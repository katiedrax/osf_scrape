Basically, ALE tries to find the strongest agreement between the experiments. This is achieved by computing the union between the generated maps while taking into account the disparities between true activation and noise. Also, to address the spatial uncertainty linked to the foci, the three-dimensional Gaussian probability distribution is applied to centers of the coordinates and images derived from the foci for all experiments obtained as modeled activation (MA).

We will also conduct exploratory analysis involving the extraction of the probability of functional changes per-voxel, and the contributions from each experiment task as well as correlation analysis between confounding parameters in each study.  The GingerALE software has an inbuilt Cluster-FWE algorithm (Eickhoff, S. B., Bzdok, D., Laird, A. R., Kurth, F., &amp; Fox, P. T., 2012).  We will analyze the differences in convergent activation and locations where significant alterations are present between groups. Firstly, for the contrast analysis, we will use the subtraction method to uncover significant clusters characterizing each experiment. Using the corrected maps of the individual ALEs voxel differences will be computed to determine significant activation within each study. Null distributions will then be generated from the ALE scores using random permutation of all experiments, then the ALE score of the equal-sized group similar to the individual computed maps will be randomly permuted for all the voxels in the represented brain as implemented in the software.

Two ALE contrast images are created by directly subtracting one input image from the other. This ALE subtraction image does not take into account differences between the studies. To correct for study sizes (Eickhoff et al., 2011), GingerALE creates simulated data by pooling the foci datasets and randomly dividing them into two now groupings of the same size as the original data sets. An ALE image is created for each new data set, then subtracted from the other and compared to the true data. After many permutations, we have a voxel\u2010wise P-value image showing where the true data\u2019s values sit on the distribution of values in that voxel. In certain cases, a very small or even negative value could be significantly high on the distribution.

Further, the analysis will be conducted using the confounding parameters such as the severity of the disorder in each study", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=ks3qg", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "ks3qg", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "ks3qg", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/tc9hu/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "tc9hu", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j8wct/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "j8wct", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/ks3qg/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ks3qg/"}}], "links": {"first": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json", "last": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "prev": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=191", "next": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=193", "meta": {"total": 5469, "per_page": 10}}}
