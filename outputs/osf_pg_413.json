What are the effects of increasing women\u2019s political participation at the grassroots? We examine this question through a randomized field experiment conducted around the December 2016 elections in Ghana. While we cannot manipulate women\u2019s participation directly, we can encourage their participation through a civic education campaign. The treatment is a durbar -- a large community meeting presided over by the traditional chief -- held in rural villages by Ghana\u2019s National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE), an independent, non-partisan government agency that regularly conducts civic education programs. The goal of the civic education treatment is to address social norms against the participation of women in political parties and encourage greater women\u2019s participation at the local level in the period leading up to the December 2016 election. We assess the effect of the durbar on (a) women\u2019s political participation; (b) political party strategies, including mobilization and outreach to women before the election; (c) women\u2019s economic welfare; and (d) social norms about the participation of women in politics and local leadership. (1) The experiment is an opportunity to understand how the resources available to political parties affect their electoral and linkage strategies in new democracies. Particularly important in new democracies are labor resources \u2013 the grassroots members and \u201cbrokers\u201d capable of mobilizing or persuading voters through networks of personal relationships. It has been difficult to assess how these resources affect party behavior, however, as parties often simultaneously differ on many dimensions, and political competition affects both the resources available to a party and the mix of strategies it selects. We address this issue by randomizing treatment over rural communities to exogenously increase the participation of women in local party branches that begin with very similar initial resource endowments.

Previous work on public opinion about foreign policy suggests that the public uses the characteristics of other countries as informational shortcuts when forming preferences about international relations and American foreign policy. For example, some studies suggest that the American public distinguishes between countries based on their regime type. However, there are real-world examples in which the U.S. cooperates with countries the public would not be expected to support (such as autocracies) based on the findings of the scholarly research on public opinion about foreign policy. This study explores the conditions under which the American public might support an alliance between the United States and an unlikely alliance partner such as those described above. Specifically, does the existence of a critical threat increase individuals\u2019 willingness to support an alliance between the United States and an unappealing or even threatening country? To answer these questions, this study uses a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design to test the influence of two country characteristics and the goal of the alliance on individuals\u2019 willingness to support the international alliance, beliefs about whether the potential alliance is in the best interest of the United States, and beliefs about the likely consequences of the potential alliance. Participants are presented with a short scenario indicating the U.S. is considering forming an alliance with another country. The scenario describes the goals of the alliance (general, or to combat ISIS) in addition to the characteristics of the country (regime type and respect for human rights). Additionally, participants are randomly presented one of two quotes by President Trump suggesting potential cooperation with Russia, asked whether they would support forming an alliance with Russia, and asked whether they believe such an alliance to be in the best interest of the United States."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Main Effects First, I aim to test the following hypotheses regarding the influence of the characteristics of a potential alliance partner on individuals\u2019 support for a potential alliance: 1. Describing the potential alliance partner as authoritarian should decrease support for the alliance, compared to describing the ally as democratic. 2. Describing the potential alliance partner as authoritarian should decrease individuals\u2019 belief that the alliance is in the best interest of the United States, compared to describing the ally as democratic. 3. Describing the potential alliance partner as often violating human rights should decrease support for the alliance, compared to describing the ally as rarely violating human rights. 4. Describing the potential alliance partner as often violating human rights should decrease individuals\u2019 belief that the alliance is in the best interest of the United States, compared to describing the ally as rarely violating human rights. Second, and most central to this study, I aim to test the following main hypotheses regarding the influence of alliance goal and threat on individuals\u2019 support for a potential alliance: 5. Describing the goal of the alliance as combatting terrorism will increase support for the alliance, compared to the \u2018general\u2019 alliance condition, which does not mention a specific threat. 6. Describing the goal of the alliance as combatting terrorism will increase beliefs that the alliance is in the best interest of the United States, compared to the \u2018general\u2019 alliance condition, which does not mention a specific threat. Conditional Effects I expect the effects of 1) the country\u2019s characteristics and 2) the goal of the alliance on individuals\u2019 support for the alliance and belief that the alliance is in the best interest of the U.S. to be conditional: 1. The effect of regime type should be conditional on the alliance goal. In particular, I expect that describing the potential alliance partner as authoritarian (rather than democratic) will decrease support for the alliance and beliefs the alliance is in the best interest of the U.S., except in the case that the goal of the alliance is to fight terrorism. 2. The effect of the country\u2019s human rights record should be conditional on the alliance goal. In particular, I expect that describing the country as often violating human rights will decrease support for the alliance and beliefs the alliance is in the best interest of the U.S., except in the case that the goal of the alliance is to fight terrorism. 3. The effect of the goal of the alliance should be conditional on whether individuals believe ISIS poses a threat. I expect that describing the goal of the alliance as to fight terrorism will only increase support for the alliance and beliefs the alliance is in the best interest of the U.S. when individuals believe ISIS poses a critical threat. In addition, I will also test whether results about a hypothetical alliance extend to a real-world example with the following hypothesis: 1. Individuals that read a quote by the president about cooperating with Russia with the goal of fighting ISIS will indicate relatively greater support for such cooperation, compared to those that receive the \u2018general\u2019 cooperation quote, which specifies Russia as a cooperation partner but does not mention ISIS. 2. Individuals that read a quote by the president about cooperating with Russia with the goal of fighting ISIS will indicate relatively stronger beliefs that such cooperation is in the best interest of the United States, compared to those that receive the \u2018general\u2019 cooperation quote, which specifies Russia as a cooperation partner but does not mention ISIS. 3. Individuals who are co-partisans with the president suggesting cooperation with Russia should indicate greater support for the proposed cooperation on average, than non-copartisans. 4. Individuals who indicate greater support for the president that suggested cooperation with Russia should indicate greater support for the proposed cooperation on average, than individuals indicating lower levels of support. 5. Individuals that perceive Russia to pose a critical threat to the United States should indicate less support for cooperation with Russia than those that perceive Russia as posing no threat or only somewhat of a threat. 6. The effect of the goal of cooperation with Russia should be conditional on whether individuals believe ISIS poses a threat. I expect that describing the goal of cooperation with Russia as fighting terrorism will only increase support for cooperation when individuals believe ISIS poses a critical threat. 7. The effect of the goal of cooperation with Russia may be conditional on whether individuals are co-partisans with the president. It might be that describing the goal as fighting terrorism increases support for cooperation when individuals are co-partisans with the president, because the newly introduced threat is more credible coming from a co-partisan source. On the other hand, it might be that the goal increases support for cooperation more among non-copartisans, because co-partisans were already more supportive of the cooperation. Mechanisms In order to identify the mechanisms underlying relationship between the goal of the alliance and individuals\u2019 support for the alliance, the following hypotheses will also be tested: 1. Describing the alliance partner as authoritarian and a frequent violator of human rights should increase individuals\u2019 perceptions of costs of the alliance. 2. Describing the goal of the alliance as fighting terrorism should increase individuals\u2019 perceptions of the benefits of the alliance. 3. Beliefs that the alliance will help the U.S. fight terrorism should mediate the relationship between the goal of the alliance and individuals\u2019 support for the alliance and beliefs the alliance is in the best interest of the United States. I expect that describing the goal of the alliance as fighting terrorism will increase support for the alliance and beliefs the alliance is in the best interest of the U.S. by increasing individuals\u2019 beliefs the alliance will help the U.S. fight terrorism. The following research questions, which explore the relationship between individual-level characteristics and support for alliances, may also be explored: 1. Is support for a hypothetical alliance influenced by individuals\u2019 foreign policy attitudes? 2. Is support for a hypothetical alliance influenced by individuals\u2019 personal values? 3. Is support for a hypothetical alliance influenced by individuals\u2019 level of political knowledge or partisan affiliations? If partisan affiliations influence support for the alliance, is it due to more concern among Republicans about terrorism?"}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "The main outcome variable is respondent support for the potential alliance.

Oregon was the first state to adopt and implement automatic voter registration prior to the 2016 election. Following Oregon, 15 additional states (plus DC) have adopted automatic voter registration, although the details of the process vary by state. For this experiment, automatic voter registration is defined by the most common approach in recent state legislation: citizens who obtain or update a driver\u2019s license or state ID are automatically registered to vote. Survey research by scholars, news media pollsters, and private groups have examined public support for passing automatic voter registration. Referenda to pass automatic voter registration in several states provides additional (and legally binding) indications of public support. However, to our knowledge, no research has explored public expectations of impacts of the policy. Since support for adopting automatic voter registration in different states has come from different types of political elites, examining how these cues shape public expectations is an opportunity to gain insights about the opinion dynamics about public policy \u2013 both for this particular election reform and public policy generally. Although many proposals to alter election administration are bogged down in partisan \u201cvoting wars\u201d, automatic voter registration has been adopted in states controlled by Democrats and Republicans. Democrats and Republicans make different arguments in favor of automatic voter registration, but the legislative track record suggests each partisan camp seems to have found something to like. One purpose of the survey experiment is testing whether framing automatic voter registration (AVR) using partisan language activates partisan processing on the part of the respondent and thus alters expectations about the policy outcomes from AVR. This part of the experiment is motivated by recent research that shows that partisan framing has a strong impact on evaluation of policies, reforms, and evaluations of political leaders. This research finds co-partisan framing tends to increase support, while framing in terms of the opposing party reduces support. However, as noted above, we are not aware of any research examining the impact of partisan framing on expectations about policy outcomes for AVR or other election reforms. We include \u201cdual\u201d partisan framing because AVR was passed in some states with support from both parties. We extend testing of elite cues beyond partisanship by including \u201celection officials\u201d as non-partisan bureaucratic experts. Election officials have made non-partisan (or at least less partisan) arguments supporting automatic voter registration due to cost-savings and reduced election administration problems. This condition reflects a (potentially) important part of the policy debate influencing expectations about policy impacts. As part of the 2018 CCES Module for Reed College, the experiment tests the impact of cuing citizens to think of automatic voter registration as supported by Democrats, Republicans, both parties, election administrators. A control condition omits any cue about political elite support. Following the randomly assigned cue, respondents are asked about their expectations of the impact of automatic voter registration on election fairness and legitimacy, election administration problems, voter turnout and voter fraud.

Oregon was the first state to adopt and implement automatic voter registration prior to the 2016 election. Following Oregon, 15 additional states (plus DC) have adopted automatic voter registration, although the details of the process vary by state. For this experiment, automatic voter registration is defined by the most common approach in recent state legislation: citizens who obtain or update a driver\u2019s license or state ID are automatically registered to vote. Survey research by scholars, news media pollsters, and private groups have examined public support for passing automatic voter registration. Referenda to pass automatic voter registration in several states provides additional (and legally binding) indications of public support. However, to our knowledge, no research has explored public expectations of impacts of the policy. Since support for adopting automatic voter registration in different states has come from different types of political elites, examining how these cues shape public expectations is an opportunity to gain insights about the opinion dynamics about public policy \u2013 both for this particular election reform and public policy generally. Although many proposals to alter election administration are bogged down in partisan \u201cvoting wars\u201d, automatic voter registration has been adopted in states controlled by Democrats and Republicans. Democrats and Republicans make different arguments in favor of automatic voter registration, but the legislative track record suggests each partisan camp seems to have found something to like. One purpose of the survey experiment is testing whether framing automatic voter registration (AVR) using partisan language activates partisan processing on the part of the respondent and thus alters expectations about the policy outcomes from AVR. This part of the experiment is motivated by recent research that shows that partisan framing has a strong impact on evaluation of policies, reforms, and evaluations of political leaders. This research finds co-partisan framing tends to increase support, while framing in terms of the opposing party reduces support. However, as noted above, we are not aware of any research examining the impact of partisan framing on expectations about policy outcomes for AVR or other election reforms. We include \u201cdual\u201d partisan framing because AVR was passed in some states with support from both parties. We extend testing of elite cues beyond partisanship by including \u201celection officials\u201d as non-partisan bureaucratic experts. Election officials have made non-partisan (or at least less partisan) arguments supporting automatic voter registration due to cost-savings and reduced election administration problems. This condition reflects a (potentially) important part of the policy debate influencing expectations about policy impacts. As part of the 2018 CCES Module for Reed College, the experiment tests the impact of cuing citizens to think of automatic voter registration as supported by Democrats, Republicans, both parties, election administrators. A control condition omits any cue about political elite support. Following the randomly assigned cue, respondents are asked about their expectations of the impact of automatic voter registration on election fairness and legitimacy, election administration problems, voter turnout and voter fraud. We expect these cues about political elite support for automatic voter registration will alter public beliefs about the impact of reforms. The pattern of effects is expected to be similar in direction to partisan debates about a range of election administration reforms, however it is unclear how strong these partisan effects will be.

place one of the biggest burdens on future electricity networks, especially at peak times such as weeknight evenings, when people return home from work. To mitigate this, governments are relying on domestic consumers to sign up to new types of smart-meter enabled electricity tariffs which will be designed to encourage them to use less electricity at peak times. For example, in the UK, the business case for smart meters relies on 20 percent of consumers switching to a time of use tariff (which charge people a higher rate for electricity consumed at peak times) by 2030. However, consumers rarely switch their energy tariff or supplier, despite the large savings involved. In Ireland, time of use tariffs will become mandatory. In the US, scholars and policymakers are advocating the use of an opt-out enrollment approach. However, consumers do not like being told what to do and these tariffs will not necessary benefit everyone. Moreover, evidence suggests that the effectiveness of opt-outs may originate from people's inattention to the default option. Whilst this may be a tolerable cost for boosting enrollment rates to pension schemes and organ donor registers (which are arguably in the majority of the public's interest), there is no point in enrolling people on tariffs without their knowledge as they are unlikely to adjust their electricity consumption patterns. Although third party automation of electrical demand (e.g home heating) could be used to avoid people from consuming at peak times, this still raises the question over how consent for such schemes would be obtained. One possibility is that suppliers will bundle these tariffs with third party control as part of the standard terms of conditions of the tariff. If people do not read terms and conditions, this presents a risk that people could sign up to automated control of their heating without their knowledge (raising ethical concerns, including over health and safety e.g. if elderly people sign up to automation without their knowledge and a supplier is able to reduce their heating demand temperatures). However, it is not known what proportion of people would fail to read the terms and conditions of such tariffs and therefore whether there is a genuine risk of this happening. An alternative approach would be for suppliers to actively prompt people to sign up to direct load control after they have switched to a time of use tariff \u2013 however, this may not result in a high enough number of sign ups to prevent people from losing money relative to a flat-rate tariff. This project will run a field experiment to test low-cost methods of recruiting owners of plug-in electric vehicles and/or heat pumps (which are expected to be the dominant form of heating in 2030) to domestic demand-side response electricity tariffs. It will also test methods of obtaining informed consent for direct load control and will analyse whether these tariffs self-select consumers who are most likely to save money on the tariff (consumers with high consuming flexible electrical appliances) or whether such tariffs may also attract consumers who could be worse off on a time of use tariff than on a flat-rate tariff - and whether some methods are more likely to increase uptake amongst those who are likely to save money than others. The tariff was designed by a British energy supplier to be commercially viable in the current climate. This study will be a randomised control trial in which two experiments will be run. Experiment 1 The first experiment will test two methods of boosting new customer registration rates \u2013 information provision and tailored information provision. Participants will be recruited through online advertisements and then randomly assigned to one of three versions of a website that was created especially for the trial in an A/B test style field experiment: \u2022 Control: existing company website, with multiple types of information but no pricing information (status quo) \u2022 Treatment group 1: price information with a price comparison \u2022 Treatment group 2: tailored price information Experiment 2 In addition, to test different methods of obtaining informed consent for additional home automation services, visitors will be randomly assigned within each of the three websites to one of two different ways of obtaining this consent: (1) third party direct load control of home heating is built into the standard terms and conditions of the tariff (bundled consent) (2) a text box informing them that the company could install a smart thermostat in their homes which the company will use to occasionally lower the temperature on their home heating during peak times help them save money on their energy bills which asks them to tick one of three boxes to indicate their preference: (i) yes they do want a smart thermostat which the energy company will remotely adjust at peak times or; (ii) they already have a smart thermostat but would like the company to remotely adjust the temperature set point at peak times or; (iii) they do not want the company to remotely adjust their heating (active choice). This imagines a future in which most people have electric heating and smart thermostats to which suppliers, with consent, could connect to automatically. We note that after participants assigned to the bundled condition switch, they are also asked to provide an active choice to whether or not they would like direct load control; this enables us to test whether they provided informed consent to DLC (as simply downloading the terms and conditions does not demonstrate that they read them and therefore were aware of the clause about direct load control). Therefore, the only difference between the active choice condition and the bundled condition is that the latter contains a clause that provides the supplier with permission to do direct load control whereas the terms and conditions in the former does not."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment 1 (H1a): get a quote rates and switching rates will be higher amongst those who are more likely to benefit from the time of use tariff (H1b): get a quote rates and switching rates will be no higher amongst those who are more likely to benefit from the time of use tariff (H2) get a quote and switching rates will be higher amongst those who self-report having an Economy 7 tariff/meter (H3): Get a quote rates will be higher in the price comparison condition than the control condition (H4): Get a quote rates will be higher in the tailored condition than the control condition (H5): Get a quote rates will be higher in the tailored condition than the price comparison condition (H6): Get a quote rates will be higher in the tailored condition than either the control or price comparison conditions amongst the population of interest (heat pump and electric vehicle owners).

Hypotheses H1a-H1b will be tested by taking the total number of people who switch to the tariff and dividing it by each of the following sub-groups: electric vehicle ownership, heat pump ownership, living in a house with over 4 bedrooms, those living in a household with electric heating, tumble dryer, washing machine, dishwasher, washer-dryer respectively. H2 will be tested by taking the total number of people who get a quote or switch and dividing this by the number of people who self-report having an Economy 7 tariff/meter. The proportions obtained will be compared to their general representation in the population. Hypotheses 3-4 will be tested using a logistic regression using the following two equations respectively: (1) (Y_i )=\u03b1+\u03b2_1 (T2)_i+ X_i+ u_i (2) (Y_i )=\u03b1+\u03b2_2 (T3)_i+ X_i+ u_i Hypothesis 5 will be tested using logistic regression using the following equation, in which the price comparison group is the omitted dummy variable and therefore the reference category: (3) (Y_i )=\u03b1+\u03b2_3 (T3)_i+ X_i+ u_i Hypothesis 6 will be tested using a logistic regression using the following equation, in which individuals assigned to the price comparison and control group combined are the reference category: (4) (Y_i )= \u03b1+ \u03b2_6 \u3016T3\u3017_i+ \u03b2_7 \u3016T3\u3017_i*\u3016\u03b4.index\u3017_i+ \u03b2_8 \u3016\u03b4.index\u3017_i+ J_i+ \u03c7_i+ \u03bc_i Hypothesis 5 will be tested using logistic regression using the following equation, in which the price comparison group is the omitted dummy variable and therefore the reference category: (Y_i )= \u03b1+ \u03b2_6 (T3)_i+ \u03b2_7 (T3)_i*(\u03b4.index)_i+ \u03b2_8 (\u03b4.index)_i+ J_i+ \u03c7_i+ \u03bc_i In all equations, Y_i is the outcome measure; it is a binary variable taking the value of one (1) if the participant gets a quote and (0) otherwise. \u03b1 is the constant. In equation 1, the treatment dummy T2 indicates whether individual i was assigned to the price comparison website, rather than the control group. In equation 2, T3 indicates whether individual i was assigned to the tailored website rather than the control group. In equation 3, T3 indicates whether the individual i was assigned to the tailored website rather than the price comparison group. In equation 4, T3 indicates whether individual i was assigned to the tailored website rather than either the control or price comparison website. Each treatment dummy can either take on the value 0, indicating that the respondent was not in that group, or the value 1, indicating that the respondent was in that treatment group. In equation 1, \u03b2_1 is the coefficient on \u3016T2\u3017_i, which measures the effect of being in the price comparison group rather than the control group and is our primary coefficient of interest for testing H3. In equation 2 \u03b2_2 is the coefficient on \u3016T3\u3017_i, which measures the effect of being in the tailored group rather than the control group and is our primary coefficient of interest for testing H4. In equation 3, \u03b2_3 is the coefficient on \u3016T3\u3017_i, which measures the effect of being in the tailored group rather than the price comparison group and is our primary coefficient of interest for testing H5. In equation 4, \u03b2_6 is the coefficient on \u3016T3\u3017_i which measures the effect of being in the tailored group rather than the price comparison or control group amongst those for whom there are observations for the diagnostic indices (i.e. those who completed the surveys), whereas \u03b2_7 is the coefficient on the interaction term \u3016T3\u3017_i*\u3016\u03b4.index\u3017_i, which measures the effect of being in the tailored group rather than in the price comparison or control group amongst individuals who have a high value on the diagnostic index (e.g. self-report as having either an electric vehicle or a heat pump) compared to any individuals with a low value on the diagnostic index (i.e. did not report as having these appliances) and is therefore the coefficient of interest for testing H6. \u3016\u03b4.index\u3017_i in equation 4 is the dummy variable which indicates whether an individual has a high value on the diagnostic index (i.e. self-reported as having a heat pump or electric vehicle) compared to those who have a low value so \u03b2_8 is the coefficient on this variable which captures the effect of self-reporting to own one of these appliances on the outcome variable. As noted above, there are four diagnostic indices and each one will be used to estimate equation 4 respectively. In equation 4, the variable J_i is the propensity score (the inverse probability of completing the survey and therefore having contributed to the diagnostic index). If the coefficient on the diagnostic index is significant then this is evidence that the tariff is self-selecting people who are more likely to benefit from the tariff, in line with classical expectations; if it is not significant, then there is no evidence for this, as consistent with a behavioural economic framework. If the coefficient on both the treatment and the interaction between treatment and the diagnostic index are significant, then diagnosis is important (i.e. tailoring works better on heat pump and EV owners) but the treatment also works regardless of diagnostic status. If the coefficient on the treatment dummy is not significant but the coefficient on the treatment by diagnostic index interaction is significant, then treatment is contingent upon proper diagnosis. If we have the reverse, then the treatment is more universally effective and diagnostics are not important. If neither is significant, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the treatment doesn\u2019t have an impact on anybody in the sample frame, diagnosed or not. Across all equations, X_i is a vector of control variables, which includes a series of individual characteristic controls including whether they are a new or returning visitor [binary 1=yes; 0=no], the referring advert (fixed effects), the device the website was viewed on [binary 1=computer; 0=mobile/tablet] and the time the website was visited (fixed effects). u_i is the error term. Multiple comparisons corrections will be applied treating experiment 1 and experiment 2 as independent sets of tests. Experiment 2 Hypothesis 1 will be tested using a logistic regression using the following equation respectively: (1) (Y_i )=\u03b1+\u03b2_1 \u3016T1\u3017_i+ X_i+ u_i In the equation above, Y_i is the outcome measure; it is a binary variable taking the value of one (1) if the participant provides consent for direct load control and (0) otherwise as per Table 2. \u03b1 is the constant. The treatment dummy T1 indicates whether individual i was assigned to the active choice condition, rather than the bundled condition. \u03b2_1 is the coefficient on \u3016T1\u3017_i, which measures the effect of being in the active choice condition rather than the bundled condition and is our primary coefficient of interest for testing H1.

To mitigate this, governments are relying on domestic consumers to sign up to new types of smart-meter enabled electricity tariffs which will be designed to encourage them to use less electricity at peak times. For example, in the UK, the business case for smart meters relies on 20 percent of consumers switching to a time of use tariff (which charge people a higher rate for electricity consumed at peak times) by 2030. However, consumers rarely switch their energy tariff or supplier, despite the large savings involved. In Ireland, time of use tariffs will become mandatory. In the US, scholars and policymakers are advocating the use of an opt-out enrollment approach. However, consumers do not like being told what to do and these tariffs will not necessary benefit everyone. Moreover, evidence suggests that the effectiveness of opt-outs may originate from people's inattention to the default option. Whilst this may be a tolerable cost for boosting enrollment rates to pension schemes and organ donor registers (which are arguably in the majority of the public's interest), there is no point in enrolling people on tariffs without their knowledge as they are unlikely to adjust their electricity consumption patterns. Although third party automation of electrical demand (e.g home heating) could be used to avoid people from consuming at peak times, this still raises the question over how consent for such schemes would be obtained. One possibility is that suppliers will bundle these tariffs with third party control as part of the standard terms of conditions of the tariff. If people do not read terms and conditions, this presents a risk that people could sign up to automated control of their heating without their knowledge (raising ethical concerns, including over health and safety e.g. if elderly people sign up to automation without their knowledge and a supplier is able to reduce their heating demand temperatures). However, it is not known what proportion of people would fail to read the terms and conditions of such tariffs and therefore whether there is a genuine risk of this happening. An alternative approach would be for suppliers to actively prompt people to sign up to direct load control after they have switched to a time of use tariff \u2013 however, this may not result in a high enough number of sign ups to prevent people from losing money relative to a flat-rate tariff. This project will run a field experiment to test low-cost methods of recruiting owners of plug-in electric vehicles and/or heat pumps (which are expected to be the dominant form of heating in 2030) to domestic demand-side response electricity tariffs. It will also test methods of obtaining informed consent for direct load control and will analyse whether these tariffs self-select consumers who are most likely to save money on the tariff (consumers with high consuming flexible electrical appliances) or whether such tariffs may also attract consumers who could be worse off on a time of use tariff than on a flat-rate tariff - and whether some methods are more likely to increase uptake amongst those who are likely to save money than others. The tariff was designed by a British energy supplier to be commercially viable in the current climate. This study will be a randomised control trial in which two experiments will be run. Experiment 1 The first experiment will test two methods of boosting new customer registration rates \u2013 information provision and tailored information provision. Participants will be recruited through online advertisements and then randomly assigned to one of three versions of a website that was created especially for the trial in an A/B test style field experiment: \u2022 Control: existing company website, with multiple types of information but no pricing information (status quo) \u2022 Treatment group 1: price information with a price comparison \u2022 Treatment group 2: tailored price information Experiment 2 In addition, to test different methods of obtaining informed consent for additional home automation services, visitors will be randomly assigned within each of the three websites to one of two different ways of obtaining this consent: (1) third party direct load control of home heating is built into the standard terms and conditions of the tariff (bundled consent) (2) a text box informing them that the company could install a smart thermostat in their homes which the company will use to occasionally lower the temperature on their home heating during peak times help them save money on their energy bills which asks them to tick one of three boxes to indicate their preference: (i) yes they do want a smart thermostat which the energy company will remotely adjust at peak times or; (ii) they already have a smart thermostat but would like the company to remotely adjust the temperature set point at peak times or; (iii) they do not want the company to remotely adjust their heating (active choice). This imagines a future in which most people have electric heating and smart thermostats to which suppliers, with consent, could connect to automatically. We note that after participants assigned to the bundled condition switch, they are also asked to provide an active choice to whether or not they would like direct load control; this enables us to test whether they provided informed consent to DLC (as simply downloading the terms and conditions does not demonstrate that they read them and therefore were aware of the clause about direct load control). Therefore, the only difference between the active choice condition and the bundled condition is that the latter contains a clause that provides the supplier with permission to do direct load control whereas the terms and conditions in the former does not.", "q16": "Experiment 1 (H1a): get a quote rates and switching rates will be higher amongst those who are more likely to benefit from the time of use tariff (H1b): get a quote rates and switching rates will be no higher amongst those who are more likely to benefit from the time of use tariff (H2) get a quote and switching rates will be higher amongst those who self-report having an Economy 7 tariff/meter (H3): Get a quote rates will be higher in the price comparison condition than the control condition (H4): Get a quote rates will be higher in the tailored condition than the control condition (H5): Get a quote rates will be higher in the tailored condition than the price comparison condition (H6): Get a quote rates will be higher in the tailored condition than either the control or price comparison conditions amongst the population of interest (heat pump and electric vehicle owners). Experiment 2 (H1) the consent rate to direct load control of home heating will be higher in the bundled condition relative to the active choice condition (H2): informed consent rates to direct load control will be substantially higher in the active choice condition relative to the bundled condition", "q17": "Experiment 1 Hypotheses H1a-H1b will be tested by taking the total number of people who get a quote and dividing this by each of the key population sub-groups that indicate a greater likelihood of benefitting from the tariff: electric vehicle ownership, heat pump ownership, living in a house with over 4 bedrooms. Hypotheses H1a-H1b will be tested by taking the total number of people who switch to the tariff and dividing it by each of the following sub-groups: electric vehicle ownership, heat pump ownership, living in a house with over 4 bedrooms, those living in a household with electric heating, tumble dryer, washing machine, dishwasher, washer-dryer respectively. H2 will be tested by taking the total number of people who get a quote or switch and dividing this by the number of people who self-report having an Economy 7 tariff/meter.

In equation 1, the treatment dummy T2 indicates whether individual i was assigned to the price comparison website, rather than the control group. In equation 2, T3 indicates whether individual i was assigned to the tailored website rather than the control group. In equation 3, T3 indicates whether the individual i was assigned to the tailored website rather than the price comparison group. In equation 4, T3 indicates whether individual i was assigned to the tailored website rather than either the control or price comparison website. Each treatment dummy can either take on the value 0, indicating that the respondent was not in that group, or the value 1, indicating that the respondent was in that treatment group. In equation 1, \u03b2_1 is the coefficient on \u3016T2\u3017_i, which measures the effect of being in the price comparison group rather than the control group and is our primary coefficient of interest for testing H3. In equation 2 \u03b2_2 is the coefficient on \u3016T3\u3017_i, which measures the effect of being in the tailored group rather than the control group and is our primary coefficient of interest for testing H4. In equation 3, \u03b2_3 is the coefficient on \u3016T3\u3017_i, which measures the effect of being in the tailored group rather than the price comparison group and is our primary coefficient of interest for testing H5. In equation 4, \u03b2_6 is the coefficient on \u3016T3\u3017_i which measures the effect of being in the tailored group rather than the price comparison or control group amongst those for whom there are observations for the diagnostic indices (i.e. those who completed the surveys), whereas \u03b2_7 is the coefficient on the interaction term \u3016T3\u3017_i*\u3016\u03b4.index\u3017_i, which measures the effect of being in the tailored group rather than in the price comparison or control group amongst individuals who have a high value on the diagnostic index (e.g. self-report as having either an electric vehicle or a heat pump) compared to any individuals with a low value on the diagnostic index (i.e. did not report as having these appliances) and is therefore the coefficient of interest for testing H6. \u3016\u03b4.index\u3017_i in equation 4 is the dummy variable which indicates whether an individual has a high value on the diagnostic index (i.e. self-reported as having a heat pump or electric vehicle) compared to those who have a low value so \u03b2_8 is the coefficient on this variable which captures the effect of self-reporting to own one of these appliances on the outcome variable. As noted above, there are four diagnostic indices and each one will be used to estimate equation 4 respectively. In equation 4, the variable J_i is the propensity score (the inverse probability of completing the survey and therefore having contributed to the diagnostic index). If the coefficient on the diagnostic index is significant then this is evidence that the tariff is self-selecting people who are more likely to benefit from the tariff, in line with classical expectations; if it is not significant, then there is no evidence for this, as consistent with a behavioural economic framework. If the coefficient on both the treatment and the interaction between treatment and the diagnostic index are significant, then diagnosis is important (i.e. tailoring works better on heat pump and EV owners) but the treatment also works regardless of diagnostic status. If the coefficient on the treatment dummy is not significant but the coefficient on the treatment by diagnostic index interaction is significant, then treatment is contingent upon proper diagnosis. If we have the reverse, then the treatment is more universally effective and diagnostics are not important. If neither is significant, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the treatment doesn\u2019t have an impact on anybody in the sample frame, diagnosed or not. Across all equations, X_i is a vector of control variables, which includes a series of individual characteristic controls including whether they are a new or returning visitor [binary 1=yes; 0=no], the referring advert (fixed effects), the device the website was viewed on [binary 1=computer; 0=mobile/tablet] and the time the website was visited (fixed effects). u_i is the error term. Multiple comparisons corrections will be applied treating experiment 1 and experiment 2 as independent sets of tests. Experiment 2 Hypothesis 1 will be tested using a logistic regression using the following equation respectively: (1) (Y_i )=\u03b1+\u03b2_1 \u3016T1\u3017_i+ X_i+ u_i In the equation above, Y_i is the outcome measure; it is a binary variable taking the value of one (1) if the participant provides consent for direct load control and (0) otherwise as per Table 2. \u03b1 is the constant. The treatment dummy T1 indicates whether individual i was assigned to the active choice condition, rather than the bundled condition. \u03b2_1 is the coefficient on \u3016T1\u3017_i, which measures the effect of being in the active choice condition rather than the bundled condition and is our primary coefficient of interest for testing H1.

We will measure the perceived likelihood that a candidate will win the election with two questions measured on a five-point scale: \u2022 If this mayor would run for office in your locality, how likely is it that he would have the votes of some people in the locality? \u2022 If this mayor would run for office in your locality, how likely is it that he would win the election? Candidate\u2019s capacity. We will measure the perceived capacity of candidate\u2019s with a battery of questions asking voters to assess the following characteristics on a five-point scale: \u2022 How good manager do you think this candidate is? \u2022 How likely is it that this candidate is capable of ensuring order and discipline in the village? \u2022 How likely is it that this candidate can solve things in town? Candidate\u2019s positive personal characteristics. We will measure the perceived positive characteristics of the candidate with a battery of questions asking voters to assess the following characteristics on a five-point scale: \u2022 How likely is it that this candidate knows how to treat people? \u2022 How likely is it that this candidate helps poor people? \u2022 How likely is it that this candidate would help people in an emergency? \u2022 How likely is it that this candidate is a good Christian? \u2022 How likely is it that this candidate is a good family man? Candidate\u2019s corruption. We will measure the perceived corruption of candidate\u2019s with a battery of questions asking voters to assess the following characteristics on a five-point scale: \u2022 How honest do you think this candidate is? \u2022 How likely is it that this candidate is against corruption? c) Heterogeneous Effects Poverty. We will measure poverty using the respondents\u2019 self-reported income on a four-point scale. The measure will be reverse-coded. As a robustness check, we will also look at subjective poverty. Eligibility for the workfare program. We will code someone as ineligible for the workfare program if they report their occupation as: \u2022 Employed \u2022 Retired d) Controls Our main specifications will include controls for gender, age, education, ethnicity, income, occupation, and partisan affiliation.", "q18": "Romania", "q19": "2000", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "IRB-AAAO8150", "q25": "3/30/16",
