The study team will reach out directly to each sample member to invite them to voluntarily complete the survey, providing a URL with which to access the online collaboration survey. \n\nSecondary Data Collection: CWCC grantees will be asked to share with the process study team copies of project-produced reports and deliverables, such as grant-mandated semi-annual progress reports and staff training manuals. We will collect these on a semi-annual basis via email or during site visits. ", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "No manipulated variables.", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Interviews, Observations, and Program Documents: The transcripts, notes, and documents from these sources will be coded for emergent patterns and themes in an exploratory fashion. Measures are not pre-specified. The major topics areas are how CWCC grantees:\n     - Interpret the grant's funding opportunity announcement (FOA) and match allowed \n       activities to local community needs; \n     - Develop and maintain partnerships;\n     - Collaboratively structure their continuum of services, service intake, and service delivery;\n     - Integrate services and align strategies to prevent child maltreatment across partners;\n     - Approach staffing and leadership roles;\n     - Recruit and assess families to identify and serve with prevention services; and\n     - Use data to guide and assess their work.\n\nCollaboration Survey: The Collaboration Survey instrument relies on a well-tested, standardized measure of seven collaboration factors, the Collaboration Assessment Tool (CAT; Marek, Brock &amp; Savla, 2015). The seven factors are: context, members, process, communication, function, resources, and leadership. In addition, the survey will measure respondents' perceptions of current success, perceptions of future success, and background characteristics. \n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "Using data from the collaboration survey, we will generate an average score for each grantee on each of seven collaboration factors: context, members, process, communication, function, resources, and leadership. The steps we will take to do this are: (1) add together all the ratings for the questions or statements related to each factor; and (2) divide by the total number of ratings for those questions (this number is equal to the number of raters multiplied by the number of questions for the factor). We will use the same approach for the perceptions of success scales. Depending on sample size within each grantee (e.g., each cell must have an N of 6 or more), we may calculate average scores across the seven collaboration factors based on respondent background characteristics such as when the respondent became involved in the grant or whether respondents are managers/leaders or front line staff. ", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "This is an exploratory study using qualitative and descriptive research methods. It does not involve hypothesis testing or statistical modeling. \n\nQualitative Analysis: The qualitative analysis will consist of coding observation forms, interview transcripts, and program documents to identify themes, patterns, key activities, and practices using NVivo software. The process study team will have a pre-analysis meeting to discuss themes and patterns in the data and use those themes and patterns as the basis to develop a code book. Each document will be coded by two individuals, and a reconciler will resolve any discrepancies in coding. \n\nWe will use the grounded theory approach to qualitative analysis, which entails a systematic approach to coding and thematic analysis to search for patterns, exemplary events, key activities, collaborative approaches, practices, goals, and processes recorded in notes from interviews and site visits. Patterns and themes are identified through a simultaneous process of deduction and induction involving the comparison of responses and grouping similar concepts together in categories (e.g., key successes and key challenges in implementation). As additional data are collected over time, initial categories will be elaborated further and augmented.\n\nWe will use content analysis to review the qualitative data collected for this evaluation to determine the presence of specific words or concepts. We will use those findings to enumerate and categorize findings from the CWCC grantees\u2019 program documents and from our interview and site visit observation notes. Our inductive methods will allow us to describe the activities and implementation of each CWCC grantee, and to make descriptive comparisons across the sites. We will also be able to identify common and unique implementation challenges and lessons learned by CWCC grantees from program documents, site visit observations, and interviews. \n\nConsensus coding will be used to yield common themes and threads related to the perceptions and experiences of staff from partner organizations/agencies involved in the implementation of the CWCC initiative. The process study team will hold analytic meetings throughout the coding process to review the data, discuss emerging themes, agree upon coding strategies, and update the codebook. \n\nThe qualitative analyses from the collaboration survey will result in summaries by individual CWCC grantee and across all 13 CWCC grantees that describe themes, patterns, key activities, and practices.\n\nDescriptive Analysis: The descriptive analysis planned includes calculation of frequencies, ranges, means, and standard deviations for quantitative data collected in the collaboration survey. The collaboration survey will be fielded annually for four years. For each survey year, responses from the full survey sample (i.e., individuals involved in grant activity execution and leadership across all 13 CWCC grantees) will be pooled and analyzed together. Analysis will be conducted using Excel or SAS. \n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href":

The first session will be for screening and preparation. If the participant meets criteria, they will be invited back to a second session, where the experiment itself will be administered. In the experiment, participants will involve creating instructional videos for pupils of different ages (5 year old pupil and a 10 year old pupil), on the subject of how to build a Lego catapult. These sessions will be no more than one week apart.\n\nScreening:\n\nScreening will consist of psychological testing, and some time spent on independently learning how to build the Lego catapult. The screening measures consist of:\n- Social and Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) lifetime version.\n- Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) Vocabulary and Block design tasks.\n- ToM Triangles Animation task.\n\nSCQ (ref 4):\nPrior to screening parents will be asked to complete the Social and Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), two 40-item, binary choice questionnaires that query sociality, communication and range of interests. One questionnaire probes for a picture of how the child is doing currently, and the other for a picture of their development (lifetime). Lifetime scores above 15 indicate likely ASD. Only the lifetime version of the questionnaire will be administered. Children with lifetime scores above 15 will be included in the ASD group, but excluded if recruiting to the TD group. \n\nQuestionnaires will be provided to parents of participating children before the first session (either sent in post or digitally via email), or if not possible they will be asked to complete the questionnaire during the screening session.\n\nWASI Vocabulary and Block Design tasks (ref 5):\nIn order to assess verbal and motor skills, and to obtain a measure of general cognition (as expressed in predicted IQ), the WASI vocabulary and block design tasks will be administered as per the formal instructions. Participants in both groups that have a predicted IQ greater than or equal to 90 will be included. Additionally, participants in both groups that have a scaled score of greater than or equal to 8 for both the vocabulary and block design tasks will be included.\n\nThe second version (WASI-II) will be used. The WASI will be the first task administered in the screening session.\n\nToM Triangles Animation task (ref 6):\nTo assess degree of theory of mind, the participant will be presented with the triangles animation task. The participant is asked to give their qualitative understanding of a series of four scenarios depicted by abstract shapes. Participants are scored based on their descriptions of the animation's content and the behaviour of the triangle. For each scenario the participant is asked \u201cwhat is happening in this animation?\u201d Responses to each scenario are graded between 0 and 2 on two dimensions: Accuracy (i.e. the description of the content of the video) and Mentalisation (i.e. the language used to describe the interpreted thoughts and feelings of the triangles).\n\nIndependent learning of the Lego catapult:\nFollowing completion of the screening tasks, the participant will learn how to build a Lego catapult. This will be done independently, so as to avoid any modelling of teaching on the part of the researcher. Participants will initially be given a simple Lego building task as a warm-up exercise, while the researcher organises and sets up for building the catapult. Once ready, the participant will be introduced to the catapult. They will be instructed by a building manual (see attached document), which details using pictures how to assemble the catapult. Additionally, the participant will be provided with a pre-built model of the catapult, which they may inspect but not amend in any way. The researcher will not be able to assist with the building of the catapult in any way, and will absent themselves from the table while the participant is learning to build the catapult. Once the participant confirms they understand the task, the researcher will leave the table and allow the participant to build the catapult independently. The participant will alert the researcher once they have finished building. If there are significant errors with the built catapult, the researcher will ask if the participant would like some more time to practice building it. Once the participant has demonstrated they understand how to build the catapult correctly, the session will end. If the participant is unable to build the catapult without significant errors, they will be not be included in the study.\n\nExperiment Plan:\n\nFor the experiment, a mixed (within and between) design will be used. Two groups of participants will be recruited, ASD and typically developing adolescents (11 to 15 year olds). Participation will involve creating instructional videos for pupils of different ages (5 year old pupil and a 10 year old pupil). Each participant will create two instructional videos, aimed at different pupils. The order in which participants will create videos for their pupils will be counterbalanced, where an equal number of participants (within each group) will create the 5 year old video first to those who create the 10 year old video first. Participants will be introduced to their targeted pupil by way of a short video vignette (administered prior to the creation of the participant's instructional video), where the pupil states their name and age. The gender of the pupil will depend on the gender of the participants (to avoid any gender-related biases affecting teaching approach).

These cover two modalities, verbal and audible.\n\u2022\tVerbal = How language is used to convey instruction.\n\u2022\tAcoustic = Properties of sound in the language used.\n\nVerbal - Transcripts of the videos will be coded to identify each instructive step conveyed by the teacher. Each of these steps will be assigned two qualities: whether they are pupil-specific or generic; and whether the instruction is process focused or product focused. \n\nSpecific vs generic was used as a contrast in Ashley and Tomasello (1998), in their comparison of 2.5, 3 and 3.5 year olds on a co-operative teaching task. In this experiment, a number of instructional qualities were considered however of key significance was the emergence of specific directive instructions in the older 3.5 year old group. \n\nProcess vs product is a construct which distinguishes imitation from emulation. One of the major theories of cumulative cultural evolution posits that humans are process focused when they teach, we pass on the steps involved in teaching rather than conveying the final outcome. ToM is argued to be key to our ability to engage in process focused teaching.\n\nI will treat both of these constructs as proportional variables, i.e. the amount of specific/generalised and process/product will be expressed as a % of the total instructions. Therefore only two variables will be necessary to capture this distinction, one variable for the proportion of specific instruction and one variable for the proportion of process instruction.\n\nExamples of how transcripts will be coded, will follow:\n\u2022\t\u201cSo now you make the handle\u201d\no\tThis example is pupil specific because it directly addresses the pupil.\no\tIt is also product focused because it only describes the end state, not the process.\n\u2022\t\u201cThe tower goes here, on the base of the catapult\u201d\no\tThis example is generic, it does not directly address the pupil.\no\tIt is also a process focused instruction, because it describes how to perform the task.\n\nDue to the nature of creating an instructional video teachers may use visual gestures to supplement their instruction giving. Coding will account for any visual aids used in the instruction giving process. Unless the teacher clearly demonstrates the process to the camera, the instruction will only be coded as product focused. For example:\n\u2022\t\u201cTo make the head of the catapult, you put it together like this [Head is shown to screen]\u201d\no\tThis would be pupil specific.\no\tThis would be process focused. Although the process is not described verbally, it is conveyed visually.\n\nAdditionally, we will capture how much instruction is given to different pupils through examination of the transcripts. Although we have not yet seen any teaching research explore this, it seems intuitively worth exploring. This will be captured in two ways:\n\u2022\tInstructional count (i.e. the number of verbal instructions given to each pupil).\n\u2022\tWords-per-minute (i.e. how many words are used from the time between the start of talking to the finish).\n\nAcoustic \u2013 IDS is characterised by a number of augmentations to speech. In this experiment I do not have the means to measure all of these, however a number of bodies of work point to some augmentations which may be possible to be isolated. \n\nOne of these is fundamental frequency (F0), the base pitch of our voice which is modulated to higher frequency bands when speaking to infants. In order to isolate and examine F0 differences across groups and pupil types, the researcher will follow the data scoring approach outlined in Braarud &amp; Stormark (2008). In this study, the researchers cleaned the audio of background noise, then isolated each word or sound uttered by their participants as a \u2018vocal unit\u2019. Each of these vocal units was then subjected to pitch extraction to give an F0 for each 3.6ms of voice production. Mean F0 will be taken across vocal units produced for each participant and each video made.\n\nAdditionally we will investigate pause and utterance durations, in line with research from Fernald &amp; Simon (1984). In this study, utterances were defined as any section of speech bounded by pauses of longer than 300ms. Pitch extraction, pause and utterance analysis will be performed in PRAAT.\n\nSummary:\nTo summarise I have SEVEN dependent variables, which I will compare across groups and pupil types. These are: proportion of specific instructions, (relative to generic instructions), proportion of process instructions (relative to product instructions), counts of numbers of instructions given, words-per-minute, fundamental frequency (F0), mean pause duration and mean utterance duration.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "A principal components analysis will be conducted on the nine dependent measures.

In the experiment, participants will involve creating instructional videos for pupils of different ages (5 year old pupil and a 10 year old pupil), on the subject of how to build a Lego catapult. These sessions will be no more than one week apart.\n\nScreening:\n\nScreening will consist of psychological testing, and some time spent on independently learning how to build the Lego catapult. The screening measures consist of:\n- Social and Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) lifetime version.\n- Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) Vocabulary and Block design tasks.\n- ToM Triangles Animation task.\n\nSCQ (ref 4):\nPrior to screening parents will be asked to complete the Social and Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), two 40-item, binary choice questionnaires that query sociality, communication and range of interests. One questionnaire probes for a picture of how the child is doing currently, and the other for a picture of their development (lifetime). Lifetime scores above 15 indicate likely ASD. Only the lifetime version of the questionnaire will be administered. Children with lifetime scores above 15 will be included in the ASD group, but excluded if recruiting to the TD group. \n\nQuestionnaires will be provided to parents of participating children before the first session (either sent in post or digitally via email), or if not possible they will be asked to complete the questionnaire during the screening session.\n\nWASI Vocabulary and Block Design tasks (ref 5):\nIn order to assess verbal and motor skills, and to obtain a measure of general cognition (as expressed in predicted IQ), the WASI vocabulary and block design tasks will be administered as per the formal instructions. Participants in both groups that have a predicted IQ greater than or equal to 90 will be included. Additionally, participants in both groups that have a scaled score of greater than or equal to 8 for both the vocabulary and block design tasks will be included.\n\nThe second version (WASI-II) will be used. The WASI will be the first task administered in the screening session.\n\nToM Triangles Animation task (ref 6):\nTo assess degree of theory of mind, the participant will be presented with the triangles animation task. The participant is asked to give their qualitative understanding of a series of four scenarios depicted by abstract shapes. Participants are scored based on their descriptions of the animation's content and the behaviour of the triangle. For each scenario the participant is asked \u201cwhat is happening in this animation?\u201d Responses to each scenario are graded between 0 and 2 on two dimensions: Accuracy (i.e. the description of the content of the video) and Mentalisation (i.e. the language used to describe the interpreted thoughts and feelings of the triangles).\n\nIndependent learning of the Lego catapult:\nFollowing completion of the screening tasks, the participant will learn how to build a Lego catapult. This will be done independently, so as to avoid any modelling of teaching on the part of the researcher. Participants will initially be given a simple Lego building task as a warm-up exercise, while the researcher organises and sets up for building the catapult. Once ready, the participant will be introduced to the catapult. They will be instructed by a building manual (see attached document), which details using pictures how to assemble the catapult. Additionally, the participant will be provided with a pre-built model of the catapult, which they may inspect but not amend in any way. The researcher will not be able to assist with the building of the catapult in any way, and will absent themselves from the table while the participant is learning to build the catapult. Once the participant confirms they understand the task, the researcher will leave the table and allow the participant to build the catapult independently. The participant will alert the researcher once they have finished building. If there are significant errors with the built catapult, the researcher will ask if the participant would like some more time to practice building it. Once the participant has demonstrated they understand how to build the catapult correctly, the session will end. If the participant is unable to build the catapult without significant errors, they will be not be included in the study.\n\nExperiment Plan:\n\nFor the experiment, a mixed (within and between) design will be used. Two groups of participants will be recruited, ASD and typically developing adolescents (11 to 15 year olds). Participation will involve creating instructional videos for pupils of different ages (5 year old pupil and a 10 year old pupil). Each participant will create two instructional videos, aimed at different pupils. The order in which participants will create videos for their pupils will be counterbalanced, where an equal number of participants (within each group) will create the 5 year old video first to those who create the 10 year old video first. Participants will be introduced to their targeted pupil by way of a short video vignette (administered prior to the creation of the participant's instructional video), where the pupil states their name and age. The gender of the pupil will depend on the gender of the participants (to avoid any gender-related biases affecting teaching approach).

To recruit children with diagnoses of ASD, special education need coordinators will be approached in various schools in the south-west of England. When recruiting via schools, the parents/carers of prospective participants will be approached by a representative of the school to seek verbal permission for the researcher to get in touch with them, or to discuss their child's participation on the parent's behalf.\n\nWhen the researcher is alerted to a prospective participant, they will discuss the suitability of the child for participation, with the appropriate adult (i.e. school representative or parent/carer). This conversation will involve checking the child's age, diagnoses, and whether they are performing at age-related targets for their verbal skills. If the child appears suitable for participation, then written consent will be sought from the parent and a date booked in for data collection to occur. As detailed in the design plan, at this point participants will undergo a more formal screening for general cognition. Any participants not meeting these criteria will be excluded from the analysis.\n\nParticipating children will be rewarded for their participation in the form of a Lego mini-figure (approximately worth \u00a31.50 each). Parents of participating children will not be materially incentivised.\n\nRecruitment will occur from the present (March 2020) until an appropriate sample size has been recruited. This is anticipated to be completed before the end of this academic year (July 2020).\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "There are two manipulated variables:\n- Participant group (ASD or TD).\n- Pupil age (5 year or 10 year).\n\nWhere all participants are either in the ASD or TD group, and all participants complete both pupil age conditions.\n\nDetails for how pupil age is manipulated can be found in the design plan.", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "A number of variables will be measured in the screening and experimental phases of the study. The screening tools and the measurements drawn from these are detailed in the design plan. Here I will list the measures that will be recorded from the screening tools.\n\n\u2022\tParticipant Age\n\u2022\tSCQ - Lifetime score.\n\u2022\tWASI - Full Scale IQ (2 item)\n\u2022\tWASI - Block Design Scaled Score\n\u2022\tWASI - Vocabulary Scaled Score\n\u2022\tToM Triangles Animation - Accuracy Total Score\n\u2022\tToM Triangles Animation - Mentalisation Total Score\n\nA new coding scheme based on available research has been devised to isolate components of teaching behaviours. These cover two modalities, verbal and audible.\n\u2022\tVerbal = How language is used to convey instruction.\n\u2022\tAcoustic = Properties of sound in the language used.\n\nVerbal - Transcripts of the videos will be coded to identify each instructive step conveyed by the teacher. Each of these steps will be assigned two qualities: whether they are pupil-specific or generic; and whether the instruction is process focused or product focused. \n\nSpecific vs generic was used as a contrast in Ashley and Tomasello (1998), in their comparison of 2.5, 3 and 3.5 year olds on a co-operative teaching task. In this experiment, a number of instructional qualities were considered however of key significance was the emergence of specific directive instructions in the older 3.5 year old group. \n\nProcess vs product is a construct which distinguishes imitation from emulation. One of the major theories of cumulative cultural evolution posits that humans are process focused when they teach, we pass on the steps involved in teaching rather than conveying the final outcome. ToM is argued to be key to our ability to engage in process focused teaching.\n\nI will treat both of these constructs as proportional variables, i.e. the amount of specific/generalised and process/product will be expressed as a % of the total instructions. Therefore only two variables will be necessary to capture this distinction, one variable for the proportion of specific instruction and one variable for the proportion of process instruction.\n\nExamples of how transcripts will be coded, will follow:\n\u2022\t\u201cSo now you make the handle\u201d\no\tThis example is pupil specific because it directly addresses the pupil.\no\tIt is also product focused because it only describes the end state, not the process.\n\u2022\t\u201cThe tower goes here, on the base of the catapult\u201d\no\tThis example is generic, it does not directly address the pupil.\no\tIt is also a process focused instruction, because it describes how to perform the task.\n\nDue to the nature of creating an instructional video teachers may use visual gestures to supplement their instruction giving. Coding will account for any visual aids used in the instruction giving process. Unless the teacher clearly demonstrates the process to the camera, the instruction will only be coded as product focused. For example:\n\u2022\t\u201cTo make the head of the catapult, you put it together like this [Head is shown to screen]\u201d\no\tThis would be pupil specific.\no\tThis would be process focused. Although the process is not described verbally, it is conveyed visually.\n\nAdditionally, we will capture how much instruction is given to different pupils through examination of the transcripts. Although we have not yet seen any teaching research explore this, it seems intuitively worth exploring. This will be captured in two ways:\n\u2022\tInstructional count (i.e. the number of verbal instructions given to each pupil).\n\u2022\tWords-per-minute (i.e. how many words are used from the time between the start of talking to the finish).\n\nAcoustic \u2013 IDS is characterised by a number of augmentations to speech. In this experiment I do not have the means to measure all of these, however a number of bodies of work point to some augmentations which may be possible to be isolated. \n\nOne of these is fundamental frequency (F0), the base pitch of our voice which is modulated to higher frequency bands when speaking to infants. In order to isolate and examine F0 differences across groups and pupil types, the researcher will follow the data scoring approach outlined in Braarud &amp; Stormark (2008). In this study, the researchers cleaned the audio of background noise, then isolated each word or sound uttered by their participants as a \u2018vocal unit\u2019. Each of these vocal units was then subjected to pitch extraction to give an F0 for each 3.6ms of voice production. Mean F0 will be taken across vocal units produced for each participant and each video made.\n\nAdditionally we will investigate pause and utterance durations, in line with research from Fernald &amp; Simon (1984). In this study, utterances were defined as any section of speech bounded by pauses of longer than 300ms. Pitch extraction, pause and utterance analysis will be performed in PRAAT.\n\nSummary:\nTo summarise I have SEVEN dependent variables, which I will compare across groups and pupil types. These are: proportion of specific instructions, (relative to generic instructions), proportion of process instructions (relative to product instructions), counts of numbers of instructions given, words-per-minute, fundamental frequency (F0), mean pause duration and mean utterance duration.\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "A principal components analysis will be conducted on the nine dependent measures. The exact method is described in the analysis plan section.", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Prior to analysis of the data, groups will be compared to ensure they meet certain assumptions for the rationale. Groups will be contrasted on measures of motor-coordination (i.e. WASI block design), verbal skills (i.e. WASI vocabulary), general cognitive ability (i.e. predicted full scale IQ as compiled by a composite of block design and vocabulary performance) and theory of mind (i.e. triangles animation task). A one way ANOVA will be run on these measures, with group being a fixed factor. The control and ASD group will be assumed to match on motor co-ordination, verbal skills and general cognitive ability, but not match on the measure of theory of mind. If the one way ANOVA supports these assumptions, then I will proceed with the full analysis of the teaching data.\n\nI will analyse the teaching data using a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM), specifying participant group and pupil type as fixed effects. Teacher identity will be fitted as a random effect to account for repeated measures. The outcome measures that are used in the model will depend on the outcome of an initial principal components analysis (PCA).\n\nTwo PCAs will be run; one for the verbal measures and one for the acoustic measures. If the PCA outcome gives components with Eigenvalues greater than 1, that are correlated, the GLMM will be run on the components to assess for significance. This means that a minimum of two GLMMs will be run, with the potential for further GLMMs if a PCA returns more than one component eigenvalue greater than 1.\n\nIf the PCA does not return components with Eigenvalues greater than 1 and correlated, then two separate GLMMs (for verbal and acoustic measures) will be run on the constituent dependent measures.\n\nAll the response variables are continuous. Standard residual checks will be administered to ensure that model assumptions are met for each analysis. If the distribution of the data is not Gaussian then a link function will be used to ensure that this is accounted for.\n\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children":

First, the Short Sadistic Impulse Scale measures the variable of the tendency to enjoy hurting others.

Second, the Varieties of Sadistic Tendencies scale will measure direct sadism and vicarious sadism on a scale of 1-7, 1 being not at all, 7 being very much. Direct sadism will be measured with six items; one item will be \"I enjoy hurting people.\" Vicarious sadism will be measured with seven items: one item will be \"In video games, I like the realistic blood spurts.\" Lastly, the 27-item Short Dark Triad scale measures narcissism, Machiavellianism, and subclinical psychopathy (on a scale of 1-5, 1 being strongly disagree, 5 being strongly agree. Narcissism will be assessed with statements similar to \"I have been compared to famous people.\" Machiavellianism will be assessed with items similar to \"It's not wise to tell your secrets.\" Lastly, subclinical psychopathy will be measured with items like \"Packback needs to be quick and nasty.\" \n\nIn Study 2, we will measure size items. First, the 27-item Short Dark Triad scale will measure narcissism, Machiavellianism, and subclinical psychopathy (on a scale of 1-5, 1 being strongly disagree, 5 being strongly agree). The 18-item Comprehensive Assessment of Sadistic Tendencies will measure sadism by assessing three distinct varieties of sadistic tendencies (on a scale of 1-5, 1 being strongly disagree, 5 being strongly agree). Direct physical sadism will be measured by five items, similar to \"I enjoy physically hurting people.\" Direct verbal sadism will be assessed by six items, similar to \"I enjoy making jokes at the expense of others.\" Vicarious sadism will be measured by assessing seven items, similar to \"I enjoy playing the villain in games and torturing other characters.\"", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Study 1:\nThe Dark Tetrad will show a significant effect of trolling activity preference through a multivariate analysis.

Total sadism, Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy will be entered as trolling enjoyment predictors.

Specifically, the previous research indicated that a brief mindfulness excercise may promote the implicit-explicit affiliation motive congruence (Strick &amp; Papies, 2017). However, the same researchers could not find similar results for the effect of the brief intervention on the congruence between implicit-explicit power motives. These findings are somewhat surprising as the main idea behind mindfulness excercises is that people who are mindful are more aware of their implicit motives and thus, could set explicit goals (explicit motives) more in line with these implicit motives. It is important to note that the motive domain (be it affiliation, achievement or power) should not make a difference in showing such results. \n\nBased on these, this study has several aims. The first aim (and thus the first study) is to demonstrate if mindfulness as a trait moderate the relationship between implicit and explicit motives (affiliation, achievement and power). That is, we aimed at testing the idea that people who are high on mindfulness as a trait are higher on implicit-explicit motive congruence than those who are low on mindfulness. \n\nFurthermore, with a second study, we want to show if people who have exercised meditation have higher motive congruence than those who have not exercised meditation.

This test combines the traditional motive tests (i.e., showing participants a set of ambigious pictures and asking participants to write stories for each participant. Then, a number of trained content-coders code the content of each specific test in accordance with their content of affiliation, achievement and power) and traditional self-report measures. It includes two parts. In the first part, participants are showed 15 ambigious pictures tapping into different every-day life events and are asked select a main character of the pictures and then write answer three open-ended questions regarding this person. In the second part of the study, participants are shown the same set of pictures again as well as a list of picture-specific statements. Participants have the opportunity to see the stories they wrote for each picture in the first part of the study and and indicate the statement that describes the stories they wrote for each specific picture the best. \n\n2. Explicit motives. Explicit motives are measured with Personality Research Form (Jackson, 1984). As the theoretical conception of the subscales affiliation, achievement and dominance fits very well to the conceptualization of explicit affiliation, achievement and power motives, motive research has long been using this scale to measure explicit motives. Thus, we also used this scale. Each subscale (affiliation, achievement and power) includes 16 items and participants are asked to respond to each item on a True/False scale. The sample item for affiliaton, achievement and power are \"I spend a lot of time visiting my friends.\", \"My goal is to do at least a little bit more than anyone else has done before.\", and \"I try to control others rather than permit them to control me.\" respectively. \n\n3. Goal-Selection Task: Job and Bandst\u00e4tter (2009) developed and used this task to measure explicit affiliation, achievement and power goals at the workplace. Individuals are presented with a scenario and are asked to imagine themselves in the scenario (that they have finsihed their studies and they have found a job in a short time after graduation. Now, they are asked to think about the goals they want to achieve in their new job.). After reading the scenario, participants are presented 15 goals (for each motive domain 5 goals) and are asked if they think they will strive for these goals in their new position.\n\n4. Mindfulness: Mindfulness is measured with Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS; Brown &amp; Ryan, 2003). The questionnaire measures mindfulness as a trait and includes 15 items measured on 6-point Likert type scale. An exmple item is \"I could be experiencing some emotion and not be conscious of it until some time later.\". \n\n5. Neuroticism: Neuroticism is measured wih the NEO-FFI (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992). Neuroticims subscale of the questionnaire includes 12 items and the respondents are asked to indicate the extent to which they agree or disagree with each item on a 5-point Likert Scale. \n\n6.

Higher levels of catastrophising are seen in those who describe themselves as worriers (Davey et al. 2007, Garnefski et al. 2006) and those with high levels of anxiety (Garnefski and Kraaij, 2018; Dickson, 2006).
