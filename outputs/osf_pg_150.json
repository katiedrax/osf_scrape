For instance, it has been estimated that by the age of 4 years, toddlers from low SES families have heard about 30 million less words than peers from higher SES families (Hart and Risley, 1995). The current longitudinal study aims to assess home activities and interactions that parents engage in with their 8 to 36-month-old infants during the nursery closure and social isolation period due to the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK, and to examine their role in early vocabulary development of monolingual and bilingual infants across varying in SES-background families.

We will also contact parents through social media (i.e. Facebook and Twitter). Parents will be asked to complete a questionnaire at the beginning of the school and nursery closure period (Time 1) and again, once social distancing rules cease and the schools and nurseries reopen (Time 2). The questionnaires at Time 1 will include a vocabulary questionnaire (the Oxford Communicative Development Inventory O-CDI; Hamilton, Plunkett, &amp; Schafer, 2000), a family background questionnaire (which will include information about siblings' gender and age, and family's SES), the Early Parenting Attitudes Questionnaire (Hembacher &amp; Frank, 2018), four questions about use of infant directed speech, and a measure of smartphone use. At Time 2, we will repeat the O-CDI, screen time measure, and ask what type of activities parents engaged in with their child (and activity frequency) during the isolation period. Parents of children who are exposed to more than one language will be asked to complete either a bilingual, trilingual or multilingual (four language) adaptation of the O-CDI. These questionnaires include additional columns for the parent to report whether the words are understood or said in any of the child\u2019s languages. These parents will also be asked to provide a phone number to complete the Language Exposure Questionnaire (LEQ; Bosch &amp; Sebasti\u00e1n-Gall\u00e9s, 1997) via phone after the Time 2 questionnaire. The O-CDI will provide us with an estimate of a child's comprehensive and productive vocabulary size in each language at Time 1 and Time 2.

For bilingual infants, we will also calculate the total comprehensive and productive vocabulary size (i.e. summing the number of words known and said in English and the additional language), conceptual vocabulary size (i.e. number of concepts known across both languages) and percentage of translation equivalents (i.e. dividing the number of words for which the infant knew the label in both languages by the total vocabulary size).   \n\nOur predictors are: the frequency of shared book reading during the social isolation period; the frequency of structured child-parent interactions; the amount of exposure to TV/cartoons. If the sample size permits, for those infants whose parents engage in shared book reading, we will include the type of reading as a factor (more verbalisations and dialogue-type of reading should result in larger gains in vocabulary). For bilingual infants, we will also consider the percentage of exposure to each language as a predictor. \n\nMaternal education (varying from 1 - Primary school to 8 - PhD) will be used as a proxy of SES and will be included as a predictor in the analyses.\n\nWe will also count the number of days between T1 and T2 (Gap_days) and will include it as a co-variate in the analyses.", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "First, we will examine the number of participants and the distribution of the SES backgrounds across the 8 possible categories (coded as a continuous variable, varying from 1 - Primary school to 8 - PhD).

Modality (receptive vs expressive) will be included as a factor for 8-18-month-old infants and Child will be included as a random variable. We also will model a possible interaction between Frequency_read and Modality (cf Karras et al, 2005).\n\nWe will also include Gap_days as a co-variate in the analyses, as we expect larger gains of more days have passed between Time 1 and Time 2.\n\nGains~Frequency_read+Frequency_interaction+Frequency_TV+Frequency_outdoor+Maternal_educ+Modality + Modality:Frequency_read+Gap_days+(1|Child), data=8_18_mo_data\n\nIf the model does not converge, then the interaction term will be removed from the model and the analyses will be performed for each modality separately.\n\nSecond, we will perform similar analyses for the expressive vocabulary (modality will be removed).

These studies address the question of whether people seek post-decision counterfactual information - how much they could have won - in a gambling task (the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, BART; Lejuez et al., 2002). In previous studies we used a within-participant design, presenting participants with 60 trials of the BART and giving them the option to view the balloon's limit after each trial. Participants frequently sought information even at some cost even though a. it made them feel bad, and b. (we argue that) it had no instrumental value. Our argument that the information had no instrumental value relied on the independent nature of the trials in the task - since the balloon's limit was randomly determined on each trial - so gaining information about the limit on the previous trial cannot benefit performance on future trials. However, it may be argued that participants believe that there is some non-random structure that can be learned through seeking information about the balloon's limit. Thus, they might have sought information for instrumental reasons, even though the information was actually not of any instrumental value. \n\nIn the current study, we aim to demonstrate that people will still incur costs to learn post-decision counterfactual information when the possibility to use that information in the future is completely removed because there is only one trial and that information still makes them feel bad. In the new version of the task, participants practice by completing 10 trials of the BART with no option to seek information. They rate their emotions on a visual analogue scale after seeing the outcome of each trial. \n\nAfter the 10 practice trials, participants receive the following instructions: \"Now that you've had a chance to practice, it's time for the real thing! There is one more round and this time each pump is worth 20p!\". They then complete one critical round of the BART. If participants 'go bust' on this final round, then they do not get a bonus payment and they are not offered the opportunity to see how far they could have gone. If they 'banked' the money, then after rating their emotions about the outcome, then they are given the following instructions: \"You won \u00a3X.XX. Would you like to see how much you could have won if you kept going? The information comes at a price - you will have to wait 30 seconds for your completion code at the end of the experiment!

In this study, we examine the differences in perception of women in the military between two countries, namely Israel and Poland. Israel is the only country in the world with compulsory military service for women (Sasson-Levy, 2011). We argue that there are certain qualities that make Israeli context unique comparing to other countries and that these qualities will lead to differences in perceptions of women between Polish and Israeli participants.

In this project, we investigate the influence of two factors -- factual misperceptions and threat perceptions -- on trade policy preferences.
