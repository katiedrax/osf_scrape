Each participant will be randomly assigned to one of four music conditions: Moving, Happy, Neutral and Sad, and will listen to a piece of music of approximately 1 min. Afterwards, the participant will be asked to answer questions concerning the experience of chills (Maruski, Thrash,  &amp; Elliot, 2012):\n\nWhile listening to this music, to which extent did you\u2026\n...feel cold or feel a chill \n\u2026feel a shiver or shudder\n\u2026have a tingling or ticklish feeling\n\u2026have goosebumps or a hair-on-end feeling\u201d\nOn a scale from 1 = not at all to 7=very strongly.\n\nParticipants will also be asked to rate to which extent they felt 13 emotions. The 13 emotions are: amusement, anger, awe, compassion, contentment, gratitude, fear, I felt moved, I felt touched, joy, pride, sadness and wonder, and will be rated on a scale from 1=not at all to 5=very strongly.\n\nThe participant will then be asked to fill 4 questionnaires: the State Adult Attachment Measure (SAAM), the Caregiving System Scale (CSS), the Experiences in Close Relationships Scale (ECR) and the Geneva Sentimentality Scale.\n\nFinally, participants will answer demographic questions and participate in an exploratory study in which they will again be randomly assigned to two conditions: social priming and no social priming. They will again hear a piece of music (the same for everybody) and answer the chills, emotions and SAAM again. The difference between the 2 conditions will be the text introducing the music: half of the participants will be told it is a recording from a musician playing at a wedding (social priming) and half will be told it was created by a compositor using only a computer (no social priming). A brief statement will afterwards explain the deception and let the participant choose to include the data or not in the study\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "We will manipulate the type of music with 4 levels: happy, sad, neutral and moving (characterization based on previous studies).

Participants will be asked to rate on a scale from 1 to 5 the intensity of 13 emotions: amusement, anger, awe, compassion, contentment, gratitude, fear, I felt moved, I felt touched, joy, pride, sadness and wonder\n\nChills: experience of the bodily sensation known as \"chills\" while listening to the music. Participants will rate on a scale from 1 to 7 to which extent they experienced a chill, shiver or shudder, a tingling or ticklish feeling and goosebumps or a hair-on-end feeling (based on the study of Maruskin, L. A., Thrash, T. M., &amp; Elliot, A. J. 2012)\n\nAttachment state:  attachment as a state is defined as the state of fluctuation of the attachment style of a person. Even though the attachment style (trait) is a relatively stable characteristic, it can have fluctuations in specific situations in which for example security is primed. Attachment state will be measured by the State Adult Attachment Measure developed by Gillath, Hart, Noftle &amp; Stockdale (2009). This scale has 3 different subscales: anxiety, avoidance and security. \n\nAttachment trait: attachment as a trait is considered a stable characteristic of an individual concerning his style of feeling and behaving in close relationships. It will be measured with the Experience in Close Relationships Questionnaire (cf. Brennan, K. A., Clark, C. L., &amp; Shaver, P. R. 1998) that has two subscales: avoidance and anxiety.\n\nCaregiving trait: the caregiving system is considered the counterpart of the attachment system. Caregiving as a trait is considered to be the (relatively stable) style of caregiving of an individual. This trait will be measured with the Caregiving System Scale developed by Shaver, Mikulincer, &amp; Shemesh-Iron, (2010) that allows the calculation of two scores: the caregiving deactivation and the caregiving hyperactivation.\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "Chills:\nThe four questions will give 4 different scores for goosebumps, tingling, coldness and shivers. If the correlations between goosebumps and tingling and between coldness and shivers is significant, they will be combined (added) to create two additional indices: Goosetingles and Coldshivers (cf. Maruskin, 2012).   \n\nEmotions:\nThe score on each emotion will be considered an indice. If correlation between being moved and being touched is significant, the two will be averaged to create the being moved/touched indice. \n\nState Adult Attachment Measure (SAAM):\nFrom the 21 items composing this scale, three indices will be calculated:\n1. The Avoidant Attachment score is computed by averaging items 2, 3, 9, 10, 15, 16, and\n21.\n2. The Attachment Anxiety score is computed by averaging items 1, 5, 8, 12, 14, 17, and 19.\n3. The Attachment Security score is computed by averaging items 4, 6, 7, 11, 13, 18, and 20.\n\nExperience in close relationships Scale (ECR):\nFrom the 36 items composing this scale, two indices will be calculated:\n1. The Avoidant Attachment score is computed by averaging the 18 odd-numbered (1, 3, 5,\netc.) items. Higher scores reflect greater avoidance.\n2. The Attachment Anxiety score is computed by averaging the 18 even-numbered items (2,\n4, 6, etc.). Higher scores reflect greater anxiety.\n(Note. Items 3, 15, 19, 22, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, and 35 must be reverse-keyed prior to computing the scores)\n\nCaregiving System Scale:\nFrom the 20 items composing this scale, two indices will be calculated:\n1. The Caregiving Deactivation score is computed by averaging the 10 odd-numbered (1, 3,\n5, etc.) items. Higher scores reflect greater deactivation of the caregiving system.\n2. The Caregiving Hyperactivation score is computed by averaging the 10 even-numbered\nitems (2, 4, 6, etc.). Higher scores reflect greater hyperactivation of the caregiving system.\n\nGeneva Sentimentality Scale:\nFrom the 10 items composing this scale, 3 indices will be calculated:\n1. Emotions labels will be calculated by averaging items 1, 2 and 3 (reverse coded).\n2. Tears of joy index will be calculated by averaging items 4, 5, 6 and 7\n3. Warm feelings in the chest will be calculated by averaging items 8, 9 and 10", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "*Impact of music on state attachment\nTo analyze the impact of each condition on the attachment state, three one-way ANOVAs will be performed, using music conditions as factors and the 3 separate scores on the three different subscales of the State Adult Attachment Measure (Anxiety, Avoidance and Security) as dependent-variables. Post-hoc Tukey tests will be used whenever ANOVA returns a significant effect of the music condition on scores to the SAAM.. \n\n*Moderators of the impact of music on state attachment\nTo determine whether attachment trait (as measured through ECR) and caregiving trait (as measured through the Caregiving System Scale) moderate the effect of music condition on attachment state, we will perform a linear mixed model with music condition (two levels: moving music vs. non-moving music) as a predictor, attachment state as a dependent variable, and scores to the two subscales of ECR and two subscales of CSS as moderators.\n\n*Do chills mediate the impact of music on state attachment?\nFinally, we will use a multiple regression analysis to investigate whether the effect of music condition (two levels: moving vs. non-moving music) on attachment state is mediated by participants\u2019 reports of chills. Questions about chills will be averaged to form two different scores (Questions 1 &amp; 2 vs. Questions 3 &amp; 4), which means we will test for two different mediators.\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecac48", "text": "Social and Behavioral Sciences"}]]}, "relationships": {"license": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a", "type": "licenses"}}, "children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=kemdh", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "kemdh", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "kemdh", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/jyxap/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "jyxap", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2bmuh/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "2bmuh", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/kemdh/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kemdh/"}}, {"id": "u8apz", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Positive Emotionality Structure Project", "description": "Please see the attached document for a full description of the proposed analyses and datasets.

It is hypothesized that communications regarding complex, rather than simple, topics are expected to receive longer, rather than shorter, response latencies.  When this expectation is met (i.e., relatively greater response latency when the topic is complex, or shorter response latency when the topic is simple), responses are expected to be perceived as evidence rather than bullshit.  On the other hand, when this expectation is not met (i.e., relatively shorter response latency when the topic is complex, or longer response latency when the topic is simple), responses are expected to be perceived as bullshit rather than evidence.  In other words, perceived topic complexity is expected to interact with perceived response latency to affect socially perceived bullshit.  Therefore, neither the topic complexity nor the response latency alone is hypothesized to produce a significant main effect on socially perceived bullshitting behavior, but rather the interactive effect of topic complexity and response latency is hypothesized to influence people\u2019s perception of others\u2019 bullshit.\n\nIn order to test the interactive effect of topic complexity and response latency on socially perceived bullshit, it is critical to the design of the current research to employ a topic of discussion that clearly varies in its topic complexity as well as its perceived response latency.

Review and Meta-Analysis\n\nAuthors: Rifat Wahab DO, Su-Ju Lee MD, Bin Zhang PhD, Margaret Mulligan MD, Mary Mahoney MD\n\nBackground Information \nFlat epithelial atypia (FEA) is a neoplastic alteration of acini, characterized by replacement of epithelium by one to several layers of columnar cells, loss of nuclear polarity and low-grade cytologic atypia. It often co-exists with atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), lobular neoplasia (LN), and low-grade in-situ and invasive ductal carcinoma.  Recent molecular studies have shown FEA may be a common precursor of the low-grade breast neoplasia pathway. On mammography, the majority of FEA cases present as grouped amorphous microcalcifications. Less often, FEA may appear as an asymmetry or a mass. On ultrasound, it often appears as an irregular mass with microlobulated margins and hypoechoic or complex echotexture. \n\nFEA is increasingly diagnosed on core needle biopsy (CNB) due to its association with microcalcifications. The management of these patients is controversial, because the reported upgrade rates to malignancy upon excision are widely varied. The primary aim of the study is to identify the pooled upgrade rates for invasive breast cancers and/or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) on surgical excision after a CNB demonstrates pure FEA. The results of this study will assist in guiding the management recommendation (surgical excision versus close imaging follow-up) for patients diagnosed with pure FEA on CNB.\n\nMaterials and Methods:\nStudy Protocol and Quality Appraisal:\nEthics committee approval is not needed as this is a systemic review and meta-analysis. We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), statement to conduct this study. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale will used to appraise the quality of the included studies by two breast radiologists. \n\nLiterature search:\nA systemic search will be performed by our Academic &amp; Research Services Librarian in conjunction with the authors by using Pubmed, and EMBASE for studies reporting the upgrade rate of patients diagnosed with pure FEA on core needle biopsy.  Suggested keywords/search strings are: flat epithelial atypia management, flat epithelial atypia upgrade, Flat epithelial atypia and biopsy. The total number of overall studies identified with this search will be document. The PRISMA Flowchart will be used to direct our search and is attached at the end of the protocol.\n\nThe first selection of studies will be based on titles and abstracts. These will be screened two authors. Articles that report an upgrade rate for FEA in the abstract or table/figure within the full text will be considered eligible for full review. Only studies in the English language will be included in the review. Studies including all types of core needle biopsies (ultrasound, MRI, Stereotactic, tomosynthesis) were included as well as no limit was set for a minimum or maximum number of patients.  If a discrepancy occurs in the selection of a study, a third reviewer will be asked to review the study.\n\nStudies will be eligible for inclusion in our meta-analysis if the following criteria are met: (a) Pure FEA was diagnosed on core needle biopsy, (b) surgical excision was performed for the biopsied Pure FEA or 2 years of negative breast imaging follow-up, and (C) and upgrade to in-situ and invasive carcinoma was reported.  We defined an \u201cupgrade\u201d as the diagnosis of in situ or invasive carcinoma upon surgical excision. We did not consider LCIS, ADH or any other high-risk breast lesions to represent an upgrade. Studies that will be excluded are: (a) Pure FEA was not evaluated, (b) Studies that did not differentiate Pure FEA from other high-risk breast lesions or (c) no surgical excision was performed or lack of documented 2-year follow-up of negative breast imaging. \n\nData Extraction:\nFor each study included in the meta-analysis the following data will be document:\n1.\tDate of publication\n2.\tStudy design (Case series, Case Control, cohort, or randomized control trail)\n3.\tTotal number of patients with Pure FEA at core needle biopsy\n4.\tTotal number of pure FEA with upgrade to Invasive carcinoma and/or DCIS\n5.\tTotal number of FEA and ADH on surgical excision.\n6.\tTechnical aspects of the core biopsy:  Gauge of needle\n7.\tTotal number of cases with complete removal of target at core needle biopsy\n8.\tAuthors recommendation for management of FEA\n\nData will be extracted by two authors. Disagreements will be resolved by a third author. Reviewers will not be blinded to that authors affiliations or journal name.\n\nPrimary Outcomes and Secondary Outcomes.\nThe primary outcome for the study is to determine the overall upgrade rate of pure FEA diagnosed at core needle biopsy to invasive carcinoma or DCIS at surgical excision/ follow-up. Secondary outcomes will include the co-occurrence of ADH with FEA on surgical excision. Also upgrades after complete removal of the target lesion will be evaluated.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nThe bivariate random-effects model with the DerSimonian and Laird method will be used to calculate the pooled upgrade rate and its 95% confidence interval (CI). The histopathologic diagnosis after surgical excision were considered as reference standards. Those case with references standards were included.\n\nHeterogeneity among studies using I2 statistic will be used. Considered high heterogeneity if great than 50% (for overall upgrade rate per study). Meta-regression analysis will be performed to assess potential moderators of heterogeneity across studies.\n\n\n\nReferences\n1.\tSimpson PT, Gale T, Reis-Filho JS et al.

It often co-exists with atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), lobular neoplasia (LN), and low-grade in-situ and invasive ductal carcinoma.  Recent molecular studies have shown FEA may be a common precursor of the low-grade breast neoplasia pathway. On mammography, the majority of FEA cases present as grouped amorphous microcalcifications. Less often, FEA may appear as an asymmetry or a mass. On ultrasound, it often appears as an irregular mass with microlobulated margins and hypoechoic or complex echotexture. \n\nFEA is increasingly diagnosed on core needle biopsy (CNB) due to its association with microcalcifications. The management of these patients is controversial, because the reported upgrade rates to malignancy upon excision are widely varied. The primary aim of the study is to identify the pooled upgrade rates for invasive breast cancers and/or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) on surgical excision after a CNB demonstrates pure FEA. The results of this study will assist in guiding the management recommendation (surgical excision versus close imaging follow-up) for patients diagnosed with pure FEA on CNB.\n\nMaterials and Methods:\nStudy Protocol and Quality Appraisal:\nEthics committee approval is not needed as this is a systemic review and meta-analysis. We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), statement to conduct this study. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale will used to appraise the quality of the included studies by two breast radiologists. \n\nLiterature search:\nA systemic search will be performed by our Academic &amp; Research Services Librarian in conjunction with the authors by using Pubmed, and EMBASE for studies reporting the upgrade rate of patients diagnosed with pure FEA on core needle biopsy.  Suggested keywords/search strings are: flat epithelial atypia management, flat epithelial atypia upgrade, Flat epithelial atypia and biopsy. The total number of overall studies identified with this search will be document. The PRISMA Flowchart will be used to direct our search and is attached at the end of the protocol.\n\nThe first selection of studies will be based on titles and abstracts. These will be screened two authors. Articles that report an upgrade rate for FEA in the abstract or table/figure within the full text will be considered eligible for full review. Only studies in the English language will be included in the review. Studies including all types of core needle biopsies (ultrasound, MRI, Stereotactic, tomosynthesis) were included as well as no limit was set for a minimum or maximum number of patients.  If a discrepancy occurs in the selection of a study, a third reviewer will be asked to review the study.\n\nStudies will be eligible for inclusion in our meta-analysis if the following criteria are met: (a) Pure FEA was diagnosed on core needle biopsy, (b) surgical excision was performed for the biopsied Pure FEA or 2 years of negative breast imaging follow-up, and (C) and upgrade to in-situ and invasive carcinoma was reported.  We defined an \u201cupgrade\u201d as the diagnosis of in situ or invasive carcinoma upon surgical excision. We did not consider LCIS, ADH or any other high-risk breast lesions to represent an upgrade. Studies that will be excluded are: (a) Pure FEA was not evaluated, (b) Studies that did not differentiate Pure FEA from other high-risk breast lesions or (c) no surgical excision was performed or lack of documented 2-year follow-up of negative breast imaging. \n\nData Extraction:\nFor each study included in the meta-analysis the following data will be document:\n1.\tDate of publication\n2.\tStudy design (Case series, Case Control, cohort, or randomized control trail)\n3.\tTotal number of patients with Pure FEA at core needle biopsy\n4.\tTotal number of pure FEA with upgrade to Invasive carcinoma and/or DCIS\n5.\tTotal number of FEA and ADH on surgical excision.\n6.\tTechnical aspects of the core biopsy:  Gauge of needle\n7.\tTotal number of cases with complete removal of target at core needle biopsy\n8.\tAuthors recommendation for management of FEA\n\nData will be extracted by two authors. Disagreements will be resolved by a third author. Reviewers will not be blinded to that authors affiliations or journal name.\n\nPrimary Outcomes and Secondary Outcomes.\nThe primary outcome for the study is to determine the overall upgrade rate of pure FEA diagnosed at core needle biopsy to invasive carcinoma or DCIS at surgical excision/ follow-up. Secondary outcomes will include the co-occurrence of ADH with FEA on surgical excision. Also upgrades after complete removal of the target lesion will be evaluated.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nThe bivariate random-effects model with the DerSimonian and Laird method will be used to calculate the pooled upgrade rate and its 95% confidence interval (CI). The histopathologic diagnosis after surgical excision were considered as reference standards. Those case with references standards were included.\n\nHeterogeneity among studies using I2 statistic will be used. Considered high heterogeneity if great than 50% (for overall upgrade rate per study). Meta-regression analysis will be performed to assess potential moderators of heterogeneity across studies.\n\n\n\nReferences\n1.\tSimpson PT, Gale T, Reis-Filho JS et al.
