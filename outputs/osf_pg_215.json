Comparison of the IPANAT and the Disguised Mood Measure."}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Anna Semenchenko, McKenzie Lockett, Sander Koole"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Only a part of emotional experience can be verbalized and communicated and partially captured by self-report measures (Scherer, 2009). Implicit measures of affect aim to capture non-verbalized conscious and unconscious representations of emotional experience as well as deal with the drawbacks of self-report measures (e.g., demand characteristics, evaluation apprehension, faking and introspective limits). The Implicit Positive and Negative Affect Test (IPANAT) (Quirin, Kaz\u00e9n, &amp; Kuhl, 2009) is a measure of implicit affect that was developed in 2000s. The IPANAT asks the participants to rate the degree to which six artificial words sound like six mood adjectives (happy, cheerful, energetic, helpless, tense, and inhibited).  The measure is based on the idea that people misattribute their own affective states to the nonsense words, and that these misattributions provide an index of implicit affect. There is a good deal of evidence of its internal consistency, test-retest reliability, criterion, construct, and cross-cultural validity (Weil, Hern\u00e1ndez, Suslow, &amp; Quirin, 2019). \nDespite the strong empirical status of the IPANAT, there are reasons to develop additional measures of implicit affect. First, it is generally the case that each specific set of procedures invokes specific sources of measurement error. For instance, percentage of body fat can be measured with skinfold calipers or measures of body circumference. The accuracy of the skinfold caliper method depends on the skill of the person taking the measurements. The accuracy of body circumference measures depends on the body shape of the person. Thus, each measure of body fat has different sources of measurement error. The same is true for psychological measures. Therefore, a more accurate measurement can be formed by having multiple measures of the same construct.  Second, the IPANAT lends itself less well to repeated measurements of implicit affect in a single session. If the measure is repeated many times in a row, people may feel suspicious about what is being measured. Moreover, people may remember their ratings of words that were similar to the ones they rated before. \nTo address these problems, we consider an implicit affect measure that was initially developed prior to the IPANAT, during the 1990s by Hass, Katz, Rizzo, Bailey, and Moore (1992). This measure was dubbed the \u2018disguised measure of mood\u2019 by the original authors. The disguised mood measure (DMM) is presented as a subliminal perception task, in which words are subliminally flashed on a computer screen and participants have to guess the affective meaning of the words. In reality, non-sense words are subliminally presented, so participants\u2019 guesses are presumed to be based on misattribution of their inner affective state to the subliminal presentations. The rationale of the DMM is thus similar to that of the IPANAT, even though the DMM has not been systematically validated to the same extent as the IPANAT.\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "The general aim of the present study is to compare the IPANAT (Quirin et al., 2009) and the modified disguised mood measure (DMM-M) based on Hass et al. (1992) as different, but conceptually and methodologically closely related measures of implicit affect. The theoretical rationale of both measures is similar in that both are based on the principle of affect misattribution or affect infusion (Forgas, 1995), which presumes that that people\u2019s inner affective states unconsciously bias the evaluation of unrelated objects in an affect-congruent manner. Accordingly, we predict that the IPANAT and the DMM-M will show substantial overlap. We expect both measures to be positively correlated at least in the medium range (r= .4 or higher). This prediction is predicated on the assumption that the measures will have similarly high reliabilities as in prior research (Cronbach\u2019s alphas = .7 or higher).\nA secondary aim of the present study is to test the validity of shorter versions of the IPANAT and the DMM-M. The newly created short versions ask the participants to rate positive and negative affect instead of six affective states. The shorter version of the DMM-M will allow to decrease participants\u2019 fatigue in the studies with multiple iterations of an implicit affect measure. We predict, firstly, that the long and the short versions of the DMM-M will be highly correlated. Secondly, we expect the full and the short versions of IPANAT to be highly correlated. And lastly, we predict that the short version of the IPANAT and the short version of the DMM-M will show substantial overlap.

The participants will complete the four measures of implicit affect. \n\nIPANAT Measures. The first measure of implicit affect, the IPANAT (Quirin et al., 2009) includes 36 items, which ask participants to rate the degree to which six artificial words (SAFME, VIKES, TUNBA, TALEP, BELNI, and SUKOV) sound like six mood adjectives (happy, cheerful, energetic, helpless, tense, and inhibited) on a four-point scale ( 1 = doesn\u2019t fit at all, 4 = fits very well). The scores of the positive implicit affect scale will be calculated as a mean of happy, cheerful and energetic moods.  The scores of the negative implicit affect scale will be calculated as a mean of helpless, tense and inhibited moods. \nThe second IPANAT measure, the short version of the IPANAT, includes 12 items, which ask participants to rate the degree to which the same six artificial words (SAFME, VIKES, TUNBA, TALEP, BELNI, and SUKOV) sound like two generalized mood adjectives (positive and negative) on a four-point scale ( 1 = doesn\u2019t fit at all, 4 = fits very well). \n\nModified Disguised Mood Measures. In the original disguised mood measure (Hass et al., 1992) a stimulus word (a non-sense word) is presented subliminally. After the subliminal presentation, one negative, one positive and two neutral words appear on the screen. The participants are asked to choose the word which best resembles the meaning of the subliminally presented word. We made two changes to the original procedure. Firstly, we replace subliminal presentation with a flicker. This will allow the measure to be used during online studies when the researcher has no control over internet connection and hardware. The theoretical basis for the procedure, i.e. affect misattribution, remains the same. Secondly, we changed the response format to parallel that of the IPANAT. As we equalized the response format, the essential difference between the IPANAT and the modified disguised mood measure is the stimulus: a non-sense word in the IPANAT and the flicker in the modified disguised mood measure.\nFor the DMM-M the following instructions will be presented on the screen \u201cPrevious studies have shown that people can \u201cfeel\u201d the meaning of words even if these words are shown so fast that they cannot see them. In the present study, we want to learn more about this fascinating phenomenon. In a few moments, you will be shown words that are presented very fast on the computer screen. It is so fast you will probably not see a word at all. All you will see is a brief flicker on the screen. We will then ask you to judge the kinds of feelings that the word evoked in you. Please be sure to go with your gut feelings when judging the words.\u201d In reality, there will be no subliminal presentation. After a string of asterisks, a blank screen will appear for 80 ms., followed by a string of asterisks.  After each flicker, the participants will rate the extent to which the word that just flashed feels like a mood on a four-point scale (1 = not at all, 4 = very well). Six flickers each followed by a question will be used to assess six moods (happy, cheerful, energetic, helpless, tense, and inhibited). The participants will complete the procedure for six non-words. The score of the positive implicit affect scale will be calculated as a mean of happy, cheerful and energetic moods.  The score of the negative implicit affect scale will be calculated as a mean of helpless, tense and inhibited moods. \nThe short version of the DMM-M, follows the same procedure as the long version except for the following. The participants will rate the extent to which the word that flashed expresses not six moods, but two generalized moods (positive, negative) on a four-point scale ( 1 = not at all, 4 = very well). \n\nExplicit affect. The participants will complete two questionnaires of explicit affect. The first measure, explicit affect (short), parallels the short version of implicit affect measures by asking the participants to rate how positive and negative they feel right now.  The second measure, explicit affect, parallels the full version of implicit affect measures by asking the participants to rate how happy, cheerful, energetic, helpless, tense, and inhibited they feel right now. Four-point scale (1 = doesn\u2019t fit at all, 4 = fits very well) will be used in both questionnaires. The score of the positive explicit affect scale in full version of the questionnaire will be calculated as a mean of happy, cheerful and energetic moods.  The score of the negative explicit affect scale will be calculated as a mean of helpless, tense and inhibited moods.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q19": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "The following analyses will be performed:\n\u2022\tBivariate correlation coefficients for the positive affect scales of the following pairs of measures: the IPANAT and the DMM-M, the IPANAT (short) and the DMM-M (short) , the IPANAT and the IPANAT (short), the DMM-M and the DMM-M (short), explicit affect and the IPANAT, explicit affect and the DMM-M, explicit affect (short) and the IPANAT (short), explicit affect and the DMM-M (short), explicit affect and explicit affect (short). \n\u2022\tBivariate correlation coefficients for negative affect scales of the same pairs of measures.\n\u2022\tRegressions with short measure as independent variable and full measure as dependent variable to determine what percentage of variance in full measure is explained by variance in a short measure (one regression for each of the following: the IPANAT positive affect scale, the IPANAT negative affect scale, the DMM-M positive affect scale, the DMM-M negative affect scale, the measure of the explicit negative affect and the measure of explicit positive affect).\n\u2022\tCronbach\u2019s alpha for positive affect scale and negative affect scale for each of the four implicit measures.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q21": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "The participants who failed at least one of the two attention checks or replied that we shouldn\u2019t use their data because they were not paying attention, will be excluded from the analysis."}, "q23": {"extra": [], "value": "Listwise deletion"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Do Implicit Measures of Affect Converge?

Undergraduate students will be recruited via URPP. Graduate students will be recruited via social media (LinkedIn; see Appendix A) and an email communication from the Psychology Graduate Office (see Appendix B). Students will be directed to a Qualtrics survey link. Prior to completing the surveys, students will complete an online informed consent script (see Appendix D). On Qualtrics, students will complete a set of four brief surveys: (1) demographics (see Appendix E); (2) Brief Scale of Sense of Community (BSCS; see Appendix F) (Peterson, Speer, &amp; McMillan, 2008); (3) Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS; see Appendix G) (Clance, 1985); and (4) Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS; see Appendix H) (Lyubomirsky &amp; Lepper, 1999). Completion of all surveys will take appoximately 15 minutes. The demographic survey (see Appendix E) includes items such as age, year of study, race, and identified gender. We also include an option for students to provide their email should they wish to participate in a follow-up focus group. Undergraduate students will be informed that providing their email is not required for participation in the survey portion of the study alone, and that they are not required to participate in the focus group in order to receive partial course credit. Please note that we will be asking students to report some personal information, such as their race, identified gender, and use of academic accomodations on the demographic survey. The purpose of these questions is to gather information on how these variables may moderate the relationship among sense of community, impostor phenomenon, and generational status; i.e., they are variables of interest. We have worked to develop appropriate and sensitive wording for these items. For both of these questions, students are also provided with an option to withhold a response. The Brief Sense of Community Scale (BSCS; see Appendix F) is an 8-item questionnaire that was developed to measure the sense of community dimensions of needs fulfillment, group membership, influence, and shared emotional connection within a specified community (Peterson, Speer, &amp; McMillan, 2008). The BSCS is validated for assessement of sense of community (Peterson et al., 2008). The Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS; see Appendix G) is a 20-item questionnaire that measures impostor phenomenon (Clance, 1985). The scale has been shown to reliably differentiate those experiencing impostor phenomemon and those who are not (Chrisman, Pieper, Clance, Holland, &amp; Glickauf-Hughes, 1995). The Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS; see Appendix H) is a 4-item measure of global subjective happiness, as measured through self-evaluation, which has been validated in 14 studies and over 2700 participants (Lyubomirsky &amp; Lepper, 1999). FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPATION: When survey data collection is complete, students who have indicated interest in focus participation will be contacted via email. We will offer them the opportunity to participate in a focus group in exchange for a chance to win a Starbucks gift card via a draw (see Appendix I for email script, Appendix J for focus group informed consent, and Appendix K for focus group questions). These participants will be contacted via email (see Appendix I) and provided with potential focus group time slots. When participants have indicated their preferred time, focus group(s) will be scheduled. We will also post advertisments in and around the Psychology department recruiting for the focus groups (see Appendix C). We anticipate holding 1-3 focus groups depending on response rate and scheduling. Focus groups will take place in the Behavioural Science Building and be moderated by Julie Conder. Dr. Conder will explain the focus group procedure, letting participants know that the session will be recorded, that their anonymity is ensured, and how data will be securely stored. If participants agree, they will sign an informed consent prior to the focus group (see Appendix J). Recordings of focus group sessions will be subsequently transcribed.

The Brief Sense of Community Scale (BSCS; see Appendix F) is an 8-item questionnaire that was developed to measure the sense of community dimensions of needs fulfillment, group membership, influence, and shared emotional connection within a specified community (Peterson, Speer, &amp; McMillan, 2008). The BSCS is validated for assessement of sense of community (Peterson et al., 2008). The Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS; see Appendix G) is a 20-item questionnaire that measures impostor phenomenon (Clance, 1985). The scale has been shown to reliably differentiate those experiencing impostor phenomemon and those who are not (Chrisman, Pieper, Clance, Holland, &amp; Glickauf-Hughes, 1995). The Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS; see Appendix H) is a 4-item measure of global subjective happiness, as measured through self-evaluation, which has been validated in 14 studies and over 2700 participants (Lyubomirsky &amp; Lepper, 1999). FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPATION: When survey data collection is complete, students who have indicated interest in focus participation will be contacted via email. We will offer them the opportunity to participate in a focus group in exchange for a chance to win a Starbucks gift card via a draw (see Appendix I for email script, Appendix J for focus group informed consent, and Appendix K for focus group questions). These participants will be contacted via email (see Appendix I) and provided with potential focus group time slots. When participants have indicated their preferred time, focus group(s) will be scheduled. We will also post advertisments in and around the Psychology department recruiting for the focus groups (see Appendix C). We anticipate holding 1-3 focus groups depending on response rate and scheduling. Focus groups will take place in the Behavioural Science Building and be moderated by Julie Conder. Dr. Conder will explain the focus group procedure, letting participants know that the session will be recorded, that their anonymity is ensured, and how data will be securely stored. If participants agree, they will sign an informed consent prior to the focus group (see Appendix J). Recordings of focus group sessions will be subsequently transcribed. Participants will only be identified on transcripts via their initials.", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "N/A - observational study.", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "We will measure a variety of variables on a demographics form.
