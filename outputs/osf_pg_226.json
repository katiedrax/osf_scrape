{"extra": [], "value": "The Self-Determination Theory posits that all humans have three basic psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017). Humans feel autonomous when they voluntarily act in accordance with their own interests and values. They feel competent when they have mastery and can effectively attain their goals. Lastly, their need for relatedness is fulfilled when they feel connected to others. Basic need satisfaction (BNS) is important, as it is associated not only with optimal development and well-being, but also with the development of greater relationships (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017). Close relationship partners who report greater basic need satisfaction correspondingly report greater well-being and a more satisfying relationship of higher quality (e.g., Deci et al., 2006; Patrick et al., 2007). In any close relationship, the BNS of one individual is thought to influence the BNS of the other individual. Findings from the student-teacher relationship literature support this effect, as teachers\u2019 BNS has been associated with students\u2019 BNS through the use of autonomy supportive teaching practices (e.g., Roth et al., 2007). However, little is known about the interplay between parent and child BNS. Some studies have found that parents\u2019 BNS is correlated with their child\u2019s BNS through their need-fulfilling parenting practices (e.g., Wuyts et al., 2018), but to our knowledge, no study has yet examined their interplay over time. Furthermore, parents\u2019 perception of their child\u2019s BNS could also play a role in the dynamic between parent and child BNS, just as teachers are influenced by their perception of their students (e.g., Skinner &amp; Belmont, 1993). Therefore, this project aims to longitudinally examine the interplay between parents\u2019 own BNS, their perception of their child\u2019s BNS, and their child\u2019s self-reported BNS. \n\nIn a first study, we have examined the interplay of parent and child BNS over two time points in a sample of 200 Japanese dyads. Results from cross-lagged models have shown that parents\u2019 self-reported T1 BNS was not significantly associated with their child\u2019s self-reported T2 BNS, with the exception of a tendency noted for the association between parents\u2019 T1 and children\u2019s T2 autonomy need satisfaction. Children\u2019s self-reported T1 BNS also did not predict their parent\u2019s self-reported T2 BNS. Parents\u2019 perception of their child\u2019s T1 BNS was found to positively predict their child\u2019s self-reported T2 BNS, while children\u2019s self-reported T1 BNS surprisingly did not significantly predict their parents\u2019 perception of their T2 BNS. Only one exception was found, as children\u2019s competence need satisfaction at T1 negatively and significantly predicted their parent\u2019s perception of their competence need satisfaction at T2.\n\nFor our second study, we now want to replicate some of our main findings in a larger sample: (1) the association between parents\u2019 T1 and children\u2019s T2 autonomy satisfaction need, and (2) the association between parents\u2019 perceptions of their child\u2019s BNS at T1 and their child\u2019s self-reported BNS at T2.

We predict that at least one of the two parenting practices will mediate the associations in the following ways: \n         a.

Adolescents reported their own need satisfaction by filling out the same scale. The scale contains four items for the satisfaction of each basic psychological need: competence (e.g., \u201cI feel confident that I can do things well\u201d), autonomy (e.g., \u201cI feel my choices express who I really am\u201d), and relatedness (e.g., \u201cI feel connected with the people who care for me, and for whom I care\u201d). The items are answered on a 5-point Likert scale, going from \u201c1 \u2013 Completely disagree\u201d to \u201c5 \u2013 Completely agree\u201d. \n\nParental Autonomy Support and Control. Children reported their perception of their parents\u2019 autonomy support and control by filling out a Japanese translation of the Perceived Parental Autonomy Support Scale (P-PASS; Mageau et al., 2015). Parents also reported their own autonomy-supportive or controlling practices with their child by filling out the same questionnaire. The P-PASS contains 12 items about autonomy support (e.g., \u201cMy parents encouraged me to be myself\u201d) and 12 items about psychological control (e.g., \u201cMy parents used guilt to control me\u201d). The items are answered on a 7-point Likert scale, going from \u201c1 \u2013 Do not agree at all\u201d to \u201c7 \u2013 Very strongly agree\u201d.\n\nFamily Socioeconomic Status. Parents reported the annual income of the family at T1 by answering one homemade question. \n\nSex. Parents and adolescents reported their own sex at T1 by answering one homemade question.\n\nAge. Parents reported their age on a homemade question at T1. Adolescents reported their date of birth at T1, from which their age was calculated.

The mediation analyses in our cross-lagged models will test the mediation effect of autonomy-supportive and controlling practices as reported by the children on the associations between parents\u2019 BNS and children\u2019s BNS, and the associations between parents\u2019 perception of their child\u2019s BNS and their child\u2019s self-reported BNS.
