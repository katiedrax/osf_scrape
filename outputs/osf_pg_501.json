Cognitive biases, such as difficulty in ignoring cues in the environment that signal the availability of alcohol, have been shown to contribute to relapse in AUD. In recent years, cognitive bias modification (CBM) protocols have been developed in order to re-train and reduce these cognitive biases towards alcohol. These protocols involve simple computer tasks where participants are repeatedly trained to turn their attention (or responding) away from alcohol and towards non-alcohol related drinks. A number of studies have demonstrated that offering CBM alongside treatment as usual (approximately 4-6 sessions over the course of two weeks) can reduce the rate of relapse one year later, relative to patients in an active control group. Although promising, the effect sizes are small and there is scope to improve the current CBM protocols. \n\nThe innovation of the current project is to modify current CBM protocols by introducing a financial incentive to perform well on the CBM tasks. This financial incentive provides an additional motivational route to control attention and inhibit responding directed towards alcohol. In this treatment context, harmful alcohol usage could potentially be reduced even further. To this end a pilot study will be conducted among alcohol-dependent outpatients to compare the preliminary efficacy of revised protocols for CBM in reducing rate of relapse, compared to an active control.  In addition, all treatment providers will be interviewed in regards to implementation issues and future strategies that could improve delivery of CBM in the clinical context.\n\nThis project involves an active network of researchers and clinical-facing experts, paving the way for future projects than can improve treatment outcomes for adults living with mental health issues (including AUD). This study protocol pertains to inpatients recruited from Jarrah House in the first instance (with the potential addition of other sites) and is closely related to an existing protocol for a parallel study with outpatients. This project is well-supported by collaborative partners (clinical and research experts both national and international) and has the potential to deliver significant health outcomes and opportunities for future development and roll-out. \n", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-01-21T01:10:10.291303", "date_modified": "2020-01-21T00:08:58.403930", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": null, "analytics_key": "91b15e0f0f8edc0c73dad62261357673dca604824bc80a98223418f49f1de0c307cc71f0aa8bf1bb467bfc029db7b65d6118c734d0afb2d8f13f16aa07ed4167ad270c3a9e41a5bbb520039bc7eb4d46336a459dffa2df73601d41462b7b70720e2acd22a3663645b85c4b6c33795ff2bde4dfa3f8acff04b84ff6d70368995f6c92e5e441cbfe85856b4a88864ab68d", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-01-21T01:10:10.269966", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Cognitive bias modification for enhancing treatment efficacy in alcohol use disorder: pilot study of an adapted protocol aimed at reducing compulsive alcohol use in treatment seekers."}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Poppy Watson"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Specific Aims\n1.\tTo determine whether abstinent patients receiving treatment for alcohol use disorder,  who receive six sessions of active CBM (attentional bias retraining or response inhibition training) show reduced rates of relapse (anything other than continuous abstinence, self-report) at 3 months follow up than those in a control condition who perform a working-memory task (active control condition).\n2.\tTo determine whether change in scores on a well-validated measure of compulsive alcohol use from baseline to 3-months post intervention differs for those in the active CBM groups versus the active control condition.\n3.

On each trial participants will see two images appear on either side of a computer screen \u2013 one soft drink and one alcohol image. After 500ms the pictures disappear and a small square (the target) will appear at one of the picture locations. Participants must respond to the location of the target (left or right) by pushing the appropriate arrow-key on a computer keyboard. The dependent variable is the time taken to identify the probe location. In the assessment version of this task, the target appears equally often at the location of the alcohol or soft drink image: an \u2018alcohol attentional bias\u2019 (AAB) is observed if participants are faster to respond when the target appears in the location of the alcohol picture (with a greater difference in response time indicating a greater bias). AAB score will be assessed in this way at baseline. In the re-training version of the task (used in the six treatment sessions), the target will always appear at the location of the soft drink image. In this way, participants are repeatedly trained to shift their attention away from the alcohol image and instead look at the soft drink. They will receive points for fast/accurate responses - later translated into a financial bonus (totalling between $30 and $50 overall \u2013 around $5-$8 per session) - providing additional motivation to attend to the soft-drink image rather than the alcohol image. \n\n\u2022\tAlcohol Response Inhibition Task: We will use a commonly-used response inhibition task (the alcohol go/no go task) during both the baseline and retraining sessions. On each trial, participants will see an image (either a soft drink or an alcohol image) appear on a computer screen. An overlaid letter will indicate whether participants should push the spacebar as quickly as possible (\u2018F\u2019, 2/3 of trials) or whether they should not push any keys (\u2018P\u2019, the stop signal: 1/3 of trials). The dependent variable is the proportion of stop trials where the participant is unable to inhibit their response. In the assessment version of the task, the ability to inhibit responses will be compared when the stop signal appears on the alcohol relative to the soft drink image (measured at baseline). In the re-training version of this task (used in the six treatment sessions), the stop signal will always appear on an alcohol image. In this way, participants are repeatedly trained to inhibit responding directed towards alcohol. They will also receive points for responding quickly (but stopping accurately), which will later be translated into a financial bonus (totalling between $30 and $50 overall). \n\n\u2022\tActive control: Working Memory Task: Participants will compete a simple working memory training task (N-back task). During this task, participants are presented with a series of alcohol and soft-drink images. In the simplest form, their task is to indicate (with a key press) if the same image is presented sequentially (1-back). Once participants have mastered 1-back (two consecutive blocks with 95% accuracy), the task is made harder by moving up a level to 2-back. Here participants must indicate whether the image on the screen is the same as that presented two images ago. This task can be made gradually harder (3-back, 4-back etc.) as accuracy improves.

General Attentional Bias Task: We will use a visual search task, commonly used in our lab, to investigate distraction by general (non-alcohol-related) reward stimuli in this clinical population (baseline session only). In this task participants are instructed to find and respond to a diamond shape (the target) among a set of circles as quickly as possible, by pressing \u2018C\u2019 (horizontal) or \u2018M\u2019 (vertical). The faster participants make a correct response, the more points (and money) they earn. One of the circles in the display (the distractor) may be coloured either blue or orange (all other shapes are grey). The colour of this distractor circle indicates whether the current trial is a high- or low-reward trial. On trials with a low-reward distractor, correct responses earn 1 point for every 10 ms that respone time (RT) is below 1000 ms (e.g., an RT of 650 ms would earn 35 points). Trials with a high-reward distractor are labelled as \u201cbonus trials\u201d, and points are multiplied by 10 (e.g., RT of 650 ms would earn 350 points). The value-modulated attentional capture (VMAC) score is the response time to correctly identify the target when the display contains a high-reward distractor relative to when it contains a low-reward distractor.\n\n2.

Exclusion criteria will be non-native speakers of English, diagnosis of Korsakoff syndrome, serious neurological problems including repeated seizures, learning difficulties, history of schizophrenia, strong withdrawal symptoms and visual or motor handicaps. Clinicians will assess inclusion/exclusion criteria and only those who meet criteria will be informed about the study. At the baseline session, we have also included questions on the aforementioned inclusion/exclusion criteria in the demographic questionnaire.\n\nProposed intervention:\n\n1.\tInformation and informed consent: Individuals seeking treatment at various inpatient and outpatient faculties in NSW with a primary diagnosis of alcohol use disorder who meet inclusion criteria for the study will be informed of the study within the first three weeks of intake by a Research Psychologist/Research Assistant who is independent of their clinical care and, if interested, will be provided with information about the study. After 24 hours, if they are interested in participating, they can make an appointment with the researcher who will answer any questions. Informed consent will be obtained. Clinicians will remain blind as to the randomisation of participants. \n\n2.\tBaseline Session: During the baseline session (1 hour long), participants will perform a general attentional bias task (15 minutes; see details below), the assessment versions of the alcohol attentional bias and alcohol response inhibition tasks (10 minutes each; see details below), as well as various self-report measures: 1. Demographic questionnaire, 2. Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), 3. Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ) 4. Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS). 5. Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI). All questionnaires are attached. The baseline session will take place in a quiet room, using a laptop. Dr Poppy Watson will conduct the baseline sessions with the assistance of a research assistant and honours student (yet to be recruited and trained by Dr Poppy Watson). The experimenter will pencil in the appointments for the next six retraining sessions although flexibility will be maintained such that clients can complete the sessions at times convenient to them. Participants will receive $20 cash at the end of the baseline session as reimbursement for their time.\n\n4.\tSix x CBM retraining sessions: Over the course of 2 weeks, participants will return to the clinic (or UNSW) to complete six sessions (max. 20 minutes each) in which they complete either the alcohol attentional bias retraining task, the alcohol response inhibition task, or the working memory task (depending on the intervention group they have been assigned to). Sessions will take place in a quiet room, using a laptop. Dr Poppy Watson will conduct the retraining sessions with the assistance of a research assistant and honours student (yet to be recruited). The research assistant and student will be trained by the lead investigator (Dr Poppy Watson). Participants will receive $10 cash at the end of each session as reimbursement for their time. Treatment as usual will continue.\n\n5.\t3-month follow up: 3 months after completion of the training sessions all patients will be contacted via email and asked to complete a short questionnaire (online) assessing their alcohol use. They will also be asked to complete the OCDS questionnaire. Those who do not respond will be contacted via telephone and asked to complete the questionnaires over the phone by a researcher who is naive as to the purpose of the questionnaires (i.e. the fact that they are outcome measures following a CBM intervention). All questionnaires are attached. Upon completion of the questionnaire, the bonus payments (performance-contingent reward earned during the course of the study for all participants regardless of the condition they are assigned to) will be released to participants in the form of Woolworths or Coles vouchers. \n\n6.\tFollow-up with clinicians: Clinic staff and clinicians who have provided treatment-as-usual alongside the CBM intervention study will be asked to indicate their views on how disruptive the study was to business as usual and suggestions for improvements in future implementation.\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "Over the course of 2 weeks, alongside treatment-as-usual, participants will complete six sessions (max. 20 minutes each) in which they complete either the alcohol attentional bias retraining task, the alcohol response inhibition task, or the working memory task (depending on the intervention group they have been assigned to). \n\n\u2022\tAlcohol Attentional Bias Task: We will use a commonly-used attentional bias task during both the baseline and retraining sessions (the dot-probe task). On each trial participants will see two images appear on either side of a computer screen \u2013 one soft drink and one alcohol image. After 500ms the pictures disappear and a small square (the target) will appear at one of the picture locations. Participants must respond to the location of the target (left or right) by pushing the appropriate arrow-key on a computer keyboard. The dependent variable is the time taken to identify the probe location. In the assessment version of this task, the target appears equally often at the location of the alcohol or soft drink image: an \u2018alcohol attentional bias\u2019 (AAB) is observed if participants are faster to respond when the target appears in the location of the alcohol picture (with a greater difference in response time indicating a greater bias). AAB score will be assessed in this way at baseline. In the re-training version of the task (used in the six treatment sessions), the target will always appear at the location of the soft drink image. In this way, participants are repeatedly trained to shift their attention away from the alcohol image and instead look at the soft drink. They will receive points for fast/accurate responses - later translated into a financial bonus (totalling between $30 and $50 overall \u2013 around $5-$8 per session) - providing additional motivation to attend to the soft-drink image rather than the alcohol image. \n\n\u2022\tAlcohol Response Inhibition Task: We will use a commonly-used response inhibition task (the alcohol go/no go task) during both the baseline and retraining sessions. On each trial, participants will see an image (either a soft drink or an alcohol image) appear on a computer screen. An overlaid letter will indicate whether participants should push the spacebar as quickly as possible (\u2018F\u2019, 2/3 of trials) or whether they should not push any keys (\u2018P\u2019, the stop signal: 1/3 of trials). The dependent variable is the proportion of stop trials where the participant is unable to inhibit their response. In the assessment version of the task, the ability to inhibit responses will be compared when the stop signal appears on the alcohol relative to the soft drink image (measured at baseline). In the re-training version of this task (used in the six treatment sessions), the stop signal will always appear on an alcohol image. In this way, participants are repeatedly trained to inhibit responding directed towards alcohol. They will also receive points for responding quickly (but stopping accurately), which will later be translated into a financial bonus (totalling between $30 and $50 overall). \n\n\u2022\tActive control: Working Memory Task: Participants will compete a simple working memory training task (N-back task). During this task, participants are presented with a series of alcohol and soft-drink images. In the simplest form, their task is to indicate (with a key press) if the same image is presented sequentially (1-back). Once participants have mastered 1-back (two consecutive blocks with 95% accuracy), the task is made harder by moving up a level to 2-back. Here participants must indicate whether the image on the screen is the same as that presented two images ago. This task can be made gradually harder (3-back, 4-back etc.) as accuracy improves. Participants will earn points for fast and accurate responses which will later be translated into a financial bonus (totalling between $30 and $50 overall). \n\n\n", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Baseline Variables:\n\n1. General Attentional Bias Task: We will use a visual search task, commonly used in our lab, to investigate distraction by general (non-alcohol-related) reward stimuli in this clinical population (baseline session only). In this task participants are instructed to find and respond to a diamond shape (the target) among a set of circles as quickly as possible, by pressing \u2018C\u2019 (horizontal) or \u2018M\u2019 (vertical). The faster participants make a correct response, the more points (and money) they earn. One of the circles in the display (the distractor) may be coloured either blue or orange (all other shapes are grey). The colour of this distractor circle indicates whether the current trial is a high- or low-reward trial. On trials with a low-reward distractor, correct responses earn 1 point for every 10 ms that respone time (RT) is below 1000 ms (e.g., an RT of 650 ms would earn 35 points). Trials with a high-reward distractor are labelled as \u201cbonus trials\u201d, and points are multiplied by 10 (e.g., RT of 650 ms would earn 350 points). The value-modulated attentional capture (VMAC) score is the response time to correctly identify the target when the display contains a high-reward distractor relative to when it contains a low-reward distractor.\n\n2. Alcohol attentional bias score (see details above; RT to identify the probe on alcohol congruent relative to alcohol incongruent trials).\n\n3. Response inhibition score (see details above; number of failed inhibitions to the stop signal on alcohol stop relative to soft-drink stop trials).\n \n4. Demographic questionnaire (see attachment).\n5. Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). The 10-item AUDIT focuses on the negative personal outcomes attributable to alcohol use. This is the most widely used screening tool to assess hazardous and risky alcohol use behaviour with good test-retest reliability and internal validity.\n6. Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ). The 20-item SADQ captures the severity of the dependence (specifically the physical and affective symptoms of withdrawal). The measure has good construct validity and high test-retest reliability.\n7. Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS). This 14-item OCDS measure obsessive thoughts about alcohol use and compulsive behaviours toward drinking. The OCDS has good internal consistency and is predictive of future drinking . \n8.

In this study, we will examine how switching between native and nonnative speakers increases cognitive processing load (or \u201clistening effort\u201d), and conversely how the load associated with nonnative speech may be reduced after having recently listened to a nonnative speaker.\n\nExamining load as a function of the speaker accent on not only the current trial (native vs. nonnative) but also the preceding trial (native vs. nonnative) is relatively novel in the speech perception literature.

Congruency sequence effects (CSEs) refer to the finding that participants have a reduced congruency effect (i.e., the difference between congruent and incongruent trial performance) following an incongruent trial compared to a congruent trial (e.g., Egner, 2007). Though it has been debated whether these effects are driven by an abstract cognitive control mechanism or lower level factors (feature repetition; contingency), there exist designs that isolate cognitive control and demonstrate that conflict on the previous trial affects how one attends to goal-relevant information on the next trial (see e.g., Braem et al., 2019) .

Specifically, we will test whether pupil response is greater when switching speakers within a given accent (both native 1 to native 2, and nonnative 1 to nonnative 2), and switching speakers across accents. In each case, we will compare against pupil response when listening to the same speaker (i.e., repeats).

"description": "Posted are the experimental materials and data for the paper \"The Affiliative Consequences of Same-Race and Cross-Race Mimicry\" (Journal of Social Psychology) with the following abstract: Few studies have replicated and extended the classic mimicry to liking effect. The present research sought to (a) replicate the affiliative consequences of mimicry; (b) test whether the affiliative consequences hold in a context where mimicry may not be normative (i.e., cross-race interactions); and (c) investigate how excluded individuals respond to same- versus cross-race mimicry and non-mimicry. Participants wrote about a control topic or social exclusion and then engaged in a brief laboratory interaction in which they were mimicked or not mimicked by a confederate who was either same-race or cross-race. Then they reported how much they liked the confederate. Within the control condition, the effect of mimicry on affiliation depended on the race of the confederate\u2014but this pattern did not emerge for excluded individuals. The study was unable to conclusively replicate and extend previous findings. The authors make recommendations to promote a more cumulative science of behavioral mimicry.
