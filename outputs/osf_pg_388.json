They find that ideal points differ under the higher-stakes, behavioral method, particularly for wealthy Democrats and Republican men, whose points shift to the right of the political spectrum, and for politically engaged Democrats, whose points shift to the left. Why? We hypothesize that wealthy Democrats and Republican men provide a socially desirable answer when stakes are low but not under the higher-stakes behavioral elicitation measure. Politically engaged individuals are hypothesized to be more prone to political action, a distinction that the behavioral measure picks up. Evidence in support of these hypotheses would suggest that the behavioral method is more likely to reveal individuals' preferences when they have something at stake in the choices, and thus their underlying ideologies when the choices matter, with mixed implications for partisan and overall polarization. We test our hypotheses by conducting an online experiment with Democrats and Republicans shortly after the November 6, 2018 elections. We prime subjects' wealth, gender, and civic identities and measure their preferences under both Likert and donation methods. We also make four important improvements to the donation method. First, subjects decide how much to donate to each interest group independently, which addresses previous concerns about the selection of interest group pairings.

I predict that these many outcomes are linked to the treatment through a smaller set of mechanisms, each of which I discuss below. The intervention is an asset transfer combined with the option to relocate to the new apartments. Subsidized prices for the asset lead to an increase in a household\u2019s permanent income; while households do not immediately realize the income effect of the subsidy as they cannot sell their apartments for until 10 years after possession, I assume that they smooth their lifetime consumption across time periods with this subsidy in mind (Friedman 1957). I will measure changes in consumption of items with long-term payout ratios such as education, the education of women in particular, and medical expenditure. As income is also correlated with psychological well-being, I will also measure changes in indicators such as stress, life satisfaction and an individual\u2019s locus of control. Additionally, I will investigate the claim made by DiTella et al (2007) that property ownership leads to an increased belief in ``market values.\"I refer to this mechanism as the permanent income mechanism. I will assess the impact of property ownership on savings, psychological well-being, belief in market values, and expenditure on education through this mechanism. Moreover, as assets are collateral for loans, a household's ability to borrow formally may increase . Voting citizens can be thought of as principals who elect politicians, their agents, to represent their policy preferences. Yet poor voters may place a higher utility on immediate receipt of cash or in-kind services than affecting the policy making process. One way to reduce the incidence of vote-buying is to reduce the voter\u2019s utility from participating in vote buying. Larreguy et al (2015) find that a land titling program in Mexico weakens patterns of vote buying by reducing voters\u2019 reliance on politicians for tenure security. Frey (2015) also claims that Brazil's Bolsa Familia conditional cash transfer program reduces the marginal utility of cash payments to voters, thereby reducing support for clientelistic parties. Similarly, property ownership may decrease the marginal utility from cash or in-kind payments by making an asset available as collateral for loans, thereby generating another source of cash for voters . I refer to this mechanism as the collateral mechanism. I will assess the impact of property ownership on access to formal loans and turning to local leaders and informal loans when faced with shocks this mechanism. Asset ownership should also affect the extent to which an individual feels invested in his or her immediate political context. First, as concerns about property value should increase the marginal utility from participating in the policy-making process, I will estimate treatment effects on voting with the aim of having one\u2019s policy preferences represented (as opposed to identity based or clientelistic voting), and participation in civic associations and town hall meetings. Also, as it would seem that ownership of a fixed asset would decrease a household\u2019s propensity to move from the area, I will measure changes in a household\u2019s predicted likelihood of migrating from the city. I refer to this mechanism as the property values mechanism. Moreover, in India and other countries with a large informal sector, property ownership entails the incidence of a property tax, the first and only direct tax most citizens pay. The prevalence of informal labor means that income tax is rarely collected; in fact, in India, only 1% of the country's population paid income tax in 2013. During qualitative interviews, most low-income individuals were unaware that they paid sales or value-added taxes and claimed that they paid only property tax to the local municipal government. As a vast literature on state-formation suggests individuals demand services from the state in exchange for tax payment, I predict that property ownership will also lead individuals to demand higher quality service provision from the local government in sectors such as road quality, maintenance of law and order, and public waste management. I refer to this as the property tax mechanism.

However, few quantitative studies tried to address this question so far. This study focuses on the interplay between the economic fears and support for Russia\u2019s military action abroad. To address possible causal inference problems with my argument I will run an experimental survey in Russia to measure differences in opinion between control respondents and treatment respondents who received various economic fear stimuli. This analysis will evaluate whether economic fear is pervasive enough to shift support or salience of Russia\u2019s military action abroad.", "q17": "I will work with the Center for Independent Social Research (CISR), a reputable survey firm based in Russia with long experience of launching internet surveys in Russia.

If we think about sectarianism in the Arab World from a social psychological perspective, it can be defined as ingroup bias based on one\u2019s affiliation to a particular confessional (religious) group. Sectarianism therefore involves a process of identifying with a confessional group, or categorization of oneself and others along sectarian lines. For this reason, we are particularly interested in testing the effectiveness of self-categorization approaches to prejudice reduction. In particular, we test whether primes emphasizing a common religious identity or primes emphasizing a common national identity are more effective in reducing support for sectarian messages and the spread of hate speech. We are also interested in testing the degree to which messages that are endorsed by trusted religious or political elites are more effective than those that do not. We will test the effectiveness of these anti-bias primes in two ways. First, we use a nationally representative field experiment in Lebanon, in which subjects are randomly assigned to receive one of 4 primes (national identity, religious identity, national identity elite, religious identity elite) or are assigned to a control group and do not receive a prime. After receiving a prime (or no prime), subjects will be asked to rate several tweets containing sectarian and counter-sectarian rhetoric according to how favorably they feel towards each message and its author and how likely they would be to share the message with others. These ratings will be our primary outcome variables of interest. In addition to our survey experiment, we will conduct a Twitter experiment in order to get a better sense of the effectiveness of these anti-bias messages in reducing the use of sectarian hate speech over time in a more organic setting. Following Munger (2016), we will assign subjects to a treatment arm, where they will receive a counter-sectarian (anti-bias) message from a Twitter bot account that we control, in response to one of their recent tweets containing a sectarian slur. These messages will be adapted from the four primes in the survey experiment (national identity, religious identity, national identity elite, religious identity elite). We will also include a control group of Twitter users that receive no message from our bots as well as a group that receives a placebo counter-sectarian message that does not emphasize a superordinate identity or elite support. The primary outcome variable of interest in the Twitter experiment will be the frequency with which subjects tweet sectarian content post-treatment, relative to the pre-treatment period."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Self-categorization theory (Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, and Wetherell 1987) posits that we cognitively construe the self through a process of comparison with other group members in order to establish a sense of identification with a group. It is therefore possible for us to simultaneously hold multiple identities (Turner et al. 1987), and these identities vary with regard to their degree of inclusiveness (Brewer 2003). Self-categorization is dynamic, as several identity levels can be activated at the same time, and one can move up and down levels of identification, depending on the salience of certain category cues and contextual effects (Crisp and Hewstone 2007; Dovidio and Gaertner 2010, Oakes 2001). Identification is not set in stone, and this fluidity is why many have advocated approaching prejudice reduction from a self-categorization perspective. A wide variety of studies have shown that identity re-categorization, or the process of shifting from a lower-level identity (e.g. sect) to a higher order superordinate identity (e.g. national identity) consistently results in more positive attitudes and feelings towards members of an outgroup. As those who were previously seen as outgroup members are re-categorized as fellow in-group members in the higher order category, attitudes improve (Gaertner and Dovidio 2000). However, it is unclear how effective this approach would be in the Lebanese (or Arab) context where sectarian identities transcend national boundaries and continue to play a role in several protracted violent regional conflicts. Motivated by findings in the self-categorization literature, we hypothesize: H1a: Priming national identity will lead to lower favorability ratings of sectarian messages and the individuals who write them, and will make respondents less likely to want to share these messages with their friends, relative to receiving no prime. Given the salience of religious identity in shaping sectarian identity, we expect that priming a superordinate religious belief---a common belief in God---will be more effective than priming a common national identity. H1b: Priming a common belief in God will lead to lower favorability ratings of sectarian messages and the individuals who write them, and will make respondents less likely to want to share these messages with their friends, relative to those who receive a common national identity prime and relative to those who receive no prime. The analog of this hypothesis for the Twitter experiment is as follows: H1a: Receiving a response to a sectarian message that primes national identity will make individuals less likely to tweet sectarian messages in the future, relative to those who receive no prime. H1b: Receiving a response to a sectarian message that primes a common belief in God will make individuals less likely to tweet sectarian messages in the future, relative to those who receive a common national identity prime and relative to those who receive no prime. Following the literature on top-down approaches to prejudice reduction, we also expect that our counter-sectarian messages will be more effective if they come from trusted political elites or religious leaders. Laboratory experimental evidence suggests that top-down approaches may be particularly effective in the Lebanese context (Kobeissi and Harb 2012). We therefore hypothesize that messages from political elites and religious actors will be more effective at reducing sectarian biases than messages from peers. More specifically, we hypothesize: H2a: Exposure to a national identity prime that highlights support from political elites will lead to lower favorability ratings of sectarian messages and the individuals who write them, and will make respondents less likely to want to share these messages with their friends, relative to receiving a non-elite national identity prime. H2b: Exposure to a common belief in God prime that highlights support from religious leaders will lead to lower favorability ratings of sectarian messages and the individuals who write them, and will make respondents less likely to want to share these messages with their friends, relative to receiving a non-elite religious identity prime. The analog of this hypothesis for the Twitter experiment is as follows: H2a: Receiving a response to a sectarian message that primes national identity and highlights support from political elites will make individuals less likely to tweet sectarian messages in the future, relative to those who receive a national identity prime without elite support.
