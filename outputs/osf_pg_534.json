Once schools have expressed an interest in participating in the study, information about the study and consent forms will be distributed to parents of selected children. Written consent from parents is collected at the schools. After the end of the study, the schools will continue to have access to the apps used in the intervention. \n\nRecruitment will start in November 2019 and will be discontinued when 120 participants have been assigned to one of the groups, or in December 2020. Data collection starts in spring 2020 and ends in summer 2021.", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "We will manipulate the type of literacy training that participant will receive. The four levels of this variable are: teaching-as-usual (TaU), phonemic reading strategy, comprehension-based reading strategy, or combined phonemic/comprehension-based reading strategy.", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "(1) Phonological awareness: MiniDUVAN (Wolff, 2013) We will use five subtests from MiniDUVAN (Wolff, 2013) to assess phonological awareness skills: A1 Morpheme identification, A2 Rhyme identification, A3 Phoneme identification, B4 Phoneme synthesis, C1 Morpheme manipulation. The dependent measure is total number of correct answers across all subtests (max = 45). \n\n(2) Word reading: OS64 (Nielsen et al., 1997) and OLAF (Magnusson &amp; Naucler, 2010) Adapted versions of OS64 (Nielsen et al., 1997) and OLAF (Magnusson &amp; Naucler, 2010) will be used to assess word reading skills. In OS64 the participant match a written word to a widgit symbol, and in OLAF written words are matched to pictures. The dependent measure is total number of correct answers (max = 15 for OS64, and max = 20 for OLAF). \n\n(3) Sentence reading: DLS Bas (J\u00e4rpsten, 2004) In DLS Bas (J\u00e4rpsten, 2004) the participant read short sentences and match these to their corresponding pictures. The dependent measure is total number of correct answers (max = 20).", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "For word reading, we will transform raw scores for each test (OS64 and OLAF) on a comparable scale (e.g. standardized scores), and average the scaled scores to create a word reading index. No other indices will be created.", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Distribution of data will be checked. With normally distributed data, three two-way mixed ANOVA with one between-subject factor, Group (TaU, ALL, Animega-is, Combined), and one within-subject factor, Time (T1-T4), will be performed: one for Phonological awareness, one for Word reading, and one for Sentence reading. We expect a main effect of time and an interaction between Group and Time, driven by different trajectories between groups during the intervention (T1 to T3). At T3, we expect ALL, Animega-is and Combined to perform at a higher level than TaU, which will be tested by planned contrasts: ALL-TaU, Animega-is-TaU, and Combined-TaU. We further expect stronger performance at T3 in the Combined group compared to ALL and to Animega-is, which will be tested by planned contrast: Combined-ALL and Combined-Animega-is. \n\nIf the assumption of normality is violated (indicated by statistical test and/or detection of outlier/s), robust ANOVA using trimmed means and bootstrapping will be applied (see Field &amp; Wilcox, 2017).", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=x76wv", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "x76wv", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "x76wv", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/3h9z2/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "3h9z2", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/d9unf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "d9unf", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/x76wv/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x76wv/"}}], "links": {"first": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json", "last": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "prev": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=533", "next": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=535", "meta": {"total": 5469, "per_page": 10}}}
