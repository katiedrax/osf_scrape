Due to great numbers of questionnaires in the study, we will use the brief version of this scale (Knobloch and Theiss, 2011).\n\nIdeological orientation: Participants will identify their ideological orientation by three questions. They will rate their political view from \u201c0\u201d (\u201cvery leftist\u201d) and \u201c100\u201d (\u201cvery rightist\u201d) and their ideological orientation from \u201c0\u201d (\u201cvery liberal\u201d) and \u201c100\u201d (\u201cvery conservative\u201d) by sliding a bar on the scale.

Accelerometer, gyroscope, and rotation data will be collected once per second.\n\nA set of event-based multiple-choice questions detailing what they believe motivated their actions when they began using their phone, switched between apps on their phone, and stopped using their phone will be used. Every time the participant is asked one of these questions, they will be asked to measure how automatic or deliberate their phone use was on a 7-point Likert scale (1 being 'very automatic', 7 being 'very deliberate'). This question will be asked in thirty-second intervals after the beginning of any application that is being used. All of these questions have been attached.\n\nAfter, participants will partake in a qualitative interview on smartphone use and well-being.", "q17.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e500fbe8d8765007a81537d", "file_name": "Discrete Item Measures.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/ybthg/files/osfstorage/5e500fbe8d8765007a81537d", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e500fbe8d8765007a81537d"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "68074708dd5d944e92bbaf80c29ac1f4036afcb2a3e87ce885416dc3ac7a7263"}}], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "The analysis will be exploratory.
