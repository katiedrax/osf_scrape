We will also employ ordered probit regression with blocking covariates as controls to assess the treatment effects on the ordinal variable measuring the quality of the feedback. We may additionally add control variables for number of programs, number of volunteers, other measures of the average distance to projects, and the substantive issue areas of the subjects listed in their registration in the list presented to the NGOs. We will report results without covariates when reporting any of these regression results. In addition to calculating the standard intent to treat (ITT) effects that measure the net impact of the treatments across the subject pool, we will also obtain the complier average causal effects (CACE) using information from our email server about whether the treatment was actually reached each organization. We using Qualtrics Mailer, we are able to see the group-level open rates for each treatment condition within each block. After performing a test that compliance does not vary systematically across the groups, we will adjust the estimates of ITT effects by the rate of compliance when calculating our hypothesis tests. We have no reason to expect compliance to vary across the experimental groups, since all subjects will receive an email with the same subject line and compliance is measured when the email is opened and the invitation and its associated incentive is received.\"", "q18": "", "q19": "", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "", "q25": "", "q26": "Other (describe in text box

(ix) Also for robustness, an additional analysis will be conducted using OLS with presence of the edit at 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 7 days and 3 months from edit as outcomes. (x) We will also conduct subgroup analyses based on weekday vs. weekend, time range of edit, and which RA coded the question. These are not related to primary research questions, but may provide a measure of robustness in case there are unforeseen abnormalities (e.g., near 100% immediate removal associated with a given subgroup).\"", "q18": "", "q19": "", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "", "q25": "", "q26": "Researchers", "q27": "", "q28": "N/A", "q29": "", "q30": "", "q31": "", "q32": "",

crude oil or precious minerals, many have argued that a series of negative economic and political consequences follow (Collier 2007; Humphreys et al. 2007; Mehlum et al. 2006; Ross 2001, 1999). This phenomenon, referred to as the \u201cresource curse,\u201d seems to especially undermine good governance, and good governance is often essential to economic development. Because governments engaged in natural resource exploitation receive large amounts of revenue from sources unattached to the democratic process, mechanisms for accountability weaken and investment in human capital decreases (Bulte et al. 2005; Dunning 2005). Such governments often become more autocratic and more prone to corruption and clientelism as government officials seek political and personal gain (Robinson et al. 2006; Collier and Hoeffler 2005). Critics charge that both natural resource rents and foreign aid are \u201cwindfall revenues\u201d or \u201csovereign rents\u201d that can enable corruption and undermine governance. Indeed, some studies suggest foreign aid dependence acts much like the resource curse in demotivating citizens and enabling bad governance (Smith 2008; Djankov et al. 2008; Br\u00e4utigam and Knack 2004). Moreover, because aid allocations from donors fluctuate, governments receiving large amounts of aid can experience economic and political instability, and when aid is suddenly reduced the likelihood of conflict increases (Nielsen et al. 2011). Corruption and clientelism are also associated with foreign aid, as government officials have been known to use foreign funds for political and personal gain (Knack 2001; Svensson 2000). These and other problems with the receipt of foreign aid appear to parallel the problems of over-reliance on resource exploitation. Other studies have questioned the inevitability of the resource curse and claimed that the effects of resources on governance are contingent on other factors (Haber and Menaldo 2011; Jensen and Wantchekon 2004; Dunning 2005). Others have argued that aid has less damaging effects than natural resource revenues because foreign donors can and often do condition aid on government performance and require greater accountability in spending (Jensen and Wantchekon 2004; Collier, 2006; Dunning 2008; Bermeo 2013). However, a distinction in the resource curse literature regarding the \u201cappropriability\u201d of rents from different natural resources suggests that the adverse effects of aid on governance may be more severe (Boschini, Pettersson and Roine, 2007; Isham et al., 2005). Specifically, aid revenues are relatively \u201cappropriable,\u201d as most aid goes directly from donors to central governments. Yet, the majority of existing research on the resource curse utilizes cross-national, observational data, limiting the ability to make causal claims or address micro-level mechanisms. Moreover, despite the fact that much of the resource-curse literature relies on micro-foundational arguments about individual-level responses to new revenues, the micro-foundations of the resource curse have been undertheorized. It is not clear, for example, why less taxation would diminish voters\u2019 political will to hold politicians accountable and thus why windfall revenues, originating from either aid or natural resources, would yield higher rates of rent-seeking than tax-based revenues (see Paler 2013). Further investigation of the resource curse with observational data is unlikely to resolve outstanding micro-foundational questions. This is partly because correctly estimating the effects of windfall revenues is difficult: in countries that have already received oil revenues, citizen\u2019s expectations and willingness to sanction will be endogenous to changes in spending patterns or legislative behavior that have occurred as a result of those revenues.

Assessing changes in citizen action relative to this baseline will enable more credible and precise causal estimates of the windfall revenues\u2019 effects on voters\u2019 evaluations of government performance and their willingness to sanction elected officials. Unsurprisingly, there are relatively few cases where these conditions are satisfied and where large-scale field experimentation is possible. Fortunately, with high levels of foreign assistance and the recent and highly-publicized discovery of sizeable oil fields (see e.g. Anderson and Browne 2011), Uganda is an ideal location for this study. We thus propose to identify the micro-level effects of different sources of new government revenues on citizens\u2019 and elites\u2019 willingness to take costly action to promote better governance. The study will employ a survey experiment with behavioral outcomes in Uganda on a nationally representative sample of Ugandan citizens as well a convenience sample of Members of Parliament. Respondents will be randomized into one of four treatment conditions testing the between-subjects effects on behavior of three potential sources of revenue: oil, taxes, aid projects implemented by government and aid projects implemented by non-governmental organizations (NGOs). In each condition, respondents will hear a short vignette about government or NGO spending. The vignette will include information on the amount and source of additional revenue that will be available to the Ugandan government or NGOs in the near future. Existing literature suggests three broad mechanisms through which windfall revenues affect government behavior: the spending effect, the accountability effect, and the repression effect. For each of these effects, we have multiple outcome measures that will serve as dependent variables in our analysis. For both elite and general public respondents, we will estimate the relative average treatment effect by comparing one treatment group with another. This will yield six comparisons: aid/government with oil, aid/government with taxes, aid/NGOs with oil, aid/NGOs with taxes, aid/government with aid/NGOs, and taxes with oil. Both citizens and MPs will be asked a battery of questions, including, most importantly, their preferences over how the resources should be spent; their beliefs about how the resources are likely to be spent; how accountable and transparent they believe spending from the new revenue source will be; whether it will affect political stability and competition; and their prior knowledge of spending patterns. Citizens will then be invited to sign a petition to their member of parliament calling for a new government agency in charge of tracking how the money will be spent. Enumerators will also request that citizens send a text message to be relayed to their member of parliament calling for the agency. Finally, enumerators will invite citizens to donate part or all of their compensation for participating in the study to an NGO promoting transparency and good governance (Action Aid, Transparency International, or a different NGO of their choosing). MP subjects will be invited to sign a statement calling for a sovereign wealth fund. The inclusion of both the general public and elite respondents will provide unique insights into potential differences in how the two sets of actors view different revenue sources. This study will be supplemented after three years by a second round that will replicate the experiment with many of the same respondents, taking identical measurements along a range of political and economic indicators. It will provide, for the first time, an ability to estimate, at the micro-level, the effect of oil spending along several dimensions, including on income, access to local public goods, government performance, political competition, and political accountability. Such data is especially valuable given the often poor quality of government spending data and the potential for such figures to be inaccurate or misleading. Broadly speaking, existing research thus suggests three broad classes of effects that are applicable at the micro-level, with each having empirical implications that can be tested with this study. Each class of effects applies to both aid and oil, with the relevant comparison group being the tax treatment. First, if resource revenues allow elected officials to avoid financing social spending with broad-based taxation, citizens may have fewer vested interests in holding elected officials accountable for performance and spending patterns. This should manifest itself in two ways: in the first round of data collection, those who expect to benefit from oil revenues should feel less inclined to take costly action to monitor or sanction government behavior compared to citizens in regions without oil. In the panel data, we should similarly observe that those who have benefited objectively (measured as realized per-capita oil revenue) are less inclined to take action. These expectations are consistent with recent work by Martin (2013), which suggests that taxation may also work to induce accountability by activating a fairness norm among voters. Where voters are taxed more, Martin demonstrates, they also make more demands on elected leaders. The second prediction flows from the so-called repression effect. A one-party state with regular elections, Uganda is widely regarded as an anocracy, one in which the ruling party, the National Resistance Movement (NRM), uses its financial and coercive advantage to intimidate opponents and purchase electoral support through large-scale electoral clientelism (see e.g. Conroy-Krutz and Logan 2012). Ross (2001) suggests that resource rents in such states may be used to repress opponents, with the state investing in new repression technologies or simply deploying existing technologies more frequently. While we cannot test this directly in the first round of data collection, we can test whether citizens believe that resources will be used in this way. In the second round of data collection, we will be able to identify this effect more directly by comparing citizen exposure to intimidation (particularly near elections) in locales with high per capita oil revenues to those in low-spending constituencies. The final effect is that driven by the additional spending that is made possible by windfall revenues. The expectation is that, as governments receive windfall revenues, they are able to finance broad-based social welfare improvements, either through local public goods provision or conditional cash transfers. Simply put, the repression effect occurs when additional revenues are used by the incumbent to wield a stick to intimidate citizens and opposition groups; the spending effect is the carrot. This spending, when in line with citizen preferences, has the effect of increasing support for incumbent politicians and/or the ruling coalition. This effect will not be observable in the first wave, since there is no realized spending. However, we will be able to precisely estimate this effect (if it exists) after the conclusion of the second round. The spending effect is thought to purchase the population\u2019s acquiescence to authoritarian governance, and is thus one of the most important mechanisms in explaining the relationship between windfall revenues and changes in indexes of democracy such as Polity or Freedom House scores. The ability to observe this effect directly is a key strength of the project and, to the best of our knowledge, would be the first direct test of the spending effect at the micro-level. A broad outline of the effects we expect to see are presented in Table 1 below. We have listed the treatment conditions in order of where citizens should express the greatest concerns on the dimensions of accountability, repression, and spending. A survey experiment with behavioral outcomes provides advantages in assessing these hypotheses for several reasons. First, and most importantly, micro-level behavior is a function of self-interest and prior beliefs, and uncovering the effects noted above requires accurate estimates of both. Second, a traditional survey, where respondent are asked about their beliefs and expectations for multiple types of new revenue\u2014e.g. aid/gov\u2019t, aid/NGOs, taxes, and oil\u2014is likely to induce priming effects and contamination. By randomizing each of the respondents into one of four experimental conditions, we eliminate the possibility that answers to questions about a given revenue source are influenced by preceding questions about different sources. \u2003 Table 1: Expectations of Citizen Responses Across Several Outcomes Effect Type Hierarchy Among Revenue Sources Accountability Oil > Aid/Gov\u2019t > Tax > Aid/NGOs Repression Oil > Aid/Gov\u2019t > Tax > Aid/NGOs Spending Oil > Aid/Gov\u2019t > Tax > Aid/NGOs\""}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "\"For this experiment, we will draw a nationally representative sample of Ugandan citizens (n = 2,500) and a convenience sample of members of parliament and former candidates for parliament (n = 300). We will oversample in districts that are the sites of oil exploration and in districts with high and low concentrations of foreign aid based on AidData\u2019s georeferenced dataset of foreign aid. In interviews with a representative sample of Ugandan citizens and with a convenience sample of MPs, we will present a randomly assigned statement about the source of significant public funds and then ask subjects a series of questions about what they think the effects of the funds will be and where they think these funds should be spent. Both the citizen and MP surveys first ask questions covering a wide array of standard demographic characteristics. These include ethnicity, age, gender, education, employment, income, quality of life, access to public services, government effectiveness, media consumption, political knowledge, political interest, political activity, political trust, party affiliation, perceptions of corruption, and perceptions of clientelism. Some of the questions in the MP survey are dropped or modified appropriately in consideration of the different baseline levels of knowledge, political background, and sensitivity. For the MP survey, a battery of questions is added inquiring after MPs\u2019 control of government funds and aid money. After the battery of demographic questions, we will randomly assign subjects to receive a statement about billions of dollars in revenue from oil receipts, aid flows through government, aid flows through NGOs, or domestic taxes. Randomization of treatment assignment allows us to uncover systematic differences in subject responses across conditions. We will test the effects of the information conditions both on subjects\u2019 attitudes and on their willingness to take action imposing personal costs by signing a statement calling for an independent resource tracking agency; sending an SMS message to their MP; and donation of survey remuneration to watchdog NGOs. Outcomes for MPs will include signing a statement supporting the creation of a sovereign wealth fund. EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS Both citizen and MP subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions in which they are provided with information framing a set of survey questions that deepen and reinforce the experimental conditions. The conditions are as follows: Oil Condition: \u201cAs part of this survey, we are also providing important information to Ugandans about finances in Uganda. In next few years, government agencies of Uganda will receive at least five trillion shillings. This money will come from the sale of the oil that was recently discovered in Uganda. This money will become part of the Ugandan government budget. Lawmakers and the President are supposed to use the money to improve the lives of Ugandans.\u201d Tax Condition: \u201cAs part of this survey, we are also providing important information to Ugandans about finances in Uganda. In next few years, government agencies of Uganda will receive at least five trillion shillings. This money will come from taxes on wages and purchases that will be paid by all Ugandans. This money will become part of the Ugandan government budget. Lawmakers and the President are supposed to use the money to improve the lives of Ugandans.\u201d Aid through Government Condition: \u201cAs part of this survey, we are also providing important information to Ugandans about finances in Uganda. In next few years, government agencies of Uganda will receive at least five trillion shillings. This money will come from aid given by foreign governments. This money will become part of the Ugandan government budget. Lawmakers and the President are supposed to use the money to improve the lives of Ugandans.\u201d Aid through NGOs Condition: \u201cAs part of this survey, we are also providing important information to Ugandans about finances in Uganda. In next few years, non-governmental organizations of Uganda will receive at least five trillion shillings. This money will come from foreign governments and go DIRECTLY to non-governmental organizations, not to the central government. Non-governmental organizations are supposed to use the money to improve the lives of Ugandans.\u201d SURVEY AND KEY OUTCOMES OF INTEREST Following the experimental condition text, subjects will be asked a series of questions about how government money should be spent, how it is likely to be spent, and what the effects of the money on Uganda are likely to be. The questions will simultaneously serve to reinforce the treatment and to assess the effects of treatments on responses. The reactions to the survey questions, as well as actions taken in the behavioral outcomes of interest, will be compared across experimental conditions. Consistent with our discussion above, the key outcomes of interest are organized into three groups that correspond to the three causal mechanisms thought to produce the resource curse: the spending effect, the repression effect, and the accountability effect. Citizen Behavioral Outcomes The experiment also incorporates behavioral responses in which subjects can substantiate their stated preferences by undertaking actions that impose personal costs. After the survey, subjects will have the opportunity to voice their support for or opposition to a petition calling for an independent agency to track the revenues. Subjects will also be invited to send an SMS text message reinforcing their position to their MP. Finally, they will be invited to donate the money paid them for taking part in the survey to watchdog groups promoting government accountability. MPs will be invited to sign a statement of support for a sovereign wealth fund. 1. Some people have said that they would like to create a special government agency in charge of tracking how the five trillion shillings in [oil/tax/aid] money is spent by [government agencies/non-governmental organizations]. How important do you think it is to track how this money is spent? A. Not at all important B. Not very important C. Somewhat important D. Very important E. Don't know F. Refuse 2. In other countries, there are government agencies that are used to track how development money is spent. Currently, the Ugandan government does not have an agency like this. An agency to do this could be created, but it would require all Ugandans to pay special taxes in order to create it. Would you be willing to pay a small tax so that this agency could be created? A. Yes B. No C. Don't know D. Refuse 3. How much would you be willing to pay per month in new taxes for this agency to be created? Enumerator enters amount stated 4. Would you be willing to send an anonymous petition to your Member of Parliament telling him that you would like for this agency to be created? An anonymous petition is one that does not have your name on it. A. Yes B. No C. Don't know D. Refuse Would you be willing to send a petition using your real name to your Member of Parliament telling him that you would like for this agency to be created? A. Yes B. No C. Don't know D. Refuse 5. ENUMERATOR: Present the petition to the respondent. Mark below whether the respondent signs the petition. If the respondent has suggested that he would only be willing to sign anonymously, ask him or her to put an \"\"X\"\" instead of a signature. If the respondent said he would be willing to use his name, ask him to sign the petition directly. A. Signed B. Did not sign 6. Would you be willing to send an SMS saying that you would like for this agency to be created? Your message will be presented along with other messages to your Member of Parliament. Standard SMS rates apply. A. Yes B. No C. Don't know D. Refuse ENUMERATOR: Please take the slip of paper used for the SMS code and write the following number: [piped based on experimental conditions] 7. There are several organizations in Uganda that work to make it easier for ordinary Ugandans to see how development funds are spent. At the beginning of the survey, we gave you 500 shillings to compensate you for the time it has taken to answer our questions. Now, we would like to know if you would like to donate to one of those organizations. You may choose to donate to Action Aid Uganda, Transparency International Uganda, or a third organization of your choosing. If you would like to donate, please give me the amount of money you would like to donate and which organization you would like to donate to. If you do donate, your money will be used to help reduce corruption and improve the lives of ordinary Ugandans. 7A. ENUMERATOR: How much money did the respondent give you? ENUMERATOR: If they do not donate any money, type \"\"0\"\" as the answer. 7B. ENUMERATOR: Which organization did the respondent choose to donate the money to? A. Transparency International Uganda B. Action Aid Uganda C. Other Organization Citizen Survey Outcomes The following is a battery of questions that will be asked after the vignette, and represents the key outcome measures that will be used to assess whether respondents view hold different expectations for different revenue streams. They organized by the causal mechanism they are designed to test. Because spending and repression effects are ultimately a decision by elites about how to allocate resources, it is possible to observe both, one, or neither. We therefore consider these effects together. Some questions measure whether people think one is more likely than the other, while others ask them about the likelihood of each occurring independently of the other. Questions: We would now like to ask you some questions about what you think will happen when government [agencies/non-governmental organizations] receive five trillion shillings from [oil/taxes/aid]. 1. How likely is it that this money will make the government less willing to tolerate opposition and differences of opinion? A. Very unlikely B. Unlikely C. Somewhat unlikely D. Somewhat likely E. Likely F. Very likely G. Don't know H. Refuse 2. List Experiment Question: Now I would like you to think about what may happen to the new revenue available to [government agencies/non-governmental organizations], which is coming from [oil/taxes/aid]. I am going to read you a list of things that may or may not happen with this new revenue. After I am done, I would like you to tell me HOW MANY of these things will probably happen. Do not tell me which ones you experienced, only HOW MANY. ENUMERATOR: Read the following list of things to the respondent. Read them SLOWLY. Once you are done, ask the respondent if he or she would like you to read them again. If they answer yes, do so. Sometimes there will be four items, at other times only three. Read ONLY the items on the list. Mark the number they tell you in the box below. A. Most of the [oil/tax/aid] money will be used to bring development to Uganda. B. The [oil/tax/aid] money will bring conflict to Uganda. C. Some Ugandans will benefit from the [oil/tax/aid] money, but others will not. D. [List experiment item, randomly assigned] Politicians will use the [oil/tax/aid] money to do favors for people and try to win their votes. 3. How do you think the money should be distributed?

I understand that the creation of such a fund would entail the creation of an independent body that would manage and invest the revenues that are collected. I also understand that, every year, the fund would be required to publicly report its income and investments in order to promote transparency. I support the creation of such a fund and hope that it will bring greater development and prosperity to Uganda.\u201d MP Survey Outcomes 1.

Don\u2019t know DATA ANALYSIS We will perform data analysis on the outcomes of interest clustered according to the three categories of repression, accountability, and spending. We will begin the analysis using simple difference-in-means tests. We will supplement the difference-in-means results with robustness checks using logit and ordered probit regression analysis using standard demographic covariates as controls. These techniques will be used to assess the main between-subjects treatment effects of the four experimental conditions. Given that we suspect that treatment effects may vary across demographic categories and geographic locations, we will also perform subgroup analysis for the following categories: 1. Perceptions of high vs. low corruption 2. Oil districts vs. non-oil districts 3. Districts with high vs. low aid receipts 4. Political party affiliation 5. Ethnic affiliation (in President\u2019s tribe or not) Given potential issues with multiple comparisons, we will examine effects of the treatments on families of outcomes, conditional on learning that the variables that we project will make up each family indeed load on the same dimension (when using factor analysis). We will construct inverse covariance-weighted indices as suggested by Anderson (2008) and test for treatment effects on the different families of outcomes. The families include subject political action, perceived consequences, projected visibility of the resource spending, and the expected beneficiaries of the funding. The families conjoin the following items from the survey instrument: Action: Importance of tracking the funding, willingness to pay taxes to create an independent tracking agency, amount willing to pay per month in taxes to support the agency, willingness to sign a petition anonymously in favor of the agency, willingness to sign the petition by name, actually signing the petition, willingness to send an SMS message in support of the agency, and actually sending the SMS. Consequences: Subject projections of funding used for repression, perceptions that the money will become a prize to be won, perceptions that it will help opposition parties, perceptions that money will be used for politicians in elections. Beneficiaries: Perceptions that the money will help make ordinary people\u2019s lives better, help the subjects\u2019 families, help the subjects\u2019 communities, help the economy, help the NRM, and help the central government. Contact: Subjects\u2019 self-reported likelihood that they will contact a village elder, a sub-county official, or their member of parliament; Subjects self-reported propensity to march in a demonstration or change which party they vote for. These families of outcomes will be analyzed using inverse-covariance weighted indices (Anderson 2008), which optimally aggregate information from several variables that load on a single common factor. In addition, we will also apply a Bonferroni correction in order to control the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER). We will also present the results of the indices\u2019 constituent variables to demonstrate which individual measures are contributing most to the significance (or non-significance) of a given family. We have chosen the particular families outlined above because they represent key dimensions along which existing work in the resource-curse literature suggest we should see treatment effects. For example, our working assumption is that for those families that measure a willingness to take political action or contact elected officials, we should see the tax condition yield higher values.\""}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q30": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q38": {"extra": {}, "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "The Resource Curse, Oil Rents and Aid Dependence in Uganda: A Field Experiment", "q2": "Daniel Nielson | Brandon de la Cuesta | Stephen Knack | Helen Milner", "q3": "20140701AB", "q4": "07/01/2014 - 10:32", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to researcher access to outcome data", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "6/16/14", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "", "q15": "\"When leaders of developing countries choose to structure their economies around the extraction of export-based natural resources, such as crude oil or precious minerals, many have argued that a series of negative economic and political consequences follow (Collier 2007; Humphreys et al. 2007; Mehlum et al. 2006; Ross 2001, 1999). This phenomenon, referred to as the \u201cresource curse,\u201d seems to especially undermine good governance, and good governance is often essential to economic development. Because governments engaged in natural resource exploitation receive large amounts of revenue from sources unattached to the democratic process, mechanisms for accountability weaken and investment in human capital decreases (Bulte et al. 2005; Dunning 2005). Such governments often become more autocratic and more prone to corruption and clientelism as government officials seek political and personal gain (Robinson et al. 2006; Collier and Hoeffler 2005). Critics charge that both natural resource rents and foreign aid are \u201cwindfall revenues\u201d or \u201csovereign rents\u201d that can enable corruption and undermine governance. Indeed, some studies suggest foreign aid dependence acts much like the resource curse in demotivating citizens and enabling bad governance (Smith 2008; Djankov et al. 2008; Br\u00e4utigam and Knack 2004). Moreover, because aid allocations from donors fluctuate, governments receiving large amounts of aid can experience economic and political instability, and when aid is suddenly reduced the likelihood of conflict increases (Nielsen et al. 2011). Corruption and clientelism are also associated with foreign aid, as government officials have been known to use foreign funds for political and personal gain (Knack 2001; Svensson 2000). These and other problems with the receipt of foreign aid appear to parallel the problems of over-reliance on resource exploitation. Other studies have questioned the inevitability of the resource curse and claimed that the effects of resources on governance are contingent on other factors (Haber and Menaldo 2011; Jensen and Wantchekon 2004; Dunning 2005). Others have argued that aid has less damaging effects than natural resource revenues because foreign donors can and often do condition aid on government performance and require greater accountability in spending (Jensen and Wantchekon 2004; Collier, 2006; Dunning 2008; Bermeo 2013). However, a distinction in the resource curse literature regarding the \u201cappropriability\u201d of rents from different natural resources suggests that the adverse effects of aid on governance may be more severe (Boschini, Pettersson and Roine, 2007; Isham et al., 2005). Specifically, aid revenues are relatively \u201cappropriable,\u201d as most aid goes directly from donors to central governments. Yet, the majority of existing research on the resource curse utilizes cross-national, observational data, limiting the ability to make causal claims or address micro-level mechanisms. Moreover, despite the fact that much of the resource-curse literature relies on micro-foundational arguments about individual-level responses to new revenues, the micro-foundations of the resource curse have been undertheorized. It is not clear, for example, why less taxation would diminish voters\u2019 political will to hold politicians accountable and thus why windfall revenues, originating from either aid or natural resources, would yield higher rates of rent-seeking than tax-based revenues (see Paler 2013). Further investigation of the resource curse with observational data is unlikely to resolve outstanding micro-foundational questions. This is partly because correctly estimating the effects of windfall revenues is difficult: in countries that have already received oil revenues, citizen\u2019s expectations and willingness to sanction will be endogenous to changes in spending patterns or legislative behavior that have occurred as a result of those revenues.

Assessing changes in citizen action relative to this baseline will enable more credible and precise causal estimates of the windfall revenues\u2019 effects on voters\u2019 evaluations of government performance and their willingness to sanction elected officials. Unsurprisingly, there are relatively few cases where these conditions are satisfied and where large-scale field experimentation is possible. Fortunately, with high levels of foreign assistance and the recent and highly-publicized discovery of sizeable oil fields (see e.g. Anderson and Browne 2011), Uganda is an ideal location for this study. We thus propose to identify the micro-level effects of different sources of new government revenues on citizens\u2019 and elites\u2019 willingness to take costly action to promote better governance. The study will employ a survey experiment with behavioral outcomes in Uganda on a nationally representative sample of Ugandan citizens as well a convenience sample of Members of Parliament. Respondents will be randomized into one of four treatment conditions testing the between-subjects effects on behavior of three potential sources of revenue: oil, taxes, aid projects implemented by government and aid projects implemented by non-governmental organizations (NGOs). In each condition, respondents will hear a short vignette about government or NGO spending. The vignette will include information on the amount and source of additional revenue that will be available to the Ugandan government or NGOs in the near future. Existing literature suggests three broad mechanisms through which windfall revenues affect government behavior: the spending effect, the accountability effect, and the repression effect. For each of these effects, we have multiple outcome measures that will serve as dependent variables in our analysis. For both elite and general public respondents, we will estimate the relative average treatment effect by comparing one treatment group with another. This will yield six comparisons: aid/government with oil, aid/government with taxes, aid/NGOs with oil, aid/NGOs with taxes, aid/government with aid/NGOs, and taxes with oil. Both citizens and MPs will be asked a battery of questions, including, most importantly, their preferences over how the resources should be spent; their beliefs about how the resources are likely to be spent; how accountable and transparent they believe spending from the new revenue source will be; whether it will affect political stability and competition; and their prior knowledge of spending patterns. Citizens will then be invited to sign a petition to their member of parliament calling for a new government agency in charge of tracking how the money will be spent. Enumerators will also request that citizens send a text message to be relayed to their member of parliament calling for the agency. Finally, enumerators will invite citizens to donate part or all of their compensation for participating in the study to an NGO promoting transparency and good governance (Action Aid, Transparency International, or a different NGO of their choosing). MP subjects will be invited to sign a statement calling for a sovereign wealth fund. The inclusion of both the general public and elite respondents will provide unique insights into potential differences in how the two sets of actors view different revenue sources. This study will be supplemented after three years by a second round that will replicate the experiment with many of the same respondents, taking identical measurements along a range of political and economic indicators. It will provide, for the first time, an ability to estimate, at the micro-level, the effect of oil spending along several dimensions, including on income, access to local public goods, government performance, political competition, and political accountability. Such data is especially valuable given the often poor quality of government spending data and the potential for such figures to be inaccurate or misleading. Broadly speaking, existing research thus suggests three broad classes of effects that are applicable at the micro-level, with each having empirical implications that can be tested with this study. Each class of effects applies to both aid and oil, with the relevant comparison group being the tax treatment. First, if resource revenues allow elected officials to avoid financing social spending with broad-based taxation, citizens may have fewer vested interests in holding elected officials accountable for performance and spending patterns. This should manifest itself in two ways: in the first round of data collection, those who expect to benefit from oil revenues should feel less inclined to take costly action to monitor or sanction government behavior compared to citizens in regions without oil. In the panel data, we should similarly observe that those who have benefited objectively (measured as realized per-capita oil revenue) are less inclined to take action. These expectations are consistent with recent work by Martin (2013), which suggests that taxation may also work to induce accountability by activating a fairness norm among voters. Where voters are taxed more, Martin demonstrates, they also make more demands on elected leaders. The second prediction flows from the so-called repression effect. A one-party state with regular elections, Uganda is widely regarded as an anocracy, one in which the ruling party, the National Resistance Movement (NRM), uses its financial and coercive advantage to intimidate opponents and purchase electoral support through large-scale electoral clientelism (see e.g. Conroy-Krutz and Logan 2012). Ross (2001) suggests that resource rents in such states may be used to repress opponents, with the state investing in new repression technologies or simply deploying existing technologies more frequently. While we cannot test this directly in the first round of data collection, we can test whether citizens believe that resources will be used in this way. In the second round of data collection, we will be able to identify this effect more directly by comparing citizen exposure to intimidation (particularly near elections) in locales with high per capita oil revenues to those in low-spending constituencies. The final effect is that driven by the additional spending that is made possible by windfall revenues. The expectation is that, as governments receive windfall revenues, they are able to finance broad-based social welfare improvements, either through local public goods provision or conditional cash transfers. Simply put, the repression effect occurs when additional revenues are used by the incumbent to wield a stick to intimidate citizens and opposition groups; the spending effect is the carrot. This spending, when in line with citizen preferences, has the effect of increasing support for incumbent politicians and/or the ruling coalition. This effect will not be observable in the first wave, since there is no realized spending. However, we will be able to precisely estimate this effect (if it exists) after the conclusion of the second round. The spending effect is thought to purchase the population\u2019s acquiescence to authoritarian governance, and is thus one of the most important mechanisms in explaining the relationship between windfall revenues and changes in indexes of democracy such as Polity or Freedom House scores. The ability to observe this effect directly is a key strength of the project and, to the best of our knowledge, would be the first direct test of the spending effect at the micro-level. A broad outline of the effects we expect to see are presented in Table 1 below. We have listed the treatment conditions in order of where citizens should express the greatest concerns on the dimensions of accountability, repression, and spending. A survey experiment with behavioral outcomes provides advantages in assessing these hypotheses for several reasons. First, and most importantly, micro-level behavior is a function of self-interest and prior beliefs, and uncovering the effects noted above requires accurate estimates of both. Second, a traditional survey, where respondent are asked about their beliefs and expectations for multiple types of new revenue\u2014e.g. aid/gov\u2019t, aid/NGOs, taxes, and oil\u2014is likely to induce priming effects and contamination. By randomizing each of the respondents into one of four experimental conditions, we eliminate the possibility that answers to questions about a given revenue source are influenced by preceding questions about different sources. \u2003 Table 1: Expectations of Citizen Responses Across Several Outcomes Effect Type Hierarchy Among Revenue Sources Accountability Oil > Aid/Gov\u2019t > Tax > Aid/NGOs Repression Oil > Aid/Gov\u2019t > Tax > Aid/NGOs Spending Oil > Aid/Gov\u2019t > Tax > Aid/NGOs\"", "q17": "\"For this experiment, we will draw a nationally representative sample of Ugandan citizens (n = 2,500) and a convenience sample of members of parliament and former candidates for parliament (n = 300). We will oversample in districts that are the sites of oil exploration and in districts with high and low concentrations of foreign aid based on AidData\u2019s georeferenced dataset of foreign aid. In interviews with a representative sample of Ugandan citizens and with a convenience sample of MPs, we will present a randomly assigned statement about the source of significant public funds and then ask subjects a series of questions about what they think the effects of the funds will be and where they think these funds should be spent. Both the citizen and MP surveys first ask questions covering a wide array of standard demographic characteristics. These include ethnicity, age, gender, education, employment, income, quality of life, access to public services, government effectiveness, media consumption, political knowledge, political interest, political activity, political trust, party affiliation, perceptions of corruption, and perceptions of clientelism. Some of the questions in the MP survey are dropped or modified appropriately in consideration of the different baseline levels of knowledge, political background, and sensitivity. For the MP survey, a battery of questions is added inquiring after MPs\u2019 control of government funds and aid money. After the battery of demographic questions, we will randomly assign subjects to receive a statement about billions of dollars in revenue from oil receipts, aid flows through government, aid flows through NGOs, or domestic taxes. Randomization of treatment assignment allows us to uncover systematic differences in subject responses across conditions. We will test the effects of the information conditions both on subjects\u2019 attitudes and on their willingness to take action imposing personal costs by signing a statement calling for an independent resource tracking agency; sending an SMS message to their MP; and donation of survey remuneration to watchdog NGOs. Outcomes for MPs will include signing a statement supporting the creation of a sovereign wealth fund. EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS Both citizen and MP subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions in which they are provided with information framing a set of survey questions that deepen and reinforce the experimental conditions. The conditions are as follows: Oil Condition: \u201cAs part of this survey, we are also providing important information to Ugandans about finances in Uganda.

In next few years, government agencies of Uganda will receive at least five trillion shillings. This money will come from aid given by foreign governments. This money will become part of the Ugandan government budget. Lawmakers and the President are supposed to use the money to improve the lives of Ugandans.\u201d Aid through NGOs Condition: \u201cAs part of this survey, we are also providing important information to Ugandans about finances in Uganda. In next few years, non-governmental organizations of Uganda will receive at least five trillion shillings. This money will come from foreign governments and go DIRECTLY to non-governmental organizations, not to the central government. Non-governmental organizations are supposed to use the money to improve the lives of Ugandans.\u201d SURVEY AND KEY OUTCOMES OF INTEREST Following the experimental condition text, subjects will be asked a series of questions about how government money should be spent, how it is likely to be spent, and what the effects of the money on Uganda are likely to be. The questions will simultaneously serve to reinforce the treatment and to assess the effects of treatments on responses. The reactions to the survey questions, as well as actions taken in the behavioral outcomes of interest, will be compared across experimental conditions. Consistent with our discussion above, the key outcomes of interest are organized into three groups that correspond to the three causal mechanisms thought to produce the resource curse: the spending effect, the repression effect, and the accountability effect. Citizen Behavioral Outcomes The experiment also incorporates behavioral responses in which subjects can substantiate their stated preferences by undertaking actions that impose personal costs. After the survey, subjects will have the opportunity to voice their support for or opposition to a petition calling for an independent agency to track the revenues. Subjects will also be invited to send an SMS text message reinforcing their position to their MP. Finally, they will be invited to donate the money paid them for taking part in the survey to watchdog groups promoting government accountability. MPs will be invited to sign a statement of support for a sovereign wealth fund. 1. Some people have said that they would like to create a special government agency in charge of tracking how the five trillion shillings in [oil/tax/aid] money is spent by [government agencies/non-governmental organizations]. How important do you think it is to track how this money is spent? A. Not at all important B. Not very important C. Somewhat important D. Very important E. Don't know F. Refuse 2. In other countries, there are government agencies that are used to track how development money is spent. Currently, the Ugandan government does not have an agency like this. An agency to do this could be created, but it would require all Ugandans to pay special taxes in order to create it. Would you be willing to pay a small tax so that this agency could be created? A. Yes B. No C. Don't know D. Refuse 3. How much would you be willing to pay per month in new taxes for this agency to be created? Enumerator enters amount stated 4. Would you be willing to send an anonymous petition to your Member of Parliament telling him that you would like for this agency to be created? An anonymous petition is one that does not have your name on it. A. Yes B. No C. Don't know D. Refuse Would you be willing to send a petition using your real name to your Member of Parliament telling him that you would like for this agency to be created? A. Yes B. No C. Don't know D. Refuse 5. ENUMERATOR: Present the petition to the respondent. Mark below whether the respondent signs the petition. If the respondent has suggested that he would only be willing to sign anonymously, ask him or her to put an \"\"X\"\" instead of a signature. If the respondent said he would be willing to use his name, ask him to sign the petition directly. A. Signed B. Did not sign 6. Would you be willing to send an SMS saying that you would like for this agency to be created? Your message will be presented along with other messages to your Member of Parliament. Standard SMS rates apply. A. Yes B. No C. Don't know D. Refuse ENUMERATOR: Please take the slip of paper used for the SMS code and write the following number: [piped based on experimental conditions] 7. There are several organizations in Uganda that work to make it easier for ordinary Ugandans to see how development funds are spent. At the beginning of the survey, we gave you 500 shillings to compensate you for the time it has taken to answer our questions. Now, we would like to know if you would like to donate to one of those organizations. You may choose to donate to Action Aid Uganda, Transparency International Uganda, or a third organization of your choosing. If you would like to donate, please give me the amount of money you would like to donate and which organization you would like to donate to. If you do donate, your money will be used to help reduce corruption and improve the lives of ordinary Ugandans. 7A. ENUMERATOR: How much money did the respondent give you? ENUMERATOR: If they do not donate any money, type \"\"0\"\" as the answer. 7B. ENUMERATOR: Which organization did the respondent choose to donate the money to? A. Transparency International Uganda B. Action Aid Uganda C. Other Organization Citizen Survey Outcomes The following is a battery of questions that will be asked after the vignette, and represents the key outcome measures that will be used to assess whether respondents view hold different expectations for different revenue streams. They organized by the causal mechanism they are designed to test. Because spending and repression effects are ultimately a decision by elites about how to allocate resources, it is possible to observe both, one, or neither. We therefore consider these effects together. Some questions measure whether people think one is more likely than the other, while others ask them about the likelihood of each occurring independently of the other. Questions: We would now like to ask you some questions about what you think will happen when government [agencies/non-governmental organizations] receive five trillion shillings from [oil/taxes/aid]. 1. How likely is it that this money will make the government less willing to tolerate opposition and differences of opinion? A. Very unlikely B. Unlikely C. Somewhat unlikely D. Somewhat likely E. Likely F. Very likely G. Don't know H. Refuse 2.

I understand that the creation of such a fund would entail the creation of an independent body that would manage and invest the revenues that are collected. I also understand that, every year, the fund would be required to publicly report its income and investments in order to promote transparency. I support the creation of such a fund and hope that it will bring greater development and prosperity to Uganda.\u201d MP Survey Outcomes 1.

Don\u2019t know DATA ANALYSIS We will perform data analysis on the outcomes of interest clustered according to the three categories of repression, accountability, and spending. We will begin the analysis using simple difference-in-means tests. We will supplement the difference-in-means results with robustness checks using logit and ordered probit regression analysis using standard demographic covariates as controls. These techniques will be used to assess the main between-subjects treatment effects of the four experimental conditions. Given that we suspect that treatment effects may vary across demographic categories and geographic locations, we will also perform subgroup analysis for the following categories: 1. Perceptions of high vs. low corruption 2. Oil districts vs. non-oil districts 3. Districts with high vs. low aid receipts 4. Political party affiliation 5. Ethnic affiliation (in President\u2019s tribe or not) Given potential issues with multiple comparisons, we will examine effects of the treatments on families of outcomes, conditional on learning that the variables that we project will make up each family indeed load on the same dimension (when using factor analysis). We will construct inverse covariance-weighted indices as suggested by Anderson (2008) and test for treatment effects on the different families of outcomes. The families include subject political action, perceived consequences, projected visibility of the resource spending, and the expected beneficiaries of the funding. The families conjoin the following items from the survey instrument: Action: Importance of tracking the funding, willingness to pay taxes to create an independent tracking agency, amount willing to pay per month in taxes to support the agency, willingness to sign a petition anonymously in favor of the agency, willingness to sign the petition by name, actually signing the petition, willingness to send an SMS message in support of the agency, and actually sending the SMS. Consequences: Subject projections of funding used for repression, perceptions that the money will become a prize to be won, perceptions that it will help opposition parties, perceptions that money will be used for politicians in elections. Beneficiaries: Perceptions that the money will help make ordinary people\u2019s lives better, help the subjects\u2019 families, help the subjects\u2019 communities, help the economy, help the NRM, and help the central government. Contact: Subjects\u2019 self-reported likelihood that they will contact a village elder, a sub-county official, or their member of parliament; Subjects self-reported propensity to march in a demonstration or change which party they vote for. These families of outcomes will be analyzed using inverse-covariance weighted indices (Anderson 2008), which optimally aggregate information from several variables that load on a single common factor. In addition, we will also apply a Bonferroni correction in order to control the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER). We will also present the results of the indices\u2019 constituent variables to demonstrate which individual measures are contributing most to the significance (or non-significance) of a given family. We have chosen the particular families outlined above because they represent key dimensions along which existing work in the resource-curse literature suggest we should see treatment effects. For example, our working assumption is that for those families that measure a willingness to take political action or contact elected officials, we should see the tax condition yield higher values.\"", "q18": "", "q19": "", "q20": "Yes", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "", "q25": "", "q26": "Researchers", "q27": "", "q28": "No", "q29": "", "q30": "No", "q31": "", "q32": "", "q33": [""], "q34": [""], "q35": "Agree", "q36": "Agree", "q37": [], "q38": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=bwfts", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "bwfts", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "bwfts", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/d5gfm/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "d5gfm", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ef2mh/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "ef2mh", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0f/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0f", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/bwfts/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bwfts/"}}], "links": {"first": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json", "last": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "prev": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=460", "next": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=462", "meta": {"total": 5469, "per_page": 10}}}
