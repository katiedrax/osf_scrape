common invasive interventions in use in healthcare. Prescribed IVTM play an essential role in the treatment of illness, management of chronic conditions and in maintaining health and wellbeing. The intravenous (IV) route is the administration of concentrated medications (diluted or undiluted) directly into peripherally or centrally inserted vascular access devices. Medication safety is a key priority and best practice standards are required to guide the safe preparation and administration of IVTM.  \n\nMethods  \n\nWe will conduct a systematic review of the literature pertaining to the preparation and administration of intravenous therapy and medicines. Our search will include studies concerned with the preparation and/or administration of IVTM via peripheral or central vascular access devices. We will be guided by the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) in this review. Literature will include all trial designs, national/international guidelines, and expert consensus opinion made available in English from 2009 to present day. \n\nConclusion  \n\nWe will synthesise the evidence concerning safe and effective preparation and administration of intravenous therapy and medicines to inform the development of a national guideline for healthcare professionals in Ireland. The availability of up-to-date, contemporaneous evidence-based practice standards will ensure quality and safety for service-users.", "category": "other", "custom_citation": "", "date_created":

"}}}, "procedure": {"value": {"question10b": {"extra": [], "value": "Procedure \nParticipants were invited for three assessments, with the pretest approximately 8-17 weeks after birth, the posttest approximately 12-21 weeks after birth, and a follow-up around 29-45 weeks post-birth. The first two research visits were located either in the Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC) or at the participant\u2019s home, depending on possible MRI contra-indications (i.e. diabetes, neurological diagnosis, metallic foreign objects in participant\u2019s body) and preference of the participant. Between the pretest and posttest, participants received an instruction about the intervention and were asked to use the assigned baby tool, either a baby seat or a baby carrier, for three weeks, for a minimal of six hours per week divided over at least four days. Between the post-test and follow-up, participants could keep the assigned tool and use it as often as they preferred. The study is approved by the Ethics Committees of the Leiden University Medical Centre and of the Department of Education and Child studies at Leiden University. All participants gave informed consent. For the current paper, we focus on the pretest assessment.\n\nThe pretest assessment consisted of at least three parts: 1. Behavioral measurements, including a 10 minute Free play (Witte, De Moor, Van Ijzendoorn, &amp; Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2019), the Auditory Startling Task (AST, Witte et al., 2019), a handgrip force paradigm (Alyousefi-Van Dijk et al., 2019), and the Five Minute Speech Sample (Lotz et al., 2020); 2. Saliva and hair sampling for hormonal measurements; and 3. Questionnaires about e.g. health, medication and current mental state. When the assessment took place in the LUMC, additional neural measurements were taken with (f)MRI and DTI. Following the assessment, participants and partners completed some online questionnaires at home (including the Parental Protection Questionnaire; See Van \u2019t Veer et al., 2019). \n\n\nMeasures\nAuditory Startling task .To observe paternal protective behavior, we applied the Auditory Startling Task (Witte et al., 2019). During the AST, a loud short sound fragment was played \u201cunexpectedly\u201d by a hidden audio installation while the participant was playing with his infant. Participant and infant were playing alone in a separate room while being videotaped. The sound consisted of white noise (80-db) and was programmed for 10 seconds with short breaks. At the end of the sound fragment, the researcher entered the room and apologized for the sound: e.g. \u2018I am sorry for the sound, we had some technical problems\u2019. The purpose of the sound fragment was explained to the participants at the end of the follow-up visit. \nProtective behavior of the participant towards the infant in reaction to the sound fragment, and baby states before and during the sound fragment were coded from the video. The baby state before the sound fragment was coded based on observation of the 30 seconds before the start of the white noise. The baby state during the sound fragment was also coded. Coding of the protective behavior in reaction to the white noise was stopped when the researcher entered the room.\n\nThe coding manual was developed for the current study. Two authors (MBK &amp; AL) watched 10 AST videos and listed the observed protective responses and added other possible protective behaviors in reaction to the auditory stimuli. Subsequently, 10 members of the research team, including MBK and AL, rated these behaviors on protective behavior (1= least protective; 8= most protective). A correlation matrix of these ratings revealed that all r &gt; .80, indicating that in general all raters agreed on rating order. The final coding scheme consists of a 10-point scale, with higher scores reflecting more protective behavior, see Table 1 for an overview. The coding scheme for baby states before and during noise was adapted from Mah, Bakermans-Kranenburg, Van Ijzendoorn, &amp; Smith (2015) and consists of a 5-point scale: 1. Drowsy or asleep, 2. Quiet, 3. Alert, 4. Startled, 5. Fussing, 6. Distressed. When various states or responses were observed, the highest rating corresponding to these responses was assigned\nFive raters were trained by one of the authors (AL). Interrater reliability was assessed based on a total of 20 videos. A first set of ten videos was scored directly after the training. A second set of ten videos was coded after all raters coded several videos independently. All raters obtained good inter rater reliability (Single measures absolute agreement, Parental protection ICC &gt; .84, Baby state before noise ICC &gt; .67, Baby state during noise ICC &gt; .75). \n\nfMRI protection task. To examine the possible neural basis for paternal protection, fathers participated in an fMRI task that was adapted from Van \u2018t Veer et al. (2019). In the current protection task, as described in Witte et al. (2019), participants watched videos while lying in an MRI scanner. The videos depicted either a scenario in which an infant was in a threatening situation, or a matched neutral video in which there was no threat to the infant. During the task, participants watched 12 different video pairs (see table 2. for a description of the videos). The videos (that will be made available upon request) were filmed using a gender-neutral lifelike baby doll. Fathers were instructed to imagine that the infant in the videos was their own infant. To ease the task of imagining their own infant in the videos, a picture of their infant was shown during the task. Moreover, the presentation of the doll\u2019s face and the faces of the actors in the videos was minimized.\nEach video, 12 threatening videos and 12 matched neutral videos, was shown twice to each participant, resulting in a total of 48 videos. The duration of each video was 6 seconds. The videos were shown in one of four pre-programmed semi-random orders. The order was selected based on participant identification number (1 assigned to order 1, 4 to order 4, 5 to order 1, etc.). For each order, it was ensured that videos were equally distributed across the task: 12 neutral and 12 threatening videos were presented during the first half of the task as well as the second half of the task. To maximize the power of the design, inter stimulus interval (ISI) between videos was sampled using the web-based tool Neurodesign (Durnez, Blair, &amp; Poldrack, 2017). Videos were separated by an ISI of variable length ranging from 3.0 \u2013 8.0 seconds, with a mean ISI of 4.5 seconds. The task was programmed in E-Prime software (version 2.0; Psychology Software Tools, Inc., PA, USA).\n\nPrior to the first assessment, participants were asked to send a picture of their own child. Each photo was edited in Adobe Photoshop CS by adding a black-face contour to remove ears and most of the hair, and a black background. To ensure that all images contain approximately the same pixel ratio between the black background and face, images were resized so that face length was set on 10 cm. Finally, a selection of the picture containing the face was copied to a new black image of 640*480 pixels. Participants were familiarized to the edited image and task design during a practice task prior to the MRI scan session, while viewing videos that were not included in the real task. At the onset of the real task, an edited picture of participants own infant was shown with a written instruction to imagine that their own infant is displayed in the succeeding videos. The instruction and edited picture were shown again after each eight videos (thus six times in total). After a stimulus interval of 250 milliseconds, the instruction screen advanced to one of the four pre-programmed semi-random order of 48 videos as described above. \n\nfMRI parameters. MRI scanning was performed on a 3\u202fT Philips Achieva TXMRI system (Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands). For registration purposes, a T1-weighted anatomical scan was acquired (repetition time (TR)=\u202f7.90\u202fms, echo time (TE)\u202f=\u202f 3.50\u202fms, flip angle\u202f=\u202f8\u00b0, 155 transverse slices, ACQ voxel size 1.1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.1 mm). The fMRI-task utilized a gradient-echo blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) echo-planar imaging sequence with: TR\u202f=\u202f2200\u202fms, TE\u202f=\u202f30\u202fms, flip angle\u202f=\u202f80\u00b0, 38 transverse slices, and ACQ voxel size of 2.75\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.75\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.75\u202fmm (including a default interslice gap). The duration of the fMRI paradigm was 10 min 53\u202fs (290 volumes). Fieldmap corrections were performed using a multi-acquisition B0 map, performed directly after the end of the fMRI protection task. \n\nParental Protection Questionnaire. To measure father\u2019s protective behavior towards the child in daily life, fathers and partners were asked to fill in the Parental Protection Questionnaire (PPQ, see Van \u2018t Veer et al. (2019) for a prenatal version of this questionnaire) after each assessment. The partners reported on the participants\u2019 protective behavior as well. The current questionnaire contains 12 items that had to be scored on the prevalence during the past month (1= never, 2= seldom, 3= sometimes, 4= often or always, 5= not applicable). Examples of questions are: \u2018I made sure that the baby\u2019s diaper was changed in time\u2019, or \u2018I made sure that the living room was safe for the baby\u2019. Using an exploratory factor analysis on participants\u2019 data, items loading &gt;.40 on the factor explaining the most of the variance will be selected to calculate the mean score for both participant and partner.\n\nSalivary vasopressin/testosterone. Salivary samples were obtained at the beginning of each assessment. Participants were instructed not to consume any alcoholic drinks or have excessive physical exercise during the last 24 hours prior to each assessment. Furthermore, participants were asked not to drink any caffeine containing drinks on the day of the assessment, and not to smoke, chew gum, eat or drink (except for water) 30 minutes before the start of the appointment. Just before sampling participants rinsed their mouth with water. All samples were stored as soon as possible at -20 \u02daC. Saliva collected at home were placed on ice for transportation. \n\nTestosterone. Participants drool approximately 1.5 ml saliva into a 2 ml cryogenic vial (SalivaBio, Salimetrics), either directly into the vial or indirectly using a saliva collection aid (Saliva Bio, Salimetrics). Before drooling, participants were asked to swallow once and to slightly bent forward. To stimulate saliva production, participants were recommended to think about something sweet or sour, to move their jaws up and down, or to look at pictures of food that were provided. Testosterone was quantified at Dresden LabService GmbH (Germany) by Luminscence enzyme immunoassay (IBL International GMBH). Fifty \u00b5L of each sample was used for the immunoassay. The limit of detection was 1.8 pg/mL. Samples used for the current article were quantified in the same assay run (12 plates in total). Duplicate analyses was performed for a random selection of 30% of the samples. Inter-assay variability was 10% and intra-assay variability was 5.22%. Cross-reactivity with other substances tested &lt; 0.01 %.\n\nVasopressin. Participants chewed on a cotton swab (Salivette, Sarstedt) for 60 seconds. Saliva for the quantification of OT and AVP was collected using salivettes (Sarstedt). Participants were instructed to chew lightly on a cotton swab for 60 seconds and move the swab around in their mouth every now and then to boost saliva collection. Researchers kept track of the time using a stopwatch. Oxytocin and vasopressin were quantified by radioimunnoassay at RIAgnosis (Sinzing, Germany). Salivettes were centrifuged at 4 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes with ca. 5000 g centrifugal force, after which 0.6 ml of saliva was pipetted into a vial (0.3 ml for the analysis of OT and 0.3 ml for the analysis of AVP). Both for OT and AVP and the detection limit was 0.1 pg/ml. All pre-test samples were analyzed simultaneously in the same assay run. Intra-assay variability was &lt; 10%.

A meta-analysis on the association between parenting behavior and T levels in fathers showed a combined effect size of Hedges\u2019 g = 0.14, equivalent to r = .07 (Meijer et al., 2019). With our sample size, a combined effect size of r = .07 results in a power of .09 (at an alpha level of .05). However, the meta-analysis included studies with a broad range of parenting-related measures, and their relevance to parental protection is unclear. Hardly any study on protective parenting is available. It is thus difficult to estimate the power achieved with our sample size accurately. When taking into account the only effect size related to protective parenting (r = .46, Alyousefi- Van Dijk et al., 2019), power would be &gt; .90, but this was a study with a small sample size and the confidence interval (CI) of the effect size is (.08, .72). We can, as an alternative, determine what effect sizes we can detect in our sample. This is necessary for those associations between neural, behavioral and hormonal measurements for which no effect sizes can be derived from the literature, and thus are more exploratory. Therefore, we computed what effects we can detect as significant with our sample. Power value was set at .80, alpha at .05, resulting in detectable effect sizes of r = .31. This effect size is larger than what we consider the smallest effect size of interest (SESOI, Lakens, Scheel, &amp; Isager, 2018). We suggest that effect sizes r \u2265 .08 are of interest for further study and replication, as this is the lower end of the CI around the effect size of the aforementioned study (determination of SESOI as suggested by Perugini, Gallucci, &amp; Costantini, 2014, although ideally this should be based on the CI of a meta-analytic effect size of pertinent studies)."}, "question7b": {"extra": [], "value": "The inclusion of participants was ended half December 2019.

Parental protective behavior may be important for the promotion of secure attachment. Specifically, experiences with protective parents may enhance children\u2019s trust in parent\u2019s availability to help and protect them in times of danger or distress (Bowbly, 1982). Since most research on protective parenting concentrated on mothers (Hahn-Holbrook, Holbrook, &amp; Haselton, 2011), the current study aims to address the psychobiology of protective behavior in fathers. \nPaternal protective behavior has been studied in a variety of contexts, however, to our knowledge, only few studies combined behavioral, neural or endocrine aspects to address the psychobiology of paternal behavior. For example, males\u2019 behavioral and neural responses have been studied during exposure to infant crying, an indicator for a possible threatening situation (e.g. Alyousefi-Van Dijk et al., 2019; Li, Chen, Mascaro, Haroon, &amp; Rilling, 2017; Thijssen et al., 2018; Van Anders, Tolman, &amp; Volling, 2012). Furthermore, fathers\u2019 protective behavior and neural responses towards the (unborn) child in daily life situations have been studied (e.g. Van \u2019t Veer, Thijssen, Witteman, Van IJzendoorn, &amp; Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2019). Moreover, several literature reviews concluded that paternal behavior has a possible neuro-endocrine basis (Abraham &amp; Feldman, 2018; Hahn-Holbrook et al., 2011; Rilling &amp; Mascaro, 2017), indicating that paternal hormones, such as testosterone and vasopressin, and specific neural activation might be proper correlates or even activators of observed protective behavior. \n\nThe possible role of testosterone and vasopressin in protective parenting has been incorporated in the Steroid/Peptide Model of Social Bonds by Van Anders, Goldey, &amp; Kuo (2011). Firstly, their model implies that low levels of testosterone might be linked to parental contexts that are perceived as nurturing. This statement is in line with previous research showing that lower salivary testosterone is associated with increased participation of fathers in child care and enhanced quality of caregiving, both prenatally (Bos et al., 2018; Edelstein et al., 2017) and postnatally (Bos et al., 2018; Gettler, McDade, Feranil, &amp; Kuzawa, 2011; Weisman, Zagoory-Sharon, &amp; Feldman, 2014), although combined effect sizes are small (for meta-analysis see Meijer, Van IJzendoorn, &amp; Bakermans - Kranenburg, 2019). Additionally, the model of Van Anders and colleagues implies that high levels of testosterone are associated with parental contexts that involve a need for protective responses. Indeed, it was shown that testosterone administration increased males\u2019 neural responses to facial threat cues in brain areas associated with threat processing (Goetz et al., 2014) and that cry sounds increased salivary testosterone levels in men when no nurturing action was possible (Van Anders et al., 2012). Based on these findings, we expect a positive association between baseline testosterone levels, protective behavior and neural reactivity to threatening stimuli. \nSecondly, the Steroid/Peptide Model states a specific role for AVP reactivity in protective parenting, namely that protective aggression is positively related to increases of AVP (Van Anders et al., 2011). A number of studies suggest that paternal protection might be associated with AVP. For instance, administration of AVP increased father-to-be\u2019s orientation towards baby avatars (Cohen-Bendahan, Beijers, Van Doornen, &amp; de Weerth, 2015) and it affected the neural processing of emotionally labeled infant cry sounds (Thijssen et al., 2018). Moreover, basal AVP levels in fathers have been shown to be negatively related to brain activity in brain areas involved in empathy and social cognition when viewing neutral or positive videos of own infant vs other infant. The authors interpreted this as a possible AVP-dependent vigilance to strangers (Atzil, Hendler, Zagoory-Sharon, Winetraub, &amp; Feldman, 2012). In contrast, other studies showed that AVP administration did not increase handgrip force in reaction to infant crying in first time expectant fathers (Alyousefi-Van Dijk et al., 2019) or fathers\u2019 neural processing of infant cry and the subjective cry rating (Li et al., 2017), and no correlation between basal AVP levels and explicit and implicit infant caregiving was observed in prospective fathers (Cohen-Bendahan et al., 2015). Thus, mixed findings are present for the role of AVP, both for basal and reactive hormone levels, in protective behavior. However, no studies to date specifically looked at AVP in relation to protective paternal behavior and neural processing of infant threat. Based on previous findings and the theory of the Steroid/Peptide Model, we predict that basal levels of AVP are associated with more protective behavior and stronger neural responses to infant threat. \n\n\tTo our knowledge, few studies have focused on the relation between protective behavior and its neural correlates. An fMRI study with fathers focusing on dangerous daily situations revealed that several brain networks known to be associated with the parental care network, visual processing areas and threat detection, are involved in processing of videos depicting infant threatening situations (Van \u2019t Veer et al., 2019). Moreover, Van \u2018t Veer and colleagues observed that protective behavior in daily life was linked to stronger brain activation while watching their own (versus an unknown) infant in threatening (versus neutral) situations. Based on these findings, we hypothesize a neural threat component that will be positively associated with observed and reported protective behavior. \n"}, "question6a": {"extra": [], "value": "N/A"}}}, "confirmatory-analyses-first": {"value": {"first": {"value": {"question1c": {"extra": [], "value": "Preprocessing of AST\nIt will be checked whether data for the three scales (protective response, baby state before noise and baby state during noise) is normally distributed and whether outliers are present in the data.

Subsequently, the .nifti files and corresponding stimulus data were checked via the BIDS validator. \n\nfMRI \u2013 step 2. Preprocessing is performed using fMRIPrep (version \u22651.5.2 (Esteban, Markiewicz, et al. (2018); Esteban, Blair, et al. (2018); RRID:SCR_016216)), which is based on Nipype 1.3.1 (Gorgolewski et al. (2011); Gorgolewski et al. (2018); RRID:SCR_002502).\nAnatomical data preprocessing. T1-weighted (T1w) images were corrected for intensity non-uniformity (INU) with N4BiasFieldCorrection,(Tustison et al. 2010), distributed with ANTs 2.2.0 (Avants et al. 2008, RRID:SCR_004757). The T1w-reference was then skull-stripped with Nipype implementation of the antsBrainExtraction.sh workflow (from ANTs), using OASIS30ANTs as target template. Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white-matter (WM) and gray-matter (GM) was performed on the brain-extracted T1w using fast (FSL 5.0.9, RRID:SCR_002823, Zhang, Brady, and Smith 2001). A T1w-reference map was computed after registration of T1w images (after INU-correction) using mri_robust_template (FreeSurfer 6.0.1, Reuter, Rosas, and Fischl 2010). Brain surfaces were reconstructed using recon-all (FreeSurfer 6.0.1, RRID:SCR_001847, Dale, Fischl, and Sereno 1999), and the brain mask estimated previously was refined with a custom variation of the method to reconcile ANTs-derived and FreeSurfer-derived segmentations of the cortical gray-matter of Mindboggle (RRID:SCR_002438, Klein et al. 2017). Volume-based spatial normalization to two standard spaces (MNI152NLin2009cAsym, MNI152NLin6Asym) was performed through nonlinear registration with antsRegistration (ANTs 2.2.0), using brain-extracted versions of both T1w reference and the T1w template. The following templates were selected for spatial normalization: ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template version 2009c [Fonov et al. (2009), RRID:SCR_008796; TemplateFlow ID: MNI152NLin2009cAsym], FSL\u2019s MNI ICBM 152 non-linear 6th Generation Asymmetric Average Brain Stereotaxic Registration Model [Evans et al. (2012), RRID:SCR_002823; TemplateFlow ID: MNI152NLin6Asym].\nFunctional data preprocessing. For each BOLD run, the following preprocessing was performed. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. A deformation field to correct for susceptibility distortions was estimated based on fMRIPrep\u2019s fieldmap-less approach. The deformation field is that resulting from co-registering the BOLD reference to the same-subject T1w-reference with its intensity inverted (Wang et al. 2017; Huntenburg 2014). Registration is performed with antsRegistration (ANTs 2.2.0), and the process regularized by constraining deformation to be nonzero only along the phase-encoding direction, and modulated with an average fieldmap template (Treiber et al. 2016). Based on the estimated susceptibility distortion, an unwarped BOLD reference was calculated for a more accurate co-registration with the anatomical reference. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using bbregister (FreeSurfer) which implements boundary-based registration (Greve and Fischl 2009). Co-registration was configured with six degrees of freedom. Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using mcflirt (FSL 5.0.9, Jenkinson et al. 2002). BOLD runs were slice-time corrected using 3dTshift from AFNI 20160207 (Cox and Hyde 1997, RRID:SCR_005927). The BOLD time-series, were resampled to surfaces on the following spaces: fsaverage6. The BOLD time-series (including slice-timing correction when applied) were resampled onto their original, native space by applying a single, composite transform to correct for head-motion and susceptibility distortions. These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as preprocessed BOLD in original space, or just preprocessed BOLD. The BOLD time-series were resampled into several standard spaces, correspondingly generating the following spatially-normalized, preprocessed BOLD runs: MNI152NLin2009cAsym, MNI152NLin6Asym. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. Automatic removal of motion artifacts using independent component analysis (ICA-AROMA, Pruim et al. 2015) was performed on the preprocessed BOLD on MNI space time-series after removal of non-steady state volumes and spatial smoothing with an isotropic, Gaussian kernel of 6mm FWHM (full-width half-maximum). Corresponding \u201cnon-aggresively\u201d denoised runs were produced after such smoothing. Additionally, the \u201caggressive\u201d noise-regressors were collected and placed in the corresponding confounds file. Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the preprocessed BOLD: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS and three region-wise global signals. FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run, both using their implementations in Nipype (following the definitions by Power et al. 2014). The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and the whole-brain masks. Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to allow for component-based noise correction (CompCor, Behzadi et al. 2007). Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the preprocessed BOLD time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with 128s cut-off) for the two CompCor variants: temporal (tCompCor) and anatomical (aCompCor). tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 5% variable voxels within a mask covering the subcortical regions. This subcortical mask is obtained by heavily eroding the brain mask, which ensures it does not include cortical GM regions. For aCompCor, components are calculated within the intersection of the aforementioned mask and the union of CSF and WM masks calculated in T1w space, after their projection to the native space of each functional run (using the inverse BOLD-to-T1w transformation). Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks. For each CompCor decomposition, the k components with the largest singular values are retained, such that the retained components\u2019 time series are sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance across the nuisance mask (CSF, WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components are dropped from consideration. The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also placed within the corresponding confounds file. The confound time series derived from head motion estimates and global signals were expanded with the inclusion of temporal derivatives and quadratic terms for each (Satterthwaite et al. 2013). Frames that exceeded a threshold of 0.5 mm FD or 1.5 standardised DVARS were annotated as motion outliers. All resamplings can be performed with a single interpolation step by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e. head-motion transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available, and co-registrations to anatomical and output spaces). Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using antsApplyTransforms (ANTs), configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing effects of other kernels (Lanczos 1964). Non-gridded (surface) resamplings were performed using mri_vol2surf (FreeSurfer).\n\nIn FSL's FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool), spatial smoothing will be done using a Gaussian kernel with a full-width-at-half-maximum of 5 mm. High-pass filter cutoff will be set at 90 s.\n\nfMRI \u2013 step 3.

A Cronbach\u2019s alpha will be calculated to assess the internal consistency for these items. Based on the selected items, a mean score will be calculated. \n\nPreprocessing fMRI\nfMRI \u2013 step 1. Data is structured following the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). Firstly, Dicom scans collected during the fMRI protection task were converted to .nifti and .json files via the dcm2niix converter. Subsequently, the .nifti files and corresponding stimulus data were checked via the BIDS validator. \n\nfMRI \u2013 step 2. Preprocessing is performed using fMRIPrep (version \u22651.5.2 (Esteban, Markiewicz, et al. (2018); Esteban, Blair, et al. (2018); RRID:SCR_016216)), which is based on Nipype 1.3.1 (Gorgolewski et al. (2011); Gorgolewski et al. (2018); RRID:SCR_002502).\nAnatomical data preprocessing. T1-weighted (T1w) images were corrected for intensity non-uniformity (INU) with N4BiasFieldCorrection,(Tustison et al. 2010), distributed with ANTs 2.2.0 (Avants et al. 2008, RRID:SCR_004757). The T1w-reference was then skull-stripped with Nipype implementation of the antsBrainExtraction.sh workflow (from ANTs), using OASIS30ANTs as target template. Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white-matter (WM) and gray-matter (GM) was performed on the brain-extracted T1w using fast (FSL 5.0.9, RRID:SCR_002823, Zhang, Brady, and Smith 2001). A T1w-reference map was computed after registration of T1w images (after INU-correction) using mri_robust_template (FreeSurfer 6.0.1, Reuter, Rosas, and Fischl 2010). Brain surfaces were reconstructed using recon-all (FreeSurfer 6.0.1, RRID:SCR_001847, Dale, Fischl, and Sereno 1999), and the brain mask estimated previously was refined with a custom variation of the method to reconcile ANTs-derived and FreeSurfer-derived segmentations of the cortical gray-matter of Mindboggle (RRID:SCR_002438, Klein et al. 2017). Volume-based spatial normalization to two standard spaces (MNI152NLin2009cAsym, MNI152NLin6Asym) was performed through nonlinear registration with antsRegistration (ANTs 2.2.0), using brain-extracted versions of both T1w reference and the T1w template. The following templates were selected for spatial normalization: ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template version 2009c [Fonov et al. (2009), RRID:SCR_008796; TemplateFlow ID: MNI152NLin2009cAsym], FSL\u2019s MNI ICBM 152 non-linear 6th Generation Asymmetric Average Brain Stereotaxic Registration Model [Evans et al. (2012), RRID:SCR_002823; TemplateFlow ID: MNI152NLin6Asym].\nFunctional data preprocessing. For each BOLD run, the following preprocessing was performed. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. A deformation field to correct for susceptibility distortions was estimated based on fMRIPrep\u2019s fieldmap-less approach. The deformation field is that resulting from co-registering the BOLD reference to the same-subject T1w-reference with its intensity inverted (Wang et al. 2017; Huntenburg 2014). Registration is performed with antsRegistration (ANTs 2.2.0), and the process regularized by constraining deformation to be nonzero only along the phase-encoding direction, and modulated with an average fieldmap template (Treiber et al. 2016). Based on the estimated susceptibility distortion, an unwarped BOLD reference was calculated for a more accurate co-registration with the anatomical reference. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using bbregister (FreeSurfer) which implements boundary-based registration (Greve and Fischl 2009). Co-registration was configured with six degrees of freedom. Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using mcflirt (FSL 5.0.9, Jenkinson et al. 2002). BOLD runs were slice-time corrected using 3dTshift from AFNI 20160207 (Cox and Hyde 1997, RRID:SCR_005927). The BOLD time-series, were resampled to surfaces on the following spaces: fsaverage6. The BOLD time-series (including slice-timing correction when applied) were resampled onto their original, native space by applying a single, composite transform to correct for head-motion and susceptibility distortions. These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as preprocessed BOLD in original space, or just preprocessed BOLD. The BOLD time-series were resampled into several standard spaces, correspondingly generating the following spatially-normalized, preprocessed BOLD runs: MNI152NLin2009cAsym, MNI152NLin6Asym. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. Automatic removal of motion artifacts using independent component analysis (ICA-AROMA, Pruim et al. 2015) was performed on the preprocessed BOLD on MNI space time-series after removal of non-steady state volumes and spatial smoothing with an isotropic, Gaussian kernel of 6mm FWHM (full-width half-maximum). Corresponding \u201cnon-aggresively\u201d denoised runs were produced after such smoothing. Additionally, the \u201caggressive\u201d noise-regressors were collected and placed in the corresponding confounds file. Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the preprocessed BOLD: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS and three region-wise global signals. FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run, both using their implementations in Nipype (following the definitions by Power et al. 2014). The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and the whole-brain masks. Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to allow for component-based noise correction (CompCor, Behzadi et al. 2007). Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the preprocessed BOLD time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with 128s cut-off) for the two CompCor variants: temporal (tCompCor) and anatomical (aCompCor). tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 5% variable voxels within a mask covering the subcortical regions. This subcortical mask is obtained by heavily eroding the brain mask, which ensures it does not include cortical GM regions. For aCompCor, components are calculated within the intersection of the aforementioned mask and the union of CSF and WM masks calculated in T1w space, after their projection to the native space of each functional run (using the inverse BOLD-to-T1w transformation). Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks. For each CompCor decomposition, the k components with the largest singular values are retained, such that the retained components\u2019 time series are sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance across the nuisance mask (CSF, WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components are dropped from consideration. The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also placed within the corresponding confounds file. The confound time series derived from head motion estimates and global signals were expanded with the inclusion of temporal derivatives and quadratic terms for each (Satterthwaite et al. 2013). Frames that exceeded a threshold of 0.5 mm FD or 1.5 standardised DVARS were annotated as motion outliers. All resamplings can be performed with a single interpolation step by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e. head-motion transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available, and co-registrations to anatomical and output spaces). Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using antsApplyTransforms (ANTs), configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing effects of other kernels (Lanczos 1964). Non-gridded (surface) resamplings were performed using mri_vol2surf (FreeSurfer).\n\nIn FSL's FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool), spatial smoothing will be done using a Gaussian kernel with a full-width-at-half-maximum of 5 mm. High-pass filter cutoff will be set at 90 s.\n\nfMRI \u2013 step 3. Statistical analyses: \n1.\tFirst level analyses of the participant for the contrast threatening videos vs. neutral videos using FEAT. Threat and neutral videos as well as the instruction picture of own child will be modeled separately as a square-wave function. Each predictor will be convolved with a double gamma hemodynamic response function. Temporal derivatives will be added to the model and the contrast threat versus neutral will be assessed.\n2.\tAll first-level contrast images and the corresponding variance images will be submitted to second level mixed-effects group whole brain analyses. Group level analysis will be performed using FEAT to detect average activation for the contrast threat vs. neutral and the reverse contrast. Statistical maps will be thresholded using clusters determined by Z\u202f&gt;\u202f3.1 and a cluster corrected significance threshold of p\u202f&lt;\u202f.05. When no significant effects are observed for this threshold, the threshold will be lowered to Z &gt; 2.3. Using the COPES resulting from the positive threat vs neutral contrast, masks will be created and used as the input for a featquery extracting the individual Z mean values for all significant clusters. \n3.\tThese individual Z values will be used for further confirmatory and exploratory analyses.  \n\n\n"}, "question2c": {"extra": [], "value": "Exploratory: Path-analysis will be used to explore the mediating effect of neural responses in brain areas involved in the parental care network, visual processing areas and threat detection on the relation between basal hormone levels and protective behavior (see figure 1).

Parental protective behavior may be important for the promotion of secure attachment. Specifically, experiences with protective parents may enhance children\u2019s trust in parent\u2019s availability to help and protect them in times of danger or distress (Bowbly, 1982). Since most research on protective parenting concentrated on mothers (Hahn-Holbrook, Holbrook, &amp; Haselton, 2011), the current study aims to address the psychobiology of protective behavior in fathers. \nPaternal protective behavior has been studied in a variety of contexts, however, to our knowledge, only few studies combined behavioral, neural or endocrine aspects to address the psychobiology of paternal behavior. For example, males\u2019 behavioral and neural responses have been studied during exposure to infant crying, an indicator for a possible threatening situation (e.g. Alyousefi-Van Dijk et al., 2019; Li, Chen, Mascaro, Haroon, &amp; Rilling, 2017; Thijssen et al., 2018; Van Anders, Tolman, &amp; Volling, 2012). Furthermore, fathers\u2019 protective behavior and neural responses towards the (unborn) child in daily life situations have been studied (e.g. Van \u2019t Veer, Thijssen, Witteman, Van IJzendoorn, &amp; Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2019). Moreover, several literature reviews concluded that paternal behavior has a possible neuro-endocrine basis (Abraham &amp; Feldman, 2018; Hahn-Holbrook et al., 2011; Rilling &amp; Mascaro, 2017), indicating that paternal hormones, such as testosterone and vasopressin, and specific neural activation might be proper correlates or even activators of observed protective behavior. \n\nThe possible role of testosterone and vasopressin in protective parenting has been incorporated in the Steroid/Peptide Model of Social Bonds by Van Anders, Goldey, &amp; Kuo (2011). Firstly, their model implies that low levels of testosterone might be linked to parental contexts that are perceived as nurturing. This statement is in line with previous research showing that lower salivary testosterone is associated with increased participation of fathers in child care and enhanced quality of caregiving, both prenatally (Bos et al., 2018; Edelstein et al., 2017) and postnatally (Bos et al., 2018; Gettler, McDade, Feranil, &amp; Kuzawa, 2011; Weisman, Zagoory-Sharon, &amp; Feldman, 2014), although combined effect sizes are small (for meta-analysis see Meijer, Van IJzendoorn, &amp; Bakermans - Kranenburg, 2019). Additionally, the model of Van Anders and colleagues implies that high levels of testosterone are associated with parental contexts that involve a need for protective responses. Indeed, it was shown that testosterone administration increased males\u2019 neural responses to facial threat cues in brain areas associated with threat processing (Goetz et al., 2014) and that cry sounds increased salivary testosterone levels in men when no nurturing action was possible (Van Anders et al., 2012). Based on these findings, we expect a positive association between baseline testosterone levels, protective behavior and neural reactivity to threatening stimuli. \nSecondly, the Steroid/Peptide Model states a specific role for AVP reactivity in protective parenting, namely that protective aggression is positively related to increases of AVP (Van Anders et al., 2011). A number of studies suggest that paternal protection might be associated with AVP. For instance, administration of AVP increased father-to-be\u2019s orientation towards baby avatars (Cohen-Bendahan, Beijers, Van Doornen, &amp; de Weerth, 2015) and it affected the neural processing of emotionally labeled infant cry sounds (Thijssen et al., 2018). Moreover, basal AVP levels in fathers have been shown to be negatively related to brain activity in brain areas involved in empathy and social cognition when viewing neutral or positive videos of own infant vs other infant. The authors interpreted this as a possible AVP-dependent vigilance to strangers (Atzil, Hendler, Zagoory-Sharon, Winetraub, &amp; Feldman, 2012). In contrast, other studies showed that AVP administration did not increase handgrip force in reaction to infant crying in first time expectant fathers (Alyousefi-Van Dijk et al., 2019) or fathers\u2019 neural processing of infant cry and the subjective cry rating (Li et al., 2017), and no correlation between basal AVP levels and explicit and implicit infant caregiving was observed in prospective fathers (Cohen-Bendahan et al., 2015). Thus, mixed findings are present for the role of AVP, both for basal and reactive hormone levels, in protective behavior. However, no studies to date specifically looked at AVP in relation to protective paternal behavior and neural processing of infant threat. Based on previous findings and the theory of the Steroid/Peptide Model, we predict that basal levels of AVP are associated with more protective behavior and stronger neural responses to infant threat. \n\n\tTo our knowledge, few studies have focused on the relation between protective behavior and its neural correlates. An fMRI study with fathers focusing on dangerous daily situations revealed that several brain networks known to be associated with the parental care network, visual processing areas and threat detection, are involved in processing of videos depicting infant threatening situations (Van \u2019t Veer et al., 2019). Moreover, Van \u2018t Veer and colleagues observed that protective behavior in daily life was linked to stronger brain activation while watching their own (versus an unknown) infant in threatening (versus neutral) situations. Based on these findings, we hypothesize a neural threat component that will be positively associated with observed and reported protective behavior. \n", "recommended-hypothesis.question6a": "N/A", "description-methods.design.question2a": "Exploratory mediation analyses (all between-participant, continuous variables): \n-\tSalivary testosterone\n-\tSalivary vasopressin\n-\tNeural responses in reaction to infant threat\nThe Steroid/Peptide Model state that both T and AVP might be positively associated with protective parenting.

The first two research visits were located either in the Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC) or at the participant\u2019s home, depending on possible MRI contra-indications (i.e. diabetes, neurological diagnosis, metallic foreign objects in participant\u2019s body) and preference of the participant. Between the pretest and posttest, participants received an instruction about the intervention and were asked to use the assigned baby tool, either a baby seat or a baby carrier, for three weeks, for a minimal of six hours per week divided over at least four days. Between the post-test and follow-up, participants could keep the assigned tool and use it as often as they preferred. The study is approved by the Ethics Committees of the Leiden University Medical Centre and of the Department of Education and Child studies at Leiden University. All participants gave informed consent. For the current paper, we focus on the pretest assessment.\n\nThe pretest assessment consisted of at least three parts: 1. Behavioral measurements, including a 10 minute Free play (Witte, De Moor, Van Ijzendoorn, &amp; Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2019), the Auditory Startling Task (AST, Witte et al., 2019), a handgrip force paradigm (Alyousefi-Van Dijk et al., 2019), and the Five Minute Speech Sample (Lotz et al., 2020); 2. Saliva and hair sampling for hormonal measurements; and 3. Questionnaires about e.g. health, medication and current mental state. When the assessment took place in the LUMC, additional neural measurements were taken with (f)MRI and DTI. Following the assessment, participants and partners completed some online questionnaires at home (including the Parental Protection Questionnaire; See Van \u2019t Veer et al., 2019). \n\n\nMeasures\nAuditory Startling task .To observe paternal protective behavior, we applied the Auditory Startling Task (Witte et al., 2019). During the AST, a loud short sound fragment was played \u201cunexpectedly\u201d by a hidden audio installation while the participant was playing with his infant. Participant and infant were playing alone in a separate room while being videotaped. The sound consisted of white noise (80-db) and was programmed for 10 seconds with short breaks. At the end of the sound fragment, the researcher entered the room and apologized for the sound: e.g. \u2018I am sorry for the sound, we had some technical problems\u2019. The purpose of the sound fragment was explained to the participants at the end of the follow-up visit. \nProtective behavior of the participant towards the infant in reaction to the sound fragment, and baby states before and during the sound fragment were coded from the video. The baby state before the sound fragment was coded based on observation of the 30 seconds before the start of the white noise. The baby state during the sound fragment was also coded. Coding of the protective behavior in reaction to the white noise was stopped when the researcher entered the room.\n\nThe coding manual was developed for the current study. Two authors (MBK &amp; AL) watched 10 AST videos and listed the observed protective responses and added other possible protective behaviors in reaction to the auditory stimuli. Subsequently, 10 members of the research team, including MBK and AL, rated these behaviors on protective behavior (1= least protective; 8= most protective). A correlation matrix of these ratings revealed that all r &gt; .80, indicating that in general all raters agreed on rating order. The final coding scheme consists of a 10-point scale, with higher scores reflecting more protective behavior, see Table 1 for an overview. The coding scheme for baby states before and during noise was adapted from Mah, Bakermans-Kranenburg, Van Ijzendoorn, &amp; Smith (2015) and consists of a 5-point scale: 1. Drowsy or asleep, 2. Quiet, 3. Alert, 4. Startled, 5. Fussing, 6. Distressed. When various states or responses were observed, the highest rating corresponding to these responses was assigned\nFive raters were trained by one of the authors (AL). Interrater reliability was assessed based on a total of 20 videos. A first set of ten videos was scored directly after the training. A second set of ten videos was coded after all raters coded several videos independently. All raters obtained good inter rater reliability (Single measures absolute agreement, Parental protection ICC &gt; .84, Baby state before noise ICC &gt; .67, Baby state during noise ICC &gt; .75). \n\nfMRI protection task. To examine the possible neural basis for paternal protection, fathers participated in an fMRI task that was adapted from Van \u2018t Veer et al. (2019). In the current protection task, as described in Witte et al. (2019), participants watched videos while lying in an MRI scanner. The videos depicted either a scenario in which an infant was in a threatening situation, or a matched neutral video in which there was no threat to the infant. During the task, participants watched 12 different video pairs (see table 2. for a description of the videos). The videos (that will be made available upon request) were filmed using a gender-neutral lifelike baby doll. Fathers were instructed to imagine that the infant in the videos was their own infant. To ease the task of imagining their own infant in the videos, a picture of their infant was shown during the task. Moreover, the presentation of the doll\u2019s face and the faces of the actors in the videos was minimized.\nEach video, 12 threatening videos and 12 matched neutral videos, was shown twice to each participant, resulting in a total of 48 videos. The duration of each video was 6 seconds. The videos were shown in one of four pre-programmed semi-random orders. The order was selected based on participant identification number (1 assigned to order 1, 4 to order 4, 5 to order 1, etc.). For each order, it was ensured that videos were equally distributed across the task: 12 neutral and 12 threatening videos were presented during the first half of the task as well as the second half of the task. To maximize the power of the design, inter stimulus interval (ISI) between videos was sampled using the web-based tool Neurodesign (Durnez, Blair, &amp; Poldrack, 2017). Videos were separated by an ISI of variable length ranging from 3.0 \u2013 8.0 seconds, with a mean ISI of 4.5 seconds. The task was programmed in E-Prime software (version 2.0; Psychology Software Tools, Inc., PA, USA).\n\nPrior to the first assessment, participants were asked to send a picture of their own child. Each photo was edited in Adobe Photoshop CS by adding a black-face contour to remove ears and most of the hair, and a black background. To ensure that all images contain approximately the same pixel ratio between the black background and face, images were resized so that face length was set on 10 cm. Finally, a selection of the picture containing the face was copied to a new black image of 640*480 pixels. Participants were familiarized to the edited image and task design during a practice task prior to the MRI scan session, while viewing videos that were not included in the real task. At the onset of the real task, an edited picture of participants own infant was shown with a written instruction to imagine that their own infant is displayed in the succeeding videos. The instruction and edited picture were shown again after each eight videos (thus six times in total). After a stimulus interval of 250 milliseconds, the instruction screen advanced to one of the four pre-programmed semi-random order of 48 videos as described above. \n\nfMRI parameters. MRI scanning was performed on a 3\u202fT Philips Achieva TXMRI system (Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands). For registration purposes, a T1-weighted anatomical scan was acquired (repetition time (TR)=\u202f7.90\u202fms, echo time (TE)\u202f=\u202f 3.50\u202fms, flip angle\u202f=\u202f8\u00b0, 155 transverse slices, ACQ voxel size 1.1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.1 mm). The fMRI-task utilized a gradient-echo blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) echo-planar imaging sequence with: TR\u202f=\u202f2200\u202fms, TE\u202f=\u202f30\u202fms, flip angle\u202f=\u202f80\u00b0, 38 transverse slices, and ACQ voxel size of 2.75\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.75\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.75\u202fmm (including a default interslice gap). The duration of the fMRI paradigm was 10 min 53\u202fs (290 volumes). Fieldmap corrections were performed using a multi-acquisition B0 map, performed directly after the end of the fMRI protection task. \n\nParental Protection Questionnaire. To measure father\u2019s protective behavior towards the child in daily life, fathers and partners were asked to fill in the Parental Protection Questionnaire (PPQ, see Van \u2018t Veer et al. (2019) for a prenatal version of this questionnaire) after each assessment. The partners reported on the participants\u2019 protective behavior as well. The current questionnaire contains 12 items that had to be scored on the prevalence during the past month (1= never, 2= seldom, 3= sometimes, 4= often or always, 5= not applicable). Examples of questions are: \u2018I made sure that the baby\u2019s diaper was changed in time\u2019, or \u2018I made sure that the living room was safe for the baby\u2019. Using an exploratory factor analysis on participants\u2019 data, items loading &gt;.40 on the factor explaining the most of the variance will be selected to calculate the mean score for both participant and partner.\n\nSalivary vasopressin/testosterone. Salivary samples were obtained at the beginning of each assessment. Participants were instructed not to consume any alcoholic drinks or have excessive physical exercise during the last 24 hours prior to each assessment. Furthermore, participants were asked not to drink any caffeine containing drinks on the day of the assessment, and not to smoke, chew gum, eat or drink (except for water) 30 minutes before the start of the appointment. Just before sampling participants rinsed their mouth with water. All samples were stored as soon as possible at -20 \u02daC. Saliva collected at home were placed on ice for transportation. \n\nTestosterone. Participants drool approximately 1.5 ml saliva into a 2 ml cryogenic vial (SalivaBio, Salimetrics), either directly into the vial or indirectly using a saliva collection aid (Saliva Bio, Salimetrics). Before drooling, participants were asked to swallow once and to slightly bent forward. To stimulate saliva production, participants were recommended to think about something sweet or sour, to move their jaws up and down, or to look at pictures of food that were provided. Testosterone was quantified at Dresden LabService GmbH (Germany) by Luminscence enzyme immunoassay (IBL International GMBH). Fifty \u00b5L of each sample was used for the immunoassay. The limit of detection was 1.8 pg/mL. Samples used for the current article were quantified in the same assay run (12 plates in total). Duplicate analyses was performed for a random selection of 30% of the samples. Inter-assay variability was 10% and intra-assay variability was 5.22%. Cross-reactivity with other substances tested &lt; 0.01 %.\n\nVasopressin. Participants chewed on a cotton swab (Salivette, Sarstedt) for 60 seconds. Saliva for the quantification of OT and AVP was collected using salivettes (Sarstedt). Participants were instructed to chew lightly on a cotton swab for 60 seconds and move the swab around in their mouth every now and then to boost saliva collection. Researchers kept track of the time using a stopwatch. Oxytocin and vasopressin were quantified by radioimunnoassay at RIAgnosis (Sinzing, Germany). Salivettes were centrifuged at 4 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes with ca. 5000 g centrifugal force, after which 0.6 ml of saliva was pipetted into a vial (0.3 ml for the analysis of OT and 0.3 ml for the analysis of AVP). Both for OT and AVP and the detection limit was 0.1 pg/ml. All pre-test samples were analyzed simultaneously in the same assay run. Intra-assay variability was &lt; 10%. There is no significant cross-reactivity with other neuropeptides (&lt; 0.7%). \n\n", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question1c": "Preprocessing of AST\nIt will be checked whether data for the three scales (protective response, baby state before noise and baby state during noise) is normally distributed and whether outliers are present in the data.

Firstly, Dicom scans collected during the fMRI protection task were converted to .nifti and .json files via the dcm2niix converter. Subsequently, the .nifti files and corresponding stimulus data were checked via the BIDS validator. \n\nfMRI \u2013 step 2. Preprocessing is performed using fMRIPrep (version \u22651.5.2 (Esteban, Markiewicz, et al. (2018); Esteban, Blair, et al. (2018); RRID:SCR_016216)), which is based on Nipype 1.3.1 (Gorgolewski et al. (2011); Gorgolewski et al. (2018); RRID:SCR_002502).\nAnatomical data preprocessing. T1-weighted (T1w) images were corrected for intensity non-uniformity (INU) with N4BiasFieldCorrection,(Tustison et al. 2010), distributed with ANTs 2.2.0 (Avants et al. 2008, RRID:SCR_004757). The T1w-reference was then skull-stripped with Nipype implementation of the antsBrainExtraction.sh workflow (from ANTs), using OASIS30ANTs as target template. Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white-matter (WM) and gray-matter (GM) was performed on the brain-extracted T1w using fast (FSL 5.0.9, RRID:SCR_002823, Zhang, Brady, and Smith 2001). A T1w-reference map was computed after registration of T1w images (after INU-correction) using mri_robust_template (FreeSurfer 6.0.1, Reuter, Rosas, and Fischl 2010). Brain surfaces were reconstructed using recon-all (FreeSurfer 6.0.1, RRID:SCR_001847, Dale, Fischl, and Sereno 1999), and the brain mask estimated previously was refined with a custom variation of the method to reconcile ANTs-derived and FreeSurfer-derived segmentations of the cortical gray-matter of Mindboggle (RRID:SCR_002438, Klein et al. 2017). Volume-based spatial normalization to two standard spaces (MNI152NLin2009cAsym, MNI152NLin6Asym) was performed through nonlinear registration with antsRegistration (ANTs 2.2.0), using brain-extracted versions of both T1w reference and the T1w template. The following templates were selected for spatial normalization: ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template version 2009c [Fonov et al. (2009), RRID:SCR_008796; TemplateFlow ID: MNI152NLin2009cAsym], FSL\u2019s MNI ICBM 152 non-linear 6th Generation Asymmetric Average Brain Stereotaxic Registration Model [Evans et al. (2012), RRID:SCR_002823; TemplateFlow ID: MNI152NLin6Asym].\nFunctional data preprocessing. For each BOLD run, the following preprocessing was performed. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. A deformation field to correct for susceptibility distortions was estimated based on fMRIPrep\u2019s fieldmap-less approach. The deformation field is that resulting from co-registering the BOLD reference to the same-subject T1w-reference with its intensity inverted (Wang et al. 2017; Huntenburg 2014). Registration is performed with antsRegistration (ANTs 2.2.0), and the process regularized by constraining deformation to be nonzero only along the phase-encoding direction, and modulated with an average fieldmap template (Treiber et al. 2016). Based on the estimated susceptibility distortion, an unwarped BOLD reference was calculated for a more accurate co-registration with the anatomical reference. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using bbregister (FreeSurfer) which implements boundary-based registration (Greve and Fischl 2009). Co-registration was configured with six degrees of freedom. Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using mcflirt (FSL 5.0.9, Jenkinson et al. 2002). BOLD runs were slice-time corrected using 3dTshift from AFNI 20160207 (Cox and Hyde 1997, RRID:SCR_005927). The BOLD time-series, were resampled to surfaces on the following spaces: fsaverage6. The BOLD time-series (including slice-timing correction when applied) were resampled onto their original, native space by applying a single, composite transform to correct for head-motion and susceptibility distortions. These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as preprocessed BOLD in original space, or just preprocessed BOLD. The BOLD time-series were resampled into several standard spaces, correspondingly generating the following spatially-normalized, preprocessed BOLD runs: MNI152NLin2009cAsym, MNI152NLin6Asym. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. Automatic removal of motion artifacts using independent component analysis (ICA-AROMA, Pruim et al. 2015) was performed on the preprocessed BOLD on MNI space time-series after removal of non-steady state volumes and spatial smoothing with an isotropic, Gaussian kernel of 6mm FWHM (full-width half-maximum). Corresponding \u201cnon-aggresively\u201d denoised runs were produced after such smoothing. Additionally, the \u201caggressive\u201d noise-regressors were collected and placed in the corresponding confounds file. Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the preprocessed BOLD: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS and three region-wise global signals. FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run, both using their implementations in Nipype (following the definitions by Power et al. 2014). The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and the whole-brain masks. Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to allow for component-based noise correction (CompCor, Behzadi et al. 2007). Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the preprocessed BOLD time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with 128s cut-off) for the two CompCor variants: temporal (tCompCor) and anatomical (aCompCor). tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 5% variable voxels within a mask covering the subcortical regions. This subcortical mask is obtained by heavily eroding the brain mask, which ensures it does not include cortical GM regions. For aCompCor, components are calculated within the intersection of the aforementioned mask and the union of CSF and WM masks calculated in T1w space, after their projection to the native space of each functional run (using the inverse BOLD-to-T1w transformation). Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks. For each CompCor decomposition, the k components with the largest singular values are retained, such that the retained components\u2019 time series are sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance across the nuisance mask (CSF, WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components are dropped from consideration. The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also placed within the corresponding confounds file. The confound time series derived from head motion estimates and global signals were expanded with the inclusion of temporal derivatives and quadratic terms for each (Satterthwaite et al. 2013). Frames that exceeded a threshold of 0.5 mm FD or 1.5 standardised DVARS were annotated as motion outliers. All resamplings can be performed with a single interpolation step by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e. head-motion transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available, and co-registrations to anatomical and output spaces). Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using antsApplyTransforms (ANTs), configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing effects of other kernels (Lanczos 1964). Non-gridded (surface) resamplings were performed using mri_vol2surf (FreeSurfer).\n\nIn FSL's FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool), spatial smoothing will be done using a Gaussian kernel with a full-width-at-half-maximum of 5 mm. High-pass filter cutoff will be set at 90 s.\n\nfMRI \u2013 step 3. Statistical analyses: \n1.\tFirst level analyses of the participant for the contrast threatening videos vs. neutral videos using FEAT. Threat and neutral videos as well as the instruction picture of own child will be modeled separately as a square-wave function. Each predictor will be convolved with a double gamma hemodynamic response function. Temporal derivatives will be added to the model and the contrast threat versus neutral will be assessed.\n2.\tAll first-level contrast images and the corresponding variance images will be submitted to second level mixed-effects group whole brain analyses. Group level analysis will be performed using FEAT to detect average activation for the contrast threat vs. neutral and the reverse contrast. Statistical maps will be thresholded using clusters determined by Z\u202f&gt;\u202f3.1 and a cluster corrected significance threshold of p\u202f&lt;\u202f.05. When no significant effects are observed for this threshold, the threshold will be lowered to Z &gt; 2.3. Using the COPES resulting from the positive threat vs neutral contrast, masks will be created and used as the input for a featquery extracting the individual Z mean values for all significant clusters. \n3.\tThese individual Z values will be used for further confirmatory and exploratory analyses.  \n", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question2c": "Confirmatory\n1.\tPearson (or Spearman in case transformation of variables does not result in normally distributed variables) correlation will be calculated to examine the associations between participants\u2019 observed protective behavior and reported protective behavior (partner- and self-report).

T1-weighted (T1w) images were corrected for intensity non-uniformity (INU) with N4BiasFieldCorrection,(Tustison et al. 2010), distributed with ANTs 2.2.0 (Avants et al. 2008, RRID:SCR_004757).

The following templates were selected for spatial normalization: ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template version 2009c [Fonov et al. (2009), RRID:SCR_008796; TemplateFlow ID: MNI152NLin2009cAsym], FSL\u2019s MNI ICBM 152 non-linear 6th Generation Asymmetric Average Brain Stereotaxic Registration Model [Evans et al.

For aCompCor, components are calculated within the intersection of the aforementioned mask and the union of CSF and WM masks calculated in T1w space, after their projection to the native space of each functional run (using the inverse BOLD-to-T1w transformation). Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks.

Non-gridded (surface) resamplings were performed using mri_vol2surf (FreeSurfer).\n\nIn FSL's FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool), spatial smoothing will be done using a Gaussian kernel with a full-width-at-half-maximum of 5 mm.

A meta-analysis on the association between parenting behavior and T levels in fathers showed a combined effect size of Hedges\u2019 g = 0.14, equivalent to r = .07 (Meijer et al., 2019). With our sample size, a combined effect size of r = .07 results in a power of .09 (at an alpha level of .05). However, the meta-analysis included studies with a broad range of parenting-related measures, and their relevance to parental protection is unclear. Hardly any study on protective parenting is available. It is thus difficult to estimate the power achieved with our sample size accurately. When taking into account the only effect size related to protective parenting (r = .46, Alyousefi- Van Dijk et al., 2019), power would be &gt; .90, but this was a study with a small sample size and the confidence interval (CI) of the effect size is (.08, .72). We can, as an alternative, determine what effect sizes we can detect in our sample. This is necessary for those associations between neural, behavioral and hormonal measurements for which no effect sizes can be derived from the literature, and thus are more exploratory. Therefore, we computed what effects we can detect as significant with our sample. Power value was set at .80, alpha at .05, resulting in detectable effect sizes of r = .31. This effect size is larger than what we consider the smallest effect size of interest (SESOI, Lakens, Scheel, &amp; Isager, 2018). We suggest that effect sizes r \u2265 .08 are of interest for further study and replication, as this is the lower end of the CI around the effect size of the aforementioned study (determination of SESOI as suggested by Perugini, Gallucci, &amp; Costantini, 2014, although ideally this should be based on the CI of a meta-analytic effect size of pertinent studies).", "description-methods.planned-sample.question7b": "The inclusion of participants was ended half December 2019.

Preprocessing is performed using fMRIPrep (version \u22651.5.2 (Esteban, Markiewicz, et al. (2018); Esteban, Blair, et al. (2018); RRID:SCR_016216)), which is based on Nipype 1.3.1 (Gorgolewski et al. (2011); Gorgolewski et al. (2018); RRID:SCR_002502).\nAnatomical data preprocessing. T1-weighted (T1w) images were corrected for intensity non-uniformity (INU) with N4BiasFieldCorrection,(Tustison et al. 2010), distributed with ANTs 2.2.0 (Avants et al. 2008, RRID:SCR_004757). The T1w-reference was then skull-stripped with Nipype implementation of the antsBrainExtraction.sh workflow (from ANTs), using OASIS30ANTs as target template. Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white-matter (WM) and gray-matter (GM) was performed on the brain-extracted T1w using fast (FSL 5.0.9, RRID:SCR_002823, Zhang, Brady, and Smith 2001). A T1w-reference map was computed after registration of T1w images (after INU-correction) using mri_robust_template (FreeSurfer 6.0.1, Reuter, Rosas, and Fischl 2010). Brain surfaces were reconstructed using recon-all (FreeSurfer 6.0.1, RRID:SCR_001847, Dale, Fischl, and Sereno 1999), and the brain mask estimated previously was refined with a custom variation of the method to reconcile ANTs-derived and FreeSurfer-derived segmentations of the cortical gray-matter of Mindboggle (RRID:SCR_002438, Klein et al. 2017). Volume-based spatial normalization to two standard spaces (MNI152NLin2009cAsym, MNI152NLin6Asym) was performed through nonlinear registration with antsRegistration (ANTs 2.2.0), using brain-extracted versions of both T1w reference and the T1w template. The following templates were selected for spatial normalization: ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template version 2009c [Fonov et al. (2009), RRID:SCR_008796; TemplateFlow ID: MNI152NLin2009cAsym], FSL\u2019s MNI ICBM 152 non-linear 6th Generation Asymmetric Average Brain Stereotaxic Registration Model [Evans et al. (2012), RRID:SCR_002823; TemplateFlow ID: MNI152NLin6Asym].\nFunctional data preprocessing. For each BOLD run, the following preprocessing was performed. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. A deformation field to correct for susceptibility distortions was estimated based on fMRIPrep\u2019s fieldmap-less approach. The deformation field is that resulting from co-registering the BOLD reference to the same-subject T1w-reference with its intensity inverted (Wang et al. 2017; Huntenburg 2014). Registration is performed with antsRegistration (ANTs 2.2.0), and the process regularized by constraining deformation to be nonzero only along the phase-encoding direction, and modulated with an average fieldmap template (Treiber et al. 2016). Based on the estimated susceptibility distortion, an unwarped BOLD reference was calculated for a more accurate co-registration with the anatomical reference. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using bbregister (FreeSurfer) which implements boundary-based registration (Greve and Fischl 2009). Co-registration was configured with six degrees of freedom. Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using mcflirt (FSL 5.0.9, Jenkinson et al. 2002). BOLD runs were slice-time corrected using 3dTshift from AFNI 20160207 (Cox and Hyde 1997, RRID:SCR_005927). The BOLD time-series, were resampled to surfaces on the following spaces: fsaverage6. The BOLD time-series (including slice-timing correction when applied) were resampled onto their original, native space by applying a single, composite transform to correct for head-motion and susceptibility distortions. These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as preprocessed BOLD in original space, or just preprocessed BOLD. The BOLD time-series were resampled into several standard spaces, correspondingly generating the following spatially-normalized, preprocessed BOLD runs: MNI152NLin2009cAsym, MNI152NLin6Asym. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. Automatic removal of motion artifacts using independent component analysis (ICA-AROMA, Pruim et al. 2015) was performed on the preprocessed BOLD on MNI space time-series after removal of non-steady state volumes and spatial smoothing with an isotropic, Gaussian kernel of 6mm FWHM (full-width half-maximum). Corresponding \u201cnon-aggresively\u201d denoised runs were produced after such smoothing. Additionally, the \u201caggressive\u201d noise-regressors were collected and placed in the corresponding confounds file. Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the preprocessed BOLD: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS and three region-wise global signals. FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run, both using their implementations in Nipype (following the definitions by Power et al. 2014). The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and the whole-brain masks. Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to allow for component-based noise correction (CompCor, Behzadi et al. 2007). Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the preprocessed BOLD time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with 128s cut-off) for the two CompCor variants: temporal (tCompCor) and anatomical (aCompCor). tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 5% variable voxels within a mask covering the subcortical regions. This subcortical mask is obtained by heavily eroding the brain mask, which ensures it does not include cortical GM regions. For aCompCor, components are calculated within the intersection of the aforementioned mask and the union of CSF and WM masks calculated in T1w space, after their projection to the native space of each functional run (using the inverse BOLD-to-T1w transformation). Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks. For each CompCor decomposition, the k components with the largest singular values are retained, such that the retained components\u2019 time series are sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance across the nuisance mask (CSF, WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components are dropped from consideration. The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also placed within the corresponding confounds file. The confound time series derived from head motion estimates and global signals were expanded with the inclusion of temporal derivatives and quadratic terms for each (Satterthwaite et al. 2013). Frames that exceeded a threshold of 0.5 mm FD or 1.5 standardised DVARS were annotated as motion outliers. All resamplings can be performed with a single interpolation step by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e. head-motion transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available, and co-registrations to anatomical and output spaces). Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using antsApplyTransforms (ANTs), configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing effects of other kernels (Lanczos 1964). Non-gridded (surface) resamplings were performed using mri_vol2surf (FreeSurfer).\n\nIn FSL's FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool), spatial smoothing will be done using a Gaussian kernel with a full-width-at-half-maximum of 5 mm.

This effect is supposed to arise because the stimulus appears more threatening when approaching rather than being static or receding. In this experiment, we aim to replicate this approach-aversion effect in Virtual Reality (VR) while fully considering the multimodality of social interaction. Moreover, if the approach-aversion effect is mediated by threat perception, it should be moderated by group membership of the approaching individual. In a first experiment (https://osf.io/yqdwc), we tested our reasoning with Caucasian vs. Maghrebi virtual characters, a group categorization relevant in the French context. We obtained the approach-aversion effect showing that virtual individuals performing an approach movement are perceived more negatively than those who do not perform any movement, F (1,99) = 30.47, p &lt; .0001, PRE = .24, 95% IC [0.66, 1.41]. However, we did not obtain the expected interaction between movement and group membership, F (1,99) = 0.3, p = 0.587, PRE = .003, 95% IC [-0.15, 0.27]. In a second experiment (https://osf.io/dxkvm), we tested our reasoning with Smiling and Frowning virtual characters. Again, we obtained the approach-aversion effect, F (1,131) = 60.16, p &lt; .0001, PRE = .32, 95% IC [0.90, 1.52]. We also obtained an interaction between movement and facial expression opposite to the one we expected with a more important approach-aversion effect for smiling than frowning virtual individuals, F (1,131) = 11.34, p = .001, PRE = .08, 95% IC [0.14, 0.54]. However, results of these first experiments are limited. First, they confounded approach movement and interpersonal space intrusion. Indeed, while static individuals stood at a distance of 85cm from the participants, approaching ones arrived at a distance of 60 cm from them. Such a distance of 60 cm is below the average distance at which people feel comfortable with other (Iachini, Coello, Frassinetti &amp; Ruggiero, 2014). Second, in the second experiment virtual individuals smiled or frowned and then readopted a neutral expression before approaching participants. This may have created an unusual contrast in the smiling condition and eventually explain the unexpected interaction. That\u2019s why, we conducted a third experiment (https://osf.io/yr85f) to disentangle the effect of approach movement and interpersonal space intrusion in the previously obtained approach-aversion effect while testing the threat explanation with slightly smiling vs. frowning faces. To do that, participants encountered approaching and static individuals in two blocks and we moved participants between the block to control the interpersonal distance across condition. In this experiment, the approach-aversion effect was not significant although descriptively in the expected direction, F (1,113) = 0.25, p = .62, PRE = .00, 95% IC [-0.24, 0.40]. Again, we failed to obtain the interaction between movement and facial expression, F (1,113) = 0.65, p = .42, PRE = .00, 95% IC [-0.16, 0.38] but we obtained a three-way interaction between movement, facial expression and block order, F (1,113) = 104.94, p &lt; .001, PRE = .48, 95% IC [-3.35, -2.26].

Indeed, the approaching movement should be less threatening to participants when they initiate it than when they do not.

This score will take the difference between the harm_max and loss_max.  It will range from 100 to -100.\n\nI will also create a tradeoff score based on subtracting the trade_health from trade_econ.  This approach treats the Likert items as numeric, with equidistant values, which is an assumption of convenience.  The resulting score will range from 6 to -6.", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Several types of models will be used.  The empty models specified here may be substituted with correlation tables.
