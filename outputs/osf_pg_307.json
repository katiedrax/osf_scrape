Outcomes of Bystander Action Scale\n\nAuthors: Blinded for pre-registration \nAffiliation: Blinded for pre-registration\n\nResearch Questions\n\nRQ1: Will the two-factor structure of the General Outcomes of Bystander Action Scale replicate in an independent sample of college students?\n\nRQ2: Will positive consequences longitudinally predict more bystander behavior?\n\nRQ3: Will negative consequences longitudinally predict less bystander behavior? \n\nHypotheses\n\nHypothesis 1: The General Outcomes of Bystander Action Scale will evidence a two-factor structure reflecting the positive consequences and negative consequences subscales.\n\nHypothesis 2: While controlling for bystander behavior at the baseline assessment, positive consequences will predict more bystander behavior at the 2-month follow up. \n\nHypothesis 3: While controlling for bystander behavior at the baseline assessment, negative consequences will predict less bystander behavior at the 2-month follow up.\n\nParticipants and Procedures\n\nThis will be a secondary data analysis, and participants will be selected from a sample of first year undergraduate students (N = 730) who were recruited during the fall semester of 2016 from three universities: two private universities in the Southwest and Midwest and one public university in the Northeast. \n\nData were collected as part of a larger study on the effectiveness of a bystander training program. The institutional review board at the first author\u2019s institution approved all procedures. Students were recruited from required first year courses and were invited to participate within the first two months of school; eligible students included any first year student over the age of 18. Participants completed the baseline assessment in a monitored research lab, dormitory, or university common space. Approximately 2 months after baseline (M = 56.32 days, SD = 9.03 days), students were invited to return to the lab for a follow-up assessment. Of the 730 students who completed the baseline assessment, 664 returned for the 2-month follow-up (90.9% retention). Participants received course credit or a gift card for participation. Baseline sample size and retention rate at each of the universities were as follows: Southwest n = 265, 97.4%; Midwest n = 263, 86.4%; Northeast n = 201, 88.6%.\n\nMeasures\n\nIndependent Variables\n\nBystander consequences. Students rated their experience of positive and negative consequences at baseline using the General Outcomes of Bystander Action Scale (Banyard et al., 2019). Students reported how often they experienced each of the 3 positive consequences items and 5 negative consequences items during the past 2 months on a response scale ranging from 0 to 8+ times. Students who did not engage in bystander behavior were instructed to respond \u201cN/A\u201d to each item (\u201cN/A\u201d responses were recoded as 0). Sample items include \u201cPeople praised me for what I did\u201d (positive consequence) and \u201cI was harassed because of what I did\u201d (negative consequence). Items within the positive subscale and negative subscale were then summed to reflect a composite positive consequences score and negative consequences score; higher scores reflect more consequences in the past 2 months.\n\nDependent Variables\n\nBystander behavior. At baseline and the 2-month follow up, participants completed the 19-item Risky Situations subscale of the Bystander Behavior (For Friends) Scale (BBS; Banyard, Moynihan, Cares, &amp; Warner, 2014), a self-report measure of bystander behavior. Students reported their engagement in each of the 19-items over the past 2-months. We modified the response format such that students indicated whether they had an opportunity to intervene, and, if so, whether they intervened with prosocial bystander behavior. For example, the item \u201cI saw a friend and their partner in a heated argument\u201d included the following response options: (1) \u201cYes, and I asked if everything was ok\u201d (opportunity and bystander behavior); (2) \u201cYes, but I didn\u2019t ask if everything was ok, but there were some good reasons why I didn\u2019t\u201d (opportunity and no bystander behavior); (3) \u201cNo\u201d (no opportunity). For the purpose of the current study, we recoded responses to reflect the original scoring method (described in Banyard et al., 2014). Specifically, items were scored such that opportunity and behavior = 1, and opportunity and no behavior or no opportunity = 0. All 19 items were summed to reflect to total number of different situations in which a student engaged in bystander behavior over the past two months.\n\nData Analyses \n\nTo evaluate our first hypothesis, we will conduct a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using R lavaan (Rosseel, 2012). We will use several model fit indices to evaluate the fit of the 2-factor structure: root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; adequate fit defined as \u2264 ,08), comparative fit index (CFI; adequate fit defined as \u2265 .95), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI; adequate fit defined as \u2265 .95), and root mean square residual (SRMR; adequate fit defined as \u2264 .08) (Hu &amp; Bentler, 1998). \nBased on Banyard and colleagues\u2019 (2019) original procedure, we plan to limit our analytic sample to students who could have experienced a consequence during the study period. Specifically, as experiencing consequences of bystander behavior are contingent upon engaging in bystander behavior, we will exclude participants who reported no bystander behavior at the baseline assessment (n = 234). As our second and third hypotheses involve bystander behavior at the 2-month assessment, we will further exclude participants who reported no opportunities to engage in bystander behavior at the 2-month assessment (n = 138). Bystander behavior is contingent upon experiencing an opportunity to engage in such behavior; for instance, an individual must witness a potentially violent situation in order to engage in bystander behavior to prevent violence. By excluding participants who reported no opportunity to engage in bystander behavior at the 2-month time point, we reduce variability in bystander behavior attributable to variability in opportunities, allowing us to more precisely estimate the relation between consequences and bystander behavior. We will therefore utilize an analytic sample of 357 participants for hypotheses 2 and 3. \n\nTo evaluate hypotheses 2 and 3, we will use Poisson regression with baseline bystander behavior and consequences predicting bystander behavior at the 2-month follow up. Poisson regression is an appropriate alternative to linear regression when the dependent variable represents a count distribution, such as a count of bystander behavior (Famoye &amp; Singh, 2006). As previous research suggests bystander behavior differs by sex (Banyard &amp; Moynihan, 2011), we will include sex as a control variable in each regression. In addition to our main analyses, we will also conduct exploratory analyses to test the interactive effect of positive and negative consequences on future bystander behavior. This will allow us to determine how positive and negative consequences act together in influencing bystander behavior.  \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"summary": "Project working title: When Helping Hurts: Construct and Criterion Validity of the General Outcomes of Bystander Action Scale\n\nAuthors: Blinded for pre-registration \nAffiliation: Blinded for pre-registration\n\nResearch Questions\n\nRQ1: Will the two-factor structure of the General Outcomes of Bystander Action Scale replicate in an independent sample of college students?\n\nRQ2: Will positive consequences longitudinally predict more bystander behavior?\n\nRQ3: Will negative consequences longitudinally predict less bystander behavior? \n\nHypotheses\n\nHypothesis 1: The General Outcomes of Bystander Action Scale will evidence a two-factor structure reflecting the positive consequences and negative consequences subscales.\n\nHypothesis 2: While controlling for bystander behavior at the baseline assessment, positive consequences will predict more bystander behavior at the 2-month follow up. \n\nHypothesis 3: While controlling for bystander behavior at the baseline assessment, negative consequences will predict less bystander behavior at the 2-month follow up.\n\nParticipants and Procedures\n\nThis will be a secondary data analysis, and participants will be selected from a sample of first year undergraduate students (N = 730) who were recruited during the fall semester of 2016 from three universities: two private universities in the Southwest and Midwest and one public university in the Northeast. \n\nData were collected as part of a larger study on the effectiveness of a bystander training program.

Studies also suggest that Asian Americans (AAs) report a stronger sense of ethnic identity and perceive more discrimination (Yasuda &amp; Duan, 2002) than Asian international students (AIs). Thus, we suspect that these groups may use different narrative themes to promote emotional adjustment when reminiscing about an experience of unfair treatment, alienation, or difference based on their ethnic identity. AA (n=106) and AI (n=112) students were asked to narrate an episode of an alienation, difference, or unfair treatment based on their ethnic identity as well as a broad low point in the life story (see McAdams, 1993). Additionally, participants completed self-report measures of the Big Five (BFI-10; Rammstedt &amp; John, 2007), acculturation (AAMAS; Gim Chung, Kim, &amp; Abreu, 2004), resilience (Brief Resilience Scale; Smith et al., 2008), psychological well-being scale (Ryff &amp; Keyes, 1995), cognitive reappraisal (ERQ-10; Gross &amp; John, 2003), and other demographic questions. After generating new themes and coding scheme from an inductive thematic analysis (see Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006) of narratives from the 5 most and 5 least well-adjusted AIs (n=10) and the 5 most and 5 least well-adjusted AAs (n=10), we will compare these new themes in predicting psychological well-being for the entire sample. In a second part of this study, we will conduct exploratory analyses on potential differences between the narratives of unfair treatment, alienation, and difference and the narrative of the low point in the life story.\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Note: We conducted a qualitative thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006) on the 5 highest and 5 lowest scorers on psychological well-being in both the Asian American and Asian international student samples (n=20). In this qualitative analysis, we attempted to identify possible differences between these two groups in order to compare how these two groups achieve psychological well-being through reminiscing about their experiences.\nIn the spirit of qualitative analysis, we did not have any a priori assumptions about what these themes would be or that these themes would, in fact, be distinct from one another. In order to prevent us from seeing differences between these groups based on prior theoretical and empirical work, we were blind to the group identification (AA/AI) and to whether they scored higher or lower on psychological well being. Nevertheless, there is a substantial corpus of research that suggests that redemption figures prominantly in Americans\u2019 narratives (e.g., McAdams, 2013; McAdams &amp; Bowman, 2001), and that redemptive sequences contribute to psychological well-being (McAdams, Reynolds, Lewis, Patten, &amp; Bowman, 2001). Therefore, our qualitative analysis was inductive in the sense that we allowed the data to speak for itself without imposing any preconceptions, but it was also deductive in the sense that our final analysis was theoretically informed by existing research in narrative psychology.\nThrough our qualitative analysis, we initially identified 15 possible themes that seemed to appear frequently: Agency, Identity Affirmation, Questioning, Us vs.\u00a0Them, Abstract or Concrete Other, Internal vs.\u00a0External Processing, Naivete, Factual Elaboration, Interpretive Elaboration, Redemption, Concrete vs.\u00a0Recurring/Temporally Diffused Event, Qualifying, Unfairness, Passivity vs.\u00a0Activity, and Not fitting in vs.\u00a0Not being heard vs.\u00a0Condescension. After a discussion among the first, second, and third authors, the authors decided to code for Agency and Redemption in the entire sample, with the possibility of including additional themes if time allows. The next three themes of greatest theoretical import to us are Contamination, Identity Affirmation, and Identity Questioning.\nHypothesis 1: We expect there to be an interaction between group identification (AA/AI) and redemption, such that within the ethnic identity threat narrative, redemption will positively predict psychological well-being for AAs but negatively predict psychological well-being for AIs.\nHypothesis 2: Within the ethnic identity threat narrative, agency will have a negative curvilinear relationship with psychological well-being for AIs (but not AAs).\nHypothesis 3: Within the ethnic identity threat narrative, identity affirmation will negatively predict psychological well-being for the entire sample, with a stronger effect on international students.\nHypothesis 4: Within the ethnic identity threat narrative, identity questioning will positively predict psychological well-being for the entire sample.\nWe have no strong predictions for contamination."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Other"}, "q6": {"extra": [], "value": ["Personnel who analyze the data collected from the study are not aware of the treatment applied to any given group."]}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": "Narrative coders are blind to the group identity of the participants (Asian American/Asian international), their scores on all outcome measures, and gender.

After generating new themes and coding scheme from an inductive thematic analysis (see Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006) of narratives from the 5 most and 5 least well-adjusted AIs (n=10) and the 5 most and 5 least well-adjusted AAs (n=10), we will compare these new themes in predicting psychological well-being for the entire sample. In a second part of this study, we will conduct exploratory analyses on potential differences between the narratives of unfair treatment, alienation, and difference and the narrative of the low point in the life story.\n", "q4": "Note: We conducted a qualitative thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006) on the 5 highest and 5 lowest scorers on psychological well-being in both the Asian American and Asian international student samples (n=20). In this qualitative analysis, we attempted to identify possible differences between these two groups in order to compare how these two groups achieve psychological well-being through reminiscing about their experiences.\nIn the spirit of qualitative analysis, we did not have any a priori assumptions about what these themes would be or that these themes would, in fact, be distinct from one another. In order to prevent us from seeing differences between these groups based on prior theoretical and empirical work, we were blind to the group identification (AA/AI) and to whether they scored higher or lower on psychological well being. Nevertheless, there is a substantial corpus of research that suggests that redemption figures prominantly in Americans\u2019 narratives (e.g., McAdams, 2013; McAdams &amp; Bowman, 2001), and that redemptive sequences contribute to psychological well-being (McAdams, Reynolds, Lewis, Patten, &amp; Bowman, 2001). Therefore, our qualitative analysis was inductive in the sense that we allowed the data to speak for itself without imposing any preconceptions, but it was also deductive in the sense that our final analysis was theoretically informed by existing research in narrative psychology.\nThrough our qualitative analysis, we initially identified 15 possible themes that seemed to appear frequently: Agency, Identity Affirmation, Questioning, Us vs.\u00a0Them, Abstract or Concrete Other, Internal vs.\u00a0External Processing, Naivete, Factual Elaboration, Interpretive Elaboration, Redemption, Concrete vs.\u00a0Recurring/Temporally Diffused Event, Qualifying, Unfairness, Passivity vs.\u00a0Activity, and Not fitting in vs.\u00a0Not being heard vs.\u00a0Condescension. After a discussion among the first, second, and third authors, the authors decided to code for Agency and Redemption in the entire sample, with the possibility of including additional themes if time allows. The next three themes of greatest theoretical import to us are Contamination, Identity Affirmation, and Identity Questioning.\nHypothesis 1: We expect there to be an interaction between group identification (AA/AI) and redemption, such that within the ethnic identity threat narrative, redemption will positively predict psychological well-being for AAs but negatively predict psychological well-being for AIs.\nHypothesis 2: Within the ethnic identity threat narrative, agency will have a negative curvilinear relationship with psychological well-being for AIs (but not AAs).\nHypothesis 3: Within the ethnic identity threat narrative, identity affirmation will negatively predict psychological well-being for the entire sample, with a stronger effect on international students.\nHypothesis 4: Within the ethnic identity threat narrative, identity questioning will positively predict psychological well-being for the entire sample.\nWe have no strong predictions for contamination.", "q5": "Other", "q6": ["Personnel who analyze the data collected from the study are not aware of the treatment applied to any given group."], "q7": "Narrative coders are blind to the group identity of the participants (Asian American/Asian international), their scores on all outcome measures, and gender.

We will use a coding scheme adapted from Grysman, Fivush, Merrill, and Graci (2016).

Finally, participants who are 1) younger than 18 or 2) older than 25 or 3) not students (undergraduate or graduate) at Duke University will be excluded from the analysis.\n", "q23": "If a subject does not report a narrative for redemption, they will be excluded from the narrative coding.\nIf a participant provided the same response for all the scale items in a certain scale, the data for that scale will be treated as missing data, with the exception of the PCL (PTSD) scale, as PTSD is not particularly an expected outcome of this event.
