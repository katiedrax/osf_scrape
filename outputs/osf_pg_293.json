interest since the Second World War. Prominent articles have suggested a relationship between so-called authoritarian predisposition, as measured by child-rearing attitudes, and measures of manifest authoritarianism. This relationship is though to be moderated by a construct called normative threat, or a threat to the cohesion, unity, or success of an in-group. The relationship between authoritarian predisposition and manifest authoritarianism remains key to the modern sociological paradigm of authoritarianism; the psychological mechanism by which normative threat activates authoritarianism, however, has not been explored. We test the efficacy of self-esteem and a construct we defined as self-world fit as moderators of the relationship between authoritarian disposition and manifest authoritarian attitude.
