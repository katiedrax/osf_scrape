"value": "Jonathan Silas, Alexander Jones, Lola Zao-Sanders"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "To date, ample evidence exists describing the correlation between brain oscillations and cognitive functions, see Basar et al. (2001) for a comprehensive review. However, whether these oscillations have a causal role in mental processing or are simply epiphenomenal in their nature, remains undetermined. If cortical oscillations play a causal role in cognition, then an effect on any particular cognitive function should be observed when interfering with the oscillations underlying that function (Sejnowski &amp; Paulsen, 2006). In this study, we propose a transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) protocol to investigate the neural correlates of perspective-taking. In particular, we aim to determine whether Mu oscillations (~10Hz) in healthy adults play a role in embodied cognition as measured by performance in a perspective-taking task.\n\nMu desynchronisation has been observed in action observation, voluntary movement and somatosensory stimulation (Frenkel-Toledo et al, 2013; Canon et al, 2014). Although mu suppression has been linked to self-referential processing underlying embodied cognition, the precise role of central mu rhythms in facilitating self-referential processing remains unknown. This pre-registered investigation seeks to better understand the functional role of these rhythms in third-person perspective-taking. By applying tACS to the sensorimotor cortex, we aim to modulate mu activity whilst measuring the participants\u2019 performance on a perspective-taking task. \n\nA recent study by Conson et al. (2015) investigated third-person perspective-taking and attributed faster rotation of back facing human figures, compared to front-facing ones, to an embodied processes in neurotypicals. \n\nThe main purpose of this experiment is to test whether inhibiting mu suppression over the sensorimotor cortex will have an effect on embodied simulation performance in a neurotypical population and whether an interaction can be observed between stimulation frequency and stimuli facing direction as a result of mu modulation. \n\nAll participants will be required to complete an online Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) test. The AQ has the potential to classify three groups of people (low, average, and high degree of autistic traits)  (Lundqvist &amp; Lindner, 2017). The AQ scores will be correlated with the two groups' mean reaction times for front and back-facing stimuli. Although this study focuses on a neurotypical population we aim to establish whether a relationship exists between the degree of autistic traits and the capacity for embodied cognition. We approach this by using a continuous measure of autistic traits and assuming that ASD is a dimensional construct (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001).\n\nIn addition, this study sets out to explore whether sex differences between the participant and the stimuli have an effect on how readily the participants shift their perspective. There are well-documented sex differences in mu desynchronisation during simulation (Silas et al., 2010; 2012) and familiarity with stimulus has also been shown to modulate simulation cortical networks (Calvo-Merino et al., 2005; 2006).

(2001) for a comprehensive review. However, whether these oscillations have a causal role in mental processing or are simply epiphenomenal in their nature, remains undetermined. If cortical oscillations play a causal role in cognition, then an effect on any particular cognitive function should be observed when interfering with the oscillations underlying that function (Sejnowski &amp; Paulsen, 2006). In this study, we propose a transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) protocol to investigate the neural correlates of perspective-taking. In particular, we aim to determine whether Mu oscillations (~10Hz) in healthy adults play a role in embodied cognition as measured by performance in a perspective-taking task.\n\nMu desynchronisation has been observed in action observation, voluntary movement and somatosensory stimulation (Frenkel-Toledo et al, 2013; Canon et al, 2014). Although mu suppression has been linked to self-referential processing underlying embodied cognition, the precise role of central mu rhythms in facilitating self-referential processing remains unknown. This pre-registered investigation seeks to better understand the functional role of these rhythms in third-person perspective-taking. By applying tACS to the sensorimotor cortex, we aim to modulate mu activity whilst measuring the participants\u2019 performance on a perspective-taking task. \n\nA recent study by Conson et al. (2015) investigated third-person perspective-taking and attributed faster rotation of back facing human figures, compared to front-facing ones, to an embodied processes in neurotypicals. \n\nThe main purpose of this experiment is to test whether inhibiting mu suppression over the sensorimotor cortex will have an effect on embodied simulation performance in a neurotypical population and whether an interaction can be observed between stimulation frequency and stimuli facing direction as a result of mu modulation. \n\nAll participants will be required to complete an online Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) test. The AQ has the potential to classify three groups of people (low, average, and high degree of autistic traits)  (Lundqvist &amp; Lindner, 2017). The AQ scores will be correlated with the two groups' mean reaction times for front and back-facing stimuli. Although this study focuses on a neurotypical population we aim to establish whether a relationship exists between the degree of autistic traits and the capacity for embodied cognition. We approach this by using a continuous measure of autistic traits and assuming that ASD is a dimensional construct (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001).\n\nIn addition, this study sets out to explore whether sex differences between the participant and the stimuli have an effect on how readily the participants shift their perspective. There are well-documented sex differences in mu desynchronisation during simulation (Silas et al., 2010; 2012) and familiarity with stimulus has also been shown to modulate simulation cortical networks (Calvo-Merino et al., 2005; 2006).

The specific comparisons we intend to make are numbered to correspond with the numbering of the hypotheses in the study information section: \n\n1. Main effect of stimulation frequency with 10Hz stimulation resulting in slower RTs compared to 5.5Hz stimulation. \n\n2. Main effect of facing direction with faster RTs for back-facing stimuli compared to front-facing stimuli.\n\n3. Main effect of orientation - the degree of stimuli rotation will have an effect on RTs with faster RTs at 0\u1d52 compared to all other orientations. If a significant main effect is found, pairwise t-tests will be conducted between pairs of rotation angles.\n\n4. Interaction between Facing Direction and Stimulation Frequency - we expect to find a smaller difference in RTs between front- and back-facing stimuli in 10Hz stimulation group compared to 5.5Hz condition. If a significant interaction effect is found, follow up analysis will include pairwise t-test between 10Hz and 5.5Hz groups of the mean difference in RTs between front- and back-facing stimuli. \n\n5. Interaction between Sex and Facing Direction \u2013 we expect to find a greater difference in  RTs of back minus front-facing stimuli in the matched condition compared to mismatched.  If a significant interaction effect is found, follow up analysis will include pairwise t-test between mean RTs of congruent and incongruent conditions. \n\n6. Interaction between Sex, Facing Direction and Stimulation \u2013 we expect to find no greater difference between RTs of congruent conditions in 10Hz compared to 5.5Hz. \nFollow up analyses will include two 2x2 ANOVAs of Sex and Facing Direction, separately for 10Hz and 5.5Hz. We expect to find a significant interaction in 10Hz and not in 5.5Hz. In 10Hz, the 2x2 interaction will be followed up by a pairwise t-test between the front minus back differences in RTs of congruent and incongruent conditions. \n\n7. Interaction between AQ score and facing direction - we expect to find slower reaction times for back-facing stimuli and a smaller difference between back and front-facing stimuli RTs across both groups associated with higher AQ scores. However, it should be noted that our participants are assumed to be neurotypical and therefore not much variability in AQ scores is anticipated. \n\n8. A Correlation between AQ score and RTs - AQ scores will have an effect on RTs. We expect to find a smaller difference in RTs between front and back facing-stimuli as the AQ score increases. Separate to the factorial design we will measure the correlation between AQ scores and front-back RTs for each individual group and across both groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "q19.uploader": [{"file_id":
