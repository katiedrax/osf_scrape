of genetic or neuroimaging data in order to facilitate the understanding of healthy or disordered brain structure and function. Within the network, individual working groups focus on specific disorders, syndromes or methods. Often, a working group will aim to recruit as many originals projects, researchers and datasets relevant to it\u2019s topic, provide a standardized ENIGMA analysis pipeline for (re-)analysis of the original data, and integrate the results of the original groups into one, final analysis. Thompson et al. (preprint) provides an extensive overview on ENIGMA. \n\nWithin this network and the ENIGMA-Anxiety working group, the ENIGMA-Specific Phobia (SP) project targets the neuroanatomy of SP in children and adults. Up to now, data from 32 individual research projects from around the globe have been contributed, with a total n = 1.325 for SP subjects and n = 3.212 for healthy controls. The number of SP subjects is expected to rise to n &gt; 1.500 once all sites contributed their data. All contributors provide structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images from subjects with SP, overwhelmingly with additional healthy comparison subjects. \n\nThe ENIGMA-Specific Phobia project will compare subcortical volumes, cortical thickness and cortical surface area between SP and healthy comparison subjects. In addition, we will examine a potential influence of phobia subtype (such as animal phobia, blood-injection-injury phobia) on brain morphometry and associations with symptom severity and depressive symptomatology. Previous studies investigating alterations in structural brain anatomy of SP are scarce.

Thompson et al.

Loneliness is often associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms and childhood maltreatment. Therefore, depressive symptoms were measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996), social anxiety was assessed using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scores (LSAS; Rytwinski et al., 2009), and childhood maltreatment was measured by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; Bernstein et al., 1994). To examine whether group effects (main effects of group or interactions with group) might be driven by these potential confounders, mediation and moderation analyses will be carried out using the PROCESS macro v3.4 for SPSS (Hayes, 2017). Further moderation analyses will be conducted to examine potential effects of sex.\n\nTo further characterize the response to positive social interactions, changes in salivary oxytocin, cortisol, neurokinin B, and immunoglobulin A triggered by the positive social interaction with the experimenter will be analyzed using mixed ANOVAs.\n\n\nFurther behavioral data were collected for exploratory purposes. Group differences will be analyzed regarding temporal discounting as a measurement for the ability to control impulsive preferences. The task included 36 trials in which participants chose between smaller-sooner or larger-later rewards. The smaller-sooner rewards were pseudorandomly drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 45 \u20ac and a standard deviation of 15 \u20ac. The larger-later rewards were 0.5-75% larger than the presented smaller-sooner reward. Smaller-sooner rewards were immediately available and paired with delayed (two and four weeks) larger-later rewards in half of the trials. In a second condition, smaller-sooner rewards were available in two weeks and paired with a larger-later option available in four or six weeks. The order of trials was randomized across participants and implemented in Presentation  (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA, USA). The proportion of larger-later choices will be used as estimate for temporal discounting.\n\nFurthermore, group differences in emotion recognition and mentalization will be assessed using the revised version of the \u201cReading the Mind in the Eyes\u201d test (Baron\u2010Cohen, Wheelwright, Hill, Raste, &amp; Plumb, 2001) implemented in Presentation  (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA, USA) and an adaptive emotion recognition task implemented in Matlab (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA). Three female actors from the Karolinska face database (Lundqvist, Flykt, &amp; \u00d6hman, 1998) served as neutral stimuli. Facial expressions were morphed into fearful, happy, disgusted, and angry expressions in increments of 5 % change using Abrosoft FantaMorph 5. Stimuli were presented for 242 ms in 12 trials per emotion and actor. During the task, participants were instructed to indicate the perceived emotion (\u201cneutral\u201d, \u201cfearful\u201d, \u201chappy\u201d, \u201cdisgusted\u201d, \u201cangry\u201d, \u201cnot sure\u201d) without receiving feedback about the accuracy of their decision. A Bayesian adaptive procedure (\"QUEST\"; A. B. Watson &amp; Pelli, 1983) was used to determine the stimulus presentation and to estimate individual emotion thresholds. Stimuli with an emotion intensity of half the current threshold were presented in 25 % of the trials. Fifty percent of the stimuli were chosen such that the intensity was at the current threshold. Another 25 % of the stimuli had the maximum emotion intensity. A fixation cross was shown for 292 ms between the emotion recognition judgment and the next presentation of a face stimulus. \n\nFinally, we will analyze group differences in functional connectivity. Resting state data were acquired using a T2*-weighted echoplanar (EPI) sequence (TR = 2690 ms, TE = 30 ms, ascending slicing, matrix size: 96 x 96, voxel size: 2 x 2 x 3 mm\u00b3, slice thickness = 3.0 mm, distance factor = 10 %, FoV = 192 mm, flip angle 90\u00b0, 41 axial slices). Resting state functional connectivity will be analyzed using the CONN toolbox (www.nitrc.org/projects/conn, RRID:SCR_009550; Whitfield-Gabrieli &amp; Nieto-Castanon, 2012). In addition, a generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analysis will be conducted for brain regions showing significant effects during the fMRI trust game and social gambling task and again performed using the CONN toolbox. \n\nA blood sample was collected to assess group differences in clinically established immune parameters.\n"}, "sample": {"extra": [], "value": "We used G*Power 3 to conduct an a-priori power analysis for the project based on the effect size obtained in an fMRI study investigating the neural processing of social stimuli as a function of perceived social isolation (Cacioppo, Norris, Decety, Monteleone, &amp; Nusbaum, 2009). Cacioppo et al. (2009) observed a correlation of r = -.46 for the reactivity of the ventral striatum to positive social stimuli with the UCLA loneliness scores of participants. To reliably replicate this effect of loneliness on the neural processing of social stimuli (with \u03b1 = 0.05 and power = 0.99), at least 71 participants had to be tested. To account for possible drop-outs, we planned to test at least 80 participants. Our final sample comprises a total of 42 HL and 40 LL individuals."}, "analyses": {"extra": [], "value": "For statistical analyses, SPSS 24 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) will be used.\n\nTo examine hypothesis 1, the mean score of the General Trust Scale (Yamagishi &amp; Yamagishi, 1994) will be compared between groups using a two-sample t-test. fMRI data will be preprocessed and analyzed using standard procedures in SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, London, UK; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) implemented in Matlab (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA). The first five volumes of each functional time series will be discarded to allow for T1 equilibration. Functional images will be corrected for head movements between scans by an affine registration. Images will be initially realigned to the first image of the time series before being re-realigned to the mean of all images. To correct for signal distortion based on B0-field inhomogeneity, the images will be unwarped by applying the voxel displacement map (VDM file) to the EPI time series (Realign &amp; Unwarp). Normalization parameters will be determined by segmentation and non-linear warping of the structural scan to reference tissue probability maps in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Normalization parameters will then be applied to all functional images, which will be resampled at 2 x 2 x 2 mm\u00b3 voxel size. For spatial smoothing, a 6-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel will be used. Raw time series will be detrended using a high-pass filter (cut-off period 128 s). A two-stage approach based on the general linear model implemented in SPM12 will be used for statistical analyses. On the first level, participants\u2019 individual data will be modeled using a fixed-effect model. Onsets and durations of the four experimental conditions (\u2018trust game\u2019, \u2018risk game\u2019, \u2018age human\u2019, \u2018age computer\u2019) will be modeled by a stick function convolved with a hemodynamic response function (HRF). Movement parameters will be included in the design matrix as confounds. On the second level, main contrasts of interest between groups (HL (trust game &gt; risk game) &gt; LL (trust game &gt; risk game), LL (trust game &gt; risk game) &gt; HL (trust game &gt; risk game), HL (age human &gt; age computer) &gt; LL (age human &gt; age computer), LL (age human &gt; age computer) &gt; HL (age human &gt; age computer), HL [(trust game &gt; risk game) &gt; (age human &gt; age computer)] &gt; LL [(trust game &gt; risk game) &gt; (age human &gt; age computer)], and LL [(trust game &gt; risk game) &gt; (age human&gt; age computer)] &gt; HL [(trust game &gt; risk game) &gt; (age human &gt; age computer)]) will be computed using two-sample t-tests. The main analyses of fMRI data will focus on trust-associated regions of interest (ROIs) consisting of the amygdala, the anterior insular cortex (AI), the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and the ventral striatum (VS). The amygdala, the AI, the mPFC, and the VS will be anatomically defined according to the Wake Forest University PickAtlas (wfu PickAtlas; Maldjian, Laurienti, &amp; Burdette, 2004; Maldjian, Laurienti, Kraft, &amp; Burdette, 2003). The TPJ will be created using association test maps from neurosynth (https://neurosynth.org/; search term: temporoparietal junction). P values smaller than .05 after correction for multiple comparisons (family-wise error, FWE) will be considered significant. Whole-brain analyses of the three main contrasts of interest (trust game &gt; risk game, trust game &gt; age human, (trust game &gt; risk game) &gt; (age human &gt; age computer)) will be calculated across groups for task validation. Parameter estimates of significant contrasts will be extracted using marsbar (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net) and further analyzed in SPSS 24 to disentangle interactions by calculating Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc t-tests. Behavioral data will be analyzed using mixed-design analyses of variance (ANOVAs) and Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc t-tests. The sociality condition will be used as within-subject factor (human vs. computer), while group will serve as between-subject factor (HL vs. LL). If the assumption of sphericity is significantly violated as assessed by Mauchly\u2019s tests, Greenhouse-Geisser corrections will be applied. For analyses of the interpersonal distance paradigm, mixed ANOVAs with the within-subject factor time (pre vs. post social interaction) and the between-subject factor group (HL vs. LL) will be calculated separately for both conditions (comfortable and uncomfortable distance). \n\nTo test hypothesis 2, a mixed ANOVA with the sociality condition (human vs. computer) as within-subject factor and group (HL vs. LL) as between-subject factor will be calculated to analyze valence ratings. Post-hoc t-tests will be Bonferroni-corrected. The same preprocessing pipeline as stated for the trust game will be used for the social gambling task. On the first level, onsets and durations of eight conditions (\u2018decision computer play\u2019, \u2018decision computer no play\u2019, \u2018decision human play\u2019, \u2018decision human no play\u2019, \u2018computer win\u2019, \u2018computer lost\u2019, human win\u2019, \u2018human lost\u2019) will be modeled by a stick function convolved with a HRF. Again, movement parameters will be included in the design matrix as regressors of no interest. Differences in group-specific response patterns will be assessed on the second level by computing two-sample t-tests for the main contrasts of interest (HL (decision human &gt; decision computer) &gt; LL (decision human &gt; decision computer), HL (decision play &gt; decision no play) &gt; LL (decision play &gt; decision no play), HL (decision human play &gt; decision human no play) &gt; LL (decision human play &gt; decision human no play), HL (decision human play &gt; decision computer play) &gt; LL (decision human play &gt; decision computer play), HL (outcome human &gt; outcome computer) &gt; LL (outcome human &gt; outcome computer), HL (outcome win &gt; outcome lost) &gt; LL (outcome win &gt; outcome lost), HL (outcome human win &gt; outcome computer win) &gt; LL (outcome human win &gt; outcome computer win), HL (outcome human lost &gt; outcome computer lost) &gt; LL (outcome human lost &gt; outcome computer lost)). All contrasts will further be calculated to test the opposite direction, that is stronger effects in the LL group (e.g. LL (decision human &gt; decision computer) &gt; HL (decision human &gt; decision computer)). Furthermore, whole-brain task effects (e.g. decision human &gt; decision computer) will be analyzed across groups. Analyses will be conducted using the anatomically defined amygdala and VS according to the wfu PickAtlas as ROIs. FWE-corrected p values smaller than .05 will be considered significant. Further analyses of significant contrasts will be analogous to the analysis of the fMRI trust game data. Analyses of the virtual auction task will include mixed ANOVAs with the valence condition (positive vs. negative social feedback), the between-subject factor group, and invested money and reaction times as dependent variables.\n\nFinally, differences in the response to the positive social interaction task (as measured with PANAS, POMS, and VAS) will be analyzed using mixed ANOVAs and Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc t-tests. Time (pre vs. post social interaction) will be used as within-subject factor and group (HL vs. LL) as between-subject factor. To examine further group differences in the response to the positive social interaction, EDA and ECG data will be analyzed with Acqknowledge 4.3 software (Biopac Systems Inc., Goleta CA, USA). The EDA data will be preprocessed including resampling of the waveform to a new waveform sample rate of 62.5 samples per second, smoothing (median value smoothing factor: 63), and applying a low-pass filter with a frequency cutoff of 1 Hz. EDA data will be visually inspected for artifacts. Phasic components will be derived from the tonic EDA before the skin conductance level (SCL) is assessed. The raw ECG data will be first analyzed using an automated software detection algorithm and then visually inspected according to the software guidelines for detecting artifacts and abnormal beats. Heart rate variability (HRV) will be determined in accordance with the HRV Task Force guidelines (Task Force of The European Society of Cardiology and The North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996). The SCL, heart rate, and heart rate variability will be analyzed using mixed ANOVAs including the within-subject factor time (baseline vs. social interaction) and the between-subject factor group (HL vs. LL). \n"}, "outliers": {"extra": [], "value": "Participants who do not believe the cover story will be excluded from all analyses of the trust game.

We applied an adapted version of the trust game (cf. Engelmann, Meyer, Ruff, &amp; Fehr, 2019; King-Casas et al., 2005). Two players, the investor and the trustee, start each round with an endowment of 10 \u20ac. The investor chooses the amount of money he/she wants to invest in an unknown trustee. The invested money is tripled and added to the trustee's account. The trustee can keep all of the money for him/herself or share the money with the investor so that both players end with the same amount of money (10 \u20ac plus the invested amount). The trustees' decisions for all possible investments were collected in a screening session. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants played 30 trials of the trust game as investor without receiving feedback about the decisions of the trustees. Participants were informed that one trial would be chosen randomly at the end of the fMRI session and that they would receive the money depending on their investment and the prerecorded decision of the trustee. Participants were informed that they would play against other participants of the study. A photograph of the other participant, the trustee, was shown at the beginning of each trial. In reality, pictures of the Chicago face database (Ma, Correll, &amp; Wittenbrink, 2015) were used as photographs for the trustees. We selected pictures of Caucasian persons aged 20 to 30 years to ensure the comparability with our sample consisting of mostly German students and thus to increase the credibility of the cover story. Pictures of female (n = 15) and male (n = 15) persons were matched regarding trustworthiness and attractiveness using the norming data. In a control condition, participants played a risk game in which they invested money in a computer (which would randomly decide whether the money would be shared). Computer stimuli were matched in width and height to social stimuli and depicted computers in front of a white background. To further investigate neural correlates specific for trust decisions, we controlled for the social content of the stimuli. Thus, we included an additional condition in which participants had to estimate the age of the presented social and computer stimuli. The order of conditions (trust game, risk game, age human, age computer) was quasi randomized (no more than two trials of the same condition in a row). Each condition contained 30 trials. In each trial, the photograph was presented for 7 seconds on a black background using the software Presentation 17 (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA, USA). Participants could choose their responses using an MRI-compatible response grip system (NordicNeuroLab AS, Bergen, Norway). Two buttons could be used with the index fingers to move a cursor left and right on a white scale below the picture. Participants confirmed their responses by pressing two buttons with their thumbs. After confirmation, the cursor changed to green and was not movable anymore. For each position, the current value (invested money or estimated age) was presented in the middle of the screen. In each condition, the scale included a range of 11 values (trust and risk game: 0 to 10 \u20ac, age human: 20 to 30 years, age computer: 0 to 50 years in 5-year increments). The direction of the scale (i.e. 0 to 10 \u20ac or 10 to 0 \u20ac) was counterbalanced across participants. The trials were interleaved with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) that was jittered between 4 and 6 seconds (mean: 5 seconds). For optimization of the design, the easy-optimize-x software was used (https://www.bobspunt.com/easy-optimize-x/; TR: 2.69 s, high-pass filter cutoff: 128 s, nconds: 4, trials per condition: 30 for each condition, maximum block size: 2, trial duration: 7 s, mean ISI: 5 s, min ISI: 4 s, max ISI: 6 s, ISI distribution: Rayleigh, time before first trial: 0 s, time after last trial: 0 s, N designs to save: 85, N generations to run: 50, N designs per generation: 2000, max time to run: 1440 min, 3 contrasts of interest: [1 -1 0 0; 0 0 1 -1; 1 -1 -1 1]). One design was calculated for each participant.\n-\tInvested money while playing the trust game in the role of the investor with another human player in contrast to the risk game against the computer.\n-\tInterpersonal distance as an inclination to trust strangers measured by an adapted version of an established stop-distance paradigm (cf. Maier et al., 2020). Participants were asked to move toward an unfamiliar experimenter from a start distance of 2 m. The start distance was verified by the chin-to-chin distance measured with a digital laser measurer (error: \u00b1 0.003 m). In the first trial, participants were instructed to stop at their ideal distance. In a second trial, participants were to stop at a distance at which they felt slightly uncomfortable. Both conditions were repeated after completion of the positive social interaction.\n\n\nTo test hypothesis 2, the following dependent variables were measured:\n-\tThe BOLD signal while participants played a social gambling task (for details of the implementation of the behavioral task, see Schultz et al., 2019). Briefly, participants were asked whether they wanted to play and have the chance to win 3 \u20ac or whether they did not want to play and instead receive a fixed amount of money (ranging from 0 to 3 \u20ac). If participants chose to play in the social condition (indicated by the name and picture of one out of four partners), they received positive or negative social feedback dependent on the outcome of the trial in the form of a video. In a control condition (indicated by a picture of a computer), the feedback was given by a neutral video of a green checkmark or a red cross. If participants chose not to play, a sentence confirmed the payoff. There was no time limit for their choice. For each participant, an individual certainty equivalent (termed CE50) was estimated by fitting a cumulative Gaussian function to each participant\u2019s choice probabilities observed for the amounts offered as alternative to the play condition. The CE50 was defined as the amount of payoff a participant would have to receive to attain a fifty-fifty chance of him or her choosing the play or no-play option. The CE50 was calculated separately for the computer and for the human partners. In the same way, the CE20 and CE80 were estimated (defined as the amount of money a participant would have to receive to choose the no-play option in 20 % and 80 % of all trials). During fMRI, the partner for each trial (one out of four human partners or the computer) was chosen randomly and indicated by the name of the partner or the word \u201ccomputer\u201d. Furthermore, the fixed amount of money offered as alternative for the play option varied between the three individually determined values CE50, CE20, and CE80. Using individualized monetary amounts as an alternative to the play option enabled us to equate the number of play and no play choices across participants. Participants responded with their index fingers using an MRI-compatible response grip system (NordicNeuroLab AS, Bergen, Norway). The position of the play option (left or right on the screen) was counterbalanced across trials. All human partners were presented in combination with each of the three CE values twice, resulting in 24 social trials and 24 computer trials per run. The feedback video was presented for 2.6 seconds. The temporal intervals between decision, outcome stage, and ISIs between trials varied between 2 and 11 seconds with a descending probability (i.e. an ISI of 2 s had a probability of 44 %, an ISI of 3 s a probability of 22 %, an ISI of 4 s a probability of 11 %, an ISI of 5 s a probability of 5.6 %, and ISIs of 6 to 11 s a probability of 2.8 % each). All participants completed two runs. Participants received the obtained money from one randomly chosen trial per run.\n-\tRated valence of the positive and negative social feedback videos on a visual analogue scale (VAS; range 0-100).\n-\tInvested money during a virtual auction task against the computer to get positive social feedback or avoid negative social feedback presented via videos. Before starting the social gambling task, participants were asked with no imposed time limit to invest any amount of money between 0 \u20ac and 1 \u20ac (in increments of 5 cents) to (1) increase the probability of watching a positive social feedback video or (2) to decrease the probability of watching a negative social feedback video. Participants were informed that they would take part in a virtual auction against the computer using a random algorism to invest money. In each trial, a picture of one of six actors indicated which feedback video was being auctioned. The same actors as used in the social gambling task and two additional actors were included in this auction task. One trial was chosen randomly after the completion of the 6 trials of one condition (i.e. positive or negative feedback) and the invested money was compared to the invested money of the computer. The player who invested more money (participant or computer) won the auction and kept 1 \u20ac minus the invested money, whereas the loser of the auction kept 1 \u20ac, irrespective of the invested money. If the participant won during the positive feedback condition, a positive social feedback video was presented after winning the auction, while no video was presented during the negative feedback condition. If the participant lost, a negative social feedback video was presented during the negative feedback condition and no video was shown for the positive feedback condition. The same videos as implemented in the social gambling task and two additional feedback videos for the two additional actors were used. The feedback videos were repeated until the participants pressed any key. Participants received the remaining monetary values of the randomly chosen trials.\n\nThe key dependent variables to test hypothesis 3 are:\n-\tIncrease in positive mood and decrease in negative mood. Mood and affect were measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Scales (PANAS; D. Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988), the Profile of Mood States (POMS; McNair, Lorr, &amp; Droppleman, 1971), and visual analog scale (VAS) before and after a positive social interaction with the experimenter. The positive social interaction consisted of a semi-structured ten-minute conversation between the participant and a same-sex unfamiliar experimenter. Participants were told to talk about (1) plans for a fictive lottery win, (2) positive childhood memories, and (3) hobbies and interests. High-quality photographs presenting examples for activities (e.g. traveling around the world, buying a sports car, building a house, saving money for the future, going on a safari) were used to facilitate the start of the conversation. Participants were instructed to find similarities in the discussed topics with the experimenter. Baseline electrodermal activity (EDA) and an electrocardiogram (ECG) were collected for five minutes prior to the positive social interaction and throughout the entire social interaction via acquisition module MP150 (Biopac Systems Inc., Goleta CA, USA). EDA was measured at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz from Ag/AgCl electrodes filled with isotonic electrolyte gel on the tenar and hypotenar of the left (non-dominant) hand. ECG data were measured at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz from Ag/AgCl electrodes filled with isotonic electrolyte gel and attached to the participants in a Lead-II formation with active electrodes positioned on the right clavicle and on the lower left rib and the ground electrode placed on the left clavicle.\n\nAll fMRI data were acquired using a 3T Siemens TRIO MRI system (Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) with a Siemens 32-channel head coil. Functional data of the trust game were obtained using a T2*-weighted echoplanar (EPI) sequence (repetition time [TR] = 2690 ms, echo time [TE] = 30 ms, ascending slicing, matrix size: 96 x 96, voxel size: 2 x 2 x 3 mm\u00b3, slice thickness = 3.0 mm, distance factor = 10 %, field of view [FoV] = 192 mm, flip angle 90\u00b0, 41 axial slices). Functional data of the social gambling task were acquired using a T2*-weighted EPI sequence with a TR of 2500 ms, a TE of 30 ms, ascending slicing, a matrix size of 96 x 96, 37 axial slices with a voxel size of 2 x 2 x 3 mm\u00b3 and a slice thickness of 3.0 mm, a distance factor of 10 %, a FoV of 192 mm, and a flip angle of 90\u00b0. High-resolution T1-weighted structural images were collected on the same scanner (TR = 1660 ms, TE = 2.54 ms, matrix size: 256 x 256, voxel size: 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 mm\u00b3, slice thickness = 0.8 mm, FoV = 256 mm, flip angle = 9\u00b0, 208 sagittal slices). To control for inhomogeneity of the magnetic field, fieldmaps were obtained for each T2*-weighted EPI sequence and will be included during preprocessing of the fMRI data (TR = 392 ms, TE [1] = 4.92, TE [2] = 7.38, matrix size: 64 x 64, voxel size: 3 x 3 x 3, slice thickness = 3.0 mm, distance factor = 10 %, FoV = 192 mm, flip angle 60\u00b0, 37 axial slices).\n"}, "conditions": {"extra": [], "value": "The present study used a quasi-experimental design with a sample of pre-stratified healthy volunteers scoring high or low on the revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (Russell, Peplau, &amp; Cutrona, 1980; Schwab, 1986).

Loneliness is often associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms and childhood maltreatment. Therefore, depressive symptoms were measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996), social anxiety was assessed using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scores (LSAS; Rytwinski et al., 2009), and childhood maltreatment was measured by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; Bernstein et al., 1994). To examine whether group effects (main effects of group or interactions with group) might be driven by these potential confounders, mediation and moderation analyses will be carried out using the PROCESS macro v3.4 for SPSS (Hayes, 2017). Further moderation analyses will be conducted to examine potential effects of sex.\n\nTo further characterize the response to positive social interactions, changes in salivary oxytocin, cortisol, neurokinin B, and immunoglobulin A triggered by the positive social interaction with the experimenter will be analyzed using mixed ANOVAs.\n\n\nFurther behavioral data were collected for exploratory purposes. Group differences will be analyzed regarding temporal discounting as a measurement for the ability to control impulsive preferences. The task included 36 trials in which participants chose between smaller-sooner or larger-later rewards. The smaller-sooner rewards were pseudorandomly drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 45 \u20ac and a standard deviation of 15 \u20ac. The larger-later rewards were 0.5-75% larger than the presented smaller-sooner reward. Smaller-sooner rewards were immediately available and paired with delayed (two and four weeks) larger-later rewards in half of the trials. In a second condition, smaller-sooner rewards were available in two weeks and paired with a larger-later option available in four or six weeks. The order of trials was randomized across participants and implemented in Presentation  (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA, USA). The proportion of larger-later choices will be used as estimate for temporal discounting.\n\nFurthermore, group differences in emotion recognition and mentalization will be assessed using the revised version of the \u201cReading the Mind in the Eyes\u201d test (Baron\u2010Cohen, Wheelwright, Hill, Raste, &amp; Plumb, 2001) implemented in Presentation  (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA, USA) and an adaptive emotion recognition task implemented in Matlab (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA). Three female actors from the Karolinska face database (Lundqvist, Flykt, &amp; \u00d6hman, 1998) served as neutral stimuli. Facial expressions were morphed into fearful, happy, disgusted, and angry expressions in increments of 5 % change using Abrosoft FantaMorph 5. Stimuli were presented for 242 ms in 12 trials per emotion and actor. During the task, participants were instructed to indicate the perceived emotion (\u201cneutral\u201d, \u201cfearful\u201d, \u201chappy\u201d, \u201cdisgusted\u201d, \u201cangry\u201d, \u201cnot sure\u201d) without receiving feedback about the accuracy of their decision. A Bayesian adaptive procedure (\"QUEST\"; A. B. Watson &amp; Pelli, 1983) was used to determine the stimulus presentation and to estimate individual emotion thresholds. Stimuli with an emotion intensity of half the current threshold were presented in 25 % of the trials. Fifty percent of the stimuli were chosen such that the intensity was at the current threshold. Another 25 % of the stimuli had the maximum emotion intensity. A fixation cross was shown for 292 ms between the emotion recognition judgment and the next presentation of a face stimulus. \n\nFinally, we will analyze group differences in functional connectivity. Resting state data were acquired using a T2*-weighted echoplanar (EPI) sequence (TR = 2690 ms, TE = 30 ms, ascending slicing, matrix size: 96 x 96, voxel size: 2 x 2 x 3 mm\u00b3, slice thickness = 3.0 mm, distance factor = 10 %, FoV = 192 mm, flip angle 90\u00b0, 41 axial slices). Resting state functional connectivity will be analyzed using the CONN toolbox (www.nitrc.org/projects/conn, RRID:SCR_009550; Whitfield-Gabrieli &amp; Nieto-Castanon, 2012). In addition, a generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analysis will be conducted for brain regions showing significant effects during the fMRI trust game and social gambling task and again performed using the CONN toolbox. \n\nA blood sample was collected to assess group differences in clinically established immune parameters.\n", "sample": "We used G*Power 3 to conduct an a-priori power analysis for the project based on the effect size obtained in an fMRI study investigating the neural processing of social stimuli as a function of perceived social isolation (Cacioppo, Norris, Decety, Monteleone, &amp; Nusbaum, 2009). Cacioppo et al. (2009) observed a correlation of r = -.46 for the reactivity of the ventral striatum to positive social stimuli with the UCLA loneliness scores of participants. To reliably replicate this effect of loneliness on the neural processing of social stimuli (with \u03b1 = 0.05 and power = 0.99), at least 71 participants had to be tested. To account for possible drop-outs, we planned to test at least 80 participants. Our final sample comprises a total of 42 HL and 40 LL individuals.", "analyses": "For statistical analyses, SPSS 24 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) will be used.\n\nTo examine hypothesis 1, the mean score of the General Trust Scale (Yamagishi &amp; Yamagishi, 1994) will be compared between groups using a two-sample t-test. fMRI data will be preprocessed and analyzed using standard procedures in SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, London, UK; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) implemented in Matlab (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA). The first five volumes of each functional time series will be discarded to allow for T1 equilibration. Functional images will be corrected for head movements between scans by an affine registration. Images will be initially realigned to the first image of the time series before being re-realigned to the mean of all images. To correct for signal distortion based on B0-field inhomogeneity, the images will be unwarped by applying the voxel displacement map (VDM file) to the EPI time series (Realign &amp; Unwarp). Normalization parameters will be determined by segmentation and non-linear warping of the structural scan to reference tissue probability maps in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Normalization parameters will then be applied to all functional images, which will be resampled at 2 x 2 x 2 mm\u00b3 voxel size. For spatial smoothing, a 6-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel will be used. Raw time series will be detrended using a high-pass filter (cut-off period 128 s). A two-stage approach based on the general linear model implemented in SPM12 will be used for statistical analyses. On the first level, participants\u2019 individual data will be modeled using a fixed-effect model. Onsets and durations of the four experimental conditions (\u2018trust game\u2019, \u2018risk game\u2019, \u2018age human\u2019, \u2018age computer\u2019) will be modeled by a stick function convolved with a hemodynamic response function (HRF). Movement parameters will be included in the design matrix as confounds. On the second level, main contrasts of interest between groups (HL (trust game &gt; risk game) &gt; LL (trust game &gt; risk game), LL (trust game &gt; risk game) &gt; HL (trust game &gt; risk game), HL (age human &gt; age computer) &gt; LL (age human &gt; age computer), LL (age human &gt; age computer) &gt; HL (age human &gt; age computer), HL [(trust game &gt; risk game) &gt; (age human &gt; age computer)] &gt; LL [(trust game &gt; risk game) &gt; (age human &gt; age computer)], and LL [(trust game &gt; risk game) &gt; (age human&gt; age computer)] &gt; HL [(trust game &gt; risk game) &gt; (age human &gt; age computer)]) will be computed using two-sample t-tests. The main analyses of fMRI data will focus on trust-associated regions of interest (ROIs) consisting of the amygdala, the anterior insular cortex (AI), the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and the ventral striatum (VS). The amygdala, the AI, the mPFC, and the VS will be anatomically defined according to the Wake Forest University PickAtlas (wfu PickAtlas; Maldjian, Laurienti, &amp; Burdette, 2004; Maldjian, Laurienti, Kraft, &amp; Burdette, 2003). The TPJ will be created using association test maps from neurosynth (https://neurosynth.org/; search term: temporoparietal junction). P values smaller than .05 after correction for multiple comparisons (family-wise error, FWE) will be considered significant. Whole-brain analyses of the three main contrasts of interest (trust game &gt; risk game, trust game &gt; age human, (trust game &gt; risk game) &gt; (age human &gt; age computer)) will be calculated across groups for task validation. Parameter estimates of significant contrasts will be extracted using marsbar (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net) and further analyzed in SPSS 24 to disentangle interactions by calculating Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc t-tests. Behavioral data will be analyzed using mixed-design analyses of variance (ANOVAs) and Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc t-tests. The sociality condition will be used as within-subject factor (human vs. computer), while group will serve as between-subject factor (HL vs. LL). If the assumption of sphericity is significantly violated as assessed by Mauchly\u2019s tests, Greenhouse-Geisser corrections will be applied. For analyses of the interpersonal distance paradigm, mixed ANOVAs with the within-subject factor time (pre vs. post social interaction) and the between-subject factor group (HL vs. LL) will be calculated separately for both conditions (comfortable and uncomfortable distance). \n\nTo test hypothesis 2, a mixed ANOVA with the sociality condition (human vs. computer) as within-subject factor and group (HL vs. LL) as between-subject factor will be calculated to analyze valence ratings. Post-hoc t-tests will be Bonferroni-corrected. The same preprocessing pipeline as stated for the trust game will be used for the social gambling task. On the first level, onsets and durations of eight conditions (\u2018decision computer play\u2019, \u2018decision computer no play\u2019, \u2018decision human play\u2019, \u2018decision human no play\u2019, \u2018computer win\u2019, \u2018computer lost\u2019, human win\u2019, \u2018human lost\u2019) will be modeled by a stick function convolved with a HRF. Again, movement parameters will be included in the design matrix as regressors of no interest. Differences in group-specific response patterns will be assessed on the second level by computing two-sample t-tests for the main contrasts of interest (HL (decision human &gt; decision computer) &gt; LL (decision human &gt; decision computer), HL (decision play &gt; decision no play) &gt; LL (decision play &gt; decision no play), HL (decision human play &gt; decision human no play) &gt; LL (decision human play &gt; decision human no play), HL (decision human play &gt; decision computer play) &gt; LL (decision human play &gt; decision computer play), HL (outcome human &gt; outcome computer) &gt; LL (outcome human &gt; outcome computer), HL (outcome win &gt; outcome lost) &gt; LL (outcome win &gt; outcome lost), HL (outcome human win &gt; outcome computer win) &gt; LL (outcome human win &gt; outcome computer win), HL (outcome human lost &gt; outcome computer lost) &gt; LL (outcome human lost &gt; outcome computer lost)). All contrasts will further be calculated to test the opposite direction, that is stronger effects in the LL group (e.g. LL (decision human &gt; decision computer) &gt; HL (decision human &gt; decision computer)). Furthermore, whole-brain task effects (e.g. decision human &gt; decision computer) will be analyzed across groups. Analyses will be conducted using the anatomically defined amygdala and VS according to the wfu PickAtlas as ROIs. FWE-corrected p values smaller than .05 will be considered significant. Further analyses of significant contrasts will be analogous to the analysis of the fMRI trust game data. Analyses of the virtual auction task will include mixed ANOVAs with the valence condition (positive vs. negative social feedback), the between-subject factor group, and invested money and reaction times as dependent variables.\n\nFinally, differences in the response to the positive social interaction task (as measured with PANAS, POMS, and VAS) will be analyzed using mixed ANOVAs and Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc t-tests. Time (pre vs. post social interaction) will be used as within-subject factor and group (HL vs. LL) as between-subject factor. To examine further group differences in the response to the positive social interaction, EDA and ECG data will be analyzed with Acqknowledge 4.3 software (Biopac Systems Inc., Goleta CA, USA). The EDA data will be preprocessed including resampling of the waveform to a new waveform sample rate of 62.5 samples per second, smoothing (median value smoothing factor: 63), and applying a low-pass filter with a frequency cutoff of 1 Hz. EDA data will be visually inspected for artifacts. Phasic components will be derived from the tonic EDA before the skin conductance level (SCL) is assessed. The raw ECG data will be first analyzed using an automated software detection algorithm and then visually inspected according to the software guidelines for detecting artifacts and abnormal beats. Heart rate variability (HRV) will be determined in accordance with the HRV Task Force guidelines (Task Force of The European Society of Cardiology and The North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996). The SCL, heart rate, and heart rate variability will be analyzed using mixed ANOVAs including the within-subject factor time (baseline vs. social interaction) and the between-subject factor group (HL vs. LL). \n", "outliers": "Participants who do not believe the cover story will be excluded from all analyses of the trust game. Participants with excessive head movements (&gt; 4 mm/\u00b0 in any direction) or anatomical abnormalities will be excluded from fMRI analyses. Participants who are not fluent in German will be excluded from all analyses of the positive social interaction.", "dependent": "The key dependent variables to test hypothesis 1 are:\n-\tMean score of the General Trust Scale (Yamagishi &amp; Yamagishi, 1994)\n-\tThe blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal while participants played a single-round trust game in the role of an investor. We applied an adapted version of the trust game (cf. Engelmann, Meyer, Ruff, &amp; Fehr, 2019; King-Casas et al., 2005). Two players, the investor and the trustee, start each round with an endowment of 10 \u20ac. The investor chooses the amount of money he/she wants to invest in an unknown trustee. The invested money is tripled and added to the trustee's account. The trustee can keep all of the money for him/herself or share the money with the investor so that both players end with the same amount of money (10 \u20ac plus the invested amount). The trustees' decisions for all possible investments were collected in a screening session. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants played 30 trials of the trust game as investor without receiving feedback about the decisions of the trustees. Participants were informed that one trial would be chosen randomly at the end of the fMRI session and that they would receive the money depending on their investment and the prerecorded decision of the trustee. Participants were informed that they would play against other participants of the study. A photograph of the other participant, the trustee, was shown at the beginning of each trial. In reality, pictures of the Chicago face database (Ma, Correll, &amp; Wittenbrink, 2015) were used as photographs for the trustees. We selected pictures of Caucasian persons aged 20 to 30 years to ensure the comparability with our sample consisting of mostly German students and thus to increase the credibility of the cover story. Pictures of female (n = 15) and male (n = 15) persons were matched regarding trustworthiness and attractiveness using the norming data. In a control condition, participants played a risk game in which they invested money in a computer (which would randomly decide whether the money would be shared). Computer stimuli were matched in width and height to social stimuli and depicted computers in front of a white background. To further investigate neural correlates specific for trust decisions, we controlled for the social content of the stimuli. Thus, we included an additional condition in which participants had to estimate the age of the presented social and computer stimuli. The order of conditions (trust game, risk game, age human, age computer) was quasi randomized (no more than two trials of the same condition in a row). Each condition contained 30 trials. In each trial, the photograph was presented for 7 seconds on a black background using the software Presentation 17 (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA, USA). Participants could choose their responses using an MRI-compatible response grip system (NordicNeuroLab AS, Bergen, Norway). Two buttons could be used with the index fingers to move a cursor left and right on a white scale below the picture. Participants confirmed their responses by pressing two buttons with their thumbs. After confirmation, the cursor changed to green and was not movable anymore. For each position, the current value (invested money or estimated age) was presented in the middle of the screen. In each condition, the scale included a range of 11 values (trust and risk game: 0 to 10 \u20ac, age human: 20 to 30 years, age computer: 0 to 50 years in 5-year increments). The direction of the scale (i.e. 0 to 10 \u20ac or 10 to 0 \u20ac) was counterbalanced across participants. The trials were interleaved with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) that was jittered between 4 and 6 seconds (mean: 5 seconds). For optimization of the design, the easy-optimize-x software was used (https://www.bobspunt.com/easy-optimize-x/; TR: 2.69 s, high-pass filter cutoff: 128 s, nconds: 4, trials per condition: 30 for each condition, maximum block size: 2, trial duration: 7 s, mean ISI: 5 s, min ISI: 4 s, max ISI: 6 s, ISI distribution: Rayleigh, time before first trial: 0 s, time after last trial: 0 s, N designs to save: 85, N generations to run: 50, N designs per generation: 2000, max time to run: 1440 min, 3 contrasts of interest: [1 -1 0 0; 0 0 1 -1; 1 -1 -1 1]). One design was calculated for each participant.\n-\tInvested money while playing the trust game in the role of the investor with another human player in contrast to the risk game against the computer.\n-\tInterpersonal distance as an inclination to trust strangers measured by an adapted version of an established stop-distance paradigm (cf. Maier et al., 2020). Participants were asked to move toward an unfamiliar experimenter from a start distance of 2 m. The start distance was verified by the chin-to-chin distance measured with a digital laser measurer (error: \u00b1 0.003 m). In the first trial, participants were instructed to stop at their ideal distance. In a second trial, participants were to stop at a distance at which they felt slightly uncomfortable. Both conditions were repeated after completion of the positive social interaction.\n\n\nTo test hypothesis 2, the following dependent variables were measured:\n-\tThe BOLD signal while participants played a social gambling task (for details of the implementation of the behavioral task, see Schultz et al., 2019). Briefly, participants were asked whether they wanted to play and have the chance to win 3 \u20ac or whether they did not want to play and instead receive a fixed amount of money (ranging from 0 to 3 \u20ac). If participants chose to play in the social condition (indicated by the name and picture of one out of four partners), they received positive or negative social feedback dependent on the outcome of the trial in the form of a video. In a control condition (indicated by a picture of a computer), the feedback was given by a neutral video of a green checkmark or a red cross. If participants chose not to play, a sentence confirmed the payoff. There was no time limit for their choice. For each participant, an individual certainty equivalent (termed CE50) was estimated by fitting a cumulative Gaussian function to each participant\u2019s choice probabilities observed for the amounts offered as alternative to the play condition. The CE50 was defined as the amount of payoff a participant would have to receive to attain a fifty-fifty chance of him or her choosing the play or no-play option. The CE50 was calculated separately for the computer and for the human partners. In the same way, the CE20 and CE80 were estimated (defined as the amount of money a participant would have to receive to choose the no-play option in 20 % and 80 % of all trials). During fMRI, the partner for each trial (one out of four human partners or the computer) was chosen randomly and indicated by the name of the partner or the word \u201ccomputer\u201d. Furthermore, the fixed amount of money offered as alternative for the play option varied between the three individually determined values CE50, CE20, and CE80. Using individualized monetary amounts as an alternative to the play option enabled us to equate the number of play and no play choices across participants. Participants responded with their index fingers using an MRI-compatible response grip system (NordicNeuroLab AS, Bergen, Norway). The position of the play option (left or right on the screen) was counterbalanced across trials. All human partners were presented in combination with each of the three CE values twice, resulting in 24 social trials and 24 computer trials per run. The feedback video was presented for 2.6 seconds. The temporal intervals between decision, outcome stage, and ISIs between trials varied between 2 and 11 seconds with a descending probability (i.e. an ISI of 2 s had a probability of 44 %, an ISI of 3 s a probability of 22 %, an ISI of 4 s a probability of 11 %, an ISI of 5 s a probability of 5.6 %, and ISIs of 6 to 11 s a probability of 2.8 % each). All participants completed two runs. Participants received the obtained money from one randomly chosen trial per run.\n-\tRated valence of the positive and negative social feedback videos on a visual analogue scale (VAS; range 0-100).\n-\tInvested money during a virtual auction task against the computer to get positive social feedback or avoid negative social feedback presented via videos. Before starting the social gambling task, participants were asked with no imposed time limit to invest any amount of money between 0 \u20ac and 1 \u20ac (in increments of 5 cents) to (1) increase the probability of watching a positive social feedback video or (2) to decrease the probability of watching a negative social feedback video. Participants were informed that they would take part in a virtual auction against the computer using a random algorism to invest money. In each trial, a picture of one of six actors indicated which feedback video was being auctioned. The same actors as used in the social gambling task and two additional actors were included in this auction task. One trial was chosen randomly after the completion of the 6 trials of one condition (i.e. positive or negative feedback) and the invested money was compared to the invested money of the computer. The player who invested more money (participant or computer) won the auction and kept 1 \u20ac minus the invested money, whereas the loser of the auction kept 1 \u20ac, irrespective of the invested money. If the participant won during the positive feedback condition, a positive social feedback video was presented after winning the auction, while no video was presented during the negative feedback condition. If the participant lost, a negative social feedback video was presented during the negative feedback condition and no video was shown for the positive feedback condition. The same videos as implemented in the social gambling task and two additional feedback videos for the two additional actors were used. The feedback videos were repeated until the participants pressed any key. Participants received the remaining monetary values of the randomly chosen trials.\n\nThe key dependent variables to test hypothesis 3 are:\n-\tIncrease in positive mood and decrease in negative mood. Mood and affect were measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Scales (PANAS; D. Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988), the Profile of Mood States (POMS; McNair, Lorr, &amp; Droppleman, 1971), and visual analog scale (VAS) before and after a positive social interaction with the experimenter. The positive social interaction consisted of a semi-structured ten-minute conversation between the participant and a same-sex unfamiliar experimenter. Participants were told to talk about (1) plans for a fictive lottery win, (2) positive childhood memories, and (3) hobbies and interests. High-quality photographs presenting examples for activities (e.g. traveling around the world, buying a sports car, building a house, saving money for the future, going on a safari) were used to facilitate the start of the conversation. Participants were instructed to find similarities in the discussed topics with the experimenter. Baseline electrodermal activity (EDA) and an electrocardiogram (ECG) were collected for five minutes prior to the positive social interaction and throughout the entire social interaction via acquisition module MP150 (Biopac Systems Inc., Goleta CA, USA). EDA was measured at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz from Ag/AgCl electrodes filled with isotonic electrolyte gel on the tenar and hypotenar of the left (non-dominant) hand. ECG data were measured at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz from Ag/AgCl electrodes filled with isotonic electrolyte gel and attached to the participants in a Lead-II formation with active electrodes positioned on the right clavicle and on the lower left rib and the ground electrode placed on the left clavicle.\n\nAll fMRI data were acquired using a 3T Siemens TRIO MRI system (Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) with a Siemens 32-channel head coil. Functional data of the trust game were obtained using a T2*-weighted echoplanar (EPI) sequence (repetition time [TR] = 2690 ms, echo time [TE] = 30 ms, ascending slicing, matrix size: 96 x 96, voxel size: 2 x 2 x 3 mm\u00b3, slice thickness = 3.0 mm, distance factor = 10 %, field of view [FoV] = 192 mm, flip angle 90\u00b0, 41 axial slices). Functional data of the social gambling task were acquired using a T2*-weighted EPI sequence with a TR of 2500 ms, a TE of 30 ms, ascending slicing, a matrix size of 96 x 96, 37 axial slices with a voxel size of 2 x 2 x 3 mm\u00b3 and a slice thickness of 3.0 mm, a distance factor of 10 %, a FoV of 192 mm, and a flip angle of 90\u00b0. High-resolution T1-weighted structural images were collected on the same scanner (TR = 1660 ms, TE = 2.54 ms, matrix size: 256 x 256, voxel size: 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 mm\u00b3, slice thickness = 0.8 mm, FoV = 256 mm, flip angle = 9\u00b0, 208 sagittal slices). To control for inhomogeneity of the magnetic field, fieldmaps were obtained for each T2*-weighted EPI sequence and will be included during preprocessing of the fMRI data (TR = 392 ms, TE [1] = 4.92, TE [2] = 7.38, matrix size: 64 x 64, voxel size: 3 x 3 x 3, slice thickness = 3.0 mm, distance factor = 10 %, FoV = 192 mm, flip angle 60\u00b0, 37 axial slices).\n", "conditions": "The present study used a quasi-experimental design with a sample of pre-stratified healthy volunteers scoring high or low on the revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (Russell, Peplau, &amp; Cutrona, 1980; Schwab, 1986).

H2: Party labels will matter more to urban respondents than rural respondents. H3: Party labels will matter more to educated respondents than less educated ones. H4: Party labels will matter less for individuals whose livelihood is tied to land, or who are economically dependent on landlords. Ethnicity/biradari H1: Respondents will prefer members of their own ethnic group/biradari compared to candidates who are not supported by their biradari or are not a member of their ethnic group. H2: Urban voters in Punjab & KP, however, will be less likely than rural respondents in those provinces to privilege candidates of their own biradari. H3: In rural regions of Punjab where sectarian influence is greatest, biradari ties will be weaker relative to rural areas in which sectarian influence is lower. This supports my theory that sectarian actors are gaining influence as traditional structures of power (including biradari) are breaking down. Violence H1: Respondents will prefer non-violent candidates to violent candidates. H2: Urban respondents will punish candidates for their use of violence more than rural respondents. This supports my reputational costs hypothesis, that parties have to weigh the benefits of using or supporting violence in one area with the costs such behavior incurs in other areas. H3: Respondents will punish their co-ethnics less for the use of violence than non co-ethnics. Respondents will punish co-ethnics affiliated with parties I characterize as identity-based less than co-ethnics affiliated with parties I characterize as patronage-based. H4: Individuals who have faced violence or witnessed violence will be more forgiving of the use of violence than individuals who have not, particularly when the violence is carried out by a party they support or a candidate their biradari supports. H5: Respondents who identify as Shia will punish candidates more for their use of violence. Policies H1: Respondents exposed to a condition in which the candidate promises to solve thana-kutcheri problems or provide jobs to \u201cyou and your family\u201d (clientelistic appeals) will have a higher evaluation of the candidate compared to respondents exposed to a candidate who promises to improve education or reduce corruption. This effect will be magnified for rural and low-income respondents. H2: Respondents exposed to a condition in which the candidate promises to improve education will be least popular among the four possible conditions. Foreign Policy H1: Respondents will prefer the candidate taking a harsh line on India relative to peace with India. H2: Respondents who have traveled or lived abroad, or who have family members who have traveled or lived abroad, will be in favor of peace with India compared to those who have not. H3: Respondents who have only completed primary education (or less) or respondents who have completed higher education will prefer candidates who advocate a peaceful relationship with India at greater rates than respondents who only have secondary education or some secondary education. H4: Respondents from Punjab, or who are ethnically Punjabi, will prefer candidates who advocate a harsh line with India at a greater rate than respondents from other provinces or non-Punjabi ethnicities. H5: Young (< 30 years old) and old (>55 years old) respondents are more likely to prefer candidates who support peace with India than middle-aged respondents (between approximately 30 and 55 years old). H6: Respondents who identify their sect as Shi\u2019a are more likely to prefer candidates who support peace with India than those who identify as Sunni. H7: Respondents will punish candidates affiliated with right-of-center parties (PML-N, PTI) less than those candidates affiliated with left-of-center parties (PPP, MQM, ANP) for supporting peace with India. Hypotheses for Vignette Experiment H1: Individuals will express support of a co-ethnic candidate even when he/she does not have access to many resources and is therefore unable to provide them goods & services. This helps support my theory that ethnic appeals to voters are not merely clientelistic appeals. That is, there is a psychic/non-instrumental benefit that voters get from voting for co-ethnic parties. H2: This effect will be magnified in multi-ethnic arenas of competition (Urban Sindh) and for low-income individuals. H3: Individuals who have previously faced or been exposed to violence will be more likely to support co-ethnic candidates regardless of their access to resources. These individuals will be more likely to support a co-ethnic candidate without resources than a non co-ethnic with resources. H4: Individuals will prefer co-ethnic candidates with resources to co-ethnic candidates without resources."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "Conjoint Survey: Regression analysis, with standard errors clustered by respondent, for both choice and ordinal outcomes (assigning values to each category).

I plan to explore these questions through a conjoint survey experiment and a vignette survey experiment among 1650 respondents in three provinces in Pakistan. (See PAP for more details)", "q16": "Hypotheses for conjoint analysis (including sub-group analysis): Party affiliation H1: Respondents who share the candidate\u2019s partisanship will have a higher evaluation of the candidate than respondents who do not share the candidate\u2019s partisanship. H2: Party labels will matter more to urban respondents than rural respondents. H3: Party labels will matter more to educated respondents than less educated ones. H4: Party labels will matter less for individuals whose livelihood is tied to land, or who are economically dependent on landlords. Ethnicity/biradari H1: Respondents will prefer members of their own ethnic group/biradari compared to candidates who are not supported by their biradari or are not a member of their ethnic group. H2: Urban voters in Punjab & KP, however, will be less likely than rural respondents in those provinces to privilege candidates of their own biradari. H3: In rural regions of Punjab where sectarian influence is greatest, biradari ties will be weaker relative to rural areas in which sectarian influence is lower. This supports my theory that sectarian actors are gaining influence as traditional structures of power (including biradari) are breaking down. Violence H1: Respondents will prefer non-violent candidates to violent candidates. H2: Urban respondents will punish candidates for their use of violence more than rural respondents. This supports my reputational costs hypothesis, that parties have to weigh the benefits of using or supporting violence in one area with the costs such behavior incurs in other areas. H3: Respondents will punish their co-ethnics less for the use of violence than non co-ethnics. Respondents will punish co-ethnics affiliated with parties I characterize as identity-based less than co-ethnics affiliated with parties I characterize as patronage-based.

The required information size (RIS) will be calculated by the DerSimonian-Laird TSA random-effects model including the proportion rates of the standard care group for each outcome, the heterogeneity (I\u00b2) estimate from each meta-analysis, the assumption of a relative risk reduction of the EEN intervention effect of 20 %, the assumptions of an overall type-I error of 5%, and power of 80%.\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=8y4rc", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "8y4rc", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "8y4rc", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/n2hax/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "n2hax", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rgkp5/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "rgkp5", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/8y4rc/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8y4rc/"}}, {"id": "tn4yw", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Emotional or Rational Appeals?
