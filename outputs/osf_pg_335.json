More specifically, we seek to understand how national identity conceptions shape national audience views on the utility of nuclear. In order to do this, we will field a survey experiment to a nationally representative sample."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Experimental design The experiment design consists of three sequential sections. The first measures the public\u2019s national identity conceptions. The second investigates how these national identity conceptions shape nuclear preferences, particularly with regards to the acquisition of nuclear weapons. The last section runs experimental scenarios of strategic interaction. We will analyze the data in two stages. In the first one we will randomly vary three main components - threat level, backup from an ally, and the perceived credibility of that backup. This will allow us to study the effects of differential threat scenarios on the public\u2019s support for proliferation. In the second stage, we will investigate whether groups that rank extreme in national identity conceptions have heterogeneous reactions to each of the randomly assigned scenarios. Dispositional instrument Survey participants will answer a list of questions that serve as dispositional measures. Our end goal is to actually test Hymans\u2019s (2006) typology of national identity conceptions, namely oppositional nationalist; sportsmanlike nationalist; oppositional subaltern; and sportsmanlike subaltern. But in order to do so we first need to operationalize the solidarity and status dimension upon which each one of these types rest. We therefore draw on Shalom Schwartz\u2019s universal model of values (1992, 1994) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) (Pratto et al 1994). Schwartz\u2019s theory of values measures solidarity through ten broad values that structure the overall life in society: benevolence, universalism, self-direction, stimulation, hedonism, achievement, power, security, conformity and tradition. For the purpose of this study, we focus on those values that foment prosocial bonds between individuals as well as solidarity and cohesion against internal and external threats. These allow us to distinguish between the dichotomizing (oppositional) and transcendent (sportsmanlike) identity conceptions, as proposed by Hymans (2006, 22). An oppositional identity is built on black-white, \u201cus versus them\u201d dichotomies. Such national identity conception is more likely to be hold by individuals that score high on conservation values such as security, conformity, and tradition. Those who embrace these values are driven by the conception that the world is a dangerous and threatening place. Thus, they seek \u201cin-group solidarity to protect from internal and external threats...which inhibit a sense of global identity and cosmopolitanism\u201d (Rathbun et al 2016, 128). In other words, it is reasonable to expect that an individual holding conservation values have a basic sense that \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cthey\u201d stand for different interests and values. By contrast, a transcendent identity conception provides a \u201csense of basic commonality\u201d which produces the feeling of a world made of \u201cus and them\u201d (Hymans 2006). This identity is likely to be more commonly held by individuals that score high on universalism, a value associated with \u201ca belief in the interdependent nature of international relations and a commitment to the collective resolution of common problems\u201d (Rathbun et al, 2016, 128). Universalism also emphasizes acceptance of and concern for other individuals, society, groups, and even the global community, which facilitate cooperation and allow for a higher degree of social organization (Rathbun et al 2016). In order to measure the status dimension, we rely on an actor\u2019s dispositional characteristic called SDO. SDO is a personality value that measures individual preferences for \u201cinequality among social groups\u201d (Pratto et al, 1994, 91). It focuses on the vertical dimension of self-other comparison, which is essential to determine status hierarchies. Thus, high-SDO individuals are more likely to view dominance hierarchies favorably even when they are legitimate and believe or desire that their own groups \u201cdominate and be superior to out-groups\u201d (Pratto et al 1994, 742). Such perception provides a sense of hierarchy that underscores the status dimension proposed by Hymans (2006). SDO is a measure that has good internal reliability, is stable over time and has adequate convergent and discriminant validity. By crossing these two psychological measures \u2013 solidarity and status - , we provide the foundations for spreading our sample population across Hymans\u2019s four ideal-type NICs: oppositional nationalist; sportsmanlike nationalist; oppositional subaltern; and sportsmanlike subaltern. Table below show how these NICs position in relation to each other. Source: Hymans (2006, 25) Social Dominance Orientation We use a 6-item SDO scale based on Pratto et al. (1994). Please read each description and indicate your agreement with each item. All scaled from 1 (strong agree) to 7 (strong disagree). Items 4 and 6 are reverse-coded. 1. It is okay if some groups have more of a chance in life than others. 2. Inferior groups should stay in their place. 3. To get ahead in life, it is sometimes okay to step on other groups. 4. We should have increased social equality. 5. It would be good if groups could be equal. 6. We should do what we can to equalize conditions for different groups. Universal model of values We use solely values that fall in the self-transcendence and conservation superordinate category. Here we briefly describe some people. Please read each description and tick the box on each line that shows how much each person is or is not like you. \u2013 Very much like me \u2013 Like me \u2013 Somewhat like me \u2013 A little like me \u2013 Not like me \u2013 Not like me at all Universalism 1. He thinks it is important that every person in the world should be treated equally. He believes everyone should have equal opportunities in life. 2. He wants everyone to be treated justly, even people he doesn\u2019t know. It is important to him to protect the weak in society Benevolence 1. It is important to him to be loyal to his friends. He wants to devote himself to people close to him. 2. It is important to him to respond to the needs of others. He tries to support those he knows. Security 1. It is important to him to live in secure surroundings. He avoids anything that might endanger his safety. 2. Having a stable society is important to him. He is concerned that the social order be protected. Conformity 1. He believes that people should do what they\u2019re told. He thinks people should follow rules at all times, even when no one is watching. 2. It is important to him to be obedient. He believes he should always show respect to his parents and to older people. Tradition 1. It is important to him to be humble and modest. He tries not to draw attention to himself. 2. Tradition is important to him. He tries to follow the customs handed down by his religion or his family. Nuclear Preferences Once we identify how the public rank themselves on Hymans\u2019 national identity conception framework, we proceed to map respondent policy preferences on nuclear affairs. How much do you agree with the following statements? Strongly Agree Agree Disagree Strongly Disagree (a) In order to feel safe in the world, Brazil needs the protection of an allied country with nuclear weapons. (b) Brazil should build its own nuclear weapons. (c) Brazil should be able to design its own nuclear weapon, but shouldn\u2019t build it. (d) Brazil should resist the non-proliferation regime because of its discriminatory character of dividing the world into nuclear \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots\u201d. Experiment We will run a vignette experiment with the treatment and control conditions for the phrasing. We will then ask the respondents to rank their agreement with the hypothetical pursuit of a nuclear weapon. Our purpose is to determine the public\u2019s likelihood to support the pursuit of nuclear weapons while randomly varying threat level, stronger ally backup, and the perceived credibility of that backup. The vignette experiment will start with the enumerator reading the following text for all participants: \u201cEveryone talks about Brazil's security in relation to other countries in the world. We will create different imaginary scenarios and ask what you think of each one.\u201d In treatments 1, 2 and 3, we intend to uncover the independent effects that the level of military threat has on the individual\u2019s decision to support the pursuit of nuclear weapons. Some respondents will read that Brazil faces a significant security threat; other respondents will read that Brazil faces a relatively low security threat; and other respondents will read that Brazil does not face a security threat. The texts of the three conditions are as follows: (TrH) High threat: \u201cConsider that a powerful enemy country poses a big military threat to Brazil\u2019s survival.\u201d (TrL) Low Threat: \u201cConsider that a weak enemy country poses a threat to Brazil.\u201d Without Threat: \u201cConsider that Brazil does not have an enemy strong enough to threaten its survival.\u201d The next step will be to identify the effects of the superpower nuclear guarantee on the public decision to pursue nuclear weapons. Thus, in treatments 3 and 4 we will randomize two conditions: one in which the U.S. government offers protection to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 when the latter faces high security threats and another in which the U.S. governments decides not to grant the protection. The texts of the two conditions are as follows: (TrP) Protection: \u201cConsider that a powerful enemy country poses a big military threat to Brazil\u2019s survival. [The United States says it will protect Brazil].\u201d (TrNP) Non-Protection: \u201cConsider that a powerful enemy country poses a big military threat to Brazil\u2019s survival. [The United States says it will not protect Brazil].\u201d In treatments 5 and 6, we will repeat the scenarios of treatments 3 and 4 and randomize two additional scenarios: one in which the potential proliferator trusts the powerful ally\u2019s willingness to mitigate the former\u2019s security threats, and one in which the potential proliferator distrust the commitment to protection made by the ally. By doing this, we can measure ceteris paribus the independent effects of government\u2019s beliefs on the individuals\u2019 decisions to support the pursuit of nuclear weapons. The text of the two condition appears below: (TrTrust) Trust: \u201cConsider that a powerful enemy country poses a big military threat to Brazil\u2019s survival. [The United States says it will protect Brazil and the Brazilian government trusts this promise.]\u201d (TrDistr) Distrust: \u201cConsider that a powerful enemy country poses a big military threat to Brazil\u2019s survival. [The United States says it will protect Brazil, yet the Brazilian government does not trust this promise].\u201d In treatments 3, 4, 5 and 6, we will prime the United States as the powerful and close ally because it is plausible to assume that Washington would indeed boost its security commitment to Brazil in the event of a significant military threat to Brazil, thereby mitigating Brazil\u2019s potential disposition to nuclearize. It is worth noting that we will have a multi-armed treatment, in which we eliminate the factorial questions that make little sense. In the full factorial design, we should have eight treatment conditions as the table below: High Threat Scenario Low Threat Scenario Protection No Protection Protection No Protection Credible Backup High Threat + Protection + Credible Backup High Threat + No Protection Credible Backup Low Threat + Protection + Credible Backup Low Threat + No Protection + Credible Backup Non-Credible Backup High Threat + Protection + Non-Credible Backup High Threat + No Protection Non-Credible Backup Low Threat + Protection + Non-Credible Backup Low Threat + No Protection + Non-Credible Backup However, there are conditions, such as when we have low threats, that protection makes no sense, and could potentially signal that the threat is actually high (why would a powerful country protect Brazil against a weak threat?). Other conditions, such as the ones involving no protection, should not be evaluated in terms of the credibility of the backup. Thus, our design assumes that we have no variation in the low threat scenario on the following table: High Threat Scenario Low Threat Scenario Protection No Protection Protection No Protection Credible Backup High Threat + Protection + Credible Backup High Threat + No Protection Low Threat Non-Credible Backup High Threat + Protection + Non-Credible Backup Such design requires imposing zeros throughout the entire combinations, so we prefer the multi-armed design as described in the previous page. It is worth noting that the multi-armed design decreases slightly the explanatory power, but it is clearer, facilitating non-specialist evaluations. The cursive formulation for our experiment is as follows: [A] With 1/7 of chance the enumerator reads: \u201cConsider that an enemy country that is weaker than Brazil poses a threat. Do you agree that Brazil should build a nuclear weapon to defend itself?\u201d [B] With 1/7 of chance the enumerator reads: \u201cConsider that Brazil does not have an enemy strong enough to threaten its survival. Do you agree that Brazil should build a nuclear weapon to defend itself?\u201d [C] With 1/7 of chance the enumerator reads: \u201cConsider that a powerful enemy country poses a big military threat to Brazil\u2019s survival. Do you agree that Brazil should build a nuclear weapon to defend itself even?\u201d [D] With 1/7 of chance the enumerator reads: \u201cConsider that a powerful enemy country poses a big military threat to Brazil\u2019s survival. The United States declares that it will not protect Brazil. Do you agree that Brazil should build a nuclear weapon to defend itself?\u201d [E] With 1/7 of chance the enumerator reads: \u201cConsider that a powerful enemy country poses a big military threat to Brazil\u2019s survival. The United States declares that it will protect Brazil. Do you agree that Brazil should build a nuclear weapon to defend itself?\u201d [F] With 1/7 of chance the enumerator reads: \u201cConsider that a powerful enemy country poses a big military threat to Brazil\u2019s survival. The United States says it will protect Brazil and the Brazilian government trusts in this promise. Do you agree that Brazil should build a nuclear weapon to defend itself?\u201d [G] With 1/7 of chance the enumerator reads: \u201cConsider that a powerful enemy country poses a big military threat to Brazil\u2019s survival. The United States says it will protect Brazil and the Brazilian government does not trust in this promise. Do you agree that Brazil should build a nuclear weapon to defend itself?\u201d The pairwise comparisons elicit the effect of each of the combinations of interest, in the likelihood of supporting the construction of a nuclear weapon by nuclear latent Brazil: \u2022 The effect of varying levels of threat on the likelihood of supporting the pursuit of nuclear weapons: compare [A], [B], [C] \u2022 The effect of not having a superpower nuclear guarantor, conditional on high threat, on the likelihood of supporting the pursuit of nuclear weapons: compare [D] with [C]. \u2022 The effect of having a superpower nuclear guarantor, conditional on high threat, on the likelihood of supporting the pursuit of nuclear weapons: compare [E] with [C]. \u2022 The effect of the government trusting in a superpower nuclear guarantor, conditional on high threat and superpower nuclear guarantor, on the likelihood of supporting the pursuit of nuclear weapons: compare [F] with [D]. \u2022 The effect of the government not trusting in a superpower nuclear guarantor, conditional on high threat and superpower nuclear guarantor, on the likelihood of supporting the pursuit of nuclear weapons: compare [G] with [D]. Hypothesis Hypothesis of Interest H.1 Main effect of threat: In general, oppositional individuals are more likely to inflate security threats than sportsmanlike individuals. H.1.1. Oppositional nationalists will be more likely to inflate security threats and to possess the willingness to pursue nuclear weapons. H.1.2. Oppositional subalterns will be more likely to inflate security threats but they do not possess the willingness to pursue nuclear weapons. H.1.3. Sportsmanlike nationalist and subaltern will be more likely to minimize security threats and therefore lack the willingness to pursue nuclear weapons. In order to measure the extent to which the research design succeeds in analyzing the independent effect of a powerful ally over the individual\u2019s decision to support the pursuit of a nuclear weapon, we will test the following hypotheses: H.2 Main effect of superpower nuclear guarantee: In general, oppositional individuals are more likely to seek superpower nuclear guarantees than sportsmanlike individuals when the level of threat is constant. H.2.1. Oppositional nationalists will be more likely to be ambiguous on the matter of nuclear guarantees than oppositional subalterns will. H.2.2. Sportsmanlike subaltern individuals will be more likely to be ambiguous to unlikely on the matter of nuclear guarantees than sportsmanlike nationalists will."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "Sample Size and Recruitment We will recruit a nationally representative sample of the Brazilian population using the survey company Datafolha, a national leading institute for the study of public opinion. Respondents will be over 18 years old and balanced quotas will ensure that the sample is broadly representative of the Brazilian population. The survey quotas are representative at the regional level, balanced by gender and age. We will use block randomization to ensure that our treatment will be administered with equal probability within each blocking bracket. This concern is intended to increase the testing power of our statistics. Analyses Balanced tests We will receive the data from Datafolha with the following pre-treatment variables: 1. Gender 2. Age 3. Country region 4. Education 5. Income (personal and family) 6. Municipality size 7. Religion The sample will be blocked at the Gender-Age-Region levels. We detail the blocking below. To ensure balance, we will test the following pre-treatment variables against our treatment schedule. The averages of these variables, within each group, should remain constant. Social Dominance Orientation (SOD) and Universal Modes of Values Scale We will construct the Social Dominance Scale by taking the Pratto et al (1994)\u2019s six items, and the Values Scale by taking Schwartz (1992)\u2019s ten items and extracting a Principal Component Analysis. The range of the principal component will be then cross-checked against the actual variables to ensure that the variable is increasing in the direction of more social dominance. We will extract the Principal Components using the R function factanal with \u2018regression\u2019 scores. National identity variable construction To construct the national identity indicator we will take the variables in bloc 2 in a heterogeneous effect approach, as each response here maps to a given national identity conception formulated by Hymans (2006). We expect to find the following heterogeneous effects: 1. For Oppositional nationalists: Oppositional nationalists want their countries to acquire nuclear weapons. They are also likely to promote the development of indigenous nuclear technology and reject the non-proliferation regime. Their posture vis-\u00e0-vis nuclear guarantees is ambiguous. Although they are likely to avoid falling under a superpower\u2019s tutelage, they will probably accept the protection from a superpower since security is stronger motivator than pride (Hymans 2006, 38). 2. For Oppositional subalterns: Oppositional subalterns do not want to acquire nuclear weapons because they see these weapons as something beyond their country\u2019s abilities. For the same reason, they should reject pursuing nuclear technological autonomy. Moreover, the individuals holding this profile should consider resisting the NPT. Thus, seeking a superpower nuclear guarantee is the most preferable policy to reduce their insecurity feeling (Hymans 2006, 39-40). 3. For Sportsmanlike nationalists: Sportsmanlike nationalists do not want nuclear weapons because they do not to fear when involved in strategic interactions with key comparison others. For the same reason, they rejected superpower nuclear guarantee that would make them fall needlessly under the \u201csuperpower tutelage.\u201d However, sportsmanlike nationalists for reasons of self-expression normally are interested in pursuing nuclear technological autonomy to foment national development and raise the international prestige of their country. These self-expressive elements of their nuclear policy stance also seem to make them resist the non-proliferation regime due to its nature and discriminatory content (Hymans 2006, 39). 4. For Sportsmanlike subalterns: Sportsmanlike subalterns do not seek nuclear weapons because they have neither the motivation nor the security need to do so. Additionally, they do not see any reason to seek a nuclear umbrella or pursue a level of nuclear autonomy beyond what is efficient in economic terms and or to stay outside and resist to the NPT (Hymans 2006, 40). As the construction of the categories can have a substantial correlation between the two types of national identity, we will also use the results of a Principal Component Analysis, extracting two orthogonal components that represent Nationalism and Oppositionism, and we will then use the median in both levels to compare them. The feasibility of this strategy will depend on the correlation within the two components measuring each item. As a disclaimer, we believe that this analysis will be exploratory. With two components measuring each national identity category, there is limited variability in the underlying data to provide a more robust comparison. Finally, as our heterogeneous effects assume an increasingly nationalist or oppositional effect in each of the categories, we will report the results for first and last quartiles. The coefficient size should have the same sign as the coefficients in the main regressions, but it should be overall higher. We cannot ensure significance here, as the quartiles reduce the sample size substantially. This part should be considered as a robustness check for our theory. Robustness checks To access the robustness of our results we will perform the analysis with: 1. Mansky Bounds for missing data. 2. Randomization inference for each of the previous models. 3. The sensitivity to the addition of pre-treatment covariates. 4. Varying the cutoffs on heterogeneous effects, which have an impact on power statistics. 5. Jackknife to ensure our results are not driven by outlier responses. Experimental analysis We will analyze the overall impact of our intervention using the series of models below: 1. A linear regression model with each component of the treatment and the dichotomized responses in the outcome variable. 2. A linear regression model with each component of the treatment and the responses in the outcome variable. 3. The above models with the inverse probability weights for each of the blocks (the most adequate model, as the blocks vary in size). 4. A multilevel probit, as the responses are ordinal and discrete. We will use robust standard errors for all the models. There is no need for clustering, as the treatment assignment has similar probabilities within each model."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Brazil"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "1900 respondents"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "IRB CEPH-FGV 124/2019"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "10/29/19"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q27": {"extra": [], "value": "Instituto DataFolha (one of the leading Brazilian polling companies"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q30": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design", "Survey Methodology"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Governance"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e387613fa39b7017d1df25d", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/jn3up/providers/osfstorage/5e387613fa39b7017d1df25d", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/jn3up/providers/osfstorage/5e387613fa39b7017d1df25d", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/jn3up/providers/osfstorage/5e387613fa39b7017d1df25d?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/jn3up/providers/osfstorage/5e387613fa39b7017d1df25d"}, "attributes": {"etag": "481834dae642765d3b8948a7fe984ad548f41f1f32f84f3557d881a7a0296a53", "kind": "file", "name": "20191219AA_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e387613fa39b7017d1df25d", "size": 268498, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "5cf0991c86d629fa4a282dcd6ec6d811", "sha256": "cec726051ee71a5b3b283b10e14d770623211ebd31389be8a23d91d80dbed64c"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 268498, "modified": "2020-02-03T19:35:47.436086+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "jn3up", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20191219AA_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T19:35:47+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "jn3up", "sha256": "cec726051ee71a5b3b283b10e14d770623211ebd31389be8a23d91d80dbed64c", "viewUrl": "/project/bmfsd/files/osfstorage/5e38761757427b01790c614c/", "selectedFileName": "20191219AA_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20191219AA_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Strategic nuclear proliferation and public opinion", "q2": "Guilherme Fasolin | Lucas Perez Florentino | Umberto Mignozzetti | Matias Spektor", "q3": "20191219AA", "q4": "12/19/2019 - 23:30", "q5": "We would like to thank Nuno Monteiro for his insightful comments on the pre-analysis plan.", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to researcher access to outcome data", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "12/15/19", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "We propose to investigate citizen attitudes towards the pursuit of nuclear weapons in Brazil. More specifically, we seek to understand how national identity conceptions shape national audience views on the utility of nuclear. In order to do this, we will field a survey experiment to a nationally representative sample.", "q16": "Experimental design The experiment design consists of three sequential sections. The first measures the public\u2019s national identity conceptions. The second investigates how these national identity conceptions shape nuclear preferences, particularly with regards to the acquisition of nuclear weapons. The last section runs experimental scenarios of strategic interaction. We will analyze the data in two stages. In the first one we will randomly vary three main components - threat level, backup from an ally, and the perceived credibility of that backup. This will allow us to study the effects of differential threat scenarios on the public\u2019s support for proliferation. In the second stage, we will investigate whether groups that rank extreme in national identity conceptions have heterogeneous reactions to each of the randomly assigned scenarios. Dispositional instrument Survey participants will answer a list of questions that serve as dispositional measures. Our end goal is to actually test Hymans\u2019s (2006) typology of national identity conceptions, namely oppositional nationalist; sportsmanlike nationalist; oppositional subaltern; and sportsmanlike subaltern. But in order to do so we first need to operationalize the solidarity and status dimension upon which each one of these types rest. We therefore draw on Shalom Schwartz\u2019s universal model of values (1992, 1994) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) (Pratto et al 1994). Schwartz\u2019s theory of values measures solidarity through ten broad values that structure the overall life in society: benevolence, universalism, self-direction, stimulation, hedonism, achievement, power, security, conformity and tradition. For the purpose of this study, we focus on those values that foment prosocial bonds between individuals as well as solidarity and cohesion against internal and external threats. These allow us to distinguish between the dichotomizing (oppositional) and transcendent (sportsmanlike) identity conceptions, as proposed by Hymans (2006, 22). An oppositional identity is built on black-white, \u201cus versus them\u201d dichotomies. Such national identity conception is more likely to be hold by individuals that score high on conservation values such as security, conformity, and tradition. Those who embrace these values are driven by the conception that the world is a dangerous and threatening place. Thus, they seek \u201cin-group solidarity to protect from internal and external threats...which inhibit a sense of global identity and cosmopolitanism\u201d (Rathbun et al 2016, 128). In other words, it is reasonable to expect that an individual holding conservation values have a basic sense that \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cthey\u201d stand for different interests and values. By contrast, a transcendent identity conception provides a \u201csense of basic commonality\u201d which produces the feeling of a world made of \u201cus and them\u201d (Hymans 2006). This identity is likely to be more commonly held by individuals that score high on universalism, a value associated with \u201ca belief in the interdependent nature of international relations and a commitment to the collective resolution of common problems\u201d (Rathbun et al, 2016, 128). Universalism also emphasizes acceptance of and concern for other individuals, society, groups, and even the global community, which facilitate cooperation and allow for a higher degree of social organization (Rathbun et al 2016). In order to measure the status dimension, we rely on an actor\u2019s dispositional characteristic called SDO. SDO is a personality value that measures individual preferences for \u201cinequality among social groups\u201d (Pratto et al, 1994, 91). It focuses on the vertical dimension of self-other comparison, which is essential to determine status hierarchies. Thus, high-SDO individuals are more likely to view dominance hierarchies favorably even when they are legitimate and believe or desire that their own groups \u201cdominate and be superior to out-groups\u201d (Pratto et al 1994, 742). Such perception provides a sense of hierarchy that underscores the status dimension proposed by Hymans (2006). SDO is a measure that has good internal reliability, is stable over time and has adequate convergent and discriminant validity. By crossing these two psychological measures \u2013 solidarity and status - , we provide the foundations for spreading our sample population across Hymans\u2019s four ideal-type NICs: oppositional nationalist; sportsmanlike nationalist; oppositional subaltern; and sportsmanlike subaltern. Table below show how these NICs position in relation to each other. Source: Hymans (2006, 25) Social Dominance Orientation We use a 6-item SDO scale based on Pratto et al. (1994). Please read each description and indicate your agreement with each item. All scaled from 1 (strong agree) to 7 (strong disagree). Items 4 and 6 are reverse-coded. 1. It is okay if some groups have more of a chance in life than others. 2. Inferior groups should stay in their place. 3. To get ahead in life, it is sometimes okay to step on other groups. 4. We should have increased social equality. 5. It would be good if groups could be equal. 6. We should do what we can to equalize conditions for different groups. Universal model of values We use solely values that fall in the self-transcendence and conservation superordinate category. Here we briefly describe some people. Please read each description and tick the box on each line that shows how much each person is or is not like you. \u2013 Very much like me \u2013 Like me \u2013 Somewhat like me \u2013 A little like me \u2013 Not like me \u2013 Not like me at all Universalism 1. He thinks it is important that every person in the world should be treated equally. He believes everyone should have equal opportunities in life. 2. He wants everyone to be treated justly, even people he doesn\u2019t know. It is important to him to protect the weak in society Benevolence 1. It is important to him to be loyal to his friends. He wants to devote himself to people close to him. 2. It is important to him to respond to the needs of others. He tries to support those he knows. Security 1. It is important to him to live in secure surroundings. He avoids anything that might endanger his safety. 2. Having a stable society is important to him. He is concerned that the social order be protected. Conformity 1. He believes that people should do what they\u2019re told. He thinks people should follow rules at all times, even when no one is watching. 2. It is important to him to be obedient. He believes he should always show respect to his parents and to older people. Tradition 1. It is important to him to be humble and modest. He tries not to draw attention to himself. 2. Tradition is important to him. He tries to follow the customs handed down by his religion or his family. Nuclear Preferences Once we identify how the public rank themselves on Hymans\u2019 national identity conception framework, we proceed to map respondent policy preferences on nuclear affairs. How much do you agree with the following statements? Strongly Agree Agree Disagree Strongly Disagree (a) In order to feel safe in the world, Brazil needs the protection of an allied country with nuclear weapons. (b) Brazil should build its own nuclear weapons. (c) Brazil should be able to design its own nuclear weapon, but shouldn\u2019t build it. (d) Brazil should resist the non-proliferation regime because of its discriminatory character of dividing the world into nuclear \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots\u201d. Experiment We will run a vignette experiment with the treatment and control conditions for the phrasing. We will then ask the respondents to rank their agreement with the hypothetical pursuit of a nuclear weapon. Our purpose is to determine the public\u2019s likelihood to support the pursuit of nuclear weapons while randomly varying threat level, stronger ally backup, and the perceived credibility of that backup. The vignette experiment will start with the enumerator reading the following text for all participants: \u201cEveryone talks about Brazil's security in relation to other countries in the world. We will create different imaginary scenarios and ask what you think of each one.\u201d In treatments 1, 2 and 3, we intend to uncover the independent effects that the level of military threat has on the individual\u2019s decision to support the pursuit of nuclear weapons. Some respondents will read that Brazil faces a significant security threat; other respondents will read that Brazil faces a relatively low security threat; and other respondents will read that Brazil does not face a security threat. The texts of the three conditions are as follows: (TrH) High threat: \u201cConsider that a powerful enemy country poses a big military threat to Brazil\u2019s survival.\u201d (TrL) Low Threat: \u201cConsider that a weak enemy country poses a threat to Brazil.\u201d Without Threat: \u201cConsider that Brazil does not have an enemy strong enough to threaten its survival.\u201d The next step will be to identify the effects of the superpower nuclear guarantee on the public decision to pursue nuclear weapons. Thus, in treatments 3 and 4 we will randomize two conditions: one in which the U.S. government offers protection to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 when the latter faces high security threats and another in which the U.S. governments decides not to grant the protection. The texts of the two conditions are as follows: (TrP) Protection: \u201cConsider that a powerful enemy country poses a big military threat to Brazil\u2019s survival. [The United States says it will protect Brazil].\u201d (TrNP) Non-Protection: \u201cConsider that a powerful enemy country poses a big military threat to Brazil\u2019s survival. [The United States says it will not protect Brazil].\u201d In treatments 5 and 6, we will repeat the scenarios of treatments 3 and 4 and randomize two additional scenarios: one in which the potential proliferator trusts the powerful ally\u2019s willingness to mitigate the former\u2019s security threats, and one in which the potential proliferator distrust the commitment to protection made by the ally. By doing this, we can measure ceteris paribus the independent effects of government\u2019s beliefs on the individuals\u2019 decisions to support the pursuit of nuclear weapons. The text of the two condition appears below: (TrTrust) Trust: \u201cConsider that a powerful enemy country poses a big military threat to Brazil\u2019s survival. [The United States says it will protect Brazil and the Brazilian government trusts this promise.]\u201d (TrDistr) Distrust: \u201cConsider that a powerful enemy country poses a big military threat to Brazil\u2019s survival. [The United States says it will protect Brazil, yet the Brazilian government does not trust this promise].\u201d In treatments 3, 4, 5 and 6, we will prime the United States as the powerful and close ally because it is plausible to assume that Washington would indeed boost its security commitment to Brazil in the event of a significant military threat to Brazil, thereby mitigating Brazil\u2019s potential disposition to nuclearize. It is worth noting that we will have a multi-armed treatment, in which we eliminate the factorial questions that make little sense. In the full factorial design, we should have eight treatment conditions as the table below: High Threat Scenario Low Threat Scenario Protection No Protection Protection No Protection Credible Backup High Threat + Protection + Credible Backup High Threat + No Protection Credible Backup Low Threat + Protection + Credible Backup Low Threat + No Protection + Credible Backup Non-Credible Backup High Threat + Protection + Non-Credible Backup High Threat + No Protection Non-Credible Backup Low Threat + Protection + Non-Credible Backup Low Threat + No Protection + Non-Credible Backup However, there are conditions, such as when we have low threats, that protection makes no sense, and could potentially signal that the threat is actually high (why would a powerful country protect Brazil against a weak threat?). Other conditions, such as the ones involving no protection, should not be evaluated in terms of the credibility of the backup. Thus, our design assumes that we have no variation in the low threat scenario on the following table: High Threat Scenario Low Threat Scenario Protection No Protection Protection No Protection Credible Backup High Threat + Protection + Credible Backup High Threat + No Protection Low Threat Non-Credible Backup High Threat + Protection + Non-Credible Backup Such design requires imposing zeros throughout the entire combinations, so we prefer the multi-armed design as described in the previous page. It is worth noting that the multi-armed design decreases slightly the explanatory power, but it is clearer, facilitating non-specialist evaluations. The cursive formulation for our experiment is as follows: [A] With 1/7 of chance the enumerator reads: \u201cConsider that an enemy country that is weaker than Brazil poses a threat. Do you agree that Brazil should build a nuclear weapon to defend itself?\u201d [B] With 1/7 of chance the enumerator reads: \u201cConsider that Brazil does not have an enemy strong enough to threaten its survival. Do you agree that Brazil should build a nuclear weapon to defend itself?\u201d [C] With 1/7 of chance the enumerator reads: \u201cConsider that a powerful enemy country poses a big military threat to Brazil\u2019s survival. Do you agree that Brazil should build a nuclear weapon to defend itself even?\u201d [D] With 1/7 of chance the enumerator reads: \u201cConsider that a powerful enemy country poses a big military threat to Brazil\u2019s survival. The United States declares that it will not protect Brazil.

Do you agree that Brazil should build a nuclear weapon to defend itself?\u201d The pairwise comparisons elicit the effect of each of the combinations of interest, in the likelihood of supporting the construction of a nuclear weapon by nuclear latent Brazil: \u2022 The effect of varying levels of threat on the likelihood of supporting the pursuit of nuclear weapons: compare [A], [B], [C] \u2022 The effect of not having a superpower nuclear guarantor, conditional on high threat, on the likelihood of supporting the pursuit of nuclear weapons: compare [D] with [C]. \u2022 The effect of having a superpower nuclear guarantor, conditional on high threat, on the likelihood of supporting the pursuit of nuclear weapons: compare [E] with [C]. \u2022 The effect of the government trusting in a superpower nuclear guarantor, conditional on high threat and superpower nuclear guarantor, on the likelihood of supporting the pursuit of nuclear weapons: compare [F] with [D]. \u2022 The effect of the government not trusting in a superpower nuclear guarantor, conditional on high threat and superpower nuclear guarantor, on the likelihood of supporting the pursuit of nuclear weapons: compare [G] with [D]. Hypothesis Hypothesis of Interest H.1 Main effect of threat: In general, oppositional individuals are more likely to inflate security threats than sportsmanlike individuals. H.1.1. Oppositional nationalists will be more likely to inflate security threats and to possess the willingness to pursue nuclear weapons. H.1.2. Oppositional subalterns will be more likely to inflate security threats but they do not possess the willingness to pursue nuclear weapons. H.1.3. Sportsmanlike nationalist and subaltern will be more likely to minimize security threats and therefore lack the willingness to pursue nuclear weapons. In order to measure the extent to which the research design succeeds in analyzing the independent effect of a powerful ally over the individual\u2019s decision to support the pursuit of a nuclear weapon, we will test the following hypotheses: H.2 Main effect of superpower nuclear guarantee: In general, oppositional individuals are more likely to seek superpower nuclear guarantees than sportsmanlike individuals when the level of threat is constant. H.2.1. Oppositional nationalists will be more likely to be ambiguous on the matter of nuclear guarantees than oppositional subalterns will. H.2.2. Sportsmanlike subaltern individuals will be more likely to be ambiguous to unlikely on the matter of nuclear guarantees than sportsmanlike nationalists will.", "q17": "Sample Size and Recruitment We will recruit a nationally representative sample of the Brazilian population using the survey company Datafolha, a national leading institute for the study of public opinion. Respondents will be over 18 years old and balanced quotas will ensure that the sample is broadly representative of the Brazilian population. The survey quotas are representative at the regional level, balanced by gender and age. We will use block randomization to ensure that our treatment will be administered with equal probability within each blocking bracket. This concern is intended to increase the testing power of our statistics. Analyses Balanced tests We will receive the data from Datafolha with the following pre-treatment variables: 1. Gender 2. Age 3. Country region 4. Education 5. Income (personal and family) 6. Municipality size 7. Religion The sample will be blocked at the Gender-Age-Region levels. We detail the blocking below. To ensure balance, we will test the following pre-treatment variables against our treatment schedule. The averages of these variables, within each group, should remain constant. Social Dominance Orientation (SOD) and Universal Modes of Values Scale We will construct the Social Dominance Scale by taking the Pratto et al (1994)\u2019s six items, and the Values Scale by taking Schwartz (1992)\u2019s ten items and extracting a Principal Component Analysis. The range of the principal component will be then cross-checked against the actual variables to ensure that the variable is increasing in the direction of more social dominance. We will extract the Principal Components using the R function factanal with \u2018regression\u2019 scores. National identity variable construction To construct the national identity indicator we will take the variables in bloc 2 in a heterogeneous effect approach, as each response here maps to a given national identity conception formulated by Hymans (2006). We expect to find the following heterogeneous effects: 1. For Oppositional nationalists: Oppositional nationalists want their countries to acquire nuclear weapons. They are also likely to promote the development of indigenous nuclear technology and reject the non-proliferation regime. Their posture vis-\u00e0-vis nuclear guarantees is ambiguous. Although they are likely to avoid falling under a superpower\u2019s tutelage, they will probably accept the protection from a superpower since security is stronger motivator than pride (Hymans 2006, 38). 2. For Oppositional subalterns: Oppositional subalterns do not want to acquire nuclear weapons because they see these weapons as something beyond their country\u2019s abilities. For the same reason, they should reject pursuing nuclear technological autonomy. Moreover, the individuals holding this profile should consider resisting the NPT. Thus, seeking a superpower nuclear guarantee is the most preferable policy to reduce their insecurity feeling (Hymans 2006, 39-40). 3. For Sportsmanlike nationalists: Sportsmanlike nationalists do not want nuclear weapons because they do not to fear when involved in strategic interactions with key comparison others. For the same reason, they rejected superpower nuclear guarantee that would make them fall needlessly under the \u201csuperpower tutelage.\u201d However, sportsmanlike nationalists for reasons of self-expression normally are interested in pursuing nuclear technological autonomy to foment national development and raise the international prestige of their country. These self-expressive elements of their nuclear policy stance also seem to make them resist the non-proliferation regime due to its nature and discriminatory content (Hymans 2006, 39). 4. For Sportsmanlike subalterns: Sportsmanlike subalterns do not seek nuclear weapons because they have neither the motivation nor the security need to do so. Additionally, they do not see any reason to seek a nuclear umbrella or pursue a level of nuclear autonomy beyond what is efficient in economic terms and or to stay outside and resist to the NPT (Hymans 2006, 40). As the construction of the categories can have a substantial correlation between the two types of national identity, we will also use the results of a Principal Component Analysis, extracting two orthogonal components that represent Nationalism and Oppositionism, and we will then use the median in both levels to compare them. The feasibility of this strategy will depend on the correlation within the two components measuring each item. As a disclaimer, we believe that this analysis will be exploratory. With two components measuring each national identity category, there is limited variability in the underlying data to provide a more robust comparison. Finally, as our heterogeneous effects assume an increasingly nationalist or oppositional effect in each of the categories, we will report the results for first and last quartiles. The coefficient size should have the same sign as the coefficients in the main regressions, but it should be overall higher. We cannot ensure significance here, as the quartiles reduce the sample size substantially. This part should be considered as a robustness check for our theory. Robustness checks To access the robustness of our results we will perform the analysis with: 1. Mansky Bounds for missing data. 2. Randomization inference for each of the previous models. 3. The sensitivity to the addition of pre-treatment covariates. 4. Varying the cutoffs on heterogeneous effects, which have an impact on power statistics. 5. Jackknife to ensure our results are not driven by outlier responses. Experimental analysis We will analyze the overall impact of our intervention using the series of models below: 1. A linear regression model with each component of the treatment and the dichotomized responses in the outcome variable. 2. A linear regression model with each component of the treatment and the responses in the outcome variable. 3. The above models with the inverse probability weights for each of the blocks (the most adequate model, as the blocks vary in size). 4. A multilevel probit, as the responses are ordinal and discrete. We will use robust standard errors for all the models. There is no need for clustering, as the treatment assignment has similar probabilities within each model.", "q18": "Brazil", "q19": "1900 respondents", "q20": "Yes", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23":

We do so in a natural setting, following the French Government's launch of a series of Citizen Assemblies in 2019, one of the most ambitious efforts to date to use Citizen Assemblies in the political life of an advanced democracy as a response to contemporary issues (social and economic inequalities, feelings of being left out and voice-less, deterioration of social capitals).

The dependent variables are: the size of their networks; the partisan composition of their networks; the impact of their network structures on voter engagement; and the degree of spillover among network members. 2. We are testing the network hypothesis with an experiment using the VoterCircle outreach platform in California\u2019s Central Valley. The dependent variable is turnout.
