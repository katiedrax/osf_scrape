There is evidence that naturally cycling women in their fertile phase, compared to their luteal phase, evaluate specific behavioral cues in men as more attractive for sexual relationships. However, recent research has cast doubt on these findings. We addressed this debate in a large, pre-registered within-subject study including salivary hormone measures and luteinizing hormone tests. One-hundred-fifty-seven female participants rated natural videos of 70 men in dyadic intersexual interactions on sexual and long-term attractiveness. Multilevel comparisons across two ovulatory cycles indicated that women\u2019s mate preferences for men\u2019s behaviors did not shift across the cycle, neither for competitive, nor for courtship behavior. Hormone levels and relationship status did not affect these results. Hormonal mechanisms and implications for estrus theories are discussed.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-02-27T15:06:14.631228", "date_modified":

"description": "Self-regulation of behavior is an essential ability for living a healthy and productive life. It matures during adolescence, when self-regulation failures are still likely to be involved in higher risk taking and behaviors that increase vulnerability. Most studies have addressed this issue considering development over chronological ages, which happens in tandem with changes in adolescents\u2019 environment and social milieu, as well as with changes in pubertal status. The timing and tempo of pubertal development, however, varies widely among individuals and so it is not adequately represented by age. Recent studies have suggested that puberty may in fact be a more important factor in determining brain and behavioral changes in adolescence than age. Understanding how puberty influences the development of self-regulation may therefore enable a better understanding of how this crucial function develops during adolescence, which could in turn be useful for designing public policies for prevention and intervention to promote adolescents\u2019 health and well-being, to create better educational strategies and to determine adolescents\u2019 rights and their accountability. Recent years have seen a growing interest on puberty, which led to an increasing number of studies incorporating measures of pubertal status. But how much knowledge about the effects of puberty on self-regulation have we gained from these studies? How much progress have we made in disentangling the effects of puberty on self-regulation from the effects of other changes happening during adolescence, such as those more closely correlated with increases in age or grades? To answer these questions we will apply the methods of systematic review to locate and integrate the literature studying the development of self-regulation along pubertal development.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-02-27T17:15:32.957629", "date_modified": "2020-02-27T17:19:39.383234", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": null, "analytics_key": "66ed16319b9251ca7c8cbda72efdc3d31bd895090c2f3d14389196d1b228fa1cb70392e392a0b446eb941737fcc9fbb7e67ff9a5addfe3fe321e57d1b6620a541a364a2578195202ad1ac358c2d771b1f0679d644a0bc758ef55a140abf345369f031ec2b55c369e0ff912c7b32271478ff06b995bfa8835cfcab8d3e5bc44e8dc2b08d498a7a090bc19aacc5c6f0596", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-02-27T17:15:32.941346", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Open-Ended Registration", "registered_meta": {"summary": {"extra": [], "value": "This registration contains a protocol for a systematic review of the development of self-regulation during pubertal development.

The investigators will also work closely with institutional officials to assess whether the intervention can improve student well-being. Specifically, the project aims to teach freshman students (who are at high risk for depression) skills in how to foster a mindful response to adversity at the beginning of the school term, along with periodic support reminders (via text message) during high stress/vulnerability periods over the course of the semester. The investigators will adopt a randomized controlled trial approach to rigorously evaluate whether this intervention can be adopted as a standard onboarding program for all incoming freshman students during the first weeks of orientation on the CMU campus. Participants will come for the study session and provide a dried blood spot sample and complete a battery of self-report questionnaires. \n \nWe have conducted a number of trials showing that brief mindfulness training programs can foster stress resistance and health among young adults, compared to other helpful stress management programs that include relaxation and problem-solving training (for a review, see Creswell, 2017; also see Lindsay et al., 2018). The purpose of this project is to boil down this evidence-based mindfulness research approach to a more simple, scalable, and impactful mindfulness-based wise intervention that is delivered in an hour training session, and then is supported throughout the semester with text message reminders during high-risk periods (which we are calling mindfulness microhits). This intervention approach is wise in that it targets and trains mindfulness in contexts where there\u2019s adversity among high-risk students, teaching them skills in being more equanimous and non-judgmental of their experiences (as opposed to being critical and evaluative). Futhermore, the training session also includes a high stakes academic performance task (where we will also measure the stress hormone cortisol via saliva samples), offering participants a chance to implement and practice their resilience skills.\nThe CMU administration has asked our lab to generate interventions and solutions to improving student mental health in the coming year. The purpose of this study is to conduct a study testing a new mindful response to adversity intervention among our students. If this study is successful we will work closely with the CMU administration to administer this resilience intervention to all incoming freshman in future years, and make our intervention program materials available to other schools that want to improve the mental health and academic performance of their students."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Primary Outcome Measure:\n\n1.Daily Depression\nIn a daily diary, participants are asked at the end of the day to identify the extent to which they endorse symptoms measuring depressive symptomatology (i.e. \"feeling hopeless about the future\", \"feeling blue\") for that day.\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing lower daily depressive symptomatology at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group. \n\n\n[Time Frame: Change in daily depression assessed daily for seven days during week 2 and week 16 of the study.]\n\n2.Depression I\nEvaluated using the validated 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), which is designed to measure characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. The score for each item ranges between 0-3, where 0 denotes less depression (e.g. \"I do not feel sad\") and 3 denotes more depression (e.g. \"I am so dan and unhappy that I can't stand it\"). Total score will be between 0-63, where 0 indicates no depression and 63 indicates extreme depression. The score is a total of 21 questions and the following is a typical subscale range distribution:\n\n1-10: These ups and downs are considered normal 11-16: Mild mood disturbance 17-20: Borderline clinical depression 21-30: Moderate depression 31-40: Severe depression over 40: Extreme depression Analyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing lower depressive symptomatology at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based treatment group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in depression over 4-month period.]\n\nSecondary BDI: Because we were unable to obtain a sample of individuals with very high baseline, we will look at the median at baseline of BDI across all groups. Based on the histogram, we will determine a \"high-baseline BDI\" group and analyze the data for that group. We will test for a time by condition interaction showing lower daily depressive symptomatology at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.  If we do not have enough participants to analyze the data for high baseline BDI, we will run a test for a baseline BDI as a moderator. Group x time x baseline BDI. \n\n3.Depression II\nEvaluated using the validated 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D), which is designed to measure characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. There are 20 questions and the score for each item ranges between 0-3. For most questions, a lower score indicates lack of depression and a higher score indicates high depression (e.g. in response to the statement \"I felt fearful\" a 0 indicates rarely and 3 indicates most or all of the time). Questions 4, 8, 12, and 16 are reverse scored. The score is the sum of the 20 questions. Possible range is 0-60. A score of 16 points or more is considered depressed.\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing lower depressive symptomatology at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based treatment group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in depression over 4-month period.]\n4.Daily Social Connection\nFollowing Hawkley et al. (2007) and our previous studies, end-of-day daily diary questions will assess the amount of time spent interacting with others and the extent to which social interactions throughout the day were perceived as positive. Example items: \"How much time did you spend today with others, talking or listening to them?\" (0 = little or none of the day to 4 = most or all of the day) and \"How many positive interactions did you have today (e.g., supportive, enjoyable, rewarding, affirming)?\" (0 = one, 1 = several, 2 = many).\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing increased daily social connection at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in daily social connection assessed daily for seven days during week 2 and week 16 of the study.]\n5.Daily Belonging\nEnd-of-day daily diary questions will measure feelings of belonging and closeness at school. Example items: \"I felt like I belong in school\" and \"I felt like no one really knew me well at school (reverse-scored)\" (0= Not at all, 4= Extremely).\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing increased daily social belonging at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in loneliness over 4-month period.]\n6.Loneliness\nEvaluated using the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale. The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness scale is designed to measure one's subjective feelings of loneliness as well as feelings of social isolation. A 20-item scale designed to measure one's subjective feelings of loneliness as well as feelings of social isolation. Participants rate each item as either A (\"I always feels this way\"), O (\"I often feel this way\"), S (\"I sometimes feel this way\"), R (\"I rarely feel this way\"), N (\"I never feel this way\"). Scores are summed from each item and higher scores indicate greater degrees of loneliness. Scores of 15-20 indicate average level of loneliness; 21-30 indicate frequent loneliness; 31-40 indicate severe loneliness.\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing decreased loneliness at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in loneliness over 4-month period.]\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n\nAcademic performance\nAcademic performance will be assessed using Grade Point Average (GPA). Analyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction higher GPA at post treatment (and follow-up) in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in GPA between semester immediately prior to enrollment and semester during enrollment in the study (approximately 5 months).]\nOccurrences of Daily Acceptance\nEnd-of-day perceptions of daily acceptance (used in Chin et al., under review) will be measured (Example questions\" Today, I was able to accept myself as I am\", \"Today, I've been judging the situation that I am in or the events that are occurring as good or bad\").\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing increased acceptance and non-judgment at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Assessed daily for seven days during week 2 and week 16 of the study.]\nPhysical Activity (FitBit)\nActivity data for number of steps will be assessed using a FitBit device worn by participants.\n\nMulti-level models will test for time by treatment interactions showing increased physical activity outcomes over time in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Assessed daily during week 2-17 of the study.]\nSleep (FitBit)\nActivity data for sleep will be assessed using a FitBit device worn by participants.\n\nMulti-level models will test for time by treatment interactions showing increased sleep outcomes over time in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Assessed daily during week 2-17 of the study.]\nConcentrations of pro-inflammatory gene expression\nGene expression measures of immune system function will be collected via dried blood spot collection method.\n\nMulti-level models will test for time by condition effects. Analyses will focus an a priori-specified gene regulation pattern involving increased expression of inflammation-related genes and decreased expression of antiviral gene - a pattern called the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA; Cole, 2012).\n\n[Time Frame: Change in gene expression over weeks 1 and weeks 17 of the study.]\nConcentrations of C-Reactive Protein\nCRP will be assessed through dried blood spots collected at baseline and post-intervention.\n\nChanges in CRP will be assessed using a time by group interaction.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in CRP over 4-month period.]\nConcentrations of salivary cortisol\nSaliva samples will be collected before and after the TSST, and assayed for salivary cortisol determination.\n\nSalivary cortisol will be analyzed both using area-under-the-curve (AUC) and mixed effects linear models, testing for a time by condition interaction showing that equanimity group has reduced cortisol reactivity to the TSST over time relative to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Four cortisol samples will be collected at the baseline session. One sample before and three samples after the acute stress challenge using the TSST.]\nPerceived Stress\nEvaluated using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The PSS measures the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. Individual scores on the PSS can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress.\n\nScores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress. Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress. Analyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing decreased reported stress at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in perceived stress over 4-month period.]\nSubjective Social Status\nCreated by health psychologist Nancy Adler and team (2000), the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status is a single-item measure that assesses a person's perceived rank relative to others in their group. Respondents view a drawing of a ladder with 10 rungs, and either read that the ladder represents where people stand in society. Respondents further read : \"At the top of the ladder are the people who are the best off, those who have the most money, most education, and best jobs. At the bottom are the people who are the worst off, those who have the least money, least education, worst jobs, or no job. Please place an 'X' on the rung that best represents where you think you stand on the ladder.\". Rungs are translated to numbers (1-10). Choosing higher rungs of the ladder (e.g. 10) indicates perception of higher social status and choosing lower rungs of the ladder (e.g. 1) indicates lower social status.\n\n[Time Frame: Measured at baseline only.]\nDaily Resilience using the Brief Resilience Scale\nEnd-of-day items will measure resilience over the course of the day. The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS, Smith et al. 2008) is a 6-item survey that assesses the ability to bounce back or recover from stress (e.g. \"It does not take me long to recover from a stressful event.\"). Some items are reverse scored and then all items are summed. Higher scores reflect more resilience. Analyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing increased resilience in daily life at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Assessed daily for seven days during week 2 and week 16 of the study.]\nDaily Occurrence of Stress and Successful Coping Scale\nEnd-of-day items will measure the perception of stress occurrence and types (e.g. \"concerns about academic performance\" or \"family concerns\") and overall perceptions of coping ability scale (e.g. Since the last survey, to what extent do you feel like your demands exceeded your ability to cope with them?\") over the course of the day. Scale ranges from 0=\"not at all true\" to 4 = \"extremely true\"), where higher scores indicate less successful coping (item 3 reverse scored).\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing decreased stress (and increased coping) in daily life at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Assessed daily for seven days during week 2 and week 16 of the study.]\nDaily State Mindfulness Scale\nEnd-of-day items will measure state mindfulness over the course of the day (e.g. \"I was thinking about something other than what I was currently doing\" is reverse scored). The scale ranges from 0=Strongly agree to 5= Strongly disagree. Higher scores indicate higher state mindfulness.\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing increased mindfulness in daily life at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Assessed daily for seven days during week 2 and week 16 of the study.]"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Interested participants will call or email our confidential lab account to set up a 10-minute pre-screening phone call. We will explain the study in greater depth and administer a screening questionnaire consistent with the inclusion and exclusion criteria specified. Participants will be full time adult (age 18+) freshman students at the CMU Pittsburgh campus, who own a data-enabled smartphone, and indicate moderate to high levels of depressive symptomatology (composite score &gt; or = 2 on the short-form Beck Depression inventory). Participants will be excluded from the study if they are non-English speaking or are unwilling or unable to complete study assessments and treatments.

Participants will come to the laboratory to receive an orientation to the study procedures and informed about the compensation structure, study timeline, and FAQs. Research staff will read the consent form and participants will provide informed consent. Participants will complete baseline psychometric surveys via a qualtrics questionnaire. Application of FitBit device and description of cortisol sample collection will occur. Heart rate will be taken as a measure of arousal of the autonomic stress response throughout the training session. Baseline gene expression and inflammation levels will be collected via dried blood spotting procedure. Participants will complete a post-DBS questionnaire immediately following the DBS collection. Cortisol will be collected at baseline and several times throughout the TSST-G via salivary samples using Salivette saliva collection tubes. Salivary cortisol sample, a measure of adrenocortical activity (thought to have high predictive value for psychosocial stress, i.e. Foley and Kirschbaum, 2010 and considered to be a reliable and valid indicator of the biologically active fraction of cortisol (Vining et al., 1983; Kirschbaum and Hellhammer, 1989, 1994)). Salivary cortisol samples will be assessed for cortisol concentrations via immunoassay. Participants will provide saliva samples several times throughout and following the TSST-G with a Salivette device (Sarstedt, Rommelsdorf, Germany), which consists of placing a cotton roll under the tongue for 2 minutes and then expectorating this roll back into a small plastic collection tube. Completed saliva samples will be stored in a secure -20\u00ba Celsius freezer immediately after sample collection. Samples will be stored until shipped on dry ice to a laboratory specializing in cortisol assays (we have a longstanding relationship with this lab (PI Kirschbaum). Assay of the saliva samples for cortisol determination will be conducted in a single batch using a chemoluminescence-immuno-assay with high sensitivity (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany). Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation from this laboratory are always below 10%. The salivary and FitBit measures we are collecting in this study are non-invasive and present minimal risk to participants. We have had no participant complaints or discomforts in collecting these measures in our previous studies.\n\nParticipants will then be randomly assigned to either the mindful response to adversity condition or the self-improvement condition.\n\nTraining &amp; Practice (45 min)\nParticipants will attend a group training session, lead by a professional instructor, about responding to adversity, which will include a description of the skills, a writing (participants will write about a self-chosen experience of stress in their lives and how they responded to it) and sharing activity focused on the proposed approach (participants will share with a small group of other participants about a time when they successfully responded to a stressful experience with equanimity), and a practice session. Following the training, participants will be instructed to practice the skills that they just learned during the next task (the TSST-G)\nThe treatment condition will be trained in techniques designed to teach a \u201cmindful approach to adversity\u201d. These techniques will include: normalizing, attention, equanimity, non-judgment, de-centering, accepting of experiences, and impermanence. Participants will be instructed on the mindset, asked to write about an instance of non-judgment and share with a partner, and then guided through a short training designed to practice each skill. Complete script for the treatment condition can be viewed here.\nThe control condition will be trained in techniques designed to teach a typical narrative self-analysis / strengths-based approach to adversity. Participants in the active control condition will be trained in a practice matched to the study condition, but with a focus on narrative self-focus (Watkins and Teasdale, 2001), which is centered on judging what is occurring, letting oneself follow trains of thoughts, examining aspects of oneself (e.g. think about why you react the way you do to adversity), and trying to figure out what beneficial responses to challenges would be. These techniques will include: choosing the best approach, minimizing stress, and identifying and enhancing personal strengths. Participants will be instructed on the mindset, asked to write about an instance of personal strength and share with a partner (participants will share with a small group of other participants about a time when they successfully responded to a stressful experience by using personal strengths), and then guided through a short training designed to practice each skill. All participants will be asked to create a short recording within 24 hours of the session talking about what they learned during the training sessions and any advice they would offer to future CMU students. Participants will be told that we are compiling a resource for next year\u2019s incoming first years to support them in responding to the stress of starting a new school and that we would like them to record a 1-2 minute audio clip describing how they have personally applied these mindsets and advice on how future students might use the mindset learned during your session to deal with their stressful experiences. They will be asked to: 1) Find a private room with no other people or sounds in the background, 2) Record themselves speaking for 1-2 minutes about the prompted materials (i.e. a review of the mindset discussed in each condition), and 3) Send the file to cmu.mindful@gmail.com within 24 hours of the study session. These recordings will not actually be shared with new students or made public at all. Study staff will listen to the recording to ensure completion of the activity. Participants will have this described to them during the debrief.\n\nGroup Social Stress Test (TSST-G), Cortisol Collection (30 min)\nProcedure - TSST-G task (30 min):\nIntroduction, Preparation, and Anticipation Phase (10 min)\nPublic speaking task (mock job interview) in groups of 5-6 people (12 min).\nMental arithmetic task (serial subtraction) (8 min)\n\nParticipants will perform a challenge task, the Trier Social Stress Test for Groups (TSST-G), which includes psychosocially stressful components (i.e., socio-evaluative threat and uncontrollability). The TSST-G will consist of a 5-min public speaking task (mock job interview) and a subsequent 5-min mental arithmetic task (serial subtraction) performed out loud in front of a panel of two unfamiliar evaluators and a conspicuous video camera while in a room with 5-6 other participants. These exercises are an adapted version of the Trier Social Stress Test (Kirschbaum et al., 1993), which is a common laboratory challenge task that has been approved by the IRB and used in many behavioral studies, including several studies in our lab (e.g. Creswell et al., 2005). Participants will be given instructions for the upcoming performance task; specifically, that they will have to give a 2-minute speech in front of their peers detailing why they should be hired for a specific job position and convince evaluators (two study confederates) that they should receive a job offer. Two evaluators (wearing white lab coats and equipped with clip boards) will enter and direct the actual performance tasks (lasting 10 minutes). The evaluators are trained to act in a non-accepting manner toward the participant\u2019s performance during these tasks.

The score for each item ranges between 0-3, where 0 denotes less depression (e.g. \"I do not feel sad\") and 3 denotes more depression (e.g. \"I am so dan and unhappy that I can't stand it\"). Total score will be between 0-63, where 0 indicates no depression and 63 indicates extreme depression. The score is a total of 21 questions and the following is a typical subscale range distribution:\n\n1-10: These ups and downs are considered normal 11-16: Mild mood disturbance 17-20: Borderline clinical depression 21-30: Moderate depression 31-40: Severe depression over 40: Extreme depression Analyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing lower depressive symptomatology at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based treatment group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in depression over 4-month period.]\n3.Depression II\nEvaluated using the validated 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D), which is designed to measure characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. There are 20 questions and the score for each item ranges between 0-3. For most questions, a lower score indicates lack of depression and a higher score indicates high depression (e.g. in response to the statement \"I felt fearful\" a 0 indicates rarely and 3 indicates most or all of the time). Questions 4, 8, 12, and 16 are reverse scored. The score is the sum of the 20 questions. Possible range is 0-60. A score of 16 points or more is considered depressed.\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing lower depressive symptomatology at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based treatment group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in depression over 4-month period.]\n4.Daily Social Connection\nFollowing Hawkley et al. (2007) and our previous studies, end-of-day daily diary questions will assess the amount of time spent interacting with others and the extent to which social interactions throughout the day were perceived as positive. Example items: \"How much time did you spend today with others, talking or listening to them?\" (0 = little or none of the day to 4 = most or all of the day) and \"How many positive interactions did you have today (e.g., supportive, enjoyable, rewarding, affirming)?\" (0 = one, 1 = several, 2 = many).\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing increased daily social connection at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in daily social connection assessed daily for seven days during week 2 and week 16 of the study.]\n5.Daily Belonging\nEnd-of-day daily diary questions will measure feelings of belonging and closeness at school.

The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness scale is designed to measure one's subjective feelings of loneliness as well as feelings of social isolation. A 20-item scale designed to measure one's subjective feelings of loneliness as well as feelings of social isolation. Participants rate each item as either A (\"I always feels this way\"), O (\"I often feel this way\"), S (\"I sometimes feel this way\"), R (\"I rarely feel this way\"), N (\"I never feel this way\"). Scores are summed from each item and higher scores indicate greater degrees of loneliness. Scores of 15-20 indicate average level of loneliness; 21-30 indicate frequent loneliness; 31-40 indicate severe loneliness.\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing decreased loneliness at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in loneliness over 4-month period.]\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n\nAcademic performance\nAcademic performance will be assessed using Grade Point Average (GPA).

Analyses will focus an a priori-specified gene regulation pattern involving increased expression of inflammation-related genes and decreased expression of antiviral gene - a pattern called the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA; Cole, 2012).\n\n[Time Frame: Change in gene expression over weeks 1 and weeks 17 of the study.]\nConcentrations of C-Reactive Protein\nCRP will be assessed through dried blood spots collected at baseline and post-intervention.\n\nChanges in CRP will be assessed using a time by group interaction.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in CRP over 4-month period.]\nConcentrations of salivary cortisol\nSaliva samples will be collected before and after the TSST, and assayed for salivary cortisol determination.\n\nSalivary cortisol will be analyzed both using area-under-the-curve (AUC) and mixed effects linear models, testing for a time by condition interaction showing that equanimity group has reduced cortisol reactivity to the TSST over time relative to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Four cortisol samples will be collected at the baseline session. One sample before and three samples after the acute stress challenge using the TSST.]\nPerceived Stress\nEvaluated using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The PSS measures the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. Individual scores on the PSS can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress.\n\nScores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress. Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress. Analyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing decreased reported stress at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in perceived stress over 4-month period.]\nSubjective Social Status\nCreated by health psychologist Nancy Adler and team (2000), the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status is a single-item measure that assesses a person's perceived rank relative to others in their group. Respondents view a drawing of a ladder with 10 rungs, and either read that the ladder represents where people stand in society. Respondents further read : \"At the top of the ladder are the people who are the best off, those who have the most money, most education, and best jobs. At the bottom are the people who are the worst off, those who have the least money, least education, worst jobs, or no job. Please place an 'X' on the rung that best represents where you think you stand on the ladder.\". Rungs are translated to numbers (1-10). Choosing higher rungs of the ladder (e.g. 10) indicates perception of higher social status and choosing lower rungs of the ladder (e.g. 1) indicates lower social status.\n\n[Time Frame: Measured at baseline only.]\nDaily Resilience using the Brief Resilience Scale\nEnd-of-day items will measure resilience over the course of the day. The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS, Smith et al. 2008) is a 6-item survey that assesses the ability to bounce back or recover from stress (e.g. \"It does not take me long to recover from a stressful event.\"). Some items are reverse scored and then all items are summed. Higher scores reflect more resilience. Analyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing increased resilience in daily life at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Assessed daily for seven days during week 2 and week 16 of the study.]\nDaily Occurrence of Stress and Successful Coping Scale\nEnd-of-day items will measure the perception of stress occurrence and types (e.g. \"concerns about academic performance\" or \"family concerns\") and overall perceptions of coping ability scale (e.g. Since the last survey, to what extent do you feel like your demands exceeded your ability to cope with them?\") over the course of the day. Scale ranges from 0=\"not at all true\" to 4 = \"extremely true\"), where higher scores indicate less successful coping (item 3 reverse scored).\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing decreased stress (and increased coping) in daily life at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Assessed daily for seven days during week 2 and week 16 of the study.]\nDaily State Mindfulness Scale\nEnd-of-day items will measure state mindfulness over the course of the day (e.g. \"I was thinking about something other than what I was currently doing\" is reverse scored). The scale ranges from 0=Strongly agree to 5= Strongly disagree. Higher scores indicate higher state mindfulness.\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing increased mindfulness in daily life at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Assessed daily for seven days during week 2 and week 16 of the study.]"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Cohen-Hoberman Inventory of Physical Symptoms (CHIPS)\nNote: CHIPS found to significantly correlate (.22 and .29) with use of Student Health Facilities in the 5 week period following completion of the scale, and the internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha) of the scale is 88\nCleaning:\nCreate a total score: sum the scores across the 33 items \ud83d\udc4d\nHigher scores indicate being increasingly bothered by more symptoms. \n\nPerceived Stress Score (PSS):\nValues in Qualtrics\nNever = 0\nAlmost Never = 1\nSometimes = 2\nFairly Often = 3\nVery Often = 4\nCleaning:\nReverse scores for questions 4, 5, 7, and 8. \nchange the scores like this: 0 = 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1, 4 = 0. \nSum the scores across 10 items\nIndividual scores on the PSS can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress.\nScores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. \nScores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress.\nScores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress.\nCreated categorical\n\nBeck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II)\nCleaning\nEach item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3, change text to numeric rating only. \nNote: For Sleeping Pattern (Item 16) and Changes in Appetite (Item 18) items: Each of these items contains seven options rated, in order, 0, 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, to differentiate between increases and decreases in behavior or motivation.\nSum the ratings for the 21 items.  \nThe maximum total score is 63.

The investigators will also work closely with institutional officials to assess whether the intervention can improve student well-being. Specifically, the project aims to teach freshman students (who are at high risk for depression) skills in how to foster a mindful response to adversity at the beginning of the school term, along with periodic support reminders (via text message) during high stress/vulnerability periods over the course of the semester. The investigators will adopt a randomized controlled trial approach to rigorously evaluate whether this intervention can be adopted as a standard onboarding program for all incoming freshman students during the first weeks of orientation on the CMU campus. Participants will come for the study session and provide a dried blood spot sample and complete a battery of self-report questionnaires. \n \nWe have conducted a number of trials showing that brief mindfulness training programs can foster stress resistance and health among young adults, compared to other helpful stress management programs that include relaxation and problem-solving training (for a review, see Creswell, 2017; also see Lindsay et al., 2018). The purpose of this project is to boil down this evidence-based mindfulness research approach to a more simple, scalable, and impactful mindfulness-based wise intervention that is delivered in an hour training session, and then is supported throughout the semester with text message reminders during high-risk periods (which we are calling mindfulness microhits). This intervention approach is wise in that it targets and trains mindfulness in contexts where there\u2019s adversity among high-risk students, teaching them skills in being more equanimous and non-judgmental of their experiences (as opposed to being critical and evaluative). Futhermore, the training session also includes a high stakes academic performance task (where we will also measure the stress hormone cortisol via saliva samples), offering participants a chance to implement and practice their resilience skills.\nThe CMU administration has asked our lab to generate interventions and solutions to improving student mental health in the coming year. The purpose of this study is to conduct a study testing a new mindful response to adversity intervention among our students.

The score for each item ranges between 0-3, where 0 denotes less depression (e.g. \"I do not feel sad\") and 3 denotes more depression (e.g. \"I am so dan and unhappy that I can't stand it\"). Total score will be between 0-63, where 0 indicates no depression and 63 indicates extreme depression. The score is a total of 21 questions and the following is a typical subscale range distribution:\n\n1-10: These ups and downs are considered normal 11-16: Mild mood disturbance 17-20: Borderline clinical depression 21-30: Moderate depression 31-40: Severe depression over 40: Extreme depression Analyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing lower depressive symptomatology at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based treatment group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in depression over 4-month period.]\n\nSecondary BDI: Because we were unable to obtain a sample of individuals with very high baseline, we will look at the median at baseline of BDI across all groups. Based on the histogram, we will determine a \"high-baseline BDI\" group and analyze the data for that group. We will test for a time by condition interaction showing lower daily depressive symptomatology at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.  If we do not have enough participants to analyze the data for high baseline BDI, we will run a test for a baseline BDI as a moderator. Group x time x baseline BDI. \n\n3.Depression II\nEvaluated using the validated 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D), which is designed to measure characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. There are 20 questions and the score for each item ranges between 0-3. For most questions, a lower score indicates lack of depression and a higher score indicates high depression (e.g. in response to the statement \"I felt fearful\" a 0 indicates rarely and 3 indicates most or all of the time). Questions 4, 8, 12, and 16 are reverse scored. The score is the sum of the 20 questions. Possible range is 0-60. A score of 16 points or more is considered depressed.\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing lower depressive symptomatology at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based treatment group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in depression over 4-month period.]\n4.Daily Social Connection\nFollowing Hawkley et al. (2007) and our previous studies, end-of-day daily diary questions will assess the amount of time spent interacting with others and the extent to which social interactions throughout the day were perceived as positive. Example items: \"How much time did you spend today with others, talking or listening to them?\" (0 = little or none of the day to 4 = most or all of the day) and \"How many positive interactions did you have today (e.g., supportive, enjoyable, rewarding, affirming)?\" (0 = one, 1 = several, 2 = many).\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing increased daily social connection at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in daily social connection assessed daily for seven days during week 2 and week 16 of the study.]\n5.Daily Belonging\nEnd-of-day daily diary questions will measure feelings of belonging and closeness at school.

The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness scale is designed to measure one's subjective feelings of loneliness as well as feelings of social isolation. A 20-item scale designed to measure one's subjective feelings of loneliness as well as feelings of social isolation. Participants rate each item as either A (\"I always feels this way\"), O (\"I often feel this way\"), S (\"I sometimes feel this way\"), R (\"I rarely feel this way\"), N (\"I never feel this way\"). Scores are summed from each item and higher scores indicate greater degrees of loneliness. Scores of 15-20 indicate average level of loneliness; 21-30 indicate frequent loneliness; 31-40 indicate severe loneliness.\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing decreased loneliness at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in loneliness over 4-month period.]\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n\nAcademic performance\nAcademic performance will be assessed using Grade Point Average (GPA). Analyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction higher GPA at post treatment (and follow-up) in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in GPA between semester immediately prior to enrollment and semester during enrollment in the study (approximately 5 months).]\nOccurrences of Daily Acceptance\nEnd-of-day perceptions of daily acceptance (used in Chin et al., under review) will be measured (Example questions\" Today, I was able to accept myself as I am\", \"Today, I've been judging the situation that I am in or the events that are occurring as good or bad\").\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing increased acceptance and non-judgment at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Assessed daily for seven days during week 2 and week 16 of the study.]\nPhysical Activity (FitBit)\nActivity data for number of steps will be assessed using a FitBit device worn by participants.\n\nMulti-level models will test for time by treatment interactions showing increased physical activity outcomes over time in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Assessed daily during week 2-17 of the study.]\nSleep (FitBit)\nActivity data for sleep will be assessed using a FitBit device worn by participants.\n\nMulti-level models will test for time by treatment interactions showing increased sleep outcomes over time in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Assessed daily during week 2-17 of the study.]\nConcentrations of pro-inflammatory gene expression\nGene expression measures of immune system function will be collected via dried blood spot collection method.\n\nMulti-level models will test for time by condition effects. Analyses will focus an a priori-specified gene regulation pattern involving increased expression of inflammation-related genes and decreased expression of antiviral gene - a pattern called the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA; Cole, 2012).\n\n[Time Frame: Change in gene expression over weeks 1 and weeks 17 of the study.]\nConcentrations of C-Reactive Protein\nCRP will be assessed through dried blood spots collected at baseline and post-intervention.\n\nChanges in CRP will be assessed using a time by group interaction.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in CRP over 4-month period.]\nConcentrations of salivary cortisol\nSaliva samples will be collected before and after the TSST, and assayed for salivary cortisol determination.\n\nSalivary cortisol will be analyzed both using area-under-the-curve (AUC) and mixed effects linear models, testing for a time by condition interaction showing that equanimity group has reduced cortisol reactivity to the TSST over time relative to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Four cortisol samples will be collected at the baseline session. One sample before and three samples after the acute stress challenge using the TSST.]\nPerceived Stress\nEvaluated using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The PSS measures the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. Individual scores on the PSS can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress.\n\nScores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress. Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress. Analyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing decreased reported stress at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in perceived stress over 4-month period.]\nSubjective Social Status\nCreated by health psychologist Nancy Adler and team (2000), the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status is a single-item measure that assesses a person's perceived rank relative to others in their group. Respondents view a drawing of a ladder with 10 rungs, and either read that the ladder represents where people stand in society. Respondents further read : \"At the top of the ladder are the people who are the best off, those who have the most money, most education, and best jobs. At the bottom are the people who are the worst off, those who have the least money, least education, worst jobs, or no job. Please place an 'X' on the rung that best represents where you think you stand on the ladder.\". Rungs are translated to numbers (1-10). Choosing higher rungs of the ladder (e.g. 10) indicates perception of higher social status and choosing lower rungs of the ladder (e.g. 1) indicates lower social status.\n\n[Time Frame: Measured at baseline only.]\nDaily Resilience using the Brief Resilience Scale\nEnd-of-day items will measure resilience over the course of the day. The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS, Smith et al. 2008) is a 6-item survey that assesses the ability to bounce back or recover from stress (e.g. \"It does not take me long to recover from a stressful event.\"). Some items are reverse scored and then all items are summed. Higher scores reflect more resilience. Analyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing increased resilience in daily life at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Assessed daily for seven days during week 2 and week 16 of the study.]\nDaily Occurrence of Stress and Successful Coping Scale\nEnd-of-day items will measure the perception of stress occurrence and types (e.g. \"concerns about academic performance\" or \"family concerns\") and overall perceptions of coping ability scale (e.g. Since the last survey, to what extent do you feel like your demands exceeded your ability to cope with them?\") over the course of the day. Scale ranges from 0=\"not at all true\" to 4 = \"extremely true\"), where higher scores indicate less successful coping (item 3 reverse scored).\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing decreased stress (and increased coping) in daily life at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Assessed daily for seven days during week 2 and week 16 of the study.]\nDaily State Mindfulness Scale\nEnd-of-day items will measure state mindfulness over the course of the day (e.g. \"I was thinking about something other than what I was currently doing\" is reverse scored). The scale ranges from 0=Strongly agree to 5= Strongly disagree. Higher scores indicate higher state mindfulness.\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing increased mindfulness in daily life at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Assessed daily for seven days during week 2 and week 16 of the study.]", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Recruitment methods will be fliers distributed throughout the campus / campus housing, posting to student facebook groups, and emails to student listserve. Interested participants will call or email our confidential lab account to set up a 10-minute pre-screening phone call. We will explain the study in greater depth and administer a screening questionnaire consistent with the inclusion and exclusion criteria specified. Participants will be full time adult (age 18+) freshman students at the CMU Pittsburgh campus, who own a data-enabled smartphone, and indicate moderate to high levels of depressive symptomatology (composite score &gt; or = 2 on the short-form Beck Depression inventory). Participants will be excluded from the study if they are non-English speaking or are unwilling or unable to complete study assessments and treatments. Participants will be scheduled to come into the lab for the study session, arriving between the hours of 2-8pm to control for natural diurnal variation in cortisol\n- Eligibility measures (taken over the phone) will include: BDI-short form for pre-screening\n\n(BEGINNING OF SEMESTER)(180 MIN): RANDOMIZATION, TRAINING SESSION, GROUP SOCIAL STRESS TEST (TSST-G)\n\nOrientation, Consent, Bio Data Collection and Randomization (50 min)\nParticipants will be asked not to eat, exercise, or drink caffeine 2 hours prior to the experiment, due to evidence that these actions can elevate cortisol levels. Participants will come to the laboratory to receive an orientation to the study procedures and informed about the compensation structure, study timeline, and FAQs. Research staff will read the consent form and participants will provide informed consent. Participants will complete baseline psychometric surveys via a qualtrics questionnaire. Application of FitBit device and description of cortisol sample collection will occur. Heart rate will be taken as a measure of arousal of the autonomic stress response throughout the training session. Baseline gene expression and inflammation levels will be collected via dried blood spotting procedure. Participants will complete a post-DBS questionnaire immediately following the DBS collection. Cortisol will be collected at baseline and several times throughout the TSST-G via salivary samples using Salivette saliva collection tubes. Salivary cortisol sample, a measure of adrenocortical activity (thought to have high predictive value for psychosocial stress, i.e. Foley and Kirschbaum, 2010 and considered to be a reliable and valid indicator of the biologically active fraction of cortisol (Vining et al., 1983; Kirschbaum and Hellhammer, 1989, 1994)). Salivary cortisol samples will be assessed for cortisol concentrations via immunoassay. Participants will provide saliva samples several times throughout and following the TSST-G with a Salivette device (Sarstedt, Rommelsdorf, Germany), which consists of placing a cotton roll under the tongue for 2 minutes and then expectorating this roll back into a small plastic collection tube. Completed saliva samples will be stored in a secure -20\u00ba Celsius freezer immediately after sample collection. Samples will be stored until shipped on dry ice to a laboratory specializing in cortisol assays (we have a longstanding relationship with this lab (PI Kirschbaum). Assay of the saliva samples for cortisol determination will be conducted in a single batch using a chemoluminescence-immuno-assay with high sensitivity (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany). Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation from this laboratory are always below 10%. The salivary and FitBit measures we are collecting in this study are non-invasive and present minimal risk to participants. We have had no participant complaints or discomforts in collecting these measures in our previous studies.\n\nParticipants will then be randomly assigned to either the mindful response to adversity condition or the self-improvement condition.\n\nTraining &amp; Practice (45 min)\nParticipants will attend a group training session, lead by a professional instructor, about responding to adversity, which will include a description of the skills, a writing (participants will write about a self-chosen experience of stress in their lives and how they responded to it) and sharing activity focused on the proposed approach (participants will share with a small group of other participants about a time when they successfully responded to a stressful experience with equanimity), and a practice session.

Participants will be instructed on the mindset, asked to write about an instance of non-judgment and share with a partner, and then guided through a short training designed to practice each skill. Complete script for the treatment condition can be viewed here.\nThe control condition will be trained in techniques designed to teach a typical narrative self-analysis / strengths-based approach to adversity. Participants in the active control condition will be trained in a practice matched to the study condition, but with a focus on narrative self-focus (Watkins and Teasdale, 2001), which is centered on judging what is occurring, letting oneself follow trains of thoughts, examining aspects of oneself (e.g. think about why you react the way you do to adversity), and trying to figure out what beneficial responses to challenges would be. These techniques will include: choosing the best approach, minimizing stress, and identifying and enhancing personal strengths. Participants will be instructed on the mindset, asked to write about an instance of personal strength and share with a partner (participants will share with a small group of other participants about a time when they successfully responded to a stressful experience by using personal strengths), and then guided through a short training designed to practice each skill. All participants will be asked to create a short recording within 24 hours of the session talking about what they learned during the training sessions and any advice they would offer to future CMU students. Participants will be told that we are compiling a resource for next year\u2019s incoming first years to support them in responding to the stress of starting a new school and that we would like them to record a 1-2 minute audio clip describing how they have personally applied these mindsets and advice on how future students might use the mindset learned during your session to deal with their stressful experiences. They will be asked to: 1) Find a private room with no other people or sounds in the background, 2) Record themselves speaking for 1-2 minutes about the prompted materials (i.e. a review of the mindset discussed in each condition), and 3) Send the file to cmu.mindful@gmail.com within 24 hours of the study session.

The TSST-G will consist of a 5-min public speaking task (mock job interview) and a subsequent 5-min mental arithmetic task (serial subtraction) performed out loud in front of a panel of two unfamiliar evaluators and a conspicuous video camera while in a room with 5-6 other participants. These exercises are an adapted version of the Trier Social Stress Test (Kirschbaum et al., 1993), which is a common laboratory challenge task that has been approved by the IRB and used in many behavioral studies, including several studies in our lab (e.g. Creswell et al., 2005). Participants will be given instructions for the upcoming performance task; specifically, that they will have to give a 2-minute speech in front of their peers detailing why they should be hired for a specific job position and convince evaluators (two study confederates) that they should receive a job offer. Two evaluators (wearing white lab coats and equipped with clip boards) will enter and direct the actual performance tasks (lasting 10 minutes). The evaluators are trained to act in a non-accepting manner toward the participant\u2019s performance during these tasks. After completion of the tasks, the evaluators will exit and participants will complete final questionnaires assessing post-task feelings, as well as providing additional saliva samples.\n\nResting, EMA Training, Cortisol Collection and Debriefing Period (30 min)\n\nParticipants will be trained on using smartphones to complete surveys and will download the EMA software application.\n\n- Study session questionnaire will include: CHIPS, PSS, BDI-II, CES-D, RRQ, MAAS, FFMQ, NAS, Goals 2018, Demographics, SES ladder, ERQ, CAI, UCLA, TSST Health Questions\n\nNote: participants will have the option to come into the lab prior to the study session to complete the consent form, DBS, and questionnaire when possible.\n- Paper questionnaires during TSST portion: Threat vs challenge, Feelings about TSST, Primary and Secondary Appraisal\n- Paper questionnaire following training: Behavior Identification Form\n\nEMA COLLECTION (at week following study session and last week of semester)\nAll EMA data will be collected directly from participants\u2019 phones using a custom-designed interactive application that supports multiple response modalities.

The score for each item ranges between 0-3, where 0 denotes less depression (e.g. \"I do not feel sad\") and 3 denotes more depression (e.g. \"I am so dan and unhappy that I can't stand it\"). Total score will be between 0-63, where 0 indicates no depression and 63 indicates extreme depression. The score is a total of 21 questions and the following is a typical subscale range distribution:\n\n1-10: These ups and downs are considered normal 11-16: Mild mood disturbance 17-20: Borderline clinical depression 21-30: Moderate depression 31-40: Severe depression over 40: Extreme depression Analyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing lower depressive symptomatology at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based treatment group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in depression over 4-month period.]\n3.Depression II\nEvaluated using the validated 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D), which is designed to measure characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression.

The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness scale is designed to measure one's subjective feelings of loneliness as well as feelings of social isolation. A 20-item scale designed to measure one's subjective feelings of loneliness as well as feelings of social isolation. Participants rate each item as either A (\"I always feels this way\"), O (\"I often feel this way\"), S (\"I sometimes feel this way\"), R (\"I rarely feel this way\"), N (\"I never feel this way\"). Scores are summed from each item and higher scores indicate greater degrees of loneliness. Scores of 15-20 indicate average level of loneliness; 21-30 indicate frequent loneliness; 31-40 indicate severe loneliness.\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing decreased loneliness at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in loneliness over 4-month period.]\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n\nAcademic performance\nAcademic performance will be assessed using Grade Point Average (GPA).

One sample before and three samples after the acute stress challenge using the TSST.]\nPerceived Stress\nEvaluated using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The PSS measures the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. Individual scores on the PSS can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress.\n\nScores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress. Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress. Analyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing decreased reported stress at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Change in perceived stress over 4-month period.]\nSubjective Social Status\nCreated by health psychologist Nancy Adler and team (2000), the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status is a single-item measure that assesses a person's perceived rank relative to others in their group. Respondents view a drawing of a ladder with 10 rungs, and either read that the ladder represents where people stand in society. Respondents further read : \"At the top of the ladder are the people who are the best off, those who have the most money, most education, and best jobs. At the bottom are the people who are the worst off, those who have the least money, least education, worst jobs, or no job. Please place an 'X' on the rung that best represents where you think you stand on the ladder.\". Rungs are translated to numbers (1-10). Choosing higher rungs of the ladder (e.g. 10) indicates perception of higher social status and choosing lower rungs of the ladder (e.g. 1) indicates lower social status.\n\n[Time Frame: Measured at baseline only.]\nDaily Resilience using the Brief Resilience Scale\nEnd-of-day items will measure resilience over the course of the day. The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS, Smith et al. 2008) is a 6-item survey that assesses the ability to bounce back or recover from stress (e.g. \"It does not take me long to recover from a stressful event.\"). Some items are reverse scored and then all items are summed. Higher scores reflect more resilience. Analyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing increased resilience in daily life at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Assessed daily for seven days during week 2 and week 16 of the study.]\nDaily Occurrence of Stress and Successful Coping Scale\nEnd-of-day items will measure the perception of stress occurrence and types (e.g. \"concerns about academic performance\" or \"family concerns\") and overall perceptions of coping ability scale (e.g. Since the last survey, to what extent do you feel like your demands exceeded your ability to cope with them?\") over the course of the day. Scale ranges from 0=\"not at all true\" to 4 = \"extremely true\"), where higher scores indicate less successful coping (item 3 reverse scored).\n\nAnalyses will use multilevel modeling to test for a time by condition interaction showing decreased stress (and increased coping) in daily life at post-treatment in the equanimity compared to the strength based group.\n\n[Time Frame: Assessed daily for seven days during week 2 and week 16 of the study.]\nDaily State Mindfulness Scale\nEnd-of-day items will measure state mindfulness over the course of the day (e.g. \"I was thinking about something other than what I was currently doing\" is reverse scored).
