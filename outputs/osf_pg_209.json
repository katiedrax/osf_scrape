All tasks use the same 6 by 6 grid in each trial, in which the gridlines are grey and the background white.\n\nTask 1: An Imagination task in which an arrow on the column and an arrow on the row of the grid indicates that participants have to imagine that the square at the intersection of these arrow cues is black. The imagination of the participant is built up gradually from 0 locations to 5 locations being imagined to be black, this is done sequentially so that every 2 seconds, the arrow cues designate a location to be imagined as black. This is repeated for until the set size has been reached (here 5 locations). The grid is presented on one side of the screen. Participants are then tested on their imagination by being presented with a grid on the other side of the screen within which a test display will be presented. There will be three types of test display: all five black squares (whole display), all five black squares with one square highlighted white (single post-cue display) or a single black square (single cue display). Participants are asked to judge whether all of these squares (whole display) or the cued square was originally cued or not. On half the trials the test display will be the originally cued squares, and in the other half it will differ such that one square is in a different location. \n\nTask 2: A visual working memory (VWM) task using the same grids as in Task 1, but where the to-be remembered squares are shown as filled in at each stage. The image is built up sequentially as per Task 1, with a different square being shown as filled every 2s until the set size is reached (here 5 locations). The grid is then masked.  Participants are tested as in Task 1.\n\nTask 3: A simultaneous visual short-term memory (VSTM). In this task there is not a sequential build-up of the stimulus. Rather the stimulus is shown briefly with all the grid locations (here set size 5) shown as filled. The grid is then masked.  Participants are then tested as in Task 1.\n\nIn tasks 1 and 2, participants are asked to build up their working memory or imagination sequentially with grid locations being added at each step. In task 3, participants are presented with a single stimulus in which all the five grid locations are already blacked out. Previously Atkin et al. (in preparation) have used whole display and single post-cue display at test, and so the purpose of the study is to explore performance differences when using these different types of test. Note that while Atkin et al. manipulated set size, only a set size of 5 will be used here, as the focus of the tasks is not on set size effects but on how methodological differences could alter performance in the memory and imagination tasks. \n\n\nIt is hypothesised that:\n\na)\tBased on previous findings, performance will be higher in the simultaneous visual short-term memory task than the sequential working memory task.\n\nb)\tThere will be an effect of display type on performance between tasks. In the simultaneous visual short-term memory task performance will be greater in the single post-cue condition than the whole display condition. Specifically, although the global organisation is the same between the two conditions (due to five squares always being presented at test), a single post-cue condition advantage is expected because decision factors only apply to one item, whereas in the whole display condition, decision factors apply for each item. In addition, performance in the whole display condition will be greater than the single cue condition. Specifically, the whole display condition advantage is expected because the global organisation is re-presented at test, unlike the single cue condition where the global organisation is not re-presented at test. Thus, the global configuration can assist performance in the whole display condition. Similarly, the sequential working memory task conditions will benefit in the same way as the simultaneous visual short-term memory task. For imagination it is unclear as to how performance will differ across the different types of test display.\n\nc)\tPerformance in each of the three tasks will strongly correlate (positively) with one another, with the strongest relationship predicted between the imagination task and the sequential working memory task. \n"}, "study_type": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment"}, "study_type_other": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"data": "It's complicated.

For example, a data set was first simulated with one continuous outcome variable (e.g., subjective valence), a categorical predictor with 2 levels (e.g., video group), a categorical predictor with 3 levels (e.g., video valence), and a random intercept for the 2nd level nesting variable in the multilevel model (e.g., participant). Parameters were estimated for each of the three main effects: (1) video group (VR vs. Flat) estimated slope beta value = 0.64, (2) negative valence (negative vs. neutral) estimated slope beta value = 0.64, and (3) positive valence (positive vs. neutral) estimated slope beta value = 0.64. Parameters were also estimated for the two interactions: (1) video group and negative valence interaction estimated slope beta value = 0.4, and (2) video group and positive valence interaction estimated slope beta value = 0.4. Lastly, parameters were estimated for residual variance = 0.50 and the random intercept variance = 0.50. These parameters were estimated to assume a medium effect size for each of the main effects (d = 0.50) and a small effect size for each of the interactions (d = 0.22). A simulation based method, with 10,000 simulations, was conducted for the power calculation. This simulation suggested that 120 participants would be needed for 90% power. \n\nA power analysis was also conducted for the proposed multilevel mediation models in the study using the Monte Carlo Power Analysis for Indirect Effects created by the Methodology and Analysis Research Lab (Shoemann et al., 2017). A medium sized correlation (r = 0.30) between the predictor (e.g., video group) and mediator (e.g., subjective presence), small correlation (r = 0.15) between the predictor and outcome (e.g., evoked valence), small correlation (r = 0.15) between the mediator and outcome, and a standard deviation of 1 was assumed. This analysis, with 10,000 simulations, suggested that we would need 800 data points to achieve 90% power. Given that we have 30 trials (videos) per participant we would only need about 25 participants to achieve sufficient power. As such, we are planning to power for the trial level effect of average presence on evoked valence and not the participant level effect. Therefore, the proposed 120 participants to power for the multilevel models will be sufficient for the multilevel mediation. As such, to account for possible technical problems during data collection, a sample of 130 participants was determined as sufficient to power the study.\n\nReferences\n* Schoemann, A.

For example, a data set was first simulated with one continuous outcome variable (e.g., subjective valence), a categorical predictor with 2 levels (e.g., video group), a categorical predictor with 3 levels (e.g., video valence), and a random intercept for the 2nd level nesting variable in the multilevel model (e.g., participant). Parameters were estimated for each of the three main effects: (1) video group (VR vs. Flat) estimated slope beta value = 0.64, (2) negative valence (negative vs. neutral) estimated slope beta value = 0.64, and (3) positive valence (positive vs. neutral) estimated slope beta value = 0.64. Parameters were also estimated for the two interactions: (1) video group and negative valence interaction estimated slope beta value = 0.4, and (2) video group and positive valence interaction estimated slope beta value = 0.4. Lastly, parameters were estimated for residual variance = 0.50 and the random intercept variance = 0.50. These parameters were estimated to assume a medium effect size for each of the main effects (d = 0.50) and a small effect size for each of the interactions (d = 0.22). A simulation based method, with 10,000 simulations, was conducted for the power calculation. This simulation suggested that 120 participants would be needed for 90% power. \n\nA power analysis was also conducted for the proposed multilevel mediation models in the study using the Monte Carlo Power Analysis for Indirect Effects created by the Methodology and Analysis Research Lab (Shoemann et al., 2017). A medium sized correlation (r = 0.30) between the predictor (e.g., video group) and mediator (e.g., subjective presence), small correlation (r = 0.15) between the predictor and outcome (e.g., evoked valence), small correlation (r = 0.15) between the mediator and outcome, and a standard deviation of 1 was assumed. This analysis, with 10,000 simulations, suggested that we would need 800 data points to achieve 90% power. Given that we have 30 trials (videos) per participant we would only need about 25 participants to achieve sufficient power. As such, we are planning to power for the trial level effect of average presence on evoked valence and not the participant level effect. Therefore, the proposed 120 participants to power for the multilevel models will be sufficient for the multilevel mediation. As such, to account for possible technical problems during data collection, a sample of 130 participants was determined as sufficient to power the study.\n\nReferences\n* Schoemann, A.

Participants will then be randomized into two groups: a group that will watch the virtual reality (VR) scenarios (VR group) and a group that will watch non-immersive film scenarios (Flat film group). Before watching the social scenarios, participants will watch a neutral video for 2-minutes in their assigned group (VR or Flat) and then be asked questions about symptoms of cybersickness. If participants report slight or moderate symptoms of cybersickness (Ames et al., 2005), they will be asked if they feel well enough to continue on with the study. If they decide not to continue, they will receive their compensation and be completed with the study. If participants report severe symptoms of cybersickness (Ames et al., 2005), they will receive their compensation and be completed with the study. Participants who continue with the study will watch 30 social scenarios (~1 minute/scenario with thirty 30 sec breaks x 30 = ~45 minutes). The VR group will watch these scenarios using an Oculus Rift VR headset and the Flat film group will watch these scenarios on a computer monitor. Participants will watch each of these scenarios in randomized blocks of negative, positive, and neutral valenced videos, with 5 consecutive videos of the same type (i.e., 5 neutral, 5 positive, or 5 negative) in a row. No video will be repeated so that participants view each of the 30 videos exactly once. Participants will provide ratings of valence, arousal, and presence after each video. To reduce carry over effects from one block of social scenario videos to another, participants will complete a short (2-minute) cognitive distractor task to \u2018clear their mind\u2019 and distract them from the current mood they may be experiencing (see James et al., 2016; Van Dillen et al., 2007). The cognitive distractor task will also be used to assess participants effort during the study based on expected attrition of task performance across the 6 blocks. Both groups will complete the cognitive distractor task on a computer screen- the VR group will simply slide up the VR headset to complete the task between video blocks.\n\nIdeal but approximate timeline: \nData collection will run from February 2020 to June 2020\nData analysis will be conducted starting June 2020 and onward.\n\nReferences\n*Ames, S.

The first level is the VR group where participants will watch the videos in the study using a virtual reality headset. The second level is the Flat film group where participants will watch the videos in the study on a computer monitor. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of these two groups.\n\nVideo Valence: This is a categorical within subjects variable with 3 levels. Within each video scenario (e.g., double date, meeting with a doctor) there will be three video versions each developed to elicit a specific valence. Therefore, the levels of this variable each represent 1 of 3 valence types: negative valence, positive valence, and neutral valence. \n\nVideo Valence Combined: This is a categorical within subjects variable with 2 levels. The first level will represent neutral valence and the second level will represent strong valence (negative valence and positive valence).\n\nCognitive Trial: This is a categorical within subjects variable with 6 levels. Each level represents the point in time during the study that participants complete a cognitive task (the symbol digit modalities test), which will be completed 6 times. \n\nParticipant: This variable represents each individual participant in the study.", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Subjective Valence: This is a continuous variable reflecting the degree of valence that participants experience after watching a video. This variable will be measured with the Affective Sliding scale (Betella &amp; Verschure, 2016), which is a digital scale, ranging from 0 to 100,  designed for the self-assessment of emotion.\n\nSubjective Arousal: This is a continuous variable reflecting the degree of arousal that participants experience after watching a video. This variable will be measured with the Affective Sliding scale (Betella &amp; Verschure, 2016), which  is a digital scale, ranging from 0 to 100, designed for the self-assessment of emotion.\n\nSubjective Presence: This is a continuous variable reflecting the degree of presence, defined as the sense of actually \u201cbeing\u201d in the virtual environment, that participants experience while watching a video. This variable will be measured with the Slater-Usoh-Steed (SUS) questionnaire (Slater, Usoh, &amp; Steed, 1994, 1995). The SUS is a 3-item self-report questionnaire where respondents provide ratings on a 7-point Likert scale.\n\nEvoked Valence: This is a continuous variable reflecting the deviation of the negative and positive valence scores from the neutral valence score for each participant. This variable will be used to test the mediation model. Specific calculation can be found in the indices.\n\nSDMT Score: This is a continuous variable reflecting participants performance on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT; Smith, 1982), which will be used to reduce carry over effects of affect from one block of social scenario videos to another and to assess effort. In this task, participants will be given an answer key consisting of symbol-number pairs. Participants then have a time limit to fill in rows of blank squares, each labeled with a symbol, with the correct number according to the key. Their performance is calculated by the number of correct responses made within a 2-minute time period.\n\nExpectancy Violation Score: This is a continuous variable reflecting the degree that participants expectation of feeling immersed in the videos was violated. This variable will be measured by a 2-item self-report questionnaire where respondents provide ratings on a 7-point Likert scale. Participants will respond to question 1 (Q1) at the start of the study and to question 2 (Q2) at the end of the study. (Q1) Expectancy: I expect that watching (VR/computer) videos will be highly immersive and engaging (1=Strongly disagree, 7=Strongly agree) and (Q2) Actual Experience: Watching (VR/computer) videos was highly immersive and engaging (1=Strongly disagree, 7=Strongly agree).

Participants use a 5\u2010point scale (1= \u201cnever\u201d to 5 = \u201call the time\u201d) to reflect on how they felt over the past nine months.\n\nThis study is testing seven mediators or moderatos: \n\nPerceived Parental Autonomy Support Scale (P-PASS)\nUsing the Perceived Parental Autonomy Support Scale (P-PASS) to measure parental autonomy support, initially developed for college students. The P-PASS is a 24-question scale to measure autonomy-supportive and controlling parenting behaviors using separate subscales.\n\nThe Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R)\nCognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R) is containing 12 items, aimed to detect a full range conceptualization of mindfulness. Participants rate how much the statements apply to them on the 4-point scale.\n\nHeartland Forgiveness Scale (HFS) \nThe Heartland Forgiveness Scale (HFS) is an 18-item questionnaire designed to access individual\u2019s dispositional forgiveness. HFS has three 6-item measures of forgiveness of self, others, and situations. Participants rate each item on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = almost always false of me to 7 = almost always true of me. \n\nActively open-minded thinking 17 (AOT17) \nActively open-minded thinking 17 (AOT17) is measuring individual\u2019s thinking styles. It was designed to assess individual\u2019s tendency to engage in flexible or open-minded thinking. The scale contains 17 statements, which are rated on a 6-point scale (1=\u201cstrongly disagree\u201d to 6=\u201cstrongly agree\u201d). \n\nListening scale\nThe listening scale is a 10-item questionnaire designed to access individuals\u2019 willingness to listen to their parents and their perception of their parents\u2019 willingness to listen to them. Participants rate each item on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = Strongly disagree to 7 = Strongly agree. \n\nTrust scale\nTrustfulness scale is a 10-item questionnaire designed to access individuals\u2019 trustfulness towards their parents and rate their perception of how their parents trust them in decision making. Participants rate each item on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = not at all to 6 = extremely. \n\nBasic Psychological Needs Scale\nThe basic Psychological needs scale is a 6-item questionnaire designed to access individuals\u2019 basic psychological needs, including autonomy, competence, and relatedness.
