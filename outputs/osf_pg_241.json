the context of romantic relationships. Although romantic relationship conflict is normative, with conflict occurring daily (Laursen, 1995), it can also be costly (Richards, Bulter, and Gross, 2003). Relationship conflict occurs in response to personality clashes or negative emotional reactions between romantic partners (Cahn, 1992). How couples interact and resolve their disputes is a fundamental determinant of relationship functioning (McNulty, O\u2019Mara, and Karney, 2008). Furthermore, impulsive traits, such as negative urgency, leave individuals vulnerable to conflict. Negative urgency is the tendency to act out in response to negative emotional states (e.g., anger; Whiteside and Lynam, 2001). Individuals high in negative urgency are poor at regulating their emotional reactions to negative experiences, often failing to employ adaptive interpersonal emotion regulation strategies. No research to date has examined the link between negative urgency and use of interpersonal emotion regulation. Assessing the underlying neural mechanisms of interpersonal emotion regulation could further bolster our understanding of how individuals high in negative urgency fail to engage in adaptive uses of interpersonal emotion regulation. \n\nReferences:\nCahn, D.

This survey will assess key information to ensure that participants are comfortable wearing the functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) equipment and will provide high-quality brain data (see above exclusion criteria). The screener survey link will have two sections, one for each partner to complete. They will be instructed to complete their section independently. At the end of the survey, participants will provide their full name and email address so we can provide them with the code to sign up for the lab study via the SONA website. Community members will be contacted by email to schedule their study session. Unqualified participants will not be contacted by these means. Instead, they will receive a message at the end of the screener indicating they were not eligible for the study and to feel free to contact the study Principle Investigator (PI) with any questions.\n\n-----Laboratory Session-----\nAfter participants are screened for eligibility, both romantic partners will be scheduled to come into a laboratory located at one of the lab spaces owned by the Psychology Department to complete the study procedures. All research assistants (RA) associated with the study will be trained and supervised by the Student Investigator (Alexandra Martelli) and PI (Dr. Chester) and will be required to complete a minimum of four mock assessment training sessions before running any actual participants through these procedures. Each study session will be run by two research assistants (RA; one will be referred to as the 'Lead RA' and the other will be referred to as the 'Support RA'). Each RA will be assigned to work with one of the romantic partners in the dyad.\n\n-----Baseline Questionnaires-----\nUpon participants entering the lab space, the Lead RA will inform the couple they will be separated for the majority of the study session, and ask them to turn off their cellular devices until the study session is complete. Participants will immediately be separated into two different study rooms to complete the informed consent procedures. Those who consent to participate will then complete a basic demographic questionnaire along with part one of the self-report measures (UPPS-P Impulsivity Scale, Effective Interpersonal Regulation of Negative Affect Scale, Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire, Interpersonal Regulation Interaction Scale). All participants will also complete a brief questionnaire that asks about caffeine consumption and medications in the past 24 hours to control for abnormalities in fNIRS data collection due to caffeine use or medications use.\n\n-----Image Viewing Task-----\nAfter completing the first questionnaire portion of the study, one romantic partner (partner #1, determined via counterbalance) will be set up first with the fNIRS equipment to complete the Image Viewing Task while their romantic partner (partner #2) completes part two of the questionnaires. The remaining questionnaires will be asked at this time for the exception of the aggression questionnaires. These questionnaires will be saved until the end of the session, after participants complete the competitive reaction time game. During the fNIRS recording, participants will view various images (positive, negative, and neutral) alone and with their partner (i.e., Image Viewing Task). Following each image will be two rating scales (positive, negative) and participants will be instructed to rate how positive and negative each image is from 1 (not at all) to 4 (extremely).\n\n-----Types of Images -----\nPrior to selection of images, all explicit, erotic images were taken out of the set of images. Then, images were selected based on hedonic valence (unpleasant to pleasant) and arousal ratings. Valence ratings range from 1 (unpleasant: unhappy, annoyed, etc.) to 9 (pleasant: happy, hopeful, etc.). Arousal ratings range from 1 (calm) to 9 (excited). IAPS includes more than 1,000 exemplars of human experience - joy, sadness, fear, anger, threatening, attractive, ugly, houses, art objects, household objects, funerals, pollution, dirty toilets, cityscapes, seascapes, sports events, photojournalism from wars and disasters, sick patients, baby animals, loving families, waterfalls, children playing. Most importantly, this international affective pictorial system encourages replication and extension of published research using the same or similar stimulus materials, which promotes increase in scientific knowledge. \n\nConditions will be presented using a rapid event-related design in a pseudo-randomized order for all conditions (intrapersonal for both partners as well as interpersonal). Based on similar fNIRS stimuli presentation designs (Glotzbach et al., 2011), each task condition will consist of a total of 75 trials (25 positive, 25 negative, 25 neutral; within-subjects). Each trial will consist of viewing a picture for 3s (Glotzbach et al., 2011), positive rating scale (3s), negative rating scale (3s), and an intertrial interval period displaying a fixation cross (jittered at 500ms and 750ms). After each image, participants will provide two emotion ratings: positive and negative. Each emotion rating scale is a 4-point Likert type scale rated from 1 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), with higher ratings corresponding to greater positive (or negative) ratings. The contrast of interest for analyses will focus on the negative image trials minus the positive and neutral image trials because negative urgency is associated with self-control failure in the face of negative emotional stimuli (Chester et al., 2016). This contrast will allow us to capture blood oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) signal (from fNIRS recording) specific to negative stimuli while controlling for all other stimuli.\n\nThe order of the Image Viewing Task will be as follows: partner #1 views images alone (while partner #2 completes part two of the questionnaires), then they switch so partner #2 views images alone (while partner #1 completes questionnaires), and finally both partners view images together. Once partner #2 is set up with the fNIRS equipment they will keep it on for the remainder of the study session, including during the competitive reaction time game (which follows the Image Viewing Task). There is only one fNIRS cap, so whoever is partner #2 will have the fNIRS cap on from the start of their solo Image Viewing Task to the end of the competitive reaction time game. The RA working with partner #2 will take their fNIRS cap off after the end of the competitive reaction time game.\n\nFor the co-viewing condition, partners will be reunited by the Support RA bringing their participant into the Lead RA's study room. The Support RA will set their participant up next to their romantic partner at an adjacent computer to view the images together. Both participants will receive instructions once more to view each image and then rate how positive and negative each image is from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Once all conditions of the Image Viewing Task are complete, the couples will be separated again to complete the competitive reaction time game.\n\n------fNIRS-----\n\nThe fNIRSport (NIRx Medical Technologies, LLC, New York, USA) equipment will be utilized for the neuroimaging component of the study. This non-invasive procedure does not have any risks associated with the device, although participants with sensitive scalps will be not be eligible to participate because the slight pressure of the fNIRS cap would be uncomfortable. The fNIRS system will consist of 16 light sources and 16 detectors, with a 3cm space between probes, comprising 48 channels. \n\nThe device is fitted to each partner by first measuring the circumference around their head to determine the size of the cap. There are three sizes: 54 (small), 56 (medium), 58 (large). The cap will be positioned over the frontal and frontotemporal area with its lowest-row center optode at the electrode position FPz, according to the international 10-20 system for EEG (Jasper, 1958). Once the cap is fitted to each participant the placement and distance between the optodes will be adjusted and secured. A black shower cap will be secured over the top of the optodes and around the head to shield from any extraneous light. Each LED light source emits light at two wavelengths (760 and 850 nm). Data will be recorded at 7.81 Hz. \n\n-----Aggression Task (aka Competitive Reaction Time Game)-----\nBoth romantic partners will be told the cover story that they will be playing a competitive reaction time game with each other and a stranger. Each RA will tell their respective dyad member that they will be playing against each other and a stranger, and they will be placed in separate rooms as to not distract one another from playing the game. In reality, they will each be playing against the computer with preprogrammed wins and losses. This game will take the form of a competitive reaction-time task in which the winner could deliver aversive noise to the loser through headphones. The aggression task will consist of a total of 32 trials, with each round consisting of 8 trials. Participants will play against each opponent for two rounds. Prior to each trial, participants will be instructed to set the volume of the noise blast their opponent would receive if the participant won the round, ranging from Level 1 (60 dB) to Level 4 (105 dB) in 15 dB intervals, not to exceed 105 dB. After each trial, participants will see the intensity settings their opponents set for them and then whether they won or lost. \n\nThe task is set to have the participants win four trials and lose four trials against each opponent (determined randomly, despite being told that their performance was what determined the outcome of each trial). All noise levels will be calibrated beforehand such that, although the noise is unpleasant, no damage to the ear will occur. The volume that the participant sets for their partner serves as our measure of aggression.\n\n-----Final Questionnaire Portion -----\nAfter playing the Competitive Reaction Time Game \"together,\" participants will complete the final few questionnaires that measure aggressive tendencies. These self-report measures will provide evidence of participants typical conflict or aggressive tendencies.\n\n-----Debriefing-----\nPrior to debrief, research assistants will check qualtrics for overt violence items on the Abuse Within Intimate Relationships Scale (items 16-26). If any of these items are endorsed an additional three questions need to be asked participants (see below).\n\nParticipants will remain separated for the final debrief. First, participants will be asked three suspicion questions. Specifically, participants will be asked, \"What did you think the study was about?\", \"Did anything seem strange or unusual to you?\" and \u201cDid you feel like you were being tricked at all during the study procedures?\u201d Next, participants will be fully debriefed and explained the true nature of the study. Following the debrief, participants will be asked to answer a couple questions to assess whether it is safe to reunite the romantic partners following the conflict paradigm. Participants will be asked two questions, \u201cAre you feeling any lingering feelings of anger or frustration towards your romantic partner?\u201d and \u201cDo you feel like you might want to hurt your partner if you saw them in a few moments?\u201d If participants say yes to either question, indicating it is unsafe to reunite them with their romantic partner, the respective RA will give them an opportunity to work through those feelings by instructing them to re-read the debriefing form provided while the RA steps out of the room to give the participant space. The RA will return after a couple of minutes to check back in with the participant and ask the debriefing questions again. Study procedures are expected to be no more or less upsetting than everyday life, but resources will be available to participants for support or for referral to counseling services if appropriate.\n\n---If AWIRS items are endorsed, three additional open ended questions will be asked ---\n\nResearch assistants will explain to the participant they are going to ask three open ended questions\n\n1. What are your fears and concerns regarding being reunited with your romantic partner?\n2. What specific stresses did you experience from the study procedures today that will impact your safety with your\nromantic partner?\n3. Do you think any threats will be made against you after completing these study procedures and if so, what threats?\n\n*If participants express any concern being reunited with their partner we will immediately provide them with contact information for the YWCA's confidential 24-hour domestic violence hotline that can provide free transportation (pre-paid ubers) and emergency housing, as well as put them in touch with resources. We will also put them in contact with the VCU Well's dating violence advocacy services. If the romantic partners both feel ready to be reunited, the Lead RA will finish the debrief process together. The Lead RA will thank both romantic partners for participating in the study, and ask them both together, one more time, if they feel angry or aggressive towards each other. Finally, the Support RA will lead both romantic partners out of the lab.\n\nVCU participants that are completing the study for credit will be granted their credit immediately following the session. Any non-VCU participants will be placed into a raffle for two chances to win $50 at the end of the study."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "Following the recommendation of Fritz and MacKinnon (2007), a sample size of 148 was deemed large enough to achieve adequate power (i.e., .80) when testing for bias-corrected and accelerated, bootstrapped indirect effects.

Negative images will be selected based on the minimum criterion that they are rated less than four, with arousal ratings expected to be around five (see Mikels et al., 2005 for review of emotional category data of IAPS). The neutral midpoint is five, so all neutral images will be within \u00bd rating unit of the midpoint, with lower expected arousal ratings compared to negative and positive images (~3). Positive images will be selected based on valence ratings greater than six, with arousal ratings expected to be around five.

Aggression Target: Whether participants are aggressing against their romantic partner or a stranger, is experimentally manipulated, as well as whether the given interaction partner is highly provocative (selects a 3 or 4 volume noise blast) or less provocative (selects a 1 or 2 volume noise blast), so this task takes a 2 (aggression target: romantic partner or stranger) x 2 (provocation: high or low) within-subjects design."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q17": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Demographics and Relationship Status - Participants will report their current age, gender/ethnic/racial identity, current romantic relationship status and the duration of that relationship.\n\nTaylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP) - aggressive behavior will be measured by the volume of sound blasts that participants select for their opponent from 1 (lowest sound blast) to 4 (highest sound blast),  targeted at either their romantic partner or opposite sex stranger. These settings will be averaged together for each participant, separately for each of the 2 targets. This task will proceed over 32 trials. Each trial will begin with a fixation cross to model baseline neural activation, followed by a volume-setting screen (participants have three seconds to respond), followed by a competition screen (3 seconds each, followed by a screen indicating their opponent's volume setting (3 seconds each), and ending with a screen indicating whether they won or lost the competition (3 seconds each). Trials are presented in blocks of 8 (2 blocks per aggression target), each block is preceded by a screen instructing participants who the subsequent 8 trials will be played against (3 seconds each). Trials are randomly assigned to include high or low provocation from participants' opponents.\n\nQuestionnaires:\n1. Negative Urgency will be assessed using the negative urgency subscale of the 59-item version of the UPPS-P Impulsivity Scale (UPPS-P; Whiteside and Lynam, 2001).

AWIRS consists of five subscales: emotional abuse, deception, verbal abuse, overt violence, and restrictive violence. \n\nb. Conflict Tactics Scale - 20-item scale in which participants report how frequently they have abused their partner, from 0 (This never happened) to 7 (Not in the past year, but it did happen before). This scale measures both self and partner reports of intimate partner aggression perpetration. \n\nc.

The items break down to six sub-scales with six items per sub-scale with Items 1-6 capturing overt IPA, 7-12 reactive overt, 13-18 proactive overt, 19-24 relational, 25-30 reactive relational, and 31-36 capturing proactive relational aggression.\n\n3. Efficacy of Interpersonal Regulation of Negative Affect will be measured using the following two scales:\n\na. Negative efficacy will be measured using the negative efficacy subscale of the 16-item Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire (IRQ; Williams, Morelli, Ong, and Zaki, 2018). The IRQ assesses subjective reports of four characteristics of interpersonal emotion regulation: the tendency to use interpersonal emotion regulation for positive and negative emotions and their efficacy (i.e., how well interpersonal emotion regulation strategies work to regulate their emotions), which creates four subscales: Negative-Tendency, Negative-Efficacy, Positive-Tendency, and Positive-Efficacy.  Each subscale consists of four items that respondents rate the extent to which they agree with various statements on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).\n\nb. Effective Intrinsic Interpersonal Regulation of Negative Affect Scale (EIIRNAS) is a 16-item measure that assesses the extent to which social interaction is effective in dampening or modifying the expression or experience of negative affect.

The same method will be applied to the positive and neutral emotion ratings to use to test whether our predictions are unique to negative affect. \n\n1. Negative Urgency will be assessed using the negative urgency subscale of the 59-item version of the UPPS-P Impulsivity Scale (UPPS-P; Whiteside and Lynam, 2001). We will take the mean of the 12 negative urgency items. \n\n2.Intimate Partner Aggression:\n\na.

In each model, the first step will estimate and test the total effect (c) of the independent variable (x) on the dependent variable (y). The second step will test the effects of the independent variable (x) on the mediating variable (m). Finally, the third step will test the effects of the mediating variable (m) and independent variable (x) on the dependent variable (y). \n\nFollowing recommended procedures (Kenny et al., 2006), gender will be contrast-coded (-1 = men, 1 = women). Behavioral aggression and self-reported aggression are the outcome measures of interest. Separate indirect effect models will be run predicting each aggression outcome measure from negative urgency. In addition, each model will be run using self-reported effective interpersonal regulation of negative affect and VMPFC activation (while viewing negative images) as mediators, for a total of four separate indirect effect models run for two mediators and two outcome variables. \n\nAnalyses will be conducted using the LME4 package (Bates, Maechler, Bolker, and Walker 2014) for R (R Core Team 2015). This package provides functions to fit and analyze linear mixed models, generalized linear mixed models, and nonlinear mixed models.\n\n----fNIRS Data -----\n\nThe NIRStar acquisition software (NIRx Medical Technologies, LLC, New York, USA) will be used to record blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response using fNIRS and to assess its signal-to-noise ratio. Neuronal activity is associated with changes in localized cerebral blood flow. The HOMER3 data analysis package in Matlab will be used for all subsequent preprocessing and analysis. Head or skin movement can cause decoupling between the optode and scalp, resulting in abrupt changes in the amplitude of the received signal. Raw data will be visually inspected for spike artifacts and faulty channels, and if any are detected, they will be removed for future analyses. Following the recommendation of Burns and Lieberman (2019), we will run a principle components analysis for motion correction to discard noisy components. The modified Beer-Lambert law (MBLL) will be used to compute estimates of changes in oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (dHB) levels from the frequency-filtered data relative to baseline (Dixon-Gordan, Bernecker, Christensen, 2015; Sassaroli and Fantini, 2004). Increases of O2Hb, as well as decreases of dHB, are indicators of cortical activity (Obrig and Villringer, 2003). To remove baseline drift and physiological noise, band-pass filtering will be used with a low cutoff frequency of 0.01 Hz and a high cutoff frequency of 0.10 Hz.  \n\nRecommended preprocessing pipeline summary:\n1) Visually inspect \"bad channels\" and remove\n2) Identify windows of motion artifact\n3) Principle Components Analysis (PCA) motion correction\n4) MBLL conversion\n5) Frequency filtering\n*Matlab scripts from Shannon Burns (https://github.com/smburns47) will be modified to fit our study design and will later be uploaded and shared.\n\t\nThe preprocessed fNIRS time series from the Image Viewing Task will be analyzed in an event-related manner with a model-based approach applying a two-level general linear model (GLM).\n\nFirst level (within-participants). First, each participant\u2019s BOLD signal will be modeled with a fixed-effects analysis, which will separately model each image condition (negative, positive, neutral) and condition order (Intrapersonal Emotion Regulation \u2013 viewing images alone, Interpersonal Emotion Regulation \u2013 co-viewing images) as regressors using Gaussian hemodynamic response functions (HRF) with a temporal derivative. A linear contrast will compare image conditions (Negative and Positive + Neutral images). This linear contrast was selected because at the root of negative urgency is self-regulatory failure in response to negative affect. Thus, it is appropriate to isolate BOLD response to negative images, controlling for BOLD response to images in general and positively-valenced affective images. As well as viewing condition (Interpersonal and Intrapersonal). This contrast allows us to isolate BOLD response to images that were co-viewed with a romantic partner (Interpersonal Emotion Regulation), controlling for BOLD responses to viewing images alone (Intrapersonal Emotion Regulation). \n\nSecond level (between-participants).  Each participant's time series from the first step will be fed into a group-level, mixed effects GLM. Brain hemodynamic changes over time will be extracted for the main effect of Negative &amp; Positive + Neutral contrast and Interpersonal and Intrapersonal Emotion Regulation contrast. The VMPFC (fNIRS channels associated with Brodmann area 10, 14, 25, and 32; Phelps, Delgado, Nearing, &amp; LeDoux, 2004) as our region of interest (ROI) will be extracted according to the experimental design. The Negative and Positive + Neutral contrast during Interpersonal and Interpersonal contrast will be modeled in a bias-corrected and accelerated, bootstrapped indirect effect model to test the effect of VMPFC activation (during interpersonal emotion regulation to negative stimuli) on the link between negative urgency and intimate partner aggression.\n\nRegistration of fNIRS Channels to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) Space: The virtual registration method will be applied to estimate the corresponding fNIRS channels to cortical topography (Tsuzuki et al., 2007). Structural information from an anatomical database will provide estimates of the channel positions from a standardized 3D brain atlas.

Although romantic relationship conflict is normative, with conflict occurring daily (Laursen, 1995), it can also be costly (Richards, Bulter, and Gross, 2003). Relationship conflict occurs in response to personality clashes or negative emotional reactions between romantic partners (Cahn, 1992). How couples interact and resolve their disputes is a fundamental determinant of relationship functioning (McNulty, O\u2019Mara, and Karney, 2008). Furthermore, impulsive traits, such as negative urgency, leave individuals vulnerable to conflict. Negative urgency is the tendency to act out in response to negative emotional states (e.g., anger; Whiteside and Lynam, 2001). Individuals high in negative urgency are poor at regulating their emotional reactions to negative experiences, often failing to employ adaptive interpersonal emotion regulation strategies. No research to date has examined the link between negative urgency and use of interpersonal emotion regulation. Assessing the underlying neural mechanisms of interpersonal emotion regulation could further bolster our understanding of how individuals high in negative urgency fail to engage in adaptive uses of interpersonal emotion regulation. \n\nReferences:\nCahn, D.

Each RA will be assigned to work with one of the romantic partners in the dyad.\n\n-----Baseline Questionnaires-----\nUpon participants entering the lab space, the Lead RA will inform the couple they will be separated for the majority of the study session, and ask them to turn off their cellular devices until the study session is complete. Participants will immediately be separated into two different study rooms to complete the informed consent procedures. Those who consent to participate will then complete a basic demographic questionnaire along with part one of the self-report measures (UPPS-P Impulsivity Scale, Effective Interpersonal Regulation of Negative Affect Scale, Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire, Interpersonal Regulation Interaction Scale). All participants will also complete a brief questionnaire that asks about caffeine consumption and medications in the past 24 hours to control for abnormalities in fNIRS data collection due to caffeine use or medications use.\n\n-----Image Viewing Task-----\nAfter completing the first questionnaire portion of the study, one romantic partner (partner #1, determined via counterbalance) will be set up first with the fNIRS equipment to complete the Image Viewing Task while their romantic partner (partner #2) completes part two of the questionnaires. The remaining questionnaires will be asked at this time for the exception of the aggression questionnaires. These questionnaires will be saved until the end of the session, after participants complete the competitive reaction time game. During the fNIRS recording, participants will view various images (positive, negative, and neutral) alone and with their partner (i.e., Image Viewing Task). Following each image will be two rating scales (positive, negative) and participants will be instructed to rate how positive and negative each image is from 1 (not at all) to 4 (extremely).\n\n-----Types of Images -----\nPrior to selection of images, all explicit, erotic images were taken out of the set of images. Then, images were selected based on hedonic valence (unpleasant to pleasant) and arousal ratings. Valence ratings range from 1 (unpleasant: unhappy, annoyed, etc.) to 9 (pleasant: happy, hopeful, etc.). Arousal ratings range from 1 (calm) to 9 (excited). IAPS includes more than 1,000 exemplars of human experience - joy, sadness, fear, anger, threatening, attractive, ugly, houses, art objects, household objects, funerals, pollution, dirty toilets, cityscapes, seascapes, sports events, photojournalism from wars and disasters, sick patients, baby animals, loving families, waterfalls, children playing. Most importantly, this international affective pictorial system encourages replication and extension of published research using the same or similar stimulus materials, which promotes increase in scientific knowledge. \n\nConditions will be presented using a rapid event-related design in a pseudo-randomized order for all conditions (intrapersonal for both partners as well as interpersonal). Based on similar fNIRS stimuli presentation designs (Glotzbach et al., 2011), each task condition will consist of a total of 75 trials (25 positive, 25 negative, 25 neutral; within-subjects). Each trial will consist of viewing a picture for 3s (Glotzbach et al., 2011), positive rating scale (3s), negative rating scale (3s), and an intertrial interval period displaying a fixation cross (jittered at 500ms and 750ms). After each image, participants will provide two emotion ratings: positive and negative. Each emotion rating scale is a 4-point Likert type scale rated from 1 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), with higher ratings corresponding to greater positive (or negative) ratings. The contrast of interest for analyses will focus on the negative image trials minus the positive and neutral image trials because negative urgency is associated with self-control failure in the face of negative emotional stimuli (Chester et al., 2016). This contrast will allow us to capture blood oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) signal (from fNIRS recording) specific to negative stimuli while controlling for all other stimuli.\n\nThe order of the Image Viewing Task will be as follows: partner #1 views images alone (while partner #2 completes part two of the questionnaires), then they switch so partner #2 views images alone (while partner #1 completes questionnaires), and finally both partners view images together. Once partner #2 is set up with the fNIRS equipment they will keep it on for the remainder of the study session, including during the competitive reaction time game (which follows the Image Viewing Task). There is only one fNIRS cap, so whoever is partner #2 will have the fNIRS cap on from the start of their solo Image Viewing Task to the end of the competitive reaction time game. The RA working with partner #2 will take their fNIRS cap off after the end of the competitive reaction time game.\n\nFor the co-viewing condition, partners will be reunited by the Support RA bringing their participant into the Lead RA's study room. The Support RA will set their participant up next to their romantic partner at an adjacent computer to view the images together. Both participants will receive instructions once more to view each image and then rate how positive and negative each image is from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Once all conditions of the Image Viewing Task are complete, the couples will be separated again to complete the competitive reaction time game.\n\n------fNIRS-----\n\nThe fNIRSport (NIRx Medical Technologies, LLC, New York, USA) equipment will be utilized for the neuroimaging component of the study. This non-invasive procedure does not have any risks associated with the device, although participants with sensitive scalps will be not be eligible to participate because the slight pressure of the fNIRS cap would be uncomfortable. The fNIRS system will consist of 16 light sources and 16 detectors, with a 3cm space between probes, comprising 48 channels. \n\nThe device is fitted to each partner by first measuring the circumference around their head to determine the size of the cap. There are three sizes: 54 (small), 56 (medium), 58 (large). The cap will be positioned over the frontal and frontotemporal area with its lowest-row center optode at the electrode position FPz, according to the international 10-20 system for EEG (Jasper, 1958). Once the cap is fitted to each participant the placement and distance between the optodes will be adjusted and secured. A black shower cap will be secured over the top of the optodes and around the head to shield from any extraneous light. Each LED light source emits light at two wavelengths (760 and 850 nm). Data will be recorded at 7.81 Hz. \n\n-----Aggression Task (aka Competitive Reaction Time Game)-----\nBoth romantic partners will be told the cover story that they will be playing a competitive reaction time game with each other and a stranger. Each RA will tell their respective dyad member that they will be playing against each other and a stranger, and they will be placed in separate rooms as to not distract one another from playing the game. In reality, they will each be playing against the computer with preprogrammed wins and losses. This game will take the form of a competitive reaction-time task in which the winner could deliver aversive noise to the loser through headphones. The aggression task will consist of a total of 32 trials, with each round consisting of 8 trials. Participants will play against each opponent for two rounds. Prior to each trial, participants will be instructed to set the volume of the noise blast their opponent would receive if the participant won the round, ranging from Level 1 (60 dB) to Level 4 (105 dB) in 15 dB intervals, not to exceed 105 dB. After each trial, participants will see the intensity settings their opponents set for them and then whether they won or lost. \n\nThe task is set to have the participants win four trials and lose four trials against each opponent (determined randomly, despite being told that their performance was what determined the outcome of each trial). All noise levels will be calibrated beforehand such that, although the noise is unpleasant, no damage to the ear will occur. The volume that the participant sets for their partner serves as our measure of aggression.\n\n-----Final Questionnaire Portion -----\nAfter playing the Competitive Reaction Time Game \"together,\" participants will complete the final few questionnaires that measure aggressive tendencies. These self-report measures will provide evidence of participants typical conflict or aggressive tendencies.\n\n-----Debriefing-----\nPrior to debrief, research assistants will check qualtrics for overt violence items on the Abuse Within Intimate Relationships Scale (items 16-26). If any of these items are endorsed an additional three questions need to be asked participants (see below).\n\nParticipants will remain separated for the final debrief. First, participants will be asked three suspicion questions. Specifically, participants will be asked, \"What did you think the study was about?\", \"Did anything seem strange or unusual to you?\" and \u201cDid you feel like you were being tricked at all during the study procedures?\u201d Next, participants will be fully debriefed and explained the true nature of the study. Following the debrief, participants will be asked to answer a couple questions to assess whether it is safe to reunite the romantic partners following the conflict paradigm. Participants will be asked two questions, \u201cAre you feeling any lingering feelings of anger or frustration towards your romantic partner?\u201d and \u201cDo you feel like you might want to hurt your partner if you saw them in a few moments?\u201d If participants say yes to either question, indicating it is unsafe to reunite them with their romantic partner, the respective RA will give them an opportunity to work through those feelings by instructing them to re-read the debriefing form provided while the RA steps out of the room to give the participant space. The RA will return after a couple of minutes to check back in with the participant and ask the debriefing questions again. Study procedures are expected to be no more or less upsetting than everyday life, but resources will be available to participants for support or for referral to counseling services if appropriate.\n\n---If AWIRS items are endorsed, three additional open ended questions will be asked ---\n\nResearch assistants will explain to the participant they are going to ask three open ended questions\n\n1. What are your fears and concerns regarding being reunited with your romantic partner?\n2. What specific stresses did you experience from the study procedures today that will impact your safety with your\nromantic partner?\n3. Do you think any threats will be made against you after completing these study procedures and if so, what threats?\n\n*If participants express any concern being reunited with their partner we will immediately provide them with contact information for the YWCA's confidential 24-hour domestic violence hotline that can provide free transportation (pre-paid ubers) and emergency housing, as well as put them in touch with resources. We will also put them in contact with the VCU Well's dating violence advocacy services. If the romantic partners both feel ready to be reunited, the Lead RA will finish the debrief process together. The Lead RA will thank both romantic partners for participating in the study, and ask them both together, one more time, if they feel angry or aggressive towards each other. Finally, the Support RA will lead both romantic partners out of the lab.\n\nVCU participants that are completing the study for credit will be granted their credit immediately following the session. Any non-VCU participants will be placed into a raffle for two chances to win $50 at the end of the study.", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "1. Image Viewing Task: Whether participants are viewing images alone (intrapersonal condition) or with their romantic partner (interpersonal condition), is experimentally manipulated, as well as the type of images they view: negative, neutral, or positive. \n\nParticipants will view images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; Lang, Bradley, and Cuthbert, 2008), which includes standardized images normed for valence and arousal levels intended to evoke emotional responses. Negative images will be selected based on the minimum criterion that they are rated less than four, with arousal ratings expected to be around five (see Mikels et al., 2005 for review of emotional category data of IAPS). The neutral midpoint is five, so all neutral images will be within \u00bd rating unit of the midpoint, with lower expected arousal ratings compared to negative and positive images (~3). Positive images will be selected based on valence ratings greater than six, with arousal ratings expected to be around five. So this task takes a 2 (viewing condition: intrapersonal or interpersonal) x 3 (image condition: negative, neutral, or positive) within-subjects design.\n\n2. Aggression Target: Whether participants are aggressing against their romantic partner or a stranger, is experimentally manipulated, as well as whether the given interaction partner is highly provocative (selects a 3 or 4 volume noise blast) or less provocative (selects a 1 or 2 volume noise blast), so this task takes a 2 (aggression target: romantic partner or stranger) x 2 (provocation: high or low) within-subjects design.", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Demographics and Relationship Status - Participants will report their current age, gender/ethnic/racial identity, current romantic relationship status and the duration of that relationship.\n\nTaylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP) - aggressive behavior will be measured by the volume of sound blasts that participants select for their opponent from 1 (lowest sound blast) to 4 (highest sound blast),  targeted at either their romantic partner or opposite sex stranger. These settings will be averaged together for each participant, separately for each of the 2 targets. This task will proceed over 32 trials. Each trial will begin with a fixation cross to model baseline neural activation, followed by a volume-setting screen (participants have three seconds to respond), followed by a competition screen (3 seconds each, followed by a screen indicating their opponent's volume setting (3 seconds each), and ending with a screen indicating whether they won or lost the competition (3 seconds each). Trials are presented in blocks of 8 (2 blocks per aggression target), each block is preceded by a screen instructing participants who the subsequent 8 trials will be played against (3 seconds each). Trials are randomly assigned to include high or low provocation from participants' opponents.\n\nQuestionnaires:\n1. Negative Urgency will be assessed using the negative urgency subscale of the 59-item version of the UPPS-P Impulsivity Scale (UPPS-P; Whiteside and Lynam, 2001). Participants will be asked to rate the extent of their agreement with statements on a 4-point Likert Scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree).  \n\n2.Intimate Partner Aggression:\n\na. Abuse Within Intimate Relationships Scale (AWIRS; Borjesson, Aarons, and Dunn, 2003)- 26-item scale in which participants report how frequently they have abused their partner, from 0 (Never) to 7 (More than once a day). AWIRS consists of five subscales: emotional abuse, deception, verbal abuse, overt violence, and restrictive violence. \n\nb. Conflict Tactics Scale - 20-item scale in which participants report how frequently they have abused their partner, from 0 (This never happened) to 7 (Not in the past year, but it did happen before). This scale measures both self and partner reports of intimate partner aggression perpetration. \n\nc. Forms and Functions of Intimate Partner Aggression - 36-item self-report of the forms (overt, relational) and functions (reactive, proactive) of intimate partner aggression scored on a 1 (not at all) - 4 (completely true) scale with higher scores indicating higher propensity for IPA perpetration. The items break down to six sub-scales with six items per sub-scale with Items 1-6 capturing overt IPA, 7-12 reactive overt, 13-18 proactive overt, 19-24 relational, 25-30 reactive relational, and 31-36 capturing proactive relational aggression.\n\n3. Efficacy of Interpersonal Regulation of Negative Affect will be measured using the following two scales:\n\na. Negative efficacy will be measured using the negative efficacy subscale of the 16-item Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire (IRQ; Williams, Morelli, Ong, and Zaki, 2018). The IRQ assesses subjective reports of four characteristics of interpersonal emotion regulation: the tendency to use interpersonal emotion regulation for positive and negative emotions and their efficacy (i.e., how well interpersonal emotion regulation strategies work to regulate their emotions), which creates four subscales: Negative-Tendency, Negative-Efficacy, Positive-Tendency, and Positive-Efficacy.  Each subscale consists of four items that respondents rate the extent to which they agree with various statements on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).\n\nb. Effective Intrinsic Interpersonal Regulation of Negative Affect Scale (EIIRNAS) is a 16-item measure that assesses the extent to which social interaction is effective in dampening or modifying the expression or experience of negative affect. Each item is rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "Negative emotion ratings from the intrapersonal and interpersonal image viewing tasks will be combined into an index of \"effective interpersonal regulation of negative affect.\" First, we will take the average of the negative emotion ratings from each condition separately (intrapersonal, interpersonal). Second, we will subtract the average negative emotion rating from intrapersonal from the average negative emotion rating from the interpersonal condition to compute an index of effective interpersonal regulation of negative affect. The same method will be applied to the positive and neutral emotion ratings to use to test whether our predictions are unique to negative affect. \n\n1. Negative Urgency will be assessed using the negative urgency subscale of the 59-item version of the UPPS-P Impulsivity Scale (UPPS-P; Whiteside and Lynam, 2001). We will take the mean of the 12 negative urgency items. \n\n2.Intimate Partner Aggression:\n\na. Abuse Within Intimate Relationships Scale (AWIRS; Borjesson, Aarons, and Dunn, 2003)- 26-item scale in which participants report how frequently they have abused their partner, from 0 (Never) to 7 (More than once a day). We will take the mean of each subscale:  emotional abuse (7 items), deception (4 items), verbal abuse (5 items), overt violence (7 items), and restrictive violence (3 items). \n\nb. Conflict Tactics Scale - 20-item scale in which participants report how frequently they have abused their partner, from 0 (This never happened) to 7 (Not in the past year, but it did happen before). We will take the mean of the 10 self-oriented items to compute a self index of intimate partner aggression and take the mean of the 10 partner-oriented items to compute a partner index of intimate partner aggression.\n\nc. Forms and Functions of Intimate Partner Aggression -  We will take the average of each six-item subscale: overt IPA, reactive overt, proactive overt, relational, reactive relational, and  proactive relational aggression.\n\n3. Efficacy of Interpersonal Regulation of Negative Affect will be measured using the following two scales:\n\na. Negative efficacy will be measured using the negative efficacy subscale of the 16-item Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire (IRQ; Williams, Morelli, Ong, and Zaki, 2018). We will take the average of each 4-item subscale: Negative-Tendency, Negative-Efficacy, Positive-Tendency, and Positive-Efficacy.  \n\nb. Effective Intrinsic Interpersonal Regulation of Negative Affect Scale (EIIRNAS) - We will compute a mean score for this scale. \n\n", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Overall Data Analytic Plan: In order to account for the dyadic nature of the data, the present study will use an indirect effects approach to test the hypotheses in a multilevel framework where individuals (level 1) are nested within couples (level 2). In each model, the first step will estimate and test the total effect (c) of the independent variable (x) on the dependent variable (y). The second step will test the effects of the independent variable (x) on the mediating variable (m). Finally, the third step will test the effects of the mediating variable (m) and independent variable (x) on the dependent variable (y). \n\nFollowing recommended procedures (Kenny et al., 2006), gender will be contrast-coded (-1 = men, 1 = women). Behavioral aggression and self-reported aggression are the outcome measures of interest. Separate indirect effect models will be run predicting each aggression outcome measure from negative urgency. In addition, each model will be run using self-reported effective interpersonal regulation of negative affect and VMPFC activation (while viewing negative images) as mediators, for a total of four separate indirect effect models run for two mediators and two outcome variables. \n\nAnalyses will be conducted using the LME4 package (Bates, Maechler, Bolker, and Walker 2014) for R (R Core Team 2015). This package provides functions to fit and analyze linear mixed models, generalized linear mixed models, and nonlinear mixed models.\n\n----fNIRS Data -----\n\nThe NIRStar acquisition software (NIRx Medical Technologies, LLC, New York, USA) will be used to record blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response using fNIRS and to assess its signal-to-noise ratio. Neuronal activity is associated with changes in localized cerebral blood flow. The HOMER3 data analysis package in Matlab will be used for all subsequent preprocessing and analysis. Head or skin movement can cause decoupling between the optode and scalp, resulting in abrupt changes in the amplitude of the received signal. Raw data will be visually inspected for spike artifacts and faulty channels, and if any are detected, they will be removed for future analyses. Following the recommendation of Burns and Lieberman (2019), we will run a principle components analysis for motion correction to discard noisy components. The modified Beer-Lambert law (MBLL) will be used to compute estimates of changes in oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (dHB) levels from the frequency-filtered data relative to baseline (Dixon-Gordan, Bernecker, Christensen, 2015; Sassaroli and Fantini, 2004). Increases of O2Hb, as well as decreases of dHB, are indicators of cortical activity (Obrig and Villringer, 2003). To remove baseline drift and physiological noise, band-pass filtering will be used with a low cutoff frequency of 0.01 Hz and a high cutoff frequency of 0.10 Hz.  \n\nRecommended preprocessing pipeline summary:\n1) Visually inspect \"bad channels\" and remove\n2) Identify windows of motion artifact\n3) Principle Components Analysis (PCA) motion correction\n4) MBLL conversion\n5) Frequency filtering\n*Matlab scripts from Shannon Burns (https://github.com/smburns47) will be modified to fit our study design and will later be uploaded and shared.\n\t\nThe preprocessed fNIRS time series from the Image Viewing Task will be analyzed in an event-related manner with a model-based approach applying a two-level general linear model (GLM).\n\nFirst level (within-participants). First, each participant\u2019s BOLD signal will be modeled with a fixed-effects analysis, which will separately model each image condition (negative, positive, neutral) and condition order (Intrapersonal Emotion Regulation \u2013 viewing images alone, Interpersonal Emotion Regulation \u2013 co-viewing images) as regressors using Gaussian hemodynamic response functions (HRF) with a temporal derivative. A linear contrast will compare image conditions (Negative and Positive + Neutral images). This linear contrast was selected because at the root of negative urgency is self-regulatory failure in response to negative affect. Thus, it is appropriate to isolate BOLD response to negative images, controlling for BOLD response to images in general and positively-valenced affective images. As well as viewing condition (Interpersonal and Intrapersonal). This contrast allows us to isolate BOLD response to images that were co-viewed with a romantic partner (Interpersonal Emotion Regulation), controlling for BOLD responses to viewing images alone (Intrapersonal Emotion Regulation). \n\nSecond level (between-participants).  Each participant's time series from the first step will be fed into a group-level, mixed effects GLM. Brain hemodynamic changes over time will be extracted for the main effect of Negative &amp; Positive + Neutral contrast and Interpersonal and Intrapersonal Emotion Regulation contrast. The VMPFC (fNIRS channels associated with Brodmann area 10, 14, 25, and 32; Phelps, Delgado, Nearing, &amp; LeDoux, 2004) as our region of interest (ROI) will be extracted according to the experimental design. The Negative and Positive + Neutral contrast during Interpersonal and Interpersonal contrast will be modeled in a bias-corrected and accelerated, bootstrapped indirect effect model to test the effect of VMPFC activation (during interpersonal emotion regulation to negative stimuli) on the link between negative urgency and intimate partner aggression.\n\nRegistration of fNIRS Channels to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) Space: The virtual registration method will be applied to estimate the corresponding fNIRS channels to cortical topography (Tsuzuki et al., 2007). Structural information from an anatomical database will provide estimates of the channel positions from a standardized 3D brain atlas. This method can estimate the spatial uncertainty of channel locations due to the variability between subjects.
