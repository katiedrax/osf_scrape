The indegree centrality will be measured as the number of ties that are directed towards the node (messages and likes received).

The formal analysis will be done on the data gathered from 3 waves (w5, w6, w7). Therefore, the standardization within waves and the variable \"wave\" in the multilevel model will be added.

Therefore, all the data we have will be used in this study. The number of participants is 774, and 518 out of them sent at least one message in the social media (van Woudenberg et. al., 2020).

The models will be constructed in the Bayesian way using brms package in R. The strength of evidence will be inferred from Bayes factors, which is computed using BayesRS package in R. Four different models will be constructed, with each of the four centrality measures as the fixed effect. A random intercept for participants and waves and the random slope for waves will be included in every model to address the clustered structure of the data (i.e., the contents are nested in participants and waves). Besides, the scale suggested by Jeffrey (1961) will be used to help to interpret the strength of the evidence corresponding to the Bayes factors. \nIf any technical problems occur in our formal analysis, we will move to Bayesian analysis based on the BayesFactor package. If that doesn't work either, we will go back to use a frequentist approach with Satterthwaite correction to draw the conclusions, which is implemented in the afex package.", "outliers": "Participants are excluded from corresponding models if their centrality measurement cannot be calculated. This may come from the following reasons: the participant only sent group messages but no one-to-one messages or likes, so he/she cannot be included in the network; the participant is the only one who sent messages or likes in his/her classroom, therefore the SD is 0 and standardized score cannot be calculated.", "dependent": "Positivity of communication. \nThe messages sent by the participants will be analyzed by a sentiment analysis package, the Dutch version of pattern (Smedt &amp; Daelemans, 2012).

Therefore, before analyzing the content, we will clean the raw data. Our approach is based on the automatic correction package hunspell. Basically, we make manual dictionaries for the frequently occurring words that hunspell couldn't give correct suggestions, and use them to replace the words in the original content. The words that are not corrected by our manual corrections will be handled by hunspell. If hunspell isn't able to correct them, they will be replaced by \"\\\\\\\\\". The process of data cleaning is also described with more details in the flowcharts and the codes in this repository.

The indegree centrality will be measured as the number of ties that are directed towards the node (messages and likes received). Whereas outdegree centrality will be measured as the number of ties that the node directs to others (likes and messages send).

After checking scale properties, it will be used as a simple additive scale in the regression analysis.\n(2) The focal predictor/independent variable is \"Objective Norms\" or ONCPB (Scale of objective norms on Covid-19 protective behaviors). The items concern the Covid-19 protective behavior of other people Rs are likely to observe in their immediate vicinity: \"neighbors\", \"people at your workplace\", \"other shoppers in your usual grocery store\", and \"cashiers in grocery stores\".  The items follow detailed questions about how you personally engage in a list of Covid-protective behaviors, how efficacious you think each one is, and whether each is/ would be emotionally costly to you, so when Rs are asked about how often these sets of actors engage in Covid-protective behaviors, the usual set of these will be salient. These will be included in a simple additive scale to make our focal predictor variable in the regression analysis.

study 20160507AA. We are conducting a replication study. We note deviations from the original design below but the preregistrations are otherwise identical.] Fact-checking is an increasingly popular way for American political journalists to verify the accuracy of statements by political figures. The trend has grown rapidly, with prominent organizations such as FactCheck.org and PolitiFact receiving national recognition and journalism awards. The work of fact-checking organizations is often cited in the media, giving credibility and professional acceptance to this new form of political coverage. There is currently very little literature on the effects of fact-checking. Moreover, existing research on the effects of correcting misperceptions has generated conflicting results. Nyhan and Reifler (2010) found that corrections failed to reduce misperceptions and, in some extreme cases produced a \u201cbackfire effect\u201d in which corrections strengthened misperceptions. Fridkin et al. (2015) showed that fact-checks of negative television advertisements influenced people\u2019s assessments of the accuracy, usefulness, and tone of negative political advertisements. Finally, Nyhan and Reifler (2016) showed that there was no evidence that exposure to fact-checking affected people\u2019s attitudes toward the practice, trust in politicians, or feelings of political efficacy, but exposure to fact-checking did increase how much people knew about contemporary political controversies and debates. The specific objective of this project is to examine the effects of summary fact-checking, an innovation in the field that is becoming more common. This format presents an overview of ratings of the accuracy of a politician\u2019s statements rather than an evaluation of a single statement. Our study will measure the effects of summary fact-checks on a politician\u2019s perceived accuracy and favorability. This project will also compare the effects of summary fact-checks to individual fact-checks that only verify a singular statement. We expect that summary fact-checking will be seen as more comprehensive and less selective than individual fact-checks and may therefore have a greater effect on public perceptions of politicians. Our experiment will therefore assess whether or not the effect of individual fact-checks differs from the effect of summary fact-checks on an individual\u2019s favorability toward a politician or the perceived accuracy of their statements. We will also take the political affiliation of both the participant and the politician into account, so we can determine whether the effects of individual and summary fact-checks vary by whether the target is a co-partisan or an opposition partisan. Finally, we will also consider whether these effects vary by political knowledge and analyze whether exposure to summary or individual fact-checks affects attitudes toward the practice more generally. The results of this experiment will allow us to understand the efficacy of different forms of fact-checking, which may help us better understand how news outlets\u2019 fact-checking practices influence public opinion. This replication experiment modifies the summary fact-checking treatment to omit any comparison between the senator in question and the average senator. Minor modifications were also made to correct typographical errors and to update the content of the survey to be accurate for administration in November 2016. (The first study was administered in May 2016.)"}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: Exposure to a negative individual fact-check or to summary fact-check information will reduce perceptions of politician accuracy and favorability H2: Perceptions of politician accuracy and favorability will be lower for participants exposed to negative summary fact-check information than for those exposed to an individual fact-check H3: Perceptions of politician accuracy and favorability will change more in response to individual or summary fact-check exposure among opposition partisans than among co-partisans RQ1: Will the effects of exposure to fact-check information on perceptions of politician accuracy and favorability vary by political knowledge/education or between partisans who are low vs. high in political knowledge/education?

All Turkers are eligible to participate in this study who meet the specified qualifications and did not take part in an earlier pilot study or our first experiment. The sample size will be approximately 2825 to match the sample size in our prior experiment\u2013 data collection will continue until all funds allocated to the project ($2,000) are exhausted. Researchers have no role in selecting the participants after listing the project on Mechanical Turk. Randomization approach We will use a between-subjects design in which respondents are randomly assigned to one of six conditions by the Qualtrics online survey platform (p=1/6 for each): Summary fact-check treatment conditions: -Fact-checking a Democrat (Harry Reid; asked about him first) -Fact-checking a Republican (Mitch McConnell; asked about him first) Individual fact-check treatment conditions: -Fact-checking a Democrat (Harry Reid; asked about him first) -Fact-checking a Republican (Mitch McConnell; asked about him first) Control conditions (placebo image/text; no fact-check provided): -Asked about perceptions of a Democrat first (Harry Reid) -Asked about perceptions of a Republican first (Mitch McConnell) Participants will first be randomized into one of the three conditions (summary fact-check, individual fact-check, or control) with equal probability (1/3) and then randomized into the Reid or McConnell versions of each with equal probability (1/2). Data collection and blinding Data will be collected on the Qualtrics online survey platform. There may be some online discussion among Mechanical Turk workers about the details of our survey. This cannot be prevented and we hope that these participants preserve the integrity of the research. Primary and secondary outcome measures Our primary outcome variables are perceptions of the favorability and accuracy of the fact-check target (McConnell or Reid) compared to participants in the control group who were asked first about the same person. Each outcome variable will be measured on a five-point scale: The next few questions will be about Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the Majority Leader of the Senate. In general, how often do you think that he makes accurate statements? -All of the time (5) -Most of the time (4) -About half the time (3) -Occasionally (2) -Never (1) Do you have a favorable or unfavorable view of Senator McConnell (R-KY)? -Very favorable (5) -Somewhat favorable (4) -Neither favorable nor unfavorable (3) -Somewhat unfavorable (2) -Very unfavorable (1) The following statement was said by Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY). We would like to know how accurate you believe the statement to be. \u201cKentucky has more private sector jobs than ever before.\u201d -Very accurate (4) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Not very accurate (2) -Not at all accurate (1) The next few questions will be about Senator Harry Reid (D-NV), the former Majority Leader of the Senate. In general, how often do you think that he makes accurate statements? -All of the time (5) -Most of the time (4) -About half the time (3) -Occasionally (2) -Never (1) Do you have a favorable or unfavorable view of Senator Reid (D-NV)? -Very favorable (5) -Somewhat favorable (4) -Neither favorable nor unfavorable (3) -Somewhat unfavorable (2) -Very unfavorable (1) The following statement was said by Senator Harry Reid (D-NV). We would like to know how accurate you believe the statement to be. \u201cNevada has more private sector jobs than ever before.\u201d -Very accurate (4) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Not very accurate (2) -Not at all accurate (1) Our secondary outcome variables measure opinions toward fact-checking using the following questions, which will be analyzed separately and also as a composite measure if they scale together using principal components factor analysis. In general, how favorable or unfavorable is your overall opinion of the fact-checking movement in journalism? -Very favorable (6) -Somewhat favorable (5) -Slightly favorable (4) -Slightly unfavorable (3) -Somewhat unfavorable (2) -Very unfavorable (1) Thinking about the amount of fact-checking that you see being performed today by journalists, do you think there should be more fact-checking, the current amount of fact-checking is about right, or there should be less fact-checking? -There should be more fact-checking. (3) -The current amount of fact-checking is about right. (2) -There should be less fact-checking. (1) In general, how often do you think articles published by fact-checkers are accurate? -All of the time (5) -Most of the time (4) -About half the time (3) -Occasionally (2) -Never (1) In presenting the news dealing with political and social issues, do you think fact-checkers deal fairly with all sides or tend to favor one side? -Fact-checkers tend to deal fairly with all sides. (1) -Fact-checkers tend to favor one side. (0) Statistical analyses For each of our analyses, we will use OLS with robust standard errors and estimate ordered probit models with robust standard errors as a robustness check. Unless otherwise noted, all experimental treatment effects will be estimated as intent to treat effects. Leaners will be treated as partisans in our statistical analyses. Perceptions of politicians will only be assessed for the first politician for which outcome measures were collected to avoid contrast effects. Participants\u2019 political knowledge will be assessed with a standard five-question battery that test participant knowledge of U.S. electoral rules and awareness of current political figures. Partisanship is measured on a standard seven-point scale administered via branching questions. Our primary model will be pooled regressions for individuals who saw either candidate, but we will also estimate regressions interacting target politician with fact-checking type (the main explanatory variable). If we cannot reject the null of no difference in effects by target, we will present the pooled model and also present separate results for Reid and McConnell either in the main text or an appendix. If the effects of key explanatory variables differ depending on the fact-checking target, we will present separate models for Reid and McConnell in the main text for expositional clarity and present interactive models in an appendix. We will estimate marginal effects as appropriate when interaction terms are included in our models. (We will also estimate our treatment effect models with standard demographic controls and report these results if the treatment effect estimate is substantively different from the model only including partisan affiliation.) To test H1, we will estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC for the accuracy and favorability outcome measures. To test H2, we will then evaluate b1-b2 directly for each outcome measure. To test H3, we will estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*copartisan+b4*opposition+b5*summaryFCXcopartisan+b6*summaryFCXopposition+b7*individualFCXcopartisan+b8*individualFCXopposition and then estimate b5-b6 and b7-b8. [Per above, we will estimate all pairwise comparisons in treatment effects between partisan groups. However, we expect to encounter power problems given the relatively small number of pure independents and may thus focus on the comparison between the co-partisan and opposition partisan groups.] To test RQ1, we will first estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*knowledge+ b4*summaryFCXknowledge+b5*individualFCXknowledge and then estimate y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*copartisan+b4*opposition+b5*summaryFCXcopartisan+b6*summaryFCXopposition+b7*individualFCXcopartisan+b8*individualFCXopposition +b9*knowledge+b10*summaryFCXknowledge+b11*individualFCXknowledge+b12*copartisanXknowledge+b13*oppositionXknowledge+b14*summaryFCXknowledgeXopposition+b15*individualFCXknowledgeXopposition. In each model, we will estimate whether the effects of the fact-checks vary by political knowledge versus the control group and each other (and, in the latter case, by partisanship as well). We will test whether the effect of knowledge is linear per Hainmueller et al. and follow their recommendations if not.

We are conducting a replication study. We note deviations from the original design below but the preregistrations are otherwise identical.] Fact-checking is an increasingly popular way for American political journalists to verify the accuracy of statements by political figures. The trend has grown rapidly, with prominent organizations such as FactCheck.org and PolitiFact receiving national recognition and journalism awards. The work of fact-checking organizations is often cited in the media, giving credibility and professional acceptance to this new form of political coverage. There is currently very little literature on the effects of fact-checking. Moreover, existing research on the effects of correcting misperceptions has generated conflicting results. Nyhan and Reifler (2010) found that corrections failed to reduce misperceptions and, in some extreme cases produced a \u201cbackfire effect\u201d in which corrections strengthened misperceptions. Fridkin et al. (2015) showed that fact-checks of negative television advertisements influenced people\u2019s assessments of the accuracy, usefulness, and tone of negative political advertisements. Finally, Nyhan and Reifler (2016) showed that there was no evidence that exposure to fact-checking affected people\u2019s attitudes toward the practice, trust in politicians, or feelings of political efficacy, but exposure to fact-checking did increase how much people knew about contemporary political controversies and debates. The specific objective of this project is to examine the effects of summary fact-checking, an innovation in the field that is becoming more common. This format presents an overview of ratings of the accuracy of a politician\u2019s statements rather than an evaluation of a single statement. Our study will measure the effects of summary fact-checks on a politician\u2019s perceived accuracy and favorability. This project will also compare the effects of summary fact-checks to individual fact-checks that only verify a singular statement. We expect that summary fact-checking will be seen as more comprehensive and less selective than individual fact-checks and may therefore have a greater effect on public perceptions of politicians. Our experiment will therefore assess whether or not the effect of individual fact-checks differs from the effect of summary fact-checks on an individual\u2019s favorability toward a politician or the perceived accuracy of their statements. We will also take the political affiliation of both the participant and the politician into account, so we can determine whether the effects of individual and summary fact-checks vary by whether the target is a co-partisan or an opposition partisan. Finally, we will also consider whether these effects vary by political knowledge and analyze whether exposure to summary or individual fact-checks affects attitudes toward the practice more generally. The results of this experiment will allow us to understand the efficacy of different forms of fact-checking, which may help us better understand how news outlets\u2019 fact-checking practices influence public opinion. This replication experiment modifies the summary fact-checking treatment to omit any comparison between the senator in question and the average senator. Minor modifications were also made to correct typographical errors and to update the content of the survey to be accurate for administration in November 2016. (The first study was administered in May 2016.)", "q16": "H1: Exposure to a negative individual fact-check or to summary fact-check information will reduce perceptions of politician accuracy and favorability H2: Perceptions of politician accuracy and favorability will be lower for participants exposed to negative summary fact-check information than for those exposed to an individual fact-check H3: Perceptions of politician accuracy and favorability will change more in response to individual or summary fact-check exposure among opposition partisans than among co-partisans RQ1: Will the effects of exposure to fact-check information on perceptions of politician accuracy and favorability vary by political knowledge/education or between partisans who are low vs. high in political knowledge/education? RQ2: Will exposure to fact-check information change opinions toward the practice of fact-checking generally?", "q17": "[The study protocol is attached.]\u2028 Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants Participants will be United States residents age 18 and over recruited on the Amazon Mechanical Turk online marketplace. All Turkers are eligible to participate in this study who meet the specified qualifications and did not take part in an earlier pilot study or our first experiment. The sample size will be approximately 2825 to match the sample size in our prior experiment\u2013 data collection will continue until all funds allocated to the project ($2,000) are exhausted. Researchers have no role in selecting the participants after listing the project on Mechanical Turk. Randomization approach We will use a between-subjects design in which respondents are randomly assigned to one of six conditions by the Qualtrics online survey platform (p=1/6 for each): Summary fact-check treatment conditions: -Fact-checking a Democrat (Harry Reid; asked about him first) -Fact-checking a Republican (Mitch McConnell; asked about him first) Individual fact-check treatment conditions: -Fact-checking a Democrat (Harry Reid; asked about him first) -Fact-checking a Republican (Mitch McConnell; asked about him first) Control conditions (placebo image/text; no fact-check provided): -Asked about perceptions of a Democrat first (Harry Reid) -Asked about perceptions of a Republican first (Mitch McConnell) Participants will first be randomized into one of the three conditions (summary fact-check, individual fact-check, or control) with equal probability (1/3) and then randomized into the Reid or McConnell versions of each with equal probability (1/2). Data collection and blinding Data will be collected on the Qualtrics online survey platform. There may be some online discussion among Mechanical Turk workers about the details of our survey. This cannot be prevented and we hope that these participants preserve the integrity of the research. Primary and secondary outcome measures Our primary outcome variables are perceptions of the favorability and accuracy of the fact-check target (McConnell or Reid) compared to participants in the control group who were asked first about the same person. Each outcome variable will be measured on a five-point scale: The next few questions will be about Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the Majority Leader of the Senate. In general, how often do you think that he makes accurate statements? -All of the time (5) -Most of the time (4) -About half the time (3) -Occasionally (2) -Never (1) Do you have a favorable or unfavorable view of Senator McConnell (R-KY)? -Very favorable (5) -Somewhat favorable (4) -Neither favorable nor unfavorable (3) -Somewhat unfavorable (2) -Very unfavorable (1) The following statement was said by Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY). We would like to know how accurate you believe the statement to be. \u201cKentucky has more private sector jobs than ever before.\u201d -Very accurate (4) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Not very accurate (2) -Not at all accurate (1) The next few questions will be about Senator Harry Reid (D-NV), the former Majority Leader of the Senate. In general, how often do you think that he makes accurate statements? -All of the time (5) -Most of the time (4) -About half the time (3) -Occasionally (2) -Never (1) Do you have a favorable or unfavorable view of Senator Reid (D-NV)? -Very favorable (5) -Somewhat favorable (4) -Neither favorable nor unfavorable (3) -Somewhat unfavorable (2) -Very unfavorable (1) The following statement was said by Senator Harry Reid (D-NV). We would like to know how accurate you believe the statement to be. \u201cNevada has more private sector jobs than ever before.\u201d -Very accurate (4) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Not very accurate (2) -Not at all accurate (1) Our secondary outcome variables measure opinions toward fact-checking using the following questions, which will be analyzed separately and also as a composite measure if they scale together using principal components factor analysis. In general, how favorable or unfavorable is your overall opinion of the fact-checking movement in journalism? -Very favorable (6) -Somewhat favorable (5) -Slightly favorable (4) -Slightly unfavorable (3) -Somewhat unfavorable (2) -Very unfavorable (1) Thinking about the amount of fact-checking that you see being performed today by journalists, do you think there should be more fact-checking, the current amount of fact-checking is about right, or there should be less fact-checking? -There should be more fact-checking. (3) -The current amount of fact-checking is about right. (2) -There should be less fact-checking. (1) In general, how often do you think articles published by fact-checkers are accurate? -All of the time (5) -Most of the time (4) -About half the time (3) -Occasionally (2) -Never (1) In presenting the news dealing with political and social issues, do you think fact-checkers deal fairly with all sides or tend to favor one side? -Fact-checkers tend to deal fairly with all sides. (1) -Fact-checkers tend to favor one side. (0) Statistical analyses For each of our analyses, we will use OLS with robust standard errors and estimate ordered probit models with robust standard errors as a robustness check. Unless otherwise noted, all experimental treatment effects will be estimated as intent to treat effects. Leaners will be treated as partisans in our statistical analyses. Perceptions of politicians will only be assessed for the first politician for which outcome measures were collected to avoid contrast effects. Participants\u2019 political knowledge will be assessed with a standard five-question battery that test participant knowledge of U.S. electoral rules and awareness of current political figures. Partisanship is measured on a standard seven-point scale administered via branching questions. Our primary model will be pooled regressions for individuals who saw either candidate, but we will also estimate regressions interacting target politician with fact-checking type (the main explanatory variable). If we cannot reject the null of no difference in effects by target, we will present the pooled model and also present separate results for Reid and McConnell either in the main text or an appendix. If the effects of key explanatory variables differ depending on the fact-checking target, we will present separate models for Reid and McConnell in the main text for expositional clarity and present interactive models in an appendix. We will estimate marginal effects as appropriate when interaction terms are included in our models. (We will also estimate our treatment effect models with standard demographic controls and report these results if the treatment effect estimate is substantively different from the model only including partisan affiliation.) To test H1, we will estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC for the accuracy and favorability outcome measures. To test H2, we will then evaluate b1-b2 directly for each outcome measure. To test H3, we will estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*copartisan+b4*opposition+b5*summaryFCXcopartisan+b6*summaryFCXopposition+b7*individualFCXcopartisan+b8*individualFCXopposition and then estimate b5-b6 and b7-b8. [Per above, we will estimate all pairwise comparisons in treatment effects between partisan groups. However, we expect to encounter power problems given the relatively small number of pure independents and may thus focus on the comparison between the co-partisan and opposition partisan groups.] To test RQ1, we will first estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*knowledge+ b4*summaryFCXknowledge+b5*individualFCXknowledge and then estimate y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*copartisan+b4*opposition+b5*summaryFCXcopartisan+b6*summaryFCXopposition+b7*individualFCXcopartisan+b8*individualFCXopposition +b9*knowledge+b10*summaryFCXknowledge+b11*individualFCXknowledge+b12*copartisanXknowledge+b13*oppositionXknowledge+b14*summaryFCXknowledgeXopposition+b15*individualFCXknowledgeXopposition. In each model, we will estimate whether the effects of the fact-checks vary by political knowledge versus the control group and each other (and, in the latter case, by partisanship as well). We will test whether the effect of knowledge is linear per Hainmueller et al. and follow their recommendations if not. We may also present a simple median split on knowledge in the main text and report the continuous interaction model in the appendix for expositional clarity. We will follow the same procedures for education, grouping all the some college/associate groups together in the continuous measure and treating college/non-college as the relevant binary measure. To test RQ2, we will estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC for individual fact-check opinion measures and the composite fact-check opinion measure (if they scale together) and then estimate b1-b2.", "q18": "United States of America", "q19": "", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "STUDY00029513", "q25": "4/22/16", "q26": "Other (describe in text box below)",

Other parent-reported child behaviors to be assessed include child daily screen usage time and screen usage purposes.\n\nParental distress will be assessed by Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7; Spitzer et al., 2006) and Kessler Screening Scale for Psychological Distress (K6; Kessler et al., 2002), as trauma psychologists have argued for measuring broader psychological functioning beyond PTSD symptoms (e.g., Bonanno et al., 2010). Multidimensional Assessment of Parenting Scale (MAPS; Parent &amp; Forehand, 2017) will assess positive domain (e.g., proactive parenting, positive reinforcement, warmth, and supportiveness) and negative domain (i.e., hostility, physical control, and lax control) with a total of 34 items. A set of questions related to parent communication about COVID-19 will also be included for the current project, including an open-ended narrative question asking parents to describe the details of a recent conversation they have with their children. \n\nDemographic information about parents (e.g., marital status, highest educational attainment, etc.), children (e.g., age, gender, disability status, etc.), and family (e.g., annual income, geographic location, significant losses/deaths, etc.) will be gathered. InCharge Financial Distress/Well-being Scale (Prawitz et al., 2006) will assess the family\u2019s current financial well-being and distress (10 items; e.g., \u201chow stressed do you feel about your personal finances?\u201d).

We will collect de-identified participant recruitment data via online survey logs, including (1) attrition and completion at each wave, (2) attention check questions, and (3) time spent to complete each survey. This information will be used to ensure data integrity from a social media convenience sample. We will inspect distributions, univariate and multivariate normality, covariance structures, as well as joint distributional properties of each ER and substance use outcome variable. Where possible, we will develop latent construct measures for these outcomes to maximize the multi-source, multi-method data, avoid inflation of Type I error due to multiple comparisons, and increase measurement reliability (Messick, 1989). Our criteria for including an indicator in a latent construct are as follows: the items comprising the indicator must show internal consistency (\u03b1 \u2265 .60; item-total correlation \u2265 .20) and the scale or indicator convergence in a CFA structural equation model (SEM) must demonstrate acceptable fit criteria.   \n\nGroup-based multi-trajectory modeling. To identify whether children reported varying symptom trajectories, we utilized group-based multi-trajectory modeling (Nagin et al., 2018) in SAS. Group-based multi-trajectory modeling is an extension of the univariate Growth Mixture Modeling (GMM). Group-based multi-trajectory modeling allows the identification of different profiles by the joint development of four symptom areas: anxious/withdrawal symptoms, fearfulness, acting out, and trauma-specific responses. A conditional model will also be estimated using county-level confirmed and death data as covariates to see if it increases the model fit. Extent data suggested a direct relationship between overall death toll and individual-level psychopathology among samples.\n\nParameters will be estimated using maximum likelihood estimation through a Newton-Raphson optimization algorithm and censored-normal models. Model selection of the number of groups and polynomial order (first or second) of the trajectories was based on a larger Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the average posterior probability of assignment (APPA) above .70, the odds of correct classification (OCC) above 5.0, a smaller mismatch between estimated and assigned group probabilities, a smaller standard deviation of group membership probabilities (SD-GMP), and the percentage of individuals estimated to be assigned to the smallest group above 1% (Klijn et al., 2017). Each child will be assigned to the multi-trajectory group having the highest posterior probability.\n\nAfter the selection of the final model, protective and risk factors will be examined for differences across the trajectory groups by analysis of variance and chi-square tests. For continuous variables, the mean parameters will be estimated for each group. For categorical variables. the probabilities for each category will be estimated for each group. Pairwise group comparisons after establishing the overall significance of ANOVA and Chi-Square tests will then be computed. The Benjamin-Hochberg procedure was used to adjust for the false discovery rate from multiple comparison rate, which controls the expected proportion of false discoveries (q) amongst the rejected null hypotheses. The false-positive rate was set at q = 0.05.\n\nModeration and mediation analysis. To further cross-validate our findings above on protective and risk factors, selected parenting and parental mental health constructs will be examined in moderation and mediation structural equation models. Specifically, we will examine how parenting behaviors (i.e., parental communications, warmth, behavioral control) will moderate vs. mediate the relationship between parental mental health and child mental health.  \n\nQualitative analysis. To supplement the quantitative findings and add depth to the analysis, we will analyze qualitative data derived from both the open-ended survey questions as well as interviews via NVivo 11. Audio-recorded interview data will be transcribed verbatim, cross-checked with the recording for accuracy.

The vignettes will expand on previous research on process-based policing by incorporating the police officer violating the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and searches the civilian without consent. This manipulation will also serve to examine the role of voice in evaluating police-civilian interactions, especially when constitutional rights are asserted or not. Three pilot studies were conducted to test manipulations of the procedural justice components individually to create the procedural justice and no procedural justice vignettes.\nThis study will answer the two research questions: through what mechanisms in the procedural justice framework do police officers, as compared to civilians, evaluate fairness in police-civilian interactions and does the extent of overlap between self- and social-identity mitigate the effect of role on evaluations of fairness. We expect to find that evaluations of fairness are predicted by procedural justice condition via indirect effects through the justice subscales for both the police and civilians. However, we expect the indirect effects to be different for police officers than for civilians and for those differences to be explained by a moderating effect of the extent to which the participants identify with the police versus their neighborhood. We expect that police officers who identify more closely with their neighborhood or community than with other police will evaluate fairness through the same mechanisms as civilians. However, police officers who identify more closely with the police than with their community will evaluate fairness through different mechanisms than civilian participants. We expect this moderation because participants both rely on and get identity information from procedural justice in police-civilian encounters (Blader &amp; Tyler, 2009; Leonardielli &amp; Min Toh, 2010; Oliveria &amp; Murphy, 2016).", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-19T22:18:56.201141", "date_modified": "2020-04-19T22:16:00.045996", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["N/A"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "fa226e969f33f35ff274dd7a47906f299087c6cecd41221bb5d2686535eaffe7779889738d14c8be5b891c97f65c987f5aa212a465c8bcb34d8b250367c53597ffa612b5399ebc735b7092bc088992ee258973dea9f9a0a62d9b366b9bb46cb16b7fab0c30e0bf322f25bf3f5e6d7e12d142d58c6654663c2d9863f7be907556303a7c31589396ca1ce02c5d79e651a4", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-19T22:18:56.178711", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Katherine Pearl Hazen, Eve M.

Perceptions of police legitimacy and institutional trust will be measured with the Attitudes Toward Police Legitimacy Scale (APLS; Reynolds, Estrada-Reynolds, &amp; Nunez, 2018) to control for pre-existing attitudes toward the police. The APLS has been found to be a reliable 34-item, single factor scale that measures perceptions of bias (3 items), quality of interpersonal treatment (4 items), trustworthiness (7 items), motivation (5 items), organizational integrity (4 items), being a member of the community (6 items), and normative alignment (4 items) of civilian respondents (Reynolds et al.). Responses will be rated on a 7-point Likert-type agreement scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree), with higher scores indicating more positive attitudes toward police. Participants will be asked to rate their agreement with statements such as, \u201cPolice officers usually make fair decisions when enforcing laws,\u201d and \u201cPolice officers are held to higher standards than regular citizens.\u201d\nThe Allophilia scale (Alfieri &amp; Marta, 2011; Pittinsky, Rosenthal, &amp; Montoya, 2011) will measure feelings toward police and will be adapted from intergroup bias literature that have been found to be predictive of prejudice and discrimination. Emotions toward the police officers and civilians will be measured with the general dimension scales of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS-X) (Watson &amp; Clark, 1999). The two general dimensions scales measure negative affect (e.g., afraid, scared, hostile) and positive affect (e.g., active, alert, excited, proud) with 10 emotions per subscale. Participants will rate the extent to which they felt each emotion when they considered being involved in an involuntary traffic stop (e.g., being stopped by a police officer for speeding, stopping a civilian for speeding) on a 5-point rating-scales (1 = very slightly or not at all; 5 = extremely).\nSocial dominance orientation (SDO) scale (SDO7) (Ho et al., 2015; Pratto et al., 1994) measures support for inequality between social groups, but not ingroup dominance over outgroups. Participants indicate the extent to which they support 16 items on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly oppose, 7 = strongly favor). SDO7 conceptualizes SDO as comprised of two subdimensions, with half the items on each subscale framed in the positive (pro-traits) and half in the negative (con-traits): the dominance (SDO-D) subdimension and the egalitarianism (SDO-E) subdimension. Con-traits are reversed coded to calculate mean subscale scores for each dimension, with higher scores meaning the participants are more in favor of group dominance. \nSDO-D represents a preference for group-based hierarchies that are created and maintained through active suppression of the subordinate group. SDO-D predicts overt and active efforts by the superordinate group to obtain and maintain dominance, including old-fashioned racism, support for immigrant persecution, support of the death penalty, and support for militarism (Ho et al., 2015). SDO7 includes eight SDO-D items, such as: \u201cSome groups of people must be kept in their place\u201d (pro-trait) and \u201cGroups at the bottom are just as deserving as groups at the top\u201d (con-trait). SDO-E represents opposition to equality between groups through a network of hierarchy-enhancing policies and beliefs. SDO-E predicts system justification, opposition to affirmative action (based on both race and gender), and support for unequal distribution of resources based on group membership (Ho et al., 2015). SDO7 includes eight SDO-E items, such as: \u201cWe should not push for group equality,\u201d (pro-trait) and \u201cWe should work to give all groups an equal chance to succeed\u201d (con-trait). See Appendix F for the SDO7 scale.  \nSocial attitudes consistent with support for and willingness to comply with authority figures will be measured with the Attitudes Toward Authority Scale (ATA) (Varley, Votruba, &amp; Shiota, in progress). The ATA is comprised of 16 items across four subscales measuring attitudes toward supporting and complying with authority figures: submission to formal authority, challenging authority, inherent superiority, and support for traditional norms. Participants will be asked to rate their agreement with each item on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). The submission to formal authority subscale is 4 items that measure support for ingroup order, stability, and security, such as \u201cIt is important to follow the rules, even when you don\u2019t want to.\u201d The submission to formal authority subscale predicts an emphasis on patriotism and national security, including government surveillance. The challenging authority subscale is 4 items that measure support for individual rights as well as the good of the group, such as: \u201cWhen making decisions, personal judgment is more important than obedience to traditions and rules.\u201d The challenging authority subscale is not related to political orientation but predicted moral foundations of fairness and egalitarianism. The inherent superiority subscale is comprised of the four items that measure support for social dominance of one\u2019s own group, such as: \u201cSome groups inherently have authority over others.\u201d The inherent superiority subscale predicts higher scores on SDO, values of power, and lower emphasis on the moral foundations of fairness. Finally, the support for the traditional norms subscale is comprised of 4 items that measure attitudes that support conformity and obedience of authority, such as: \u201cPeople should be required to adhere to society\u2019s norms.\u201d The support for traditional norms subscale predicts an emphasis on religiosity, moral purity and socially conservative political attitudes.\nPolice identity and experience. Items will be included to examine and control for the influence of personal and vicarious experience with police officers. Participants will be asked yes (coded 1) or no (coded 0) questions about their connections with police officers and other law enforcement: \u201cAre you currently a law enforcement officer?\u201d \u201cDo you have any family members or friends that are police officers or any type of law enforcement?\u201d \u201cHave you been arrested?\u201d \u201cHave you witnessed any family members or friends be arrested?\u201d \u201cHave you or your property ever been searched by the police?\u201d and \u201cHave you ever witnessed any family members or friends be searched or had their property searched by the police?\u201d If the participant indicates that they are law enforcement officers, they will also be asked to indicate what type of law enforcement officer they are. Response options will include local police officer, state police officer, federal police officer/FBI agent, sheriff, corrections officer, and other with an open response option. \n\tParticipants will be asked to indicate how closely they identify with their family, neighborhood, community, state, nation, and the police officer on a series of items using five circles that overlap to varying degrees to measure identity fusion (Swann et al., 2009).\nProcedural justice scale. Perceptions of procedural justice will be measured with an altered version of the Family Justice Inventory (Fondacaro et al., 2002), modified to be appropriate to police-civilian interactions. Participants will be asked to rate their agreement with 36 items on a 5-point scale, 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The Process Control, Voice, Neutrality, Dignity/Respect, Trust, and Global Fairness subscales will be included. A mean scale score will be calculated for each subscale. The Global Fairness subscale will serve as the dependent variable. \nParticipants will indicate how they think of themselves in relation to the characters depicted in the vignette on a series of items using five circles that overlap to varying degrees to measure identity fusion (Swann et al., 2009)."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q16": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q17": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Research hypotheses will be tested with ANCOVA, conducted in SPSS 26, and moderated-mediation analyses conducted with robust maximum likelihood estimation in MPlus 8.4 (Muthen &amp; Muthen, 2010). \nData analyses will be conducted in three phases. First, participants will be matched based on demographic characteristics and attitudes toward the police using propensity score matching to correct for the quasi-experimental nature of the design (West et al., 2014; West, Cham, Thoemmes, Renneberg, Schultze, &amp; Weiler, 2014). Items will be aggregated and averaged where appropriate to create scale scores. Second, preliminary analyses will be conducted and descriptive statistics will be obtained to determine whether the data meet the basic assumptions of SEM. We expect to find a significant 2 x 2 interaction between vignette condition and sample for most of the subscales (voice, neutrality, trust, respect, global fairness) of the adapted Family Justice Scale such that the mean difference between the procedural justice and no procedural justice conditions will be greater for police officer participants than civilian participants, consistent with our previous findings for voice behavior (Hazen &amp; Brank, 2020).

Additionally, the moderating effect of self-reported group identity and intergroup emotions will be examined. The bootstrap approach maximizes statistical power through resampling while minimizing the risk of Type 1 errors and creates confidence intervals (CI\u2019s) through empirical approximation of sampling distributions of indirect effects. Nonparametric resampling methods (bias-correct bootstrap) with 5000 samples drawn to derive the 95% CI\u2019s will be used for the modeled indirect effect of the procedural justice and outcome conditions on global fairness. \nNext, moderated-mediation analyses will test the relations among the components of procedural justice to understand whether police and civilians evaluate global fairness through the same mechanisms. Multiple group analysis will be conducted to examine whether the indirect effects and conditional indirect effects vary across police officers and civilians. The models will be over-identified; therefore, chi-square difference statistics will be relied on to determine if the models allowed to vary by group are significantly different from the model in which the paths were not allowed to vary across groups (Burnham &amp; Anderson, 2004). Finally, the presence and magnitude of the indirect effects and conditional indirect effects will be compared across the groups.

Participants will be asked to rate their agreement with statements such as, \u201cPolice officers usually make fair decisions when enforcing laws,\u201d and \u201cPolice officers are held to higher standards than regular citizens.\u201d\nThe Allophilia scale (Alfieri &amp; Marta, 2011; Pittinsky, Rosenthal, &amp; Montoya, 2011) will measure feelings toward police and will be adapted from intergroup bias literature that have been found to be predictive of prejudice and discrimination. Emotions toward the police officers and civilians will be measured with the general dimension scales of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS-X) (Watson &amp; Clark, 1999). The two general dimensions scales measure negative affect (e.g., afraid, scared, hostile) and positive affect (e.g., active, alert, excited, proud) with 10 emotions per subscale. Participants will rate the extent to which they felt each emotion when they considered being involved in an involuntary traffic stop (e.g., being stopped by a police officer for speeding, stopping a civilian for speeding) on a 5-point rating-scales (1 = very slightly or not at all; 5 = extremely).\nSocial dominance orientation (SDO) scale (SDO7) (Ho et al., 2015; Pratto et al., 1994) measures support for inequality between social groups, but not ingroup dominance over outgroups. Participants indicate the extent to which they support 16 items on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly oppose, 7 = strongly favor). SDO7 conceptualizes SDO as comprised of two subdimensions, with half the items on each subscale framed in the positive (pro-traits) and half in the negative (con-traits): the dominance (SDO-D) subdimension and the egalitarianism (SDO-E) subdimension. Con-traits are reversed coded to calculate mean subscale scores for each dimension, with higher scores meaning the participants are more in favor of group dominance. \nSDO-D represents a preference for group-based hierarchies that are created and maintained through active suppression of the subordinate group. SDO-D predicts overt and active efforts by the superordinate group to obtain and maintain dominance, including old-fashioned racism, support for immigrant persecution, support of the death penalty, and support for militarism (Ho et al., 2015). SDO7 includes eight SDO-D items, such as: \u201cSome groups of people must be kept in their place\u201d (pro-trait) and \u201cGroups at the bottom are just as deserving as groups at the top\u201d (con-trait). SDO-E represents opposition to equality between groups through a network of hierarchy-enhancing policies and beliefs. SDO-E predicts system justification, opposition to affirmative action (based on both race and gender), and support for unequal distribution of resources based on group membership (Ho et al., 2015). SDO7 includes eight SDO-E items, such as: \u201cWe should not push for group equality,\u201d (pro-trait) and \u201cWe should work to give all groups an equal chance to succeed\u201d (con-trait). See Appendix F for the SDO7 scale.  \nSocial attitudes consistent with support for and willingness to comply with authority figures will be measured with the Attitudes Toward Authority Scale (ATA) (Varley, Votruba, &amp; Shiota, in progress). The ATA is comprised of 16 items across four subscales measuring attitudes toward supporting and complying with authority figures: submission to formal authority, challenging authority, inherent superiority, and support for traditional norms. Participants will be asked to rate their agreement with each item on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). The submission to formal authority subscale is 4 items that measure support for ingroup order, stability, and security, such as \u201cIt is important to follow the rules, even when you don\u2019t want to.\u201d The submission to formal authority subscale predicts an emphasis on patriotism and national security, including government surveillance. The challenging authority subscale is 4 items that measure support for individual rights as well as the good of the group, such as: \u201cWhen making decisions, personal judgment is more important than obedience to traditions and rules.\u201d The challenging authority subscale is not related to political orientation but predicted moral foundations of fairness and egalitarianism. The inherent superiority subscale is comprised of the four items that measure support for social dominance of one\u2019s own group, such as: \u201cSome groups inherently have authority over others.\u201d The inherent superiority subscale predicts higher scores on SDO, values of power, and lower emphasis on the moral foundations of fairness. Finally, the support for the traditional norms subscale is comprised of 4 items that measure attitudes that support conformity and obedience of authority, such as: \u201cPeople should be required to adhere to society\u2019s norms.\u201d The support for traditional norms subscale predicts an emphasis on religiosity, moral purity and socially conservative political attitudes.\nPolice identity and experience. Items will be included to examine and control for the influence of personal and vicarious experience with police officers. Participants will be asked yes (coded 1) or no (coded 0) questions about their connections with police officers and other law enforcement: \u201cAre you currently a law enforcement officer?\u201d \u201cDo you have any family members or friends that are police officers or any type of law enforcement?\u201d \u201cHave you been arrested?\u201d \u201cHave you witnessed any family members or friends be arrested?\u201d \u201cHave you or your property ever been searched by the police?\u201d and \u201cHave you ever witnessed any family members or friends be searched or had their property searched by the police?\u201d If the participant indicates that they are law enforcement officers, they will also be asked to indicate what type of law enforcement officer they are. Response options will include local police officer, state police officer, federal police officer/FBI agent, sheriff, corrections officer, and other with an open response option. \n\tParticipants will be asked to indicate how closely they identify with their family, neighborhood, community, state, nation, and the police officer on a series of items using five circles that overlap to varying degrees to measure identity fusion (Swann et al., 2009).\nProcedural justice scale. Perceptions of procedural justice will be measured with an altered version of the Family Justice Inventory (Fondacaro et al., 2002), modified to be appropriate to police-civilian interactions. Participants will be asked to rate their agreement with 36 items on a 5-point scale, 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The Process Control, Voice, Neutrality, Dignity/Respect, Trust, and Global Fairness subscales will be included. A mean scale score will be calculated for each subscale. The Global Fairness subscale will serve as the dependent variable. \nParticipants will indicate how they think of themselves in relation to the characters depicted in the vignette on a series of items using five circles that overlap to varying degrees to measure identity fusion (Swann et al., 2009).", "q15.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Research hypotheses will be tested with ANCOVA, conducted in SPSS 26, and moderated-mediation analyses conducted with robust maximum likelihood estimation in MPlus 8.4 (Muthen &amp; Muthen, 2010). \nData analyses will be conducted in three phases. First, participants will be matched based on demographic characteristics and attitudes toward the police using propensity score matching to correct for the quasi-experimental nature of the design (West et al., 2014; West, Cham, Thoemmes, Renneberg, Schultze, &amp; Weiler, 2014). Items will be aggregated and averaged where appropriate to create scale scores. Second, preliminary analyses will be conducted and descriptive statistics will be obtained to determine whether the data meet the basic assumptions of SEM. We expect to find a significant 2 x 2 interaction between vignette condition and sample for most of the subscales (voice, neutrality, trust, respect, global fairness) of the adapted Family Justice Scale such that the mean difference between the procedural justice and no procedural justice conditions will be greater for police officer participants than civilian participants, consistent with our previous findings for voice behavior (Hazen &amp; Brank, 2020). When evaluating a police-civilian interaction as an observer, police officers will be more sensitive to the differences in the conditions because of their training and experience with police-civilian interactions (Hazen &amp; Brank, 2020; Johnson et al., 2018) and because they identify with the police officer in the interaction (Oliviera &amp; Murphy, 2016). Further, experience and feelings toward civilians will be added as covariates in an ANCOVA.\nFinally, the mediation analyses will be used with bootstrapping (Shrout &amp; Bolger, 2002) to test the modeled indirect effects of voice condition on evaluations of fairness through perceptions of voice, neutrality, trust, and respect. Additionally, the moderating effect of self-reported group identity and intergroup emotions will be examined. The bootstrap approach maximizes statistical power through resampling while minimizing the risk of Type 1 errors and creates confidence intervals (CI\u2019s) through empirical approximation of sampling distributions of indirect effects. Nonparametric resampling methods (bias-correct bootstrap) with 5000 samples drawn to derive the 95% CI\u2019s will be used for the modeled indirect effect of the procedural justice and outcome conditions on global fairness. \nNext, moderated-mediation analyses will test the relations among the components of procedural justice to understand whether police and civilians evaluate global fairness through the same mechanisms. Multiple group analysis will be conducted to examine whether the indirect effects and conditional indirect effects vary across police officers and civilians. The models will be over-identified; therefore, chi-square difference statistics will be relied on to determine if the models allowed to vary by group are significantly different from the model in which the paths were not allowed to vary across groups (Burnham &amp; Anderson, 2004). Finally, the presence and magnitude of the indirect effects and conditional indirect effects will be compared across the groups. We hypothesize that the relation between procedural justice condition and evaluations of global fairness would be mediated in a serial, parallel mediation through evaluations of voice, neutrality, trust, and respect. Further, we expect to find that the relation between the procedural justice condition and each modified Family Justice Scale subscale will be moderated by the sample, consistent with previous findings for voice behavior (Hazen &amp; Brank, 2020). The effects will be stronger for police officers than for civilians, replicating the interaction effects described above. This moderation would reveal that police officers interpret the components of procedural justice in police-civilian interactions differently than civilians and provide insight into which components should be examined further to better understand gaps between police officer and civilian interpretations of police-civilian interactions. Additionally, we hypothesize that the extent of identity fusion with the police will moderate the effect of the sample on the effect of the procedural justice condition. We expect that the effect of the sample will be stronger for those who identify more closely with the police than with their neighborhood or family (Oliviera &amp; Murphy, 2016). \n", "q17.uploader":

"description": "Introduction\nThe field of psychological science regularly makes generalised claims about the prevalence of self-reported behavioural and psychiatric traits (and their relationships with biological and environmental factors), yet recruitment for studies investigating these claims is often limited to Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD, e.g. American, European) populations.1,2 It is increasingly evident that psychological findings based on Western populations may not generalise to other cultures. Indeed, prior work3 has demonstrated that individuals from Asian or Black backgrounds, relative to those from White backgrounds, tend to score higher on self-reported measures of psychological traits, including those assessing symptoms of OCD and anxiety.\n\nCultural issues with online psychology research\nThere has been rapid expansion in recent years of large-scale data collection via the use of online recruitment platforms such as Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk (MTurk). These platforms provide a quick and efficient method for amassing a large participant pool for psychological research. However, this research often relies on the assumption that online participants are drawn from the same distribution of cultural backgrounds. To the contrary, recent work has shown that of active MTurk \u2018workers\u2019 at a given time, there are likely equal numbers based in the US and India. While workers based in India are typically as educated as those in the US, the different locations have esoteric features45 To get around these documented issues, many researchers restrict recruitment to local samples, which ultimately reinforces WEIRD norms.\n\nCultural issues with online psychiatry research\nThere has been less psychiatry-specific online research, but it is now growing in popularity. While prior studies have suggested that the proportion of individuals who score above clinically significant cut-off scores for e.g. obsessive-compulsive symptoms appears similar across MTurk and other community samples,6 our recent work7 found that nearly 50% of an MTurk sample scored above clinical cut-off for OCD. Exploratory analyses suggested that this effect was driven by a striking distinct distribution of scores between East Coast US workers and Indian/Sri Lankan/Pakistani workers (with bimodality seen in the West Coast US which has the highest proportion of Asian migrants in America8). Indeed, while online samples are thought to be more representative of the general population compared to college student samples (another common recruitment pool for psychological studies)9, collectively this evidence suggests that many online psychological studies using self-report measures may promote a biased or confounded interpretation of results. It is therefore important to gain a clearer understanding of the cultural differences which may underpin differences in response style among online participants in psychological research. In this study, we therefore test a simple prediction from our prior exploratory analyses: that there is a striking difference in OCD symptom scales across specific Western and Asian samples.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-20T14:32:39.193170", "date_modified": "2020-04-20T11:14:07.319052", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [""], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "d8bf7fbe97e51430b75615477122119fe3ef7b2159738e37c61fe9e5b2a93c9d3fdd76e75d9ccc4f19b24eb45ae8f8aaf725c34b59f006084a860685b3c3da5ebdfe741a67e88da6bfa748124b35308685a72cf59e5b43caf7fa0cf38a2b683b65f31325f80d3414e14a55249bb00d03c344c4a2ed7b04214ab54c3c271812b7e19d369a58adefaf6fceff8f060a687a", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-20T14:32:39.170235", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Christina Carlisi, Oliver J Robinson"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Study Objectives and Hypotheses\nObjective: to elucidate cross-cultural differences in commonly used self-report trait and diagnostic measures.
