our previous work (Busch-Moreno, Tuomainen, and Vinson, 2020). We based our hypotheses in the combined predictions of multistage models of emotional language (Kotz and Paulmann, 2011) and Anxiety (Bar-Haim et al., 2007), which predict different responses to threatening language stimuli at different time-windows during the processing of the speech signal. In our previous electroencephalography (EEG) research, we predicted that higher anxiety levels not only delay responses, but also elicit a larger positive component (event-related potential: ERP) at late processing stages; interpreted as an late positive complex (LPC). However, we observed either null, spurious or very weak evidence for effects arising at earlier time windows. \nWith this in mind, we designed the present EEG experiment as a passive listening task, using very controlled threatening phrases. This might allow us to capture early stage effects. In short, participants have to listen to phrases formulated in the second person (e.g.: \u2018you\u2019re stupid\u2019, \u2018you\u2019re calm\u2019) that contained threatening semantics only, threatening prosody only, both types of threat (congruent), or no threat at all (neutral). Participants\u2019 anxiety levels will be measured using a behavioural inhibition system (BIS) scale (Corr and Cooper, 2016), where higher scores are associated with trait anxiety (overactive BIS) and related cognitive processes such as worry and rumination. Given our extended version of the multistage models, anxiety should interact in different ways with different language properties depending on processing stage. \n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Therefore, we hypothesize that: 1) Only language type (category) should induce effects at pre-attentive early stages (20-180ms), given the slow-down of semantic threat recognition induced by the need to locate a lexical item as opposed to the saliency of prosody. 2) Anxiety mechanisms of over-attention to threat should induce effects at early-mid (mid1: 180-320ms) stages, given faster threat detection; prosody should prime at this stage. 3) Over-attention should also induce greater effects at mid-late (mid2: 320-520ms) stages for semantic stimuli, as these stages involve identification and integration of lexical content and faster recognition should involve faster and stronger emotional integration/categorization. 4) Anxiety mechanism of over-engagement with threat should induce a late stage (520-780ms) LPC for any type of threat, as worry or rumination should be elicited by threat irrespective of information type (i.e. semantic or prosody). In this way, congruent and neutral stimuli should provide a double-edge baseline, where predicted effects should be noticeable by comparing semantic-only and prosody-only stimuli. Specific predictions can be seen in Table 1 below.\n\n\nTable 1.

For consistency, participants will be kept in an age and gender range similar to our previous experiment (Busch-Moreno, Tuomainen, Vinson, 2020). Based on the high precision (credible interval width) obtained in this previous experiment we estimated that between 30 and 34 participants will be required for obtaining equivalent or higher precision (see Analysis below). \nMaterials\n\tStimuli consist of 200 phrases, all spoken in second person and ending in a noun or adjective Phrases were divided into four categories. 1) Neutral: neutral prosody and neutral semantics. 2) Prosody: threatening prosody and neutral semantics. 3) Semantic: Neutral prosody and neutral semantics. 4) Congruent: threatening prosody and threatening semantics. Phrase\u2019s words were selected by frequency and valence/arousal. Frequency, as Zipf log scores, were extracted from SUBTLEX-UK (van Heuven et al., 2014), words &lt; 2.9 and words &gt;= 5 points were removed. Scores from ANEW (Warriner et al., 2013) norms were used to select threatening/neutral sentences, where words above 4 arousal points and below 5 valence points were considered threatening, and words below 5 arousal and above 4 valence points were considered neutral. Each phrase was recorded 4 times from a male English speaker (not professional) in an acoustically isolated chamber with a RODE NT1-A1 microphone. The speaker was instructed to speak in what he considered his own threatening or neutral voice for recording Prosody/Congruent and Semantic/Neutral sentences respectively. See Figure 1 for examples of recorded phrases. \n\nSentences used in our previous experiment (Busch-Moreno, Tuomainen and Vinson, 2020) were rated in terms of arousal and valence (using ANEW\u2019s manikin) and threat (8 points Likert scale). Prosodic and complexity measures were extracted from these sentences using Parselmouth (Jadoul et al., 2018) and EntroPy (Vallat, 2019). These included: median pitch, Hammarberg index, harmonicty, shimmer, jitter, center of spectral gravity, cepstral peak prominence, energy in air, power in air, spectral entropy and detrended fluctuation. Bayesian robust and LASSO models (see Annex), indicate that Median Pitch (increase) and Hammarberg index (decrease) are sufficient to predict increases in arousal and threat. The newly recorded 200 (50 per category) phrases will be selected based on predictions (posterior predictive checks) of ratings (valence, arousal and threat) made through the aforementioned models. The phrases showing the most consistent predicted scores will be selected. These will be rated in the same manner as previously used stimuli, we expect high similarity between predicted and actual ratings. This procedure is not only intended to standardize threat in terms of prosody (acoustic features) and comprehension (ratings), but also provides an experimentally and statistically strong item selection procedure.\nTrait anxiety will be measured by a BIS scale from the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory Personality Questionnaire (RST-PQ) (Corr and Cooper, 2016), which is a measure indicative of an overactive BIS with high construct validity and can be linked to worry and rumination (see: Busch-Moreno et al., 2020). \n\n\nProcedure\n\tParticipants will complete a passive listening task (using random catch trials representing 10% of total trials).

The first include subjects (30) and sentences (200) and the latter includes all 64 electrodes (i.e. 64 slopes). This responds to the rationale that participants and stimuli can induce random variation that mainly deviates estimations from central tendency (i.e. their varying intercepts are included to induce shrinkage); while electrodes are of theoretical interest and they can work as informative slopes thus resulting in 64 interdependent posterior distributions. Therefore, this will help in retrieving information equivalent to electrodes interacting with other variables but with each electrode representing a unique response, and at the same time retaining the pooled estimation of the main repressors and/or interactions (Gelman, 2006; McElreath, 2015). \n\nTherefore, this implies 384000 data-points, corresponding to 30 subjects, listening to 200 sentences (trials) and mean amplitude per-trial recorded from 64 electrodes."}, "q14": {"extra": [], "value": "\nFrom data (mean amplitude) simulated to fit the model in Figure 2, 30 participants would provide the following precision: BIS main effect: 0.037 (ROPE length: 0.04).

We based our hypotheses in the combined predictions of multistage models of emotional language (Kotz and Paulmann, 2011) and Anxiety (Bar-Haim et al., 2007), which predict different responses to threatening language stimuli at different time-windows during the processing of the speech signal. In our previous electroencephalography (EEG) research, we predicted that higher anxiety levels not only delay responses, but also elicit a larger positive component (event-related potential: ERP) at late processing stages; interpreted as an late positive complex (LPC). However, we observed either null, spurious or very weak evidence for effects arising at earlier time windows. \nWith this in mind, we designed the present EEG experiment as a passive listening task, using very controlled threatening phrases. This might allow us to capture early stage effects. In short, participants have to listen to phrases formulated in the second person (e.g.: \u2018you\u2019re stupid\u2019, \u2018you\u2019re calm\u2019) that contained threatening semantics only, threatening prosody only, both types of threat (congruent), or no threat at all (neutral). Participants\u2019 anxiety levels will be measured using a behavioural inhibition system (BIS) scale (Corr and Cooper, 2016), where higher scores are associated with trait anxiety (overactive BIS) and related cognitive processes such as worry and rumination. Given our extended version of the multistage models, anxiety should interact in different ways with different language properties depending on processing stage. \n", "q4": "Therefore, we hypothesize that: 1) Only language type (category) should induce effects at pre-attentive early stages (20-180ms), given the slow-down of semantic threat recognition induced by the need to locate a lexical item as opposed to the saliency of prosody. 2) Anxiety mechanisms of over-attention to threat should induce effects at early-mid (mid1: 180-320ms) stages, given faster threat detection; prosody should prime at this stage. 3) Over-attention should also induce greater effects at mid-late (mid2: 320-520ms) stages for semantic stimuli, as these stages involve identification and integration of lexical content and faster recognition should involve faster and stronger emotional integration/categorization. 4) Anxiety mechanism of over-engagement with threat should induce a late stage (520-780ms) LPC for any type of threat, as worry or rumination should be elicited by threat irrespective of information type (i.e. semantic or prosody). In this way, congruent and neutral stimuli should provide a double-edge baseline, where predicted effects should be noticeable by comparing semantic-only and prosody-only stimuli. Specific predictions can be seen in Table 1 below.\n\n\nTable 1. Predictions in terms of main effects and interactions\nTime window\tMain Effects\tInteractions\tERP\nEarly (20-180ms)\tLanguage type (Category)\t---\tP1/N1\nMid1 (180-320ms)\tAnxiety (BIS)\tCategory x BIS\tP2/N2\nMid2 (320-520ms)\tAnxiety (BIS)\tCategory x BIS\tP300/N400\nLate (520-780ms)\tAnxiety (BIS)\t---\tLPC\n\n\n\tPredictions for the first three stages are mainly derived from multistage models of emotional language (Kotz and Paulmann, 2011), previous research indicating possible relationships between specific ERPs and trait anxiety (e.g. Pell et al., 2015), and on our own prognosis given multistage models of anxiety (e.g. Bar-Haim et al., 2007; Corr and McNaughton, 2012).

For consistency, participants will be kept in an age and gender range similar to our previous experiment (Busch-Moreno, Tuomainen, Vinson, 2020). Based on the high precision (credible interval width) obtained in this previous experiment we estimated that between 30 and 34 participants will be required for obtaining equivalent or higher precision (see Analysis below). \nMaterials\n\tStimuli consist of 200 phrases, all spoken in second person and ending in a noun or adjective Phrases were divided into four categories. 1) Neutral: neutral prosody and neutral semantics. 2) Prosody: threatening prosody and neutral semantics. 3) Semantic: Neutral prosody and neutral semantics. 4) Congruent: threatening prosody and threatening semantics. Phrase\u2019s words were selected by frequency and valence/arousal. Frequency, as Zipf log scores, were extracted from SUBTLEX-UK (van Heuven et al., 2014), words &lt; 2.9 and words &gt;= 5 points were removed. Scores from ANEW (Warriner et al., 2013) norms were used to select threatening/neutral sentences, where words above 4 arousal points and below 5 valence points were considered threatening, and words below 5 arousal and above 4 valence points were considered neutral. Each phrase was recorded 4 times from a male English speaker (not professional) in an acoustically isolated chamber with a RODE NT1-A1 microphone. The speaker was instructed to speak in what he considered his own threatening or neutral voice for recording Prosody/Congruent and Semantic/Neutral sentences respectively. See Figure 1 for examples of recorded phrases. \n\nSentences used in our previous experiment (Busch-Moreno, Tuomainen and Vinson, 2020) were rated in terms of arousal and valence (using ANEW\u2019s manikin) and threat (8 points Likert scale). Prosodic and complexity measures were extracted from these sentences using Parselmouth (Jadoul et al., 2018) and EntroPy (Vallat, 2019). These included: median pitch, Hammarberg index, harmonicty, shimmer, jitter, center of spectral gravity, cepstral peak prominence, energy in air, power in air, spectral entropy and detrended fluctuation. Bayesian robust and LASSO models (see Annex), indicate that Median Pitch (increase) and Hammarberg index (decrease) are sufficient to predict increases in arousal and threat. The newly recorded 200 (50 per category) phrases will be selected based on predictions (posterior predictive checks) of ratings (valence, arousal and threat) made through the aforementioned models. The phrases showing the most consistent predicted scores will be selected. These will be rated in the same manner as previously used stimuli, we expect high similarity between predicted and actual ratings. This procedure is not only intended to standardize threat in terms of prosody (acoustic features) and comprehension (ratings), but also provides an experimentally and statistically strong item selection procedure.\nTrait anxiety will be measured by a BIS scale from the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory Personality Questionnaire (RST-PQ) (Corr and Cooper, 2016), which is a measure indicative of an overactive BIS with high construct validity and can be linked to worry and rumination (see: Busch-Moreno et al., 2020). \n\n\nProcedure\n\tParticipants will complete a passive listening task (using random catch trials representing 10% of total trials).

Model comparison would be implemented to ascertain whether any of these implemented procedures results in an improved model.  \nFinally, to determine whether effects are truly present after sampling (2 chains, 1000 samples and 1000 tuning steps each using MCMC NUTS: see Salvatier et al., 2016), posterior distributions will be assessed using a region of practical equivalence (ROPE) (Kruschke, 2015), established as 2SDs (relaxed to 1SD if certainty is not good).

Some models focus on the role of political ideology and motivated reasoning, arguing that greater cognitive sophistication enables individuals to interpret evidence in an identity-consistent manner. Other models focus on the roles of basic science knowledge and cognitive sophistication, arguing that more general science knowledge and greater cognitive sophistication facilitate pro-science beliefs. To test these competing accounts, we identified a large range of controversial issues that are ostensibly subject to ideological disagreement and examined the relative roles of political ideology, science knowledge, and cognitive sophistication. Our results, which are consistent across two different nationally representative samples of Americans (N = 1,709), indicate that a combination of basic science knowledge and cognitive sophistication contribute more to science beliefs about various topics than political ideology. Furthermore, we found limited evidence for identity-protective cognition (i.e., motivated reasoning). By investigating a broad array of science-related beliefs, our results adjudicate between four accounts of science attitudes and suggest that educators and policymakers should focus on increasing basic science literacy and critical thinking instead of focusing on the ideological factors that divide people.

The within-subject factors will be test moment (pre- and post-manipulation) and previous trial (correct and error). The between-subject factor will be group (anti-free-will, control).\n\nParticipants will complete a Simon task in which they have to react to the color of a circle (yellow or blue) using left and right response keys. Note, that the colors in the original study were green and red, but in order to avoid problems for color blind participants, we decided to use yellow and blue. The circle can either appear on the left or the right side of the screen, but the stimulus location is irrelevant for the response. Therefore, there will be trials in which the response key and the location of the stimulus match (congruent trials; i.e. right side on the screen\u2013right response key, or left side on the screen\u2013left response key), and trials on which the response key and location do not match (incongruent trials; i.e. right side on the screen\u2013left response key or left side of the screen\u2013right response key). The color and stimulus location will be pseudo-randomised within subjects (equal probability of all combinations; i.e. yellow left location, yellow right location, blue left location, blue right location). \n\nIn accordance with the original code provided by the first author of the original study (31/10/2019), first a fixation cross will be presented for 500 ms, after which the stimulus will be presented. The stimulus remains on the screen until the participant\u2019s response. After the response there will be no feedback and the next trial starts. We tested the Simon task procedure without feedback in a pilot study (N=40) and observed PES even without a feedback signal. These data will be made available as well.\n\nThe general procedure will start with welcoming the participant, asking for consent and demographic details such as age, gender and nationality, and explaining the general procedure. The experiment will consist of three main parts. \n\nIn the pre-manipulation test moment participants will perform the Simon task. In total, they will complete a practice block with 16 trials and four experimental blocks with 96 trials each.\n\nFor the manipulation, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Both groups will read passages from The Astonishing Hypothesis, by Francis Crick (1994). The anti-free-will group will read a text claiming that scientists now recognize that free will is an illusion, while control group read a passage that does not mention free will. In addition, we will tell participants that they have to be able to answer two questions about the text at the end of the experiment. This is to make sure that participants read the manipulation texts carefully.\n\nAfter this, in the post-manipulation test moment, participants again perform four blocks of the Simon task with 96 trials each. When all blocks are completed, participants fill in the Free Will Inventory (FWI) and an impulsivity questionnaire (UPPS-P short). The FWI (see Supplementary Materials) consists of 15 Likert-type items (scores from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree)) with three subscales (Free Will, Determinism and Dualism/Anti-Reductionism). Note that in the original study the Free will and Determinism plus (FAD plus) was used. However, follow-up studies (including an online study) used the FWI for manipulation check, as the FWI might be more sensitive than the FAD (Genschow, Rigoni, &amp; Brass, 2017).  The impulsivity questionnaire is an addition as this project will be part of a larger individual-differences project across studies. We will not use the UPPS-P data for this study. Please note that we decided to drop the PANAS (a questionnaire used to measure positive and negative affect) as an additional measurement as it was shown in the original study that reading the manipulation text did not influence the PANAS scores. Note, that we also decided to drop the pre FWI measurement. We will only have one test session and therefore only 30 minutes between the testmoments. We assume that the pre FWI testmoment would bias the outcome of the post FWI measurement.\n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": "We will use a simple randomization.

Note, that the colors in the original study were green and red, but in order to avoid problems for color blind participants, we decided to use yellow and blue. The circle can either appear on the left or the right side of the screen, but the stimulus location is irrelevant for the response. Therefore, there will be trials in which the response key and the location of the stimulus match (congruent trials; i.e. right side on the screen\u2013right response key, or left side on the screen\u2013left response key), and trials on which the response key and location do not match (incongruent trials; i.e. right side on the screen\u2013left response key or left side of the screen\u2013right response key).

In total, they will complete a practice block with 16 trials and four experimental blocks with 96 trials each.\n\nFor the manipulation, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Both groups will read passages from The Astonishing Hypothesis, by Francis Crick (1994). The anti-free-will group will read a text claiming that scientists now recognize that free will is an illusion, while control group read a passage that does not mention free will. In addition, we will tell participants that they have to be able to answer two questions about the text at the end of the experiment. This is to make sure that participants read the manipulation texts carefully.\n\nAfter this, in the post-manipulation test moment, participants again perform four blocks of the Simon task with 96 trials each. When all blocks are completed, participants fill in the Free Will Inventory (FWI) and an impulsivity questionnaire (UPPS-P short). The FWI (see Supplementary Materials) consists of 15 Likert-type items (scores from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree)) with three subscales (Free Will, Determinism and Dualism/Anti-Reductionism). Note that in the original study the Free will and Determinism plus (FAD plus) was used. However, follow-up studies (including an online study) used the FWI for manipulation check, as the FWI might be more sensitive than the FAD (Genschow, Rigoni, &amp; Brass, 2017).  The impulsivity questionnaire is an addition as this project will be part of a larger individual-differences project across studies. We will not use the UPPS-P data for this study. Please note that we decided to drop the PANAS (a questionnaire used to measure positive and negative affect) as an additional measurement as it was shown in the original study that reading the manipulation text did not influence the PANAS scores.
