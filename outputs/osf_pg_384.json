However, despite heavy political rhetoric little political action has been taken to counter the trend and the general public displays little appetite for more redistribution. This is insofar puzzling as the political economy models would predict otherwise. An important step to expect political implications of inequality perceptions is that people attribute the (unsatisfactory) state of economic inequality to the political realm, i.e. rate it as product of political decision making. This aspect has been widely discussed with regard to economic and performance voting where the attribution of responsibility is treated as important precondition for electoral punishment effects (e.g. Tilley and Hobolt 2011, Malhotra and Kuo 2008, Giger 2011). While there is a large psychological literature on attribution (e.g., Gilbert and Malone 1995, Schlenker et al. 1994), few studies consider political outcomes and the attribution of responsibility to political actors. While this literature generally confirms that the attribution of responsibility is far from automatic and that individual differences exist, the question whether citizens attribute governments the full responsibility for the state of economic inequality or whether they rather see it as the consequences of a globalized economy is still unchartered territory."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: The less responsibility for economic inequality voters assign to the government, the less they are willing to support redistribution H2: The less responsibility for economic inequality voters assign to the government, the less they are willing to vote for parties supporting redistribution H3: H3: Political sophistication moderates the extent to which people assign responsibility for economic inequality to the political realm.

However, despite heavy political rhetoric little political action has been taken to counter the trend and the general public displays little appetite for more redistribution. This is insofar puzzling as the political economy models would predict otherwise. An important step to expect political implications of inequality perceptions is that people attribute the (unsatisfactory) state of economic inequality to the political realm, i.e. rate it as product of political decision making. This aspect has been widely discussed with regard to economic and performance voting where the attribution of responsibility is treated as important precondition for electoral punishment effects (e.g. Tilley and Hobolt 2011, Malhotra and Kuo 2008, Giger 2011). While there is a large psychological literature on attribution (e.g., Gilbert and Malone 1995, Schlenker et al. 1994), few studies consider political outcomes and the attribution of responsibility to political actors. While this literature generally confirms that the attribution of responsibility is far from automatic and that individual differences exist, the question whether citizens attribute governments the full responsibility for the state of economic inequality or whether they rather see it as the consequences of a globalized economy is still unchartered territory.", "q16": "H1: The less responsibility for economic inequality voters assign to the government, the less they are willing to support redistribution H2: The less responsibility for economic inequality voters assign to the government, the less they are willing to vote for parties supporting redistribution H3: H3: Political sophistication moderates the extent to which people assign responsibility for economic inequality to the political realm. H4: The context in form of the clarity of responsibility conditions the extent to which people assign responsibility for economic inequality to the political realm.", "q17": "In the project, we analyze how much responsibility for economic inequality citizens attribute to the government with a twofold research design. In a first step, we want to gain observational evidence on the question by asking specifically about the attribution of responsibility in a cross-national survey. The online survey, conducted in collaboration with Jonas Pontusson, will be conducted in 13 European countries and the US will include the following question: People often hold different actors responsible for economic inequality.

Its\u2019 benefits include prevention of pregnancy-related health risks, reduction of infant mortality, prevention of HIV/AIDS, slowing population growth and empowerment of women (World Health Organization, 2016). While in many sub-Saharan countries family planning services have been made free, the increase in the uptake of these services has been limited. The unmet need of family planning - i.e., the proportion of women who want to delay or stop childbearing but are unable to do so - remains high. Modern family planning services include information, counselling, and prescription of contraceptives. In Tanzania, the country of our study, these services are free. About 41% of women use some kind of contraceptives (of which about 80% are modern contraceptives). However, there is still an unmet need of family planning of 23% (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social affairs, Population Division, 2015). In Mwanza, the region of our study, only 18% of married women use modern contraceptives, and 34% have an unmet need of family planning. Furthermore, only 37% of the demand for family planning services are satisfied (TNBS and ICF Macro, 2016). The limited success of making family planning services more accessible to poor families is mostly assumed to be the result of 1) gender differences in preferences on the desired number of children, with women preferring fewer children than men, combined with 2) women\u2019s lower bargaining power (Hindin, 2000; Rasul, 2008; Westoff, 2010; Ashraf et al., 2014a,b). In this project, we focus on the effect of involving the husband in the family planning decision-process. In particular, we manipulate the husband\u2019s influence over a family-planning decision made in the lab."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "To answer the question about whether and to what extent the husband should be involved in the family planning decision-process, we run an experiment, using a sample of approximately 600 couples from rural villages in Mwanza, Northern Tanzania. The experiment is planned to run from October 2017 until November 2017. Previous literature has focused on the effect of involving the husband on the use of family planning. We add to this literature by providing a clean experimental test of the effect of the husband\u2019s influence on the decision on receiving family planning services"}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "In the experiment, the participants make a series of choices between an unconditional transfer and a conditional transfer. The unconditional transfer is paid out one month after the date of the experiment. The conditional transfer is also paid out one month after the date of the experiment, but only if the wife or the couple has attended a family planning meeting at the local health center (whether the wife or the couple is required to attend the family planning meeting depends on the treatment). We implement three between-couple treatments. In all treatments, the couples make a series of choices between the unconditional and the conditional transfer. In the first treatment, \u201cIndividual Wife\u201d, the wife makes all the decisions alone. In the second treatment, \u201cJoint\u201d, the couples make all the decisions together. Finally, in the third treatment, \u201cIndividual Husband\u201d, the husband makes all the decisions alone. In addition, we implement two within-couple treatments. One where the voucher received only requires that the wife attends the family planning meeting (\u201cWife voucher\u201d), and one where the voucher requires that both the husband and the wife attend the meeting (\u201cCouple voucher\u201d). The payment is always given to the wife with the Wife voucher, and given to both the husband and the wife with the Couple voucher. The experiment is designed to study the effect of involving the husband in the family planning decision-making process (i.e., the decision to seek family planning services). Individual Wife provides us with information about the wife\u2019s willingness-to-pay for a private family planning meeting alone. Similarly, Individual Husband, gives us information about how the husband takes decisions on behalf of his wife. Finally, comparing Joint with Individual Wife gives us information on how giving the husband some influence affects the outcome. Furthermore, using Individual Husband and Individual Wife, we can measure who has most say in the decision made in Joint (i.e., we compare all three treatments).

Its\u2019 benefits include prevention of pregnancy-related health risks, reduction of infant mortality, prevention of HIV/AIDS, slowing population growth and empowerment of women (World Health Organization, 2016). While in many sub-Saharan countries family planning services have been made free, the increase in the uptake of these services has been limited. The unmet need of family planning - i.e., the proportion of women who want to delay or stop childbearing but are unable to do so - remains high. Modern family planning services include information, counselling, and prescription of contraceptives. In Tanzania, the country of our study, these services are free. About 41% of women use some kind of contraceptives (of which about 80% are modern contraceptives). However, there is still an unmet need of family planning of 23% (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social affairs, Population Division, 2015). In Mwanza, the region of our study, only 18% of married women use modern contraceptives, and 34% have an unmet need of family planning. Furthermore, only 37% of the demand for family planning services are satisfied (TNBS and ICF Macro, 2016). The limited success of making family planning services more accessible to poor families is mostly assumed to be the result of 1) gender differences in preferences on the desired number of children, with women preferring fewer children than men, combined with 2) women\u2019s lower bargaining power (Hindin, 2000; Rasul, 2008; Westoff, 2010; Ashraf et al., 2014a,b). In this project, we focus on the effect of involving the husband in the family planning decision-process. In particular, we manipulate the husband\u2019s influence over a family-planning decision made in the lab.", "q16": "To answer the question about whether and to what extent the husband should be involved in the family planning decision-process, we run an experiment, using a sample of approximately 600 couples from rural villages in Mwanza, Northern Tanzania. The experiment is planned to run from October 2017 until November 2017. Previous literature has focused on the effect of involving the husband on the use of family planning. We add to this literature by providing a clean experimental test of the effect of the husband\u2019s influence on the decision on receiving family planning services", "q17": "In the experiment, the participants make a series of choices between an unconditional transfer and a conditional transfer. The unconditional transfer is paid out one month after the date of the experiment. The conditional transfer is also paid out one month after the date of the experiment, but only if the wife or the couple has attended a family planning meeting at the local health center (whether the wife or the couple is required to attend the family planning meeting depends on the treatment). We implement three between-couple treatments. In all treatments, the couples make a series of choices between the unconditional and the conditional transfer. In the first treatment, \u201cIndividual Wife\u201d, the wife makes all the decisions alone. In the second treatment, \u201cJoint\u201d, the couples make all the decisions together. Finally, in the third treatment, \u201cIndividual Husband\u201d, the husband makes all the decisions alone. In addition, we implement two within-couple treatments. One where the voucher received only requires that the wife attends the family planning meeting (\u201cWife voucher\u201d), and one where the voucher requires that both the husband and the wife attend the meeting (\u201cCouple voucher\u201d). The payment is always given to the wife with the Wife voucher, and given to both the husband and the wife with the Couple voucher. The experiment is designed to study the effect of involving the husband in the family planning decision-making process (i.e., the decision to seek family planning services). Individual Wife provides us with information about the wife\u2019s willingness-to-pay for a private family planning meeting alone. Similarly, Individual Husband, gives us information about how the husband takes decisions on behalf of his wife. Finally, comparing Joint with Individual Wife gives us information on how giving the husband some influence affects the outcome. Furthermore, using Individual Husband and Individual Wife, we can measure who has most say in the decision made in Joint (i.e., we compare all three treatments). We will do the same analysis for the Couple voucher.", "q18": "Tanzania", "q19": "600", "q20": "Yes", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "", "q25": "03.

cutbacks to the collective bargaining rights of its public workers. Two of the most important provisions include limiting the scope of bargaining of most public workers to wages and requiring public unions to win a majority of bargaining unit member votes in regular recertification elections (typically at the end of contracts). Other states, like Wisconsin, which have introduced similar reforms have seen sharp drops in public union memberships, budgets, and political engagement. Through a partnership with the Iowa State Education Association (ISEA), the state's union representing public school teachers and staff, we will examine what kind of messages best persuade union members to turn out to vote in recertification elections. Specifically, we will be investigating whether emphasizing some combination of three social encouragements -- the low cost of participating in the election, that workers can vote right away in the election and not wait any longer, and how voting is consistent with workers\u2019 past contributions and efforts supporting the union -- can raise participation rates in the union election. We will test each message on its own as well as each combination of these three messages, administered through email. While past work has examined union members' attitudes towards unions, that work has generally been in the context of private sector unions in past decades, when the labor movement was much larger and stronger. Our current study is significant in that it focuses on the public sector and does so in a context of unfavorable state public policy, an increasingly common occurrence. Our results will speak to the motivations that public sector workers have to continue supporting unions in the context of punitive labor law, as well as the broader processes of persuasion and mobilization in contemporary labor organizations."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "On October 10th, 2017, the Iowa Educational Association (ISEA) will mail its approximately 10,542 voting members messages we have designed in partnership with them about the upcoming recertification election.

We posit the following hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: Members who receive a message emphasizing the low cost of unions will be more likely to vote in a union recertification election, compared to control. Hypothesis 2: Members who receive a message emphasizing how they can vote right away will be more likely to vote in a union recertification election, compared to control.

Two of the most important provisions include limiting the scope of bargaining of most public workers to wages and requiring public unions to win a majority of bargaining unit member votes in regular recertification elections (typically at the end of contracts). Other states, like Wisconsin, which have introduced similar reforms have seen sharp drops in public union memberships, budgets, and political engagement. Through a partnership with the Iowa State Education Association (ISEA), the state's union representing public school teachers and staff, we will examine what kind of messages best persuade union members to turn out to vote in recertification elections. Specifically, we will be investigating whether emphasizing some combination of three social encouragements -- the low cost of participating in the election, that workers can vote right away in the election and not wait any longer, and how voting is consistent with workers\u2019 past contributions and efforts supporting the union -- can raise participation rates in the union election. We will test each message on its own as well as each combination of these three messages, administered through email. While past work has examined union members' attitudes towards unions, that work has generally been in the context of private sector unions in past decades, when the labor movement was much larger and stronger. Our current study is significant in that it focuses on the public sector and does so in a context of unfavorable state public policy, an increasingly common occurrence. Our results will speak to the motivations that public sector workers have to continue supporting unions in the context of punitive labor law, as well as the broader processes of persuasion and mobilization in contemporary labor organizations.", "q16": "On October 10th, 2017, the Iowa Educational Association (ISEA) will mail its approximately 10,542 voting members messages we have designed in partnership with them about the upcoming recertification election. At the end of every message will be a link to a website where members can vote for recertification electronically. We posit the following hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: Members who receive a message emphasizing the low cost of unions will be more likely to vote in a union recertification election, compared to control. Hypothesis 2: Members who receive a message emphasizing how they can vote right away will be more likely to vote in a union recertification election, compared to control. Hypothesis 3: Members who receive a message emphasizing how voting is consistent with their past contributions to the union will be more likely to vote in a union recertification election, compared to control. Hypothesis 4: Members who receive a message emphasizing the low cost of unions and how they can vote right away will be more likely to vote in a union recertification election, compared to control. Hypothesis 5: Members who receive a message emphasizing the low cost of unions and how voting is consistent with their past contributions to the union will be more likely to vote in a union recertification election, compared to control. Hypothesis 6: Members who receive a message emphasizing the low cost of unions, how they can vote right away, and how voting is consistent with their past contributions to the union will be more likely to vote in a union recertification election, compared to control. Hypothesis 7: Members who receive a message emphasizing the how they can vote right away and how voting is consistent with their past contributions to the union will be more likely to vote in a union recertification election, compared to control. To test these hypotheses, we will randomly assign subjects to see each combination of the three messages, or a control condition.
