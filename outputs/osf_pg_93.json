We will study this by comparing changes in polarization depending on assignment to conditions. Those assigned to the priming condition are expected to become more polarized on institutional trust compared to those assigned to the control condition. By polarization, we mean that individuals at the lower end of trust and individuals at the higher end of trust are expected to diverge more on institutional trust.

Individuals at the lower end of trust and individuals at the higher end of trust are expected to diverge more on social trust at T1 compared to T0.

We expect that even though there is a relatively short time period between T0 and T1, which stacks the odds against finding support for the hypothesis, institutional trust is influencing social trust. \n\nAt both T0 and T1, institutional trust is measured by asking: \u201cGenerally speaking, how much trust do you have in Swedish government authorities?\u201d There are five response options to the question, \u201cVery high trust,\u201d \u201cRather high trust,\u201d \u201cNeither high nor low trust,\u201d \u201cRather low trust,\u201d and \u201cVery low trust.\u201d \n\nAt both T0 and T1, social trust is measured by asking: \u201cIn your opinion, to what extent is it generally possible to trust people?\u201d There are five response options, \u201c1 People cannot generally be trusted,\u201d \u201c2,\u201d \u201c3,\u201d, \u201c4,\u201d and \u201c5 People can generally be trusted.\u201d\n\nWe will test the hypothesis with different statistical approaches, including dynamic panel data estimators, and compare the relative fit of the models.
