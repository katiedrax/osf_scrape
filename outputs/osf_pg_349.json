As a solution, policymakers and academics have championed information as a tool to make citizens more effective advocates for their rights. While there is some evidence that information can reduce leakage of resources (Reinnika and Svensson 2003), and increase citizens\u2019 access to their entitlements (Banerjee et al. 2016), the success of these interventions depends on the willingness of a reformist government to disseminate relevant information. In contexts where government agencies do not disseminate information, or do so partially, Freedom of Information (FOI) laws could help citizens to learn about the \u201cbenefits and services they are entitled to and whether they are receiving the right amounts\u201d (Banisar 2006, 7). Growing anecdotal evidence suggests that FOI laws have helped poor people gain access to government-subsidized food programs, and education. Yet there is little systematic evidence of the causal relation between the right to information and public service provision (Darch and Underwood 2009). A notable exception is Peisakhin and Pinto (2010)\u2019s study, which draws from a field experiment in India where a group of confederates where randomly assigned to submit an information request under the Right to Information Act shortly after filling an application for a ration card. Compared to the control group, confederates in the treatment group were more successful in getting a card, and their waiting times were substantially shorter. Although these findings are encouraging, it is unclear if they can be extended to contexts where the benefit to be accessed is not a private, but a public good. We partnered with Mexico\u2019s National Institute for Access to Information (INAI), and the local NGO Ciudadanos por la Transparencia (CxT) to evaluate the effects of two interventions. In a first treatment arm, INAI and CxT conduct training sessions to encourage the use of the access to information system among parents with school-aged children in Mexico. During the training session, trainers describe the workings of the system, explain how to submit requests of information, and illustrate how the system works using as an example a federal transfer program, Escuelas al Cien (E100), which transfers resources to public schools in impoverished areas of the country with the objective of improving schools\u2019 infrastructure. After showing parents the publicly available information about the E100 program, and how to request additional information, trainers encouraged parents to demand accountability and to monitor the completion of the E100 works in their schools. In a second treatment arm, INAI and CxT disseminate information about E100, including the total amount of resources allocated to a school, the amount of resources disbursed, the progress of projects, and avenues through which parents could request more information and demand accountability. The effects of these two treatment arms will be compared to a control group. The study takes place in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico. Our sample includes 100 preschool and primary schools, which have been allocated E100 resources, and are located in municipalities with low levels of criminal activity. Although federal resources have been allocated, there is a substantial delay in the implementation of the program. In March 2018, the program reported that in average 41% of the allocated resources had been disbursed to the schools in our sample, and 23% of the public works had been completed. From this group of 100 schools, 40 schools were randomly assigned to receive a training session, 20 schools were randomly assign to receive the information, and 40 schools were randomly assign to the control group. Out of the 40 schools receiving the training sessions, in 20 randomly selected schools the school principal was encouraged to attend the training session, and in the rest there was not such explicit encouragement. We used simple randomization to assign schools to the various experimental groups. In the schools assigned to receive a training session, CxT recruited 10 to 15 parents to participate in the session. In the schools assigned to receive the information, CxT distributed flyers to approximately 20 percent of the parents. At endline, we survey 15 parents per school in all our experimental groups. Hence, our sample will include 100 schools, and 1500 school parents."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "The objectives of the study are to assess whether the interventions motivate citizens to demand accountability from their schools, as well as to increase their access to services and programs to which they have a right. Broadly, we expect that the training and information interventions will lead parents to try to monitor the public resources allocated to schools, both in general and specifically with respect to the E100 program. To measure these outcomes, we will submit requests of information to measure if the relevant government agencies have received requests of information pertaining to the implementation of the E100 program in our experimental schools. In addition to formal information requests, we will examine \u2013 through survey questionnaires \u2013 whether parents interacted with the schools through other methods such as by reaching out to school principals or the PTA. If monitoring of public resources by parents is successful, this may lead to an improvement of the school facilities and infrastructure. To measure these outcomes, we will collect administrative data of the E100 program, including the share of allocated resources that have been disbursed, and the progress of projects, if funded. We will collect this information 2 and 1 months prior to the intervention, as well as 2 and 4 months after treatment. Finally, with the endline survey, we will explore if the interventions influenced parents\u2019 evaluations of their school\u2019s infrastructure.

Next, we will estimate treatment effects with difference-in-differences models when baseline measures of the dependent variables are available. At the individual level, for the means (proportions) tests, we will average outcomes at the school level, and conduct the tests with the grouped data. Then, using the individual level data, we will estimate effects regressing outcomes on treatment dummy variables, using school fixed effects. We will report standard errors clustered at the school level, which is the unit of randomization, for individual outcomes. Hypotheses tests will be conducted using two-sided tests, and p-values from corresponding t-tests will be reported. As mentioned, our plan is to estimate intent-to-treat estimates.

Our sample includes 100 preschool and primary schools, which have been allocated E100 resources, and are located in municipalities with low levels of criminal activity. Although federal resources have been allocated, there is a substantial delay in the implementation of the program. In March 2018, the program reported that in average 41% of the allocated resources had been disbursed to the schools in our sample, and 23% of the public works had been completed. From this group of 100 schools, 40 schools were randomly assigned to receive a training session, 20 schools were randomly assign to receive the information, and 40 schools were randomly assign to the control group. Out of the 40 schools receiving the training sessions, in 20 randomly selected schools the school principal was encouraged to attend the training session, and in the rest there was not such explicit encouragement. We used simple randomization to assign schools to the various experimental groups. In the schools assigned to receive a training session, CxT recruited 10 to 15 parents to participate in the session. In the schools assigned to receive the information, CxT distributed flyers to approximately 20 percent of the parents. At endline, we survey 15 parents per school in all our experimental groups. Hence, our sample will include 100 schools, and 1500 school parents.", "q16": "The objectives of the study are to assess whether the interventions motivate citizens to demand accountability from their schools, as well as to increase their access to services and programs to which they have a right. Broadly, we expect that the training and information interventions will lead parents to try to monitor the public resources allocated to schools, both in general and specifically with respect to the E100 program. To measure these outcomes, we will submit requests of information to measure if the relevant government agencies have received requests of information pertaining to the implementation of the E100 program in our experimental schools. In addition to formal information requests, we will examine \u2013 through survey questionnaires \u2013 whether parents interacted with the schools through other methods such as by reaching out to school principals or the PTA. If monitoring of public resources by parents is successful, this may lead to an improvement of the school facilities and infrastructure. To measure these outcomes, we will collect administrative data of the E100 program, including the share of allocated resources that have been disbursed, and the progress of projects, if funded. We will collect this information 2 and 1 months prior to the intervention, as well as 2 and 4 months after treatment. Finally, with the endline survey, we will explore if the interventions influenced parents\u2019 evaluations of their school\u2019s infrastructure. Please see the attached pre-analysis plan for more detailed information about our hypotheses, measurement strategies, power calculations, estimations, and sub-group analyses.", "q17": "To estimate intent-to-treat effects of the interventions, we will begin our analysis specifying a difference in means test, or differences in proportions, comparing: 1) schools assigned to the training sessions versus schools assigned to control; 2) schools assigned to the information-only treatment versus schools assigned to control; 3) schools assigned to the training sessions versus schools assigned to the information-only treatment; and 4) schools assigned to the training session without the school principal versus schools assigned to the training session with the school principal. Next, we will estimate treatment effects with difference-in-differences models when baseline measures of the dependent variables are available. At the individual level, for the means (proportions) tests, we will average outcomes at the school level, and conduct the tests with the grouped data. Then, using the individual level data, we will estimate effects regressing outcomes on treatment dummy variables, using school fixed effects. We will report standard errors clustered at the school level, which is the unit of randomization, for individual outcomes. Hypotheses tests will be conducted using two-sided tests, and p-values from corresponding t-tests will be reported. As mentioned, our plan is to estimate intent-to-treat estimates. However, we will also report compliance with assignment to treatment. In particular, in the training sessions we collected attendance data to record parents\u2019 participation and the presence or absence of the school principal.", "q18": "Mexico", "q19": "100 schools, and 1500 individuals within experimental schools.", "q20": "Yes", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "IRB Protocol ID: 2000021879", "q25": "10/20/17", "q26": "Other (describe in text box below)", "q27": "1.

In particular, exclusive political messages are shown to make ethnic majority populations more anti-immigrant while inclusive rhetoric appears ineffective in shaping immigration attitudes. This study ask whether inclusive/pro-immigration political rhetoric is really ineffective? I propose that previous studies may have been unable to detect any effect of pro-immigration political rhetoric because they have missed one potentially important component of this rhetoric: appeal to morality. Inclusive arguments may be ineffective if not framed in a moral light but powerful if they are. By appealing to obligation, fairness, and what is right, it is possible that pro-immigration politicians could be successful in shaping public opinion in their direction. To investigate this claim, I have developed a survey experiment manipulating exposure to moralized political messages on immigration. I compare the effect of exposure to anti- and pro-immigration arguments, varying the use of moral language."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1a: Exposure to non-moralized anti-immigration message has a stronger effect on public opinion than exposure to non-moralized pro-immigration message.

H1c: Exposure to moralized pro-immigration message and moralized anti-immigration message is equally effective in shaping respondents\u2019 opinion in the direction of the message. H2: Exposure to moralized political messages increases the level of moral conviction about attitudes to immigration. H3: Moral conviction about immigration is associated with holding more extreme immigration attitudes. H4: Exposure to moralized political messages is ideologically polarizing. Respondents who self-identify as right-wing will become more morally convicted and more anti-immigration when exposed to a moralized pro-immigration message (compared to a non-moralized pro-immigration message and no message exposure). Respondents who self-identify as left-wing will become more morally convicted and more pro-immigration when exposed to a moralized anti-immigration message (compared to a non-moralized anti-immigration message and no message exposure). H5a: Exposure to moralized political messages only affects convictions and attitudes among respondents who identify with the party sponsor. H5b: Exposure to moralized political messages affects convictions and attitudes among party-identifiers and non-identifiers in different directions: Both groups will be more morally convicted about immigration but non-identifiers will move in the opposite direction from the political message (conditional on ideology).

I propose that previous studies may have been unable to detect any effect of pro-immigration political rhetoric because they have missed one potentially important component of this rhetoric: appeal to morality. Inclusive arguments may be ineffective if not framed in a moral light but powerful if they are. By appealing to obligation, fairness, and what is right, it is possible that pro-immigration politicians could be successful in shaping public opinion in their direction.

This project adopts an experimental approach to examine the effect of foreigner presence as part of a research team on how citizens relate to the research project and how they respond to questions about themselves and their communities. Specifically, it randomly varies whether a foreigner is included in the research team that travels to study villages and conducts components of a multi-method field research project, and it randomly varies whether household survey respondents are exposed to the foreigner.

Our interest in this question is mostly applied. However, we draw on existing political economy and social psychology literature to develop hypotheses about the types of responses and respondents that will be most affected by the presence of a foreigner as part of the research team and the direction of the effects. By engaging in hypothesis testing about the types of variables likely to be affected by foreigner presence, we hope to provide a theoretical structure that can help other researchers decide whether the content and location of their studies are more or less vulnerable to misreporting based on research team composition. We will test the following hypotheses regarding the direction of effects foreigners will have on measurement levels and measurement accuracy. Measurement Levels: H1. Exposure to a foreign vs. a local researcher will cause respondents to provide responses more aligned with foreign interests and values on variables in which foreigners\u2019 positions are clear and salient. (Social desirability hypothesis) H2. Exposure to a foreign vs. a local researcher will cause respondents to provide more positive responses on variables capturing individual or community status. (Status hypothesis) H3. Exposure to a foreign vs. a local researcher will cause respondents to provide more negative responses on variables associated with neediness. (Neediness hypothesis) Measurement Accuracy: H4. Exposure to a foreign vs. a local researcher will cause less accurate reporting on variables capturing foreign alignment and neediness. (Pandering hypothesis) H5. Exposure to a foreign vs. a local researcher will cause more accurate reporting on variables that are politically sensitive. (Confidentiality hypothesis) H6. Exposure to a foreign vs. a local researcher will cause more accurate reporting on variables that require effort in the presence of foreigners. (Stakes hypothesis) H7. Exposure to a foreign researcher will cause respondents to provide less accurate responses on variables that can be verified with insider knowledge. (Detectability hypothesis). Heterogenous Effects: H8: The effects of foreigner presence will be larger in communities with more exposure to foreigners. Other Design Effects: Although our primary purpose in this project is to measure the effect of foreign researchers, our design also permits us to analyze the effects of conducting field research in advance of surveys. As a result, we will also test the following hypotheses: H9: The effects of field research in advance of surveys will cause greater social desirability effects and neediness effects insofar as it gives communities a chance to rehearse their responses. H10: The effects of field research in advance of surveys will cause less accurate responses on variables subject to pandering but more accurate responses on variables subject to confidentiality concerns, detectability and recall effort insofar as it makes the research purpose more obvious and makes the researchers appear more informed/engaged."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "This project employs an experimental methodology in order to assess the effects of including foreigners in research teams.

The effects of foreigners on individuals\u2019 responses to survey and interview questions is important to understand both for the design of field research, but also for understanding the effects of and best practices in implementing development assessments. This project adopts an experimental approach to examine the effect of foreigner presence as part of a research team on how citizens relate to the research project and how they respond to questions about themselves and their communities. Specifically, it randomly varies whether a foreigner is included in the research team that travels to study villages and conducts components of a multi-method field research project, and it randomly varies whether household survey respondents are exposed to the foreigner. By comparing survey responses and behavioral measures depending on exposure to foreigners as part of the research team, we will be able to measure the effect of foreign researchers.", "q16": "This project adopts an experimental approach to identify the effects of foreigners. Our interest in this question is mostly applied. However, we draw on existing political economy and social psychology literature to develop hypotheses about the types of responses and respondents that will be most affected by the presence of a foreigner as part of the research team and the direction of the effects. By engaging in hypothesis testing about the types of variables likely to be affected by foreigner presence, we hope to provide a theoretical structure that can help other researchers decide whether the content and location of their studies are more or less vulnerable to misreporting based on research team composition. We will test the following hypotheses regarding the direction of effects foreigners will have on measurement levels and measurement accuracy. Measurement Levels: H1. Exposure to a foreign vs. a local researcher will cause respondents to provide responses more aligned with foreign interests and values on variables in which foreigners\u2019 positions are clear and salient. (Social desirability hypothesis) H2. Exposure to a foreign vs. a local researcher will cause respondents to provide more positive responses on variables capturing individual or community status. (Status hypothesis) H3. Exposure to a foreign vs. a local researcher will cause respondents to provide more negative responses on variables associated with neediness. (Neediness hypothesis) Measurement Accuracy: H4. Exposure to a foreign vs. a local researcher will cause less accurate reporting on variables capturing foreign alignment and neediness. (Pandering hypothesis) H5. Exposure to a foreign vs. a local researcher will cause more accurate reporting on variables that are politically sensitive. (Confidentiality hypothesis) H6. Exposure to a foreign vs. a local researcher will cause more accurate reporting on variables that require effort in the presence of foreigners. (Stakes hypothesis) H7. Exposure to a foreign researcher will cause respondents to provide less accurate responses on variables that can be verified with insider knowledge. (Detectability hypothesis). Heterogenous Effects: H8: The effects of foreigner presence will be larger in communities with more exposure to foreigners. Other Design Effects: Although our primary purpose in this project is to measure the effect of foreign researchers, our design also permits us to analyze the effects of conducting field research in advance of surveys. As a result, we will also test the following hypotheses: H9: The effects of field research in advance of surveys will cause greater social desirability effects and neediness effects insofar as it gives communities a chance to rehearse their responses. H10: The effects of field research in advance of surveys will cause less accurate responses on variables subject to pandering but more accurate responses on variables subject to confidentiality concerns, detectability and recall effort insofar as it makes the research purpose more obvious and makes the researchers appear more informed/engaged.", "q17": "This project employs an experimental methodology in order to assess the effects of including foreigners in research teams. The intervention will randomly expose villages to one of three experimental arms, as illustrated in table 2. In the control group, there will be no pre-survey research conducted in the village (aside from any short logistical visits necessary to secure permissions). In the qualitative research group, there will be one day of focus groups and elite interviews conducted by an exclusively Tanzanian field team approximately one week before the household survey. In the foreigner plus qualitative research group, there will be one day of focus groups and elite interviews conducted by a field team that includes one foreigner approximately one week before the household survey. Communities will be randomized into the treatments, stratifying by region and previous exposure to foreigners. One week prior to the survey, mobilizing teams containing no foreigners will mobilize 20 people to participate in the household survey. In arms (2) & (3) of the study, 10 people will be selected at random and invited to participate in a focus group one or two days later, and 10 people will be selected at random to participate in a HH survey one week later. In arm (1) of the study, 20 people will be selected at random to participate in a HH survey one week later.
