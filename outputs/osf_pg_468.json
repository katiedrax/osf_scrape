Land of Lincoln has distributed 10,000 mailers which we designed to to randomly selected Illinois residents. 5,000 of the mailers frame health insurance as providing aligned costs and benefits, while another 5,000 frame insurance as being in the best interest of the individual consumer. Land of Lincoln will make results available to us by the end of February, after the enrollment window has closed. The general theory behind this experiment holds that citizens import norms from the consumer realm into the policy realm, and that the consumer fairness norm in particular can better explain policy uptake than self-interest frames. The design is indebted to Bertrand et al (2010), who examined the efficacy of advertising via a randomized mail design in South Africa. For that study, the authors partnered with a commercial lender. In this case, we will study the effects of advertising in a randomized experiment about public policy, in which we have partnered with a policy provider. Specifically, we are investigating whether consumer fairness frames that have been found to work in the consumer realm also affect policy uptake. We are bringing the literature on consumer fairness, which has flourished in economics and social psychology, into political science. Consumer fairness is grounded in everyday consumer behavior which, with repetition, produces its own norms; the shared etymological origins of norms and normal are instructive in this regard. Scholarship has coalesced around a version of consumers fairness in which individuals expect the costs they pay to be roughly in line with the costs that firms bear, along with a profit margin that does not exceed the profits they perceive firms in similar contexts to be drawing. When consumers think fairness has not been achieved, they will penalize the unfair firm. Conversely, they are willing to pay higher prices when, contextually, they believe it is fair to do so. Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler (1986a) used survey data to show that concerns about fairness effectively prevented firms from maximizing profits. The vast majority of their respondents regarded a firm that would raise shovel prices after a snowstorm as engaging in unfair behavior; the same was true for a car dealership that raised prices for a particularly in demand yet hard-to-come-by automobile. One of their chief contributions was showing that consumers do not reflexively think of profit-making as unfair. In one vignette, survey respondents were told about a landlord whose rising costs forced him to raise the rent on a poor tenant, even though the increase might force the tenant to move. 75% of respondents found the action to be fair. Given certain conditions, consumers do not begrudge firms a profit motive. Respondents viewed salary cuts undertaken by a struggling company as fair, but unfair when undertaken by a profitable company. Ultimately, consumer fairness flows from a dual entitlement principle that binds both buyers and sellers. Buyers---consumers---are entitled to a purchase price roughly comparable to a ``reference transaction,\"\" or a transaction that recently occurred within both firm and customers' community or frame of reference. Sellers, meanwhile, are entitled to a profit within the limits of the reference transaction\"\" (Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler 1986a; Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler 1986b). Evidence abounds that consumer fairness matters outside the laboratory. Consumers weigh the fairness of a particular price when deciding whether to purchase it (Martins and Monroe 1994). When they feel that a vendor is not being fair, consumers are more likely to be dissatisfied with the good sold, if not outright angry (Oliver and Swann 1989a and b). They are also likely to tell other consumers about the perceived unfairness, leading to negative costs for the vendor (Zeelenberg and Pieters 2004). For their part, vendors are acutely aware of consumers' perceptions about unfairness. Examples testifying to vendors' concerns with fairness are all around us. Why, for example, do events such as concerts and sporting events sell out well before all the demand has been captured and reflected in higher possible prices (Okun 1981; Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler 1986a)? Why do popular restaurants not engage in ``dynamic pricing\"\" and charge extra for reservations during peak hours? In both cases, firms are willfully leaving excess demand---and thus profits---on the table. The likely explanation is that firms anticipate that such actions would generate accusations of unfairness, sowing the seeds of resentment and diminishing future profits. Indeed, recent experimental work has found that consumers do regard dynamic pricing as an unfair practice (Haws and Bearden 2006). \""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"H1: The mailers that frame healthcare as fair will be significantly more effective at causing Illinois residents to sign up for Land of Lincoln Health, compared to the mailers that frame healthcare in more traditional ways related to self-interest.

There are multiple factors that affect voters' electoral behavior, but these can be aggregated in two main categories (Adams et al. 2005, Calvo and Murillo 2015). The first relies on the role of ideology, and assumes that voters and parties locate themselves along an ideal point on some ideological continuum. Voters prefer the candidate/party that minimizes ideological distance. The second category emphasizes the existence of non-ideological considerations in voters' decision making. This may involve voters taking into account some non-policy-related factors when they are deciding to vote for a particular candidate, such as descriptive representation (e.g. race, gender or social class), targeted distribution (e.g. vote-buying or patronage) and retrospective voting (reward/punish the incumbent when economic condition improve/worsen), among other non-programmatic variables. Adams et al. (2015) attempt to reconcile both groups of arguments by proposing a unified model of voting behavior, which integrates the behavioralist's perspective into the spatial-modeling framework. Therefore, the combination of the programmatic and non-programmatic components will explain voters' electoral decisions.

This project challenges this view, arguing that the importance of the ideological and non-ideological determinants of the vote are conditional to the context. Simply put, adverse conditions produced by natural disasters will affect the role of the ideological and non-ideological factors that explain voters' political preferences. Natural disasters are events triggered by natural hazards, and can generate significant costs for the countries and citizens affected. A natural disaster will modify voters' priorities and concerns.

Copiapo is the capital city of the Atacama region, and was severely affected by the floods. The Copiapo river overflowed, generating damage in multiple (but not in all) areas of the city. I will conduct a conjoint experiment in Copiapo, Chile from June 14th to July 1st, 2015. The main goal of the conjoint analysis (Hainmueller et al. 2014) is to determine how people value different attributes of the candidates to make electoral decisions. The experiment will ask a population of citizens living in the city of Copiapo to decide between two (non-real) candidates that will be competing for the position of mayor in the 2016 local elections. The respondents will see information about six attributes of these two candidates: ideology, gender, previous political experience, profession, age and proposal for affected citizens (proxy of distribution). These attributes will be randomly chosen to generate the candidates profiles. This experimental design allows for the comparison of the explanatory power of different treatments (Hainmueller and Hopkins 2014). In summary, the conjoint experiment will randomize candidates characteristics, which will allow me to identify the effects of each of these attributes. The respondents need to choose one of the two candidates. The outcome will be the answer to the following question: if you have to vote for one of these two candidates, whom do you prefer for mayor? Each of the respondents will have to evaluate 8 pairs of profiles. Therefore, in the analysis it will be necessary to cluster the standard errors by respondent.

I will spend 18 days in Copiapo in June, 2015 (10 weeks after the floods). I will conduct a survey and the conjoint experiment. The survey should provide extra evidence about the role of ideology and distribution after a natural disaster. I plan to conduct between 80 and 150 interviews.

the hallmarks of public service delivery: buses do not run on a standard schedule, water supplies are variable in terms of arrival times, and electricity blackouts occur unexpectedly. Surprisingly, the causes and consequences of unpredictable urban services have received much less attention than patterns of access to, or government expenditures on, these services. While addressing the underlying causes of service unpredictability tends to be very costly (e.g., replacing leaky water pipes or increasing capacity to improve water pressure levels), low-cost informational interventions can potentially help households to cope with service unpredictability. Alleviating coping costs may also change the way in which citizens relate to their local governments. Through a cluster-randomized experiment in Bangalore, we will evaluate a text-message based notification scheme providing households with advance warning of the timing of water services and supply cancellations, and a dedicated contact number for reporting problems. We assess whether the notification system reduces: a) the time spent waiting for water; b) expenditures on substitutes for piped water services; and c) stress levels on account of uncertain and irregular deliveries and uncertainty. We hypothesize that lower- income households will see greater welfare impacts because they have few affordable and accessible alternative water sources. We also examine if, and how, the receipt of real-time information changes how citizens \u201csee the state,\u201d whom they hold responsible for service quality and problems, and whom they approach about service concerns. We hypothesize that the advance notification system will prompt citizens to see the state as more modern and responsive when compared with the status quo, in which the state can only be accessed through intermediaries and low level bureaucrats.

In post-conflict countries, institutional changes that address security vacuums that existed during the civil war may help improve civilians perception of the security forces and of the state and it may even increase support for the state. On one hand, government forces may have been implicated in much of the atrocities and repression that occurred during the war. On the other hand, insurgent forces may have inflicted violence because government forces were too weak. Thus, it is possible that reforms that address government abuse and government incapacity may help change citizens\u2019 beliefs and actions toward the state. This project evaluates whether two security sector reforms help address the protection gap that may have existed during civil wars. Female ratio balancing or the integration of women into the security forces may alleviate some concerns that the security forces are too abusive and the increased presence of security personnel into the rural periphery may help address concerns about violence by non-state actors. It does so by randomizing police patrols by sex in one of Liberia\u2019s most remote counties. Teams of male or female police officers visited randomly select households in Grand Kru County and spent 30min speaking to household members about police reforms. The project assesses whether these visits affected perceptions and support for the state by comparing individuals from households that received visits by men or women to households that did not receive visits. The specific research questions are: 1) Do security sector reforms that increase the strength of the security forces lead to perceptions of effectiveness of the security forces? 2) Do security sector reforms that constrain the security forces lead to perceptions of restraint of the security forces? 3) Do reforms that address protection gaps lead to enhanced perceptions of the state? 4) Do reforms that address protection gaps lead to enhanced support for the state? 5) Is information about reforms or exposure to reforms more important for enhanced perceptions of and support for the state?"}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "There are a number of hypotheses that will be tested related to perceptions and behavior. The main hypotheses are: 1) Compared to individuals that have no interactions with police officers, individuals that have interactions with police officers in the rural periphery may be more likely to perceive the security sector as effective. 2) Compared to individuals that have no interactions with police officers (or compared to male police officers), individuals that have interactions with female police officers in the rural periphery may be more likely to perceive the security sector as effective and restrained. 3) Compared to individuals that have no interactions with police officers, individuals that have interactions with police officers in the rural periphery may be more likely to support the state. 4) Compared to individuals that have no interactions with police officers (or compared to male police officers), individuals that have interactions with female police officers in the rural periphery may be more likely to support the state. 5) Compared to individuals that receive information about police reforms, individuals that have interactions with police officers in the rural periphery may be more likely to perceive the security sector and the state more positively and provide more support to the state. I estimate heterogeneous treatment effects along two dimensions: (1) previous exposure to violence by state or non-state actors and (2) sex. I will operationalize exposure to wartime violence as an additive index capturing respondents\u2019 reports of victimization. I will distinguish between violence perpetrated by government security forces and violence perpetrated by rebels."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "The field experiment involves randomizing police patrols in Grand Kru County, Liberia. The treatment takes place at the household level, and includes a scripted visit by two LNP officers. Households in the control group do not receive visits by LNP officers. Twenty-five villages are selected in Grand Kru County out of a sample of 45 villages that have more than 80 households. The officers will visit 15 of the villages, while the remaining 10 villages will not receive visits by police officers. There are three separate treatments. The first treatment is direct exposure and conversation with male officers. The second treatment is exposure and conversation with female officers. There are two control groups. The first control group includes households in villages that did not receive any visits by police officers. The second control group include households from villages that received visits from police officers, but are households that were not randomly selected to receive the treatment. The third treatment is information about the LNP provided by enumerators (no visits). Officers for the project were chosen based on their similarity in personality. The LNP provided fifteen Kru-speaking officers. From these, I recorded each of the officers giving a speech and speaking to an audience about the role of the LNP. I then showed the videos to a group of Kru people in Monrovia and had them rate the officers on different characteristics. Based on the similarity of scores, I chose four officers\u2014\u0080\u0094two female and two male. The assumption is that when the police officers visit the households, they treat the entire household (all individuals within it). They are to speak to the entire household when they visit them. However, one sided non-compliance may be an issue if those that received the treatment may not be home when the outcome survey is conducted. Or, the randomized selection of the individual in the household may not yield a person that was treated (present during the officer visit). In other words, not all the household members may be treated. To account for this, the research design takes on an intent to treat research design. It makes the assumption that the visit to the household affects everyone in the household. Outcomes are measured at two different time periods. Immediate outcomes are measured during the officers'\u0080\u0099 visits. About one month after the officer visit, a team of enumerators will survey the treated individuals in \u0080\u0094the individuals with whom the police officers conversed. This end-line survey will be conducted in both control and treated villages; individuals in the ``pure\" control group will be selected randomly through the same random walk procedure used to select the treatment group. They will ask the community leaders for a list of quarters and randomly select quarters in which to conduct the survey. They will use a random walk method and survey every other house. The enumeration team that conducts the end-line survey will be introduced as conducting a survey for the Center for Applied Research (CART), a Liberian NGO, on education, security, and health. There are three outcome variables to measure: perceptions of the security sector related to effectiveness and restraint, perceptions of the state, and support for the state. The first set includes measuring perceptions of effectiveness/ineffectiveness, restraint/abuse of the state institutions (police). To do so, I conduct a large-N survey of all treatment and control households. The survey includes fifteen questions that assess perceptions of the security sector. Another way support will be measured is through monetary compensation. To test whether individuals are willing to support the state, all individuals (control groups included) will be given 90 Liberian Dollars for their participation in the survey. At the end of the survey, the enumerator will ask the individual whether the person wants to donate some portion of their money to either the community or the police to ensure security. The option of giving to the community or the state will be randomly assigned. Finally, the last way to measure support is through the counting the number of phone calls made to the police station after the visits. The officers and enumerators (for control villages) will distribute cards with phone numbers to the nearest depot. The cards that the officers give out will have phone numbers that correspond to different numbers at the LNP depot. When officers answer the phone, they will ask for the household number on the card, so that these data can also be added to the database. Police officers in the depot will record the phone calls for a period of 3 months after the visits. Calls from treated households may indicate that they are now willing to use state institutions instead of relying on informal ones. There are some additional behavioral outcomes that can be measured during the initial visit that assess the perceptions of restraint, effectiveness, and support between Treatment 1 and Treatment 2 only. The enumerators will record immediate behavioral responses during the interaction between police officers and community members. The models will use randomization inference. Two-tail tests will be used in the analyses to test whether police presence has a positive or negative impact. The data will be presented using covariates and without using covariates. If there is imbalance on any of the indicators above, these will be included in the statistical models. Standard errors will be clustered at the village level. Conventional p-value levels will be upper \u0080\u0094p-values that are below 0.05, although p-values of 0.1 will also be presented. Control variables include: sex, age, household income, religion, membership in traditional leadership, land ownership, education level, cognitive ability, participation in armed groups, past experience with the security sector, past experience with the government, and participation in community watch teams. These variables may also be used as control variables depending on balance. For continuous measures, I cap outliers at the 99th percentile. I exclude any observations with a dfbeta greater than 2/sqrt(N). I will compute the Average Effect Size within each cluster, following the procedure proposed in Kling et al. (2004) and Clingingsmith et al. (2008). Questions will be clustered based on questions related to effectiveness and restraint. Standard errors will be clustered at the village level."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Liberia"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "1275"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "Emory IRB00073869"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "12-May-15"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q27": {"extra": [], "value": "Liberian National Police, Center for Applies Research and Training"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q30": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design", "Field Experiments", "Statistics"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Conflict and Violence", "Development", "Gender", "Governance"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e31e29c4b2010001a20f8ea", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/yskvt/providers/osfstorage/5e31e29c4b2010001a20f8ea", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/yskvt/providers/osfstorage/5e31e29c4b2010001a20f8ea", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/yskvt/providers/osfstorage/5e31e29c4b2010001a20f8ea?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/yskvt/providers/osfstorage/5e31e29c4b2010001a20f8ea"}, "attributes": {"etag": "45995f91fac8d6d89f2514a95c989fabd869f1097f4e45e6dfd91f9c23eabe9d", "kind": "file", "name": "20151128AA_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e31e29c4b2010001a20f8ea", "size": 1123528, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "f2f7ed37c94c6e0539569f69c10469b3", "sha256": "ab0747cac5e1473b7f4e4059c24b43374101819c3e86c349011766a1226f8e82"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 1123528, "modified": "2020-01-29T19:53:00.340877+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "yskvt", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20151128AA_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-01-29T19:53:00+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "yskvt", "sha256": "ab0747cac5e1473b7f4e4059c24b43374101819c3e86c349011766a1226f8e82", "viewUrl": "/project/uzvhw/files/osfstorage/5e31e2a0f6631d00175a3146/", "selectedFileName": "20151128AA_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20151128AA_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": {}, "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Finding the Right Security Sector Strategy: The Goldilocks Problem in Post-Conflict States", "q2": "Sabrina Karim", "q3": "20151128AA", "q4": "11/28/2015 - 21:44", "q5": "", "q6": "No", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to realization of outcomes", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "10/4/15", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "Do reforms in the security sector help post-conflict states regain legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens?
