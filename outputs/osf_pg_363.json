The results of this study will therefore prove beneficial for charities and nonprofit organizations, who can use these findings to determine how best to use photographs as promotional and informational tools to solicit donations.

Is there a way to engender closer cooperation between conflicting groups once reconciliation is in sight? That is the question that we ask in this project. Drawing on the literature on common ingroup identity theory in psychology (Gaertner and Dovidio 2000; Gaertner et al. 1993) we ask whether an appeal to historical commonalities that predate the most recent conflict might be effective in papering over the divisions and thus leading to enhanced cooperation. This is a question that has received surprisingly little attention in the literature on postconflict reconciliation, which tends to focus on the effectiveness of various economic interventions on interpersonal rather than intergroup cooperation (Attanasio et al. 2015; Avdeenko and Gilligan 2015; Fearon et al. 2009, 2015; Nguyen and Rieger 2017). Whereas the substantial literature on intergroup cooperation focuses primarily on interactions across racial, ethnic, or religious boundaries (Balliet et al. 2014; Goldenberg et al. 2017; Pagotto et al. 2013; Pettigrew and Tropp 2006; Reuben and Tyran 2010; Scacco and Warren 2018), leaving unexplored postconflict reconciliation among culturally distinctive but racially, ethnically, or religiously homogeneous groups. The common ingroup identity theory had received some attention in political science in recent years, but its insights are ordinarily tested on outcomes such as prejudice and altruism in intergroup interactions (Charnysh et al. 2015; Lazarev and Sharma 2017; Levendusky 2018). Some work has been done on the effectiveness of appeals to common ingroup identity on cooperation (Chang and Peisakhin 2019; Robinson 2016) but in the context other than the aftermath of a protracted ideological conflict. To the best of our knowledge, ours will be the first experimental study to test the theory in that important context.

division. Is there a way to engender closer cooperation between conflicting groups once reconciliation is in sight? That is the question that we ask in this project. Drawing on the literature on common ingroup identity theory in psychology (Gaertner and Dovidio 2000; Gaertner et al. 1993) we ask whether an appeal to historical commonalities that predate the most recent conflict might be effective in papering over the divisions and thus leading to enhanced cooperation. This is a question that has received surprisingly little attention in the literature on postconflict reconciliation, which tends to focus on the effectiveness of various economic interventions on interpersonal rather than intergroup cooperation (Attanasio et al. 2015; Avdeenko and Gilligan 2015; Fearon et al. 2009, 2015; Nguyen and Rieger 2017). Whereas the substantial literature on intergroup cooperation focuses primarily on interactions across racial, ethnic, or religious boundaries (Balliet et al. 2014; Goldenberg et al. 2017; Pagotto et al. 2013; Pettigrew and Tropp 2006; Reuben and Tyran 2010; Scacco and Warren 2018), leaving unexplored postconflict reconciliation among culturally distinctive but racially, ethnically, or religiously homogeneous groups. The common ingroup identity theory had received some attention in political science in recent years, but its insights are ordinarily tested on outcomes such as prejudice and altruism in intergroup interactions (Charnysh et al. 2015; Lazarev and Sharma 2017; Levendusky 2018). Some work has been done on the effectiveness of appeals to common ingroup identity on cooperation (Chang and Peisakhin 2019; Robinson 2016) but in the context other than the aftermath of a protracted ideological conflict. To the best of our knowledge, ours will be the first experimental study to test the theory in that important context. Another insight that we plan to borrow from psychology has to do with possible differential effects of appeals to common ingroup identity on different types of groups. Social psychologists have long recognized that group status, as a product of group size, economic influence, or social hierarchy, can diminish or augment intergroup bias or cooperation levels (Brewer et al. 1993; Dovidio et al. 2008; Ellemers et al. 1992; Hogg and Hains 1996; Tajfel and Turner 1979).

And how does such exposure shape anti-immigrant sentiments and voting behavior? To address these questions, we study the recent arrival of refugees in East-Germany, a region that had not previously experienced any consistent influx of foreigners. Exploiting the random allocation of refugees to localities, we aim at comparing attitudes and behavior of native Germans living in localities that have received an influx of refugees, to localities that were not touched by this experience. We aim to make two contributions. First, we speak to the social-psychological debate on the effects of inter-group contact on altruism and trust. Altruism and trust \u2013 or \u2018mutual regard\u2019 \u2013 are seen as important ingredients of a nations economic and social well-being, but also as phenomena particularly challenged by increasing levels of immigration (Arrow, 1974; Collier, 2013; Alesina and Ferrara, 2000; Gambetta, 1988). In the literature, several conflicting hypotheses co-exist how contact should influence altruism and trust. On the one hand, the contact hypothesis predicts that, under favourable conditions, contact tends to improve intercommunal relationships (Allport, 1954; Pettigrew and Tropp, 2006). In stark contrast to this, the conflict hypothesis predicts that exposure will increase levels of competition between groups, will trigger fears among the established native populations, and will hence lead to a rejection of ethnic \u2018others\u2019 and newcomers (Bobo and Hutchings, 1996; Quillian, 1996; Olzak, 1992). A third theory specifies that increased intergroup competition following the arrival of newcomers may cause parochial altruism \u2013 a combination of hostility towards these newcomers combined with increased ingroup solidarity and trust (Bowles and Gintis, 2004; Halevy et al., 2008; Abbink et al., 2012). The continuing coexistence of these opposed hypotheses is puzzling, and is partly due to problems of measurement and endogeneity that have vexed scholars studying the effects of outgroup exposure. Second, we aim to contribute to an ongoing debate in political science how immigration and the reception of refugees shape political attitudes and behavior. A large number of studies show that immigration is a highly salient topic effectively mobilizing voters, especially on the political right (Sniderman et al., 2004; Dustmann and Preston, 2007; Brader et al., 2008; Dancygier, 2010; Hainmueller and Hopkins, 2014; Abrajano and Hajnal, 2015). Questions of immigration, the hosting of refugees and citizenship have become even more politicized in recent years with the steady rise of right-wing populists politicians and parties, which reached first peaks in 2016, with the election of Donald Trump as US president and the successful \u2018Brexit\u2019 referendum in the UK to leave the EU. In Germany, this rightward shift in politics is reflected in the success of the Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (\u2018Alternative for Germany\u2019)/ AfD party, which first entered 14 out of 16 regional parliaments, and in the 2017 federal elections acceded to the national parliament as the third-strongest party. As with the support for Trump in the US, the AfD garnered their best results in relatively rural and underdeveloped regions of country. The success of right-wing politicians and parties and the geographical pattern of their support are often attributed to the relative demise in status of members of the working class, who feel cut out from increasingly deregulated national economies, and feel alienated by high levels of immigration and the dominance of cosmopolitan values (Hochschild, 2016; Gest, 2016; Gidron and Hall, 2017; Inglehart and Norris, 2016; Colantone and Stanig, 2017; Rodrik, 2017). We contribute to this debate by testing how first-time, sustained exposure to foreign newcomers \u2013 in combination with cues regarding the religious affiliation of the newcomers and the relative economic situation of the hosting population \u2013 shape right-wing attitudes and voting behavior."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "We will record two types of outcomes: 1) altruism, trust and discriminatory behavior towards immigrants and natives, measured with a set of behavioral games, and 2) (right-wing) attitudes and voting behavior, measured in terms of recalled and prospective voting decisions and survey items. Altruism, trust and discrimination Altruism will be measured in terms of decisions in a dictator game, a widely used measure of altruism (Kahneman et al., 1986; Camerer, 2003; Fershtman and Gneezy, 2001). In the dictator game, the respondent is given a fixed amount of money and asked if s/he is will to share parts or all of it with a matched partner. The share handed over to the partner is interpreted as a measure of altruism. Our respondents will play the DG twice, once with a generic German native (either man or women), and once with a generic immigrant (either man or women). The native/immigrant status will be indicated by the name of the partner and a photo. The photos will be supplied by actors hired for that purpose. Trust will be measured with a version of the trust game (Berg et al., 1995). In the trust game, two players are endowed with a fixed amount of money. The first player is then asked whether s/he would like to send part or all of his/her endowment to his/her partner. Whatever the first player sends is multiplied by the experimenter, usually by a factor of 2 or 3. The partner/second player can now decide whether and how much of the received amount to return to the first player. Sending money therefore is a potentially profitable but risky decision for the first player, matching the widely accepted definition of a trusting decision (Gambetta, 1988). The share of the original endowment sent will be interpreted as the measure of trust. Again, participants will engage in the trust game twice, once when matched with the generic native partner, and once when matched with the generic immigrant partner. Both times, participants will decide in the role of the first player. In order to measure discrimination, we include a division game (Peterson, 2016). In the game, participants are given a fixed amount of money and are asked to distribute that amount to two partners (cp. Habyarimana et al., 2009). They can choose any split they like, dividing the amount equally, allocating the whole amount to one partner only, or choosing some intermediate solution. In our game, in all cases the two partners in this game will consist of a generic native and a generic immigrant. The extent to which the split favors one or another is interpreted as a measure of discrimination. Right-wing populism and attitudes towards immigrants and voting behavior Support for anti-immigrant and other (populist) right-wing positions will be measured with a number of survey items, tapping both into attitudes and political behavior. The main behavioral measure will be a recall of the party-choice (Zweitstimme) during the 2017 general elections. We are particularly interested in vote choices for the AfD \u2013 Germany\u2019s upstart right-wing populist party \u2013 vs. others. As a further behavioral measure, will also include a petition urging the federal government to outlaw dual citizenship \u2013 a prominent concern of the political right in Germany. Participants will be asked to indicate their support or opposition to this petition. In addition, we will include a number of survey items used in other studies probing for right-wing attitudes and attitudes towards refugees (cp. Best et al., 2016; Gerhards et al., 2016). We will analyze the items separately and in combination by standardizing and averaging all items.

The chief aims of proposed research are to: - investigate the mechanism of fiscal illusion, allowing for an updated typology of fiscal illusion, - gather data on UK taxpayer's perception of their total taxes, - examine how the provision of information on their total taxes and the allocation of taxes affects UK taxpayers' fiscal policy preferences. The main research questions are: 1. How accurately do taxpayers perceive their taxes and costs of public services? 2. How does taxpayers' knowledge of their comprehensive taxes and costs of public services affect their tax and public spending preferences? 3. How does the mechanism of fiscal illusion work? Mixed methods research is proposed to answer the questions on the mechanism of fiscal illusion and UK taxpayers' perception of their taxes and contribution to public expenditure. The explanatory sequential design will consist of quantitative data collection (through a web survey-based experiment) in the first stage and qualitative data collection (through interviews) in the second stage.

Empirical research on the hypotheses of fiscal illusion has been inconclusive, while taxpayers' perception studies have reported widespread tax misperception, with both over and underestimation observed. The chief aims of proposed research are to: - investigate the mechanism of fiscal illusion, allowing for an updated typology of fiscal illusion, - gather data on UK taxpayer's perception of their total taxes, - examine how the provision of information on their total taxes and the allocation of taxes affects UK taxpayers' fiscal policy preferences. The main research questions are: 1. How accurately do taxpayers perceive their taxes and costs of public services? 2. How does taxpayers' knowledge of their comprehensive taxes and costs of public services affect their tax and public spending preferences? 3. How does the mechanism of fiscal illusion work? Mixed methods research is proposed to answer the questions on the mechanism of fiscal illusion and UK taxpayers' perception of their taxes and contribution to public expenditure. The explanatory sequential design will consist of quantitative data collection (through a web survey-based experiment) in the first stage and qualitative data collection (through interviews) in the second stage.

H5: Revealing the amount of taxes paid, and the cost of public services incurred by individuals will affect their perception of tax fairness. H6: Revealing the amount of taxes paid, and the costs of public services incurred by individuals will make it easier for them to form fiscal policy preferences.
