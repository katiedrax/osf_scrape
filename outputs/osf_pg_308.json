Participants will complete the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Revised\u2013Short form, Neuroticism scale (EPQR-S-N; Eysenck et al., 1985). This subscale assesses participants\u2019 emotional tendencies (e.g., \u201cDoes your mood often go up and down?\u201d)\n\nSelf-Esteem. Participants will complete the Rosenburg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES; Rosenberg, 1979). This 10-item measure asks participants to rate their feelings of self-worth (e.g., \u201cOn the whole, I am satisfied with myself.\u201d) \n\nAttributions About Romantic Partner Behaviors. The first set of questions about attributions is Collins and colleagues\u2019 (2006) explanations for potentially negative partners\u2019 behaviors. Participants will rate how likely possible explanations are for the behavior in the vignettes. For each vignette, participants will rate 3 negative explanations and 3 neutral explanations. In Collins and colleagues\u2019 (2006) study, negative explanations for partners\u2019 behaviors showed good convergent validity with negative attributions on the Relationship Attributions Measure (RAM; Fincham &amp; Bradbury, 1992), a well-validated measure of attributions for partners\u2019 behaviors. \n\nThe second set of questions about attributions is the Relationship Attributions Measure (RAM; Fincham &amp; Bradbury, 1992). Participants will complete this measure in response to Collins and colleagues\u2019 (2006) vignettes. We will ask participants to rate their agreement on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree) with statements that reflect six dimensions of attributions. The causal attributions subscale encompasses attributions of locus, stability, and globality (e.g., \u201cMy partner\u2019s behavior is due to something about them\u201d) and the responsibility attributions subscale encompasses attributions of intentionality, motivation, and blameworthiness (e.g., My partner\u2019s behavior was motivated by selfish rather than unselfish concerns.\u201d) The original validation study (Fincham &amp; Bradbury, 1992) demonstrated adequate internal consistency across three samples with Chronbach\u2019s \u03b1 ranging from .55 to .88 for the subscales. The measure also demonstrated moderate to high test-retest reliability over three weeks. \n\nExplicit responses to partners\u2019 behaviors.  Following rating attributions about the event depicted in the vignette, participants will rate how likely they are to react in various ways subscale (e.g., \u201cSnap or yell,\u201d \u201cIgnore your partner,\u201d \u201cCriticize or complain\u201d) using a procedure from Collins and colleagues (2006). This measure strong internal consistency (\u03b1 =.93; Collins et al., 2006).\n\nImplicit responses to partners\u2019 behaviors. Participants will complete a novel go/no-go association task to test implicit responses to hypothetical partners\u2019 behaviors (Conflict Responses Go/No-Go Association Task; CR-GNAT; Fitter &amp; Cassidy, in preparation). Go/no-go association tasks measure implicit associations between a target stimulus (e.g., children) and an attribute (e.g., good). Researchers assess the strength of the association between the target and the attribute by measuring the degree to which distracter items (e.g., \u201cannoying\u201d) can be quickly discriminated from items that belong to the target category (e.g., \u201cmy child\u201d) and the attribute category (e.g., \u201cjoyful\u201d). Variations of the GNAT are frequently used to measure implicit associations (e.g., Anderson &amp; Kaufmann, 2011; Kaufmann &amp; Haslam, 2007; Sturge-Apple et al.,  2015). A variant of the GNAT has also been employed to test implicit responses toward one\u2019s future child (Jones et al., in preparation). GNATs can achieve good reliability with 40 or more trials per block (see Williams &amp; Kaufmann, 2012, for a review).\n\nFirst, participants will complete two short practice blocks of the CR-GNAT (procedure described below). Next, they will be asked to imagine \u201cYour partner didn't comfort you when you were feeling down.\u201d After 30 seconds, the participants will be asked to think about how they would respond. Finally, participants will complete the CR-GNAT.\n\nThree types of word stimuli will appear one at a time on a computer screen for 650ms each (stimulus time following Sturge-Apple et al., 2015). Words will belong to either one of two attribute categories (positive and negative) or the target category (the words \u201cmy behavior\u201d). Words in the positive attribute category will be positive responses to the imagined upsetting behavior (e.g., \u201cforgive,\u201d \u201crespect\u201d), and words in the negative attribute category will be negative responses to the imagined upsetting behavior (e.g., \u201caccuse,\u201d \u201cyell\u201d).  The target category will consist solely of the words \u201cmy behavior\u201d.\n\nSubjects will participate in two positive blocks (one practice round with 14 trials and one real round with 42 trials) and two negative blocks with the same number of trials as the positive blocks. In the positive blocks, participants will be asked to press the space bar when they see positive words, or the words \u201cmy behavior\u201d and to do nothing for negative words. In the negative block, participants will be asked to press the space bar when they see negative words, or the words \u201cmy behavior\u201d and to do nothing for positive words. This task will yield two d\u2019 scores, one for the positive block and one for the negative block. Higher d\u2019 scores on the positive block reflect positive implicit responses, and higher d\u2019 scores on negative block reflect negative implicit responses. \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Negative attributions. \n\nPrevious research using the RAM has demonstrated the two subscales (causal attributions and responsibility attributions) to be highly correlated.

We will conduct independent samples t-tests to determine whether there are differences in the study variables between the secure and neutral primed participants. If any of these possible covariates are significantly associated with study variables, we will control for them in all principal analyses.\n\nHypothesis 1: To test our first hypothesis, negative attributions will be regressed on priming condition, and covariates. \n\nHypothesis 2: We will conduct percentile bootstrapped mediation models to test our second and third hypotheses. Percentile bootstrapped mediation has a good balance between type 1 and type 2 error rates compared to the bias-corrected bootstrap and Monte Carlo approaches (Hayes &amp; Scharkow, 2013; MacKinnon et al., 2004).\nPriming condition will be entered as the independent variable, negative attributions will be entered as the mediator, negative explicit responses to partners\u2019 behaviors will be entered as the dependent variable, and we will control for covariates.\n\nHypothesis 3: Priming condition will be entered as the independent variable, negative attributions will be entered as the mediator, negative implicit responses to partners\u2019 behaviors will be entered as the dependent variable, and we will control for covariates.\n\nTo calculate implicit responses to romantic partners\u2019 behaviors, we will use d\u2019 from signal detection theory (SDT) to indicate performance on the GNAT. Before calculating d\u2019, we will standardize hit rates and false alarm rates using the standard normal N(0,1) function. We will calculate d\u2019 with the following formula: d\u2019 = Z(hit rate) \u2013 Z(false alarm rate). To handle extreme values that cannot be standardized (0s and 1s), we will use the loglinear transformation approach (Stanislaw &amp; Todorov, 1999). Prior to calculating the hit rate, I\u2019ll add .5 to the number of hits and false alarms, and 1 to the number of signal trials and the number of noise trials. \n\nTo remove method variance and control for general performance on the GNAT, we will follow previous researchers (e.g., Boldero et al., 2007; Sturge-Apple et al., 2015) and utilize residual scores. We will calculate a residual index of d\u2019 scores for negative trials by regressing d\u2019 scores for positive trials on d\u2019 scores for negative trials and saving the residualized scores. These scores reflect participants\u2019 performance on the negative GNAT trials, controlling for performance on the GNAT in general. \n\nHypothesis 4. We will compute a Pearson product moment correlation between explicit responses to partners\u2019 behaviors, and implicit responses to partners\u2019 behaviors to examine the predictive validity of these measures. \n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b6d28/children/?format=json", "meta":
