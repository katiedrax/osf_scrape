This study contributes to the research body by considering the (non-)occurrence, valence, and perceived controllability of events across main life areas in adolescents and adults of all ages. I will use multi-rater and twin data from two data waves (two years apart) of the Study of Personality Architecture and Dynamics (SPeADy). Second-wave data are being currently collected and will be available in Spring 2020.

The importance of personal focus values increases following the start of a new qualification or professional phase (H2.1a), a major interpersonal conflict (H2.2a), and/or a relationship dissolution (H2.3a). These relations strengthen with the life event\u2019s rated valence strength (H2.1b, H2.2b, and H2.3b).\n\n3.
