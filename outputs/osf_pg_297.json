ODNI training module\n2. Demographic survey\n3. Application of ODNI method to sample intelligence products\n4. RST training module\n5. Application of RST method to sample intelligence products\n\nAt stages 3 and 5 in each group, subjects will be guided through a series of 18 sample intelligence products, and asked to use the method in which they have just been trained to evaluate the QoR in each product. Of the 18 products, 7 are well-reasoned, and 11 are poorly-reasoned.\n\nTo isolate the effects of training in each method, only evaluations from stage 3 will be used to answer the primary research question. Further, due to the length of stages 1 and 3, it is not expected that many participants will complete stages 4 and 5. If there is a meaningful amount of data collected in stages 4 and 5, it might be used for exploratory analysis.\n\nTo maximise learning outcomes for subjects, they will be provided with feedback immediately after evaluating each product. The feedback will indicate whether or not their evaluation of the product was correct, along with details and justifications for the correct evaluation of the product. This will likely cause learning effects to be present. To counterbalance learning effects, the order in which the products are presented to subjects will be randomised.\n\nA secondary aim of the study is to collect preliminary data on the robustness of each method to variations in communication style. To this end, 4 of the products have two variants. Two well-reasoned products have an additional 'poorly written' version that contains spelling and grammatical errors, verbosity and repetition; and two poorly-reasoned products have an additional, 'impressively written' version that contains jargon, obfuscation, and \u201cofficialese\u201d. For these 4 products, each subject will only see one version, chosen at random.\n\nAs the we want to retain the ability to use the test products used for this study in future, as well to to potentially sell access to the training package, we are not attaching them to this registration.

The sequence of tasks the two groups will complete are summarised below.\n\nGROUP 1 (RST then ODNI)\n\n1. RST training module\n2. Demographic survey\n3. Application of RST method to sample intelligence products\n4. ODNI training module\n5. Application of ODNI method to sample intelligence products \n\nGROUP 2 (ODNI then RST)\n\n1. ODNI training module\n2. Demographic survey\n3. Application of ODNI method to sample intelligence products\n4. RST training module\n5. Application of RST method to sample intelligence products\n\nAt stages 3 and 5 in each group, subjects will be guided through a series of 18 sample intelligence products, and asked to use the method in which they have just been trained to evaluate the QoR in each product. Of the 18 products, 7 are well-reasoned, and 11 are poorly-reasoned.\n\nTo isolate the effects of training in each method, only evaluations from stage 3 will be used to answer the primary research question. Further, due to the length of stages 1 and 3, it is not expected that many participants will complete stages 4 and 5. If there is a meaningful amount of data collected in stages 4 and 5, it might be used for exploratory analysis.\n\nTo maximise learning outcomes for subjects, they will be provided with feedback immediately after evaluating each product. The feedback will indicate whether or not their evaluation of the product was correct, along with details and justifications for the correct evaluation of the product. This will likely cause learning effects to be present. To counterbalance learning effects, the order in which the products are presented to subjects will be randomised.\n\nA secondary aim of the study is to collect preliminary data on the robustness of each method to variations in communication style. To this end, 4 of the products have two variants. Two well-reasoned products have an additional 'poorly written' version that contains spelling and grammatical errors, verbosity and repetition; and two poorly-reasoned products have an additional, 'impressively written' version that contains jargon, obfuscation, and \u201cofficialese\u201d. For these 4 products, each subject will only see one version, chosen at random.\n\nAs the we want to retain the ability to use the test products used for this study in future, as well to to potentially sell access to the training package, we are not attaching them to this registration.

Participants will be invited to participate through multiple channels, including:\n\n- from government departments and intelligence organisations in Five Eyes countries, via relationships our research group has with those organisations;\n- from a pool of subjects who have been involved in previous studies undertaken by our research group, re-invited via email;\n- from the general public, invited via Facebook ads and a public invitation on the Hunt Lab website.\n\nTo encourage participation, the study will be presented as a valuable opportunity for professional learning. For many participants, the training they received in evaluating quality of reasoning will be applicable beyond the context of the study.\n\nEILIGIBILITY\n\nParticipants cannot be members of our (extended) research group or have participated in any pilot studies in which they will have already seen versions of the products. Additional criteria for data exclusion are outlined under the relevant question in the Analysis plan section. Otherwise, there are no criteria which make subjects ineligible to participate. \n\nParticipants will be separately asked whether they have previously encountered either of the two evaluation methods, and their response to these questions will be included as a variable in our model. (While the RST is a new, unpublished method, some participants may have encountered an earlier version of it in pilot studies we have run.)\n\nThe substantial length of the training modules is also expected to prompt participants to \u2018self-filter\u2019 and abandon the training if they are either (a) not sufficiently committed/engaged or (b) already familiar with the material, both of which are undesirable qualities for the purposes of the study, but difficult to test for in advance of delivering the training. For these participants, no evaluations for intelligence products will be collected, because they will not make it past the training.\n\nSTUDY TIMELINE\n\nThe training and evaluation modules are available online and designed to operate indefinitely.
