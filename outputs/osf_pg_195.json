It describes the diminished ability to enjoy (daily) life, and has been associated with both the development and maintenance of depression (Pizzagalli, 2014; Spijker et al., 2001; Wardenaar et al., 2012). Pleasure can be subdivided into three separate components: wanting, liking and learning (Berridge et al., 2009; Berridge &amp; Robinson, 2003). Each component describes a separate aspect of an evolutionary adaptive reward loop intended to steer us towards rewards, either tangible (e.g. food, warmth) or more abstract (e.g. praise, accomplishments). Evidence from neurobiological and experimental research in laboratory settings shows that the temporal relations in this reward loop are disturbed in people suffering from depressive symptoms (Berridge &amp; Kringelbach, 2015; Vrieze et al., 2013; Whitton et al., 2015). To investigate reward loops in daily life, recent studies employed Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), a measurement approach in which participants receive multiple short questionnaires per day over the course of several days or weeks (Heininga et al., 2017; van Roekel et al., 2019; Wichers et al., 2015). An EMA study by Bakker et al. (2017) indicated that the disturbances in the reward loop as found in neurobiological studies can also be detected in daily life. \n \tAlthough deficits in reward loops have repeatedly been associated with depressive symptoms, the influence of reward loop functioning on the course of depression remains largely untested. Berridge and Robinson (2003) assumed that strong reward loop connections are adaptive in the sense that they steer an organism towards rewards. Behavioral activation, an effective treatment for depression (Dimidjian et al., 2011; Lewinsohn, 1974), also builds on this assumption: engaging in activities increase the chances of positive experiences, which subsequently reinforces future motivation for engaging in activities. Conversely, in a poorly connected reward loop increasing e.g. motivation through therapy would be ineffective as there would be no influence on subsequent engagement in activities. In other words; a functioning reward loop should contribute to recovery from depression. \n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Higher reward loop connection strength is associated with decreases in depressive symptoms over time.

See Figure 1 for a schematic overview of the measured variables and indices. \n\nEngagement in activities is operationalized as activities or active behavior leading to rewarding experiences, either physically or psychologically. During each measurement, participants were asked for the previous three hours (retrospective) to respond to the statements \"I've been physically active\", \"I've been in pleasant company\" and \"I did what I wanted to\". For each person and each timepoint, the  average score of the three questions will be taken as an indication of amount of engagement in activities in the preceding timeslot. \n\nPositive Experiences reflects the amount of positive affect (PA) participants experience at the time of measurement (momentary). Participants entered responses to \u201cRight now, I feel...\u201d on emotional adjectives, balanced on the arousal dimension (high/low) of emotional experience. PA was measured with the adjectives cheerful, relaxed, satisfied, energetic, enthusiastic and calm (e.g. \u201cI feel cheerful\u201d). Similar to other studies in the field (see for example Brans, Koval, Verduyn, Lim, &amp; Kuppens, 2013; Hartmann et al., 2015; Verhagen, Simons, van Zelst, &amp; Delespaul, 2017) a single positive affect score will be calculated as the mean score of the six positive adjectives for each person at each measurement. \n\nFor Motivation participants were asked to think about the next three hours (prospective), or the next day in case of the last diary of the day. Participants responded to the statements \"I intend to undertake certain things\" and \"I'm looking forward to the next three hours/day\". The composite measure of motivation will be calculated as the average of the two items for each person at each measurement. \n\nDepression severity was measured with the total score of the 30-item self-report Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR) (Rush, Gullion, Basco, Jarrett, &amp; Trivedi, 1996) across 6 time points: at baseline, after 4 weeks of ESM and at 4 follow-up measurements at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months post-ESM. The IDS-SR includes all DSM-IV diagnostic criterion items for major depressive disorder, as well as commonly associated symptoms such as irritability. Each symptom item is scored on a scale from 0 to 3, with higher scores denoting greater symptom severity.

Each node in the reward loop will be used as dependent variable in the regression analyses once, with the lagged preceding node as predictor. To control for autocorrelation, the lagged version of the dependent variable will be added as a covariate. Random intercepts and slopes will be added to allow participants to vary independently, leading to the following regression equations:\n\n-\tMotivation(t) = Positive Experiences(t) + Motivation(t-1) \n-\tEngagement in Activities(t) = Motivation(t-1) + Engagement in Activities(t-1)\n-\tPositive Experiences(t) = Engagement in Activities(t) + Positive Experiences(t-1)\n\nFurthermore, the last Motivation measurement of the day will not be allowed to predict the first Engagement in Activities of the day to prevent unequal timespacing. The model will be fitted using restricted maximum likelihood estimation, which can handle missing data well, and correlated random slopes and intercepts. As indication of the random effects the variance of both intercept and slope will be reported. Any nonconvergence of one of the regression analyses due to low levels of variation of the items will be interpreted as a sign of absent connection strength for that path, which will then be set to zero. Subsequently, we will average the three standardized pathway coefficients for each individual as a measure of reward loop strength, resulting in a single average standardized coefficient for each participant. \n\n(2) Reward loop strength &amp; depressive symptoms \nTo investigate the influence of reward loop strength on depressive symptoms over 6 months, we will perform a multilevel linear regression analysis with reward loop strength as predictor and depressive symptoms level over time as dependent variable.

The ZELF-i study is a pragmatic multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) with participants starting treatment for depressive symptoms aged between 18 and 65 years. Participants allocated to the Do-module engaged in 28 days of EMA (5 times per day) and received weekly personalized feedback on positive affect and activities. For more details on the ZELF-i study, see the protocol paper, available online: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-018-1847-z.", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Sampling and data collection procedures: See protocol paper (Bastiaansen et al., 2018). Participant inclusion was finished when at least 40 participants in each of the three conditions (Control, Do, Think) completed both the baseline (T0) and post-intervention measurement (T1), and, for the treatment arms, also completed the intervention (no drop-out). The total number of included participants is 161 (55 Do, 55 Think, 51 Control). In the current study, only the participants in the Do module (55 participants) will be used.", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "Not applicable for the current study", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "All EMA variables were measured at each timepoint, on visual analogue scales ranging from 'not/not at all' (0) to 'all the time/very much' (100). The order of all questions was fixed, for a detailed view of all questions and sequence, see table 1 in Bastiaansen et al., 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-018-1847-z). See Figure 1 for a schematic overview of the measured variables and indices. \n\nEngagement in activities is operationalized as activities or active behavior leading to rewarding experiences, either physically or psychologically. During each measurement, participants were asked for the previous three hours (retrospective) to respond to the statements \"I've been physically active\", \"I've been in pleasant company\" and \"I did what I wanted to\". For each person and each timepoint, the  average score of the three questions will be taken as an indication of amount of engagement in activities in the preceding timeslot. \n\nPositive Experiences reflects the amount of positive affect (PA) participants experience at the time of measurement (momentary). Participants entered responses to \u201cRight now, I feel...\u201d on emotional adjectives, balanced on the arousal dimension (high/low) of emotional experience. PA was measured with the adjectives cheerful, relaxed, satisfied, energetic, enthusiastic and calm (e.g. \u201cI feel cheerful\u201d). Similar to other studies in the field (see for example Brans, Koval, Verduyn, Lim, &amp; Kuppens, 2013; Hartmann et al., 2015; Verhagen, Simons, van Zelst, &amp; Delespaul, 2017) a single positive affect score will be calculated as the mean score of the six positive adjectives for each person at each measurement. \n\nFor Motivation participants were asked to think about the next three hours (prospective), or the next day in case of the last diary of the day. Participants responded to the statements \"I intend to undertake certain things\" and \"I'm looking forward to the next three hours/day\". The composite measure of motivation will be calculated as the average of the two items for each person at each measurement. \n\nDepression severity was measured with the total score of the 30-item self-report Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR) (Rush, Gullion, Basco, Jarrett, &amp; Trivedi, 1996) across 6 time points: at baseline, after 4 weeks of ESM and at 4 follow-up measurements at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months post-ESM. The IDS-SR includes all DSM-IV diagnostic criterion items for major depressive disorder, as well as commonly associated symptoms such as irritability. Each symptom item is scored on a scale from 0 to 3, with higher scores denoting greater symptom severity. The IDS-SR has good psychometric properties with high concurrent and internal validity (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .92) \n", "q17.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e68c1c44a60a5008abb3051", "file_name": "Figure 1.jpg", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/h5qta/files/osfstorage/5e68c1c44a60a5008abb3051", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e68c1c44a60a5008abb3051"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "aecfacebaa40acaecae0079c9f6b7beb3baffec6cd8c7a639a79588aa715673d"}}], "q18.question": " ", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "The analysis consist of two parts: the construction of the reward loops (1) and the repeated measures analysis on the course of depressive symptoms (2). All analyses will be performed using the lme4 package (Bates et al., 2015, p. 4) in R (R Core Team, 2019). p-values will be obtained using lmerTest (Kuznetsova et al., 2017).\n\n(1) Reward loops \nFirst, we investigate the overall reward loop structure for the whole sample by performing multilevel linear regression analyses, taking into account that the daily diary measurements (level 1) are nested within persons (level 2). Each node in the reward loop will be used as dependent variable in the regression analyses once, with the lagged preceding node as predictor. To control for autocorrelation, the lagged version of the dependent variable will be added as a covariate. Random intercepts and slopes will be added to allow participants to vary independently, leading to the following regression equations:\n\n-\tMotivation(t) = Positive Experiences(t) + Motivation(t-1) \n-\tEngagement in Activities(t) = Motivation(t-1) + Engagement in Activities(t-1)\n-\tPositive Experiences(t) = Engagement in Activities(t) + Positive Experiences(t-1)\n\nFurthermore, the last Motivation measurement of the day will not be allowed to predict the first Engagement in Activities of the day to prevent unequal timespacing. The model will be fitted using restricted maximum likelihood estimation, which can handle missing data well, and correlated random slopes and intercepts. As indication of the random effects the variance of both intercept and slope will be reported. Any nonconvergence of one of the regression analyses due to low levels of variation of the items will be interpreted as a sign of absent connection strength for that path, which will then be set to zero. Subsequently, we will average the three standardized pathway coefficients for each individual as a measure of reward loop strength, resulting in a single average standardized coefficient for each participant. \n\n(2) Reward loop strength &amp; depressive symptoms \nTo investigate the influence of reward loop strength on depressive symptoms over 6 months, we will perform a multilevel linear regression analysis with reward loop strength as predictor and depressive symptoms level over time as dependent variable. The model will again be fitted using restricted maximum likelihood estimation and correlated random slopes and intercepts. As indication of the random effects the variance of both intercept and slope will be reported.   \n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href":

One of the major concerns of the state is the prevalence of suicidal thoughts and attempts among sexual minority Utahns. In a previous project, we used the 2016 and 2017 datasets from Utah's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a large population-estimated sample, in order to report on the prevalence of suicidal/self-harming thoughts and the lifetime prevalence of suicidal attempts among LGB and Heterosexual Utahns. LGB adult Utahns, when compared to heterosexuals, were drastically more likely to report recent suicidal/self-harming thoughts (14.3% vs. 4.3%; X2(1) = 14,651.00, p &lt; .001; OR = 3.71 (95% CI [3.63, 3.80]) and lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts (36.6% vs. 7.0%; X2(1) = 172,602.82, p &lt; .001; OR = 7.66 (95% CI [7.57,7.74]). Of even greater concern, was that LGB Utahns were more than 12 times more likely to report multiple suicide attempts than heterosexual Utahns (26.5% vs. 2.8%; difference = 23.7%, 95% CI [18.24, 29.98]); X2(1) = 360.79, p &lt; .001, OR = 12.49 (95% CI [8.99, 17.35]). Thus, LGB Utahns may be nearly three times more likely to attempt suicide than other LGB adults in population samples (e.g., Hottes, et al., 2016). \n\nMoving beyond reporting on the prevalence, we now seek to explore potential predictors of suicidal/self-harming thoughts and suicide attempts among LGB and Heterosexual Utahns. Both the 2016 and 2018 Utah BRFSS datasets included items on adverse childhood experience (ACEs) and the respective suicide variables. As such we sought to answer and test the following research questions and hypotheses: \n\nResearch Questions:\n\nRQ1: What is the prevalence of ACEs, suicidal thoughts, and attempts among LGB and heterosexual Utahns?\nRQ2: Are certain types of ACEs (e.g., sexual abuse) stronger predictors of suicidal variables? \nRQ3: Is there a moderation effect of sexual orientation between ACEs and suicidal variables?\nRQ4: How might the dose effect of ACEs affect Utahns\u2019 suicidality by sexual orientation? \n\nHypotheses:\n\nH1: LGB participants are will report higher levels of total ACEs, sexual abuse, physical abuse, witnessing domestic violence, and troubled homes, than heterosexual participants. \nH1a: LGB participants will be more likely to report 7 or more ACEs, than heterosexual participants.\nH1b: Bisexual participants will be more likely to report total ACEs, sexual abuse, physical abuse, witnessing domestic violence, and troubled homes, than LG participants.\nH2: LGB participants will report higher prevalence lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts, than heterosexual participants.\nH2a: Bisexual participants will report higher prevalence lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts, than LG participants. \nH3: Total ACEs will predict frequency of recent (two weeks) suicidal/self-harming thoughts, above and beyond controls.\nH3a: There will be a dose effect with higher levels of ACES having a larger effect on frequency of recent (two weeks) suicidal/self-harming thoughts. \nH3b: Sexual abuse will predict frequency of recent (two weeks) suicidal/self-harming thoughts, above and beyond all other ACEs.\nH4: Total ACEs will predict any lifetime suicide attempt, above and beyond controls.\nH4a: Total ACEs will predict multiple lifetime suicide attempts, above and beyond controls.\n H4b: There will be a dose effect with higher levels of ACE having a larger effect on any lifetime suicide attempts.\nH4c: There will be a dose effect with higher levels of ACE having a larger effect on multiple  lifetime suicide attempts.\nH4d: Sexual abuse will predict lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts, above and beyond all other ACEs.\nH5: Sexual orientation will moderate the relationship between total ACEs frequency of recent (two weeks) suicidal/self-harming thoughts, any suicide attempt, and multiple lifetime suicide attempts.\nH5a: Sexual orientation will also moderate the dosing effect between higher levels of ACEs and recent (two weeks) suicidal/self-harming thoughts, any suicide attempt, and multiple lifetime suicide attempts.\n\nAnalytical plan:\n\nPreliminary\n- Weighting variable\n- Create the dichotomous variables \n- Basic descriptives (pre/post weighting and imputations) \n- Frequency, distributions, missingness (missing completely random), Mean, SD, etc. \n- Choose a plan for missingness (e.g., multiple imputations, MLM, FIML). \n\nInferential\n- T Test/Mann Whitney U. \n- Chi-squared\n- Regression\n- Logistic, count, interaction terms. \n\n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"summary": "This preregistration contains a brief description of what we will be examining, our research questions, hypotheses, and a basic outline of our analytical plan. \n\nDescription of the study: In the state of Utah there is a growing conversation about suicide and suicide prevention.

as-of-yet unpublished experiment conducted by Schwensfeier, Kandemir, and Nieuwenstein. In this unpublished experiment, we examined how memory for an image of an object (T1) is affected when it is followed within 300 or 1000 ms by an image depicting either negative or neutral contents (T2). To ensure the processing of the emotional or neutral contents of T2, participants performed a speeded 2-alternative forced choice task (2-AFC) requiring a judgment of whether the contents of T2 were negative or neutral. The results showed that a neutral T2 interfered with memory for T1 when it was shown at a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of 300 ms, but not when it was shown at an SOA of 1000 ms, thus replicating earlier findings showing that the process of consolidating a stimulus into working memory can be disrupted by a speeded 2-AFC task (Nieuwenstein &amp; Wyble, 2014; see also, Kandemir, Aky\u00fcrek, &amp; Nieuwenstein, 2017). Interestingly, a different pattern was found for negative T2 images: Compared to neutral T2s, negative T2s interfered equally with memory for T1 at the SOA of 300 ms, but they differed in also producing significant interference at an SOA of 1000 ms. This finding suggests that negative emotional images not only disrupt consolidation but also maintenance of information in working memory. The primary aim of the study preregistered in this report is to test the replicability of this finding.
