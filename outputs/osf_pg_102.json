High-skilled migrants may believe that developed countries have greater responsibilities to offer work opportunities to migrants, but do not have a responsibility to provide welfare benefits.", "q17": "We plan to ask a battery of observational questions examining migrants' views on the ethics of illegal migration and various types of migration restrictions; we also plan to ask many of the same questions to a sample in the United States.

Several studies have shown that increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, decreased number of lymphocytes especially CD8+ cells, decrease neutrophil and platelet counts were associated with more severe pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and in COVID-19. However, little is known about the exact mechanism and the clinical importance of these laboratory changes. In this meta-analysis, we aim to explore the significance of changes in the hematological parameters of patients and assessed the correlation between clinical laboratory data and the severity of COVID-19 in adult patients.

Condition or domain being studied: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common symptomatic, inflammatory and immunological disorder of nasal mucosa results from allergen exposure triggered IgE response. Epidemiology of allergic rhinitis varies according to different factors like genetic constitution, racial differences, socio-economic conditions, chances of exposure to different allergens, sex, growth stages. AR shows high prevalence among developed countries. AR is managed with first and second anti histamines (56%), intra nasal corticosteroids (25%) and mast cell stabilizers (19%). Prolonged usage of these medications is necessary in beating the disease as far as the recurrence is concerned. This may lead to numerous serious health hazards. Studies have shown that negative effects of sedative anti-histamines last to the succeeding day disturbing the day time performance. Therefore, research on it is needed.\n\n6.Participants/population: Participants with all types of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis) regardless of gender, age, etiology, ethnic group, severity, diagnosed with specific criteria (i.e. mention any one of criteria for diagnosis of allergic rhinitis) are eligible for inclusion.

Studies have shown that negative effects of sedative anti-histamines last to the succeeding day disturbing the day time performance. Acupuncture in the treatment of allergic rhinitis has done a lot of research, the effect is significant. Therefore, research on it is needed.\n\n6.Participants/population: Participants with all types of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis) regardless of gender, age, etiology, ethnic group, severity, diagnosed with specific criteria (i.e. mention any one of criteria for diagnosis of allergic rhinitis) are eligible for inclusion. Complicated with asthma, nasosinusitis are excluded.\n\n7. Intervention(s), exposure(s): Treatment of acupuncture.\n\n8. Comparator(s)/control: Including sham acupuncture, western medicines, blank control, placebo control and other interventions. Interventions in the experimental group were not included.\n\n9. Types of study to be included: We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published and unpublished, in English and Chinese.\n\n10.

Data extraction (selection and coding): Three reviewers searched the online databases listed above and recorded the titles and abstracts of all the articles.\nThree evaluators assessed the eligibility of these articles and made decisions on every research (inclusion or exclusion) independently.

Six elements will be assessed: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, free of selective reporting, and other bias. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion with a third party.\n\n14. Strategy for data synthesis: Statistical analyses will be performed using RevMan 5.3 software (The Cochrane Collaboration).\n- Pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of dichotomous outcomes will be used to report effect estimate.\n- Continuous data will be presented as mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. If different measurement scales are used, standardized mean difference (SMD) will be performed to analyze continuous data.\nIf required data are not reported, we will try to obtain data from corresponding author.\nHeterogeneity will be assessed using both the \u03c7\u00b2 test and the I\u00b2 statistic, and we will consider an I\u00b2 value greater than 50% indicative of substantial heterogeneity.\n- For I\u00b2&lt;50%, a fixed-effect model is used.\n- For I\u00b2 &gt;=50%, a random-effect model is applied.\nIf data permit, we plan to exclude some trials that contribuite most to the heterogeneity to see whether the result change or not.\nWe will also use a summary of findings table to present the main findings using GRADEpro software (The Cochrane Collaboration). Funnel plots will be generated to detect publication bias if more than 10 trials are identified to report the same outcomes. If appropriate, we will use cumulative meta-analyses. Results of meta-analyses will be visualized by forest plots. In addition, we will conduct trial sequential analysis to evaluate the meta-analyses for primary outcomes, which can reveal the required information size and potentially false results in a meta-analysis. Intention-to-treat analysis will be applied for primary outcome, if missing data from the original trials are available.\n\n15. Analysis of subgroups or subsets: If data permitted, we plan to conduct subgroup analyses for different groups, including:\nDifferent age of patients\nDifferent severity of disease\nDifferent regimen applied\nDifferent treat time\nDifferent acupoints selected\nCombined with other interventions or not.\n\n16. Type and method of review: intervention; Meta-analysis; Prevention; Systematic review.\n\n17. Health area of the review: Complementary therapies; Allergy; Public health; ENT; \n\n18.

Condition or domain being studied: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common symptomatic, inflammatory and immunological disorder of nasal mucosa results from allergen exposure triggered IgE response. Epidemiology of allergic rhinitis varies according to different factors like genetic constitution, racial differences, socio-economic conditions, chances of exposure to different allergens, sex, growth stages. AR shows high prevalence among developed countries. AR is managed with first and second anti histamines (56%), intra nasal corticosteroids (25%) and mast cell stabilizers (19%). Prolonged usage of these medications is necessary in beating the disease as far as the recurrence is concerned. This may lead to numerous serious health hazards. Studies have shown that negative effects of sedative anti-histamines last to the succeeding day disturbing the day time performance. Acupuncture in the treatment of allergic rhinitis has done a lot of research, the effect is significant. Therefore, research on it is needed.\n\n6.Participants/population: Participants with all types of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis) regardless of gender, age, etiology, ethnic group, severity, diagnosed with specific criteria (i.e. mention any one of criteria for diagnosis of allergic rhinitis) are eligible for inclusion.

Condition or domain being studied: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common symptomatic, inflammatory and immunological disorder of nasal mucosa results from allergen exposure triggered IgE response. Epidemiology of allergic rhinitis varies according to different factors like genetic constitution, racial differences, socio-economic conditions, chances of exposure to different allergens, sex, growth stages. AR shows high prevalence among developed countries. AR is managed with first and second anti histamines (56%), intra nasal corticosteroids (25%) and mast cell stabilizers (19%). Prolonged usage of these medications is necessary in beating the disease as far as the recurrence is concerned. This may lead to numerous serious health hazards. Studies have shown that negative effects of sedative anti-histamines last to the succeeding day disturbing the day time performance. Traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of allergic rhinitis has done a lot of research, the effect is significant. There are no SR or protocol on acupoint catgut embedding for allergic rhinitis. Therefore, research on it is needed.\n\n6.Participants/population: Participants with all types of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis) regardless of gender, age, etiology, ethnic group, severity, diagnosed with specific criteria (i.e. mention any one of criteria for diagnosis of allergic rhinitis) are eligible for inclusion.

If different measurement scales are used, standardized mean difference (SMD) will be performed to analyze continuous data.\nIf required data are not reported, we will try to obtain data from corresponding author.\nHeterogeneity will be assessed using both the \u03c7\u00b2 test and the I\u00b2 statistic, and we will consider an I\u00b2 value greater than 50% indicative of substantial heterogeneity.\n- For I\u00b2&lt;50%, a fixed-effect model is used.\n- For I\u00b2 &gt;=50%, a random-effect model is applied.\nIf data permit, we plan to exclude some trials that contribuite most to the heterogeneity to see whether the result change or not.\nWe will also use a summary of findings table to present the main findings using GRADEpro software (The Cochrane Collaboration). Funnel plots will be generated to detect publication bias if more than 10 trials are identified to report the same outcomes. If appropriate, we will use cumulative meta-analyses. Results of meta-analyses will be visualized by forest plots.
