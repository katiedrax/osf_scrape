Previous research showed that basal perceptual processes such as stimulus organization are at work in interoception: When comparing somatic stimuli in a breathing paradigm, type of categorization (arbitrary vs. continuous categorical organization) influenced magnitude estimations as well as breathing behavior in healthy participants (Petersen, Schroijen, M\u00f6lders, Zenker, &amp; Van den Bergh, 2014). Specifically, different breathing resistance loads were perceived as more similar within than between categories. In addition, self-reported number and frequency of somatic symptoms were associated with an overestimation of stimulus intensities at category borders (Petersen, Van Staeyen, Vogele, von Leupoldt, &amp; Van den Bergh, 2015). Next to arbitrary categories, previous research showed that interoceptive perceptions are also influenced by contextual information. For example, Bogaerts et al. (2008) found lower interoceptive accuracy of breathing sensations in high symptom reporters in a symptom-related, but not in a neutral context. \n\nThe predictive coding theory of symptom perception assumes that symptom predictions influence body perception (Van den Bergh, Witth\u00f6ft, Petersen, &amp; Brown, 2017). Arbitrary and continual categories might influence such predictions and thereby change perceptions. This in turn may help explain the development and maintenance of somatic symptom disorders. \n\nThe present study was designed to 1) replicate findings of a basic categorization effects on the classification of breathing sensations (Petersen et al., 2014), 2) examine whether meaningful labels (categories \u201csensations\u201d and \u201csymptoms\u201d) produce stronger categorization effects than arbitrary labels (categories \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d), and 3) relate potential categorization effects to psychopathological measures such as symptom reporting and illness

The acquisition trajectory to the maximal interpretation that adults exhibit, however, is still poorly understood.\n\nAnother possible cause of non-maximal interpretation is children\u2019s non-adult-like domain restriction (DR), which enables the existential readings of PDD. It is possible that, while children do assign maximal interpretations to PDDs, they appear to treat them existentially because they restrict the domain of reference to a subset of items.

Thus, children\u2019s performance of interpreting negative PDDs in Tieu et al.\u2019s study is likely to be confounded with the mention effect.\n\nFurthermore, Schwartz (2012) argues that while the maximal interpretation is the default for PDDs, adult English speakers could also interpret PDDs non-maximally when a restricted domain is applied.

We consider two possibilities regarding their non-maximal interpretation of PDDs: Either they are yet to develop the concept of maximality associated with PDDs, or they are aware of the maximality requirement of PDDs but their interpretation is more amenable to DR than in adults.\n\nThe former indicates that children\u2019s interpretation of PDDs is on a par with that of indefinite plurals (e.g. \u201cSome hearts are red.\u201d). Alternatively, if the pattern of interpretation of definite and indefinite plurals differ, either linguistically and contextually mediated DR should be at play in making the non-maximal interpretation of PDDs possible.\n\nThe next question is concerned with the nature of DR. An important distinction between linguistically and contextually mediated DR is that the former does not require that maximality holds among associated objects, while the latter does, in an alternative domain that does not encompass all of the objects in the display.\n\nHence, if children are sensitive only to the linguistically mediated DR, they are likely to accept any situations where the existential readings of PDD are possible. If, on the other hand, their interpretation of PDDs is subject to contextual factors (just like adults are), the non-maximal interpretation should be readily induced in situations where the associated objects are visually contiguous.\n\nAnother question to be addressed in this study is how DR explains different patterns of interpretation of PDDs among adults and children. Given the hypothesis that children\u2019s notion of maximality tied to PDDs is unstable, children should be more sensitive to contextual DR effects than adults. Therefore, manipulating the contextual information should affect children to a greater extent than adults. Furthermore, it is also likely that a difference is observed among children depending on age groups. The younger they are, the more vulnerable (or even absent) their notion of maximality is, and thus their interpretation of PDDs is comparable to that of indefinite plurals. As they age, however, the notion of maximality becomes stronger, but their interpretation of PDDs should still be non-adult-like as it is highly subject to the contextually-driven DR."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

We consider two possibilities regarding their non-maximal interpretation of PDDs: Either they are yet to develop the concept of maximality associated with PDDs, or they are aware of the maximality requirement of PDDs but their interpretation is more amenable to DR than in adults.\n\nThe former indicates that children\u2019s interpretation of PDDs is on a par with that of indefinite plurals (e.g. \u201cSome hearts are red.\u201d). Alternatively, if the pattern of interpretation of definite and indefinite plurals differ, either linguistically and contextually mediated DR should be at play in making the non-maximal interpretation of PDDs possible.\n\nThe next question is concerned with the nature of DR. An important distinction between linguistically and contextually mediated DR is that the former does not require that maximality holds among associated objects, while the latter does, in an alternative domain that does not encompass all of the objects in the display.\n\nHence, if children are sensitive only to the linguistically mediated DR, they are likely to accept any situations where the existential readings of PDD are possible. If, on the other hand, their interpretation of PDDs is subject to contextual factors (just like adults are), the non-maximal interpretation should be readily induced in situations where the associated objects are visually contiguous.\n\nAnother question to be addressed in this study is how DR explains different patterns of interpretation of PDDs among adults and children. Given the hypothesis that children\u2019s notion of maximality tied to PDDs is unstable, children should be more sensitive to contextual DR effects than adults. Therefore, manipulating the contextual information should affect children to a greater extent than adults. Furthermore, it is also likely that a difference is observed among children depending on age groups. The younger they are, the more vulnerable (or even absent) their notion of maximality is, and thus their interpretation of PDDs is comparable to that of indefinite plurals. As they age, however, the notion of maximality becomes stronger, but their interpretation of PDDs should still be non-adult-like as it is highly subject to the contextually-driven DR.", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

One reason for conducting the pilot study online is to replicate the study by Schwartz (2012), who reports the possibility of non-maximal interpretation of PDDs among adults. However, because of the communicative nature of the present study (i.e. listening to the puppet and giving them a reward), we would like to shift to testing subjects in a laboratory setting. Therefore, while the results of the online and on-site experiments should be comparable if Schwartz\u2019s study is replicated, they will be analyzed for any unexpected differences.", "q25": "", "q8.question": "We have a within-subject design where each subject is exposed to trials with different sentence types and object types.\n\nFor each trial, the subject sees a group of objects in one of the four types: All target objects, mixed objects (with the target objects clustered together), mixed objects (with the target objects split), and no target object. The visual stimulus is accompanied by a sentence with either a universal quantifier (e.g. \u201cAll of the animals are lions\u201d), an indefinite existential quantifier (e.g. \u201cSome of the animals are lions\u201d), or a PDD (\u201cThe animals are lions\u201d). Sentences with universal and indefinite existential quantifiers are treated as controls, as adults and children have been shown to behave similarly in interpreting them.\n\nThe order of trials is pseudo-randomized, resulting in 2 experimental orders. Subjects are equally assigned to each order.", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "We will start collecting data from adult controls first, to test whether we replicate the contextual manipulation effect observed in Schwartz (2012) using child-friendly stimuli. Data collection from children is thus contingent on a successful replication of the contextual effect among adults, with our experimental paradigm or, if necessarily, with Schwartz\u2019s original stimuli. \n\nAdult subjects will be recruited for the online pilot and the on-site experiment. The pilot will be conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), a crowdsourcing platform where workers get compensated ($1.20) for completing the task. Adult subjects for the on-site experiment consist of University of California, San Diego undergraduate students participating for course credit. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we might keep using AMT for testing adults in lieu of on-site experiment.\n\nChild participants will be typically developing native, fluent, English speaking children between the ages of 4;0 and 7;0. Participants will be recruited from databases of interested families, at sites throughout the community, through their preschools, or through other events in the greater San Diego area. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, children may also be recruited and tested online.\n\nWe will first focus on recruiting child subjects from a restricted age range (4;6 to 6;6), as we predict that the effect of contextual manipulations on the interpretation of PDDs will be particularly prominent among children from this age range.\n  \nAfter getting enough subjects from the restricted age range, we will qualitatively examine the results from the oldest and youngest subjects. If the performance of the oldest subjects is almost adult-like, we will not collect data from subjects aged 6;6-7;0, as their performance is predicted to be almost adult-like as well and thus not particularly informative. Likewise, if the youngest subjects from the restricted age range exhibit no notion of maximality, subjects aged 4;0-4;6 are likely to perform similarly, and thus we will not collect data from them either. \n\nFor adult subjects, because some of them will be tested online, we will use exclusion criteria to ensure data quality, following norms of online testing: American IP address, and self-reporting English as their only native language.\n\nIn addition, we will base exclusion on control trials (i.e. trials with some and all sentence types) where judgments should be unanimous. There are 8 such trials, and any participant who provides the incorrect answer for at least 6 of them will be excluded from analysis. For child subjects, we will not exclude any data unless they fail the training trials (see Section 17 for details) or they fail to complete the experiment.", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Forced choice task: Subjects will be presented with two characters, and the experimenter will tell them that one character is very smart and \u201calways says things that are just right,\u201d and the other character \u201calways says things that are silly or not true\u201d. On each trial, subjects see the objects, hear a sentence starting with \u201cSomebody says... (e.g. the animals are lions),\u201d and they are asked which character has said the sentence. As a response, they choose between the smart and silly characters.\n\nCrucially, which character subjects choose in the mixed object trials in response to a sentence with PDD will determine if they interpret PDDs maximally or non-maximally. Because the smart character should always produce a sentence that correctly captures the state of objects, choosing the character indicates that subjects have made the non-maximal interpretation of PDD. In contrast, if they prefer the maximal interpretation for PDDs, they should choose the silly character as the speaker in such trials.", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Raw responses (choice between the blindfolded and seeing characters) will be coded as maximal (1) or non-maximal (0) for critical trials, and correct (1) or incorrect (0) for controls.\n \nWe will construct a binomial mixed effects regression model predicting binary responses (correct/maximal vs. incorrect/non-maximal) as a function of Sentence Type (all/some/PDD), Object Type (all targets/mixed targets (clustered)/mixed targets (split)/no target) and Age (1-year bins for children and adults as a whole): Correct/maximal (1/0) ~ Sentence Type + Object Type +  Age + (1|Subject).\n\nFirst of all, we will predict the pattern of responses between adults and children in critical and control trials (i.e. trials with PDDs vs. all or some): Correct/maximal (1/0) ~ Sentence Type*Age + Object Type + (1|Subject).\n\nBased on results from previous studies , there should be an interaction effect between Sentence Type and Age on the pattern of responses. This interaction would indicate that there is no difference among adults and children for controls, but that there is one for critical trials. The difference between critical and control trials will also be explored via Wilcoxon non-parametric test.\n\nOne exception where adults and children may perform differently in a control is where a sentence with some is presented with the all-target object type. Because the sentence does not conform to the so-called \u2018some-but-not-all\u2019 scalar implicature, adults should judge the sentence as false (i.e. choose the silly character). In contrast, it is widely attested that children fail to compute the scalar implicature, and thus they are likely to accept the sentence in such a setting (i.e. choose the smart character).\n\nWe will then focus on the performance in the critical trials where target objects are mixed with non-target objects. Proportion of non-maximal responses (i.e. choosing the smart character in such trials) will be predicted from Age, and the effect of Age will be interpreted as evidence that children are more likely to interpret PDDs non-maximally relative to adults. \nThe contextual effect on the interpretation of PDDs will be examined by comparing the proportion of non-maximal responses between the two mixed object types (clustered vs. split): Maximal (1/0) ~ Object Type*Age + Sentence Type + (1|Subject).\n\nIf the visual contiguity of target objects triggers the non-maximal interpretation (in line with Schwartz 2012), there should be the main effect of Object Type.\n\nIf children are more prone to the contextual manipulation than adults, which is the primary hypothesis of this study, there should be an interaction between Age and Object Type such that children\u2019s non-maximal responses increase for the clustered object type to a greater extent than those of adults.", "q19.uploader": []},
