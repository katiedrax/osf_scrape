related to physical and mental health (Chekroud et al., 2018; Curtis et al., 2017; Schuch et al., 2016) as well as to happiness and well-being (Zhang &amp; Chen, 2019). Various mechanisms are assumed to mediate this association, ranging from biological explanations to social integration theories (e.g., Netz, Wu, Becker, &amp; Tenenbaum, 2005). In our study, we propose that another mechanism \u2013 person-environment fit (here: how well an athlete fits into the specific characteristics of the environment of her/his sport) \u2013 might explain the association between sport and well-being. \nPerson-environment fit refers to the congruence between characteristics of an individual (e.g., personality traits) and characteristics of the environment (e.g., job demands; Kristof-Brown &amp; Guay, 2011). In organizational contexts, a fit between an employee\u2019s personality traits or abilities and job demands has been found to be associated with higher job satisfaction and well-being (Hardin &amp; Donaldson III, 2014). In the context of sports, the interplay between a person and environmental factors has so far been insufficiently investigated (Allen &amp; Laborde, 2014). However, it has been found that personality traits, especially the Big Five, differ on average in meaningful ways between athletes of different types of sports (Allen, Greenlees, &amp; Jones, 2011). Thus, supplemental fit, defined as having a personality trait profile resembling that of other people surrounding in a given context (Furr, 2008; Muchinsky &amp; Monahan, 1987), could be a potential mechanism driving the feeling of belonging in the context of sport (Allen &amp; Laborde, 2014). Investigating similarity fit or fit in general can be done in either a variable-oriented or a profile-oriented way. In the present study, we will focus on a variable-oriented approach.

If the correlation coefficient is &gt; .7, the two scales will be combined into the scale \u201cmood\u201d.

The analyses will be performed using the R package RSA (Sch\u00f6nbrodt &amp; Humberg, 2018) as well as additional functions considering the multilevel structure by Nestler and colleagues (2019). Polynomial regressions and response surface analyses will be conducted across all 103 sports and both genders for each pair of the Big Five domains (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism) and for all outcomes (sport satisfaction, life satisfaction, mood OR positive affect &amp; negative affect) separately, resulting in either 15 or 20 different (depending whether we combine the mood scale or calculate results for positive and negative affect separately)  fit analyses and RSA graphs (for an example, see Figure 1). \nWhenever possible, random slope models will be estimated. If more than 10% of the random slopes models do not converge (either 1 or 2 models), we will instead estimate random intercept models for all planned analyses.

Thus, this systemic review and meta-analysis of RCTs aimed to clarify the effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks in preventing acute respiratory infection.", "uploader": [{"file_id": "5e4cdc711949df010c564cfc", "file_name": "Systematic Scoping Review Protocol.docx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/evrxn/files/osfstorage/5e4cdc711949df010c564cfc", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e4cdc711949df010c564cfc"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "00ddd4d5081a6679934876e5e03b84110bda3b0eb60345f192d404ee90a2c962"}}]}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=evrxn", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "evrxn", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "evrxn", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/abh4w/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "abh4w", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kz52j/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "kz52j", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/evrxn/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/evrxn/"}}], "links": {"first": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json", "last": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "prev": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=276", "next": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=278", "meta": {"total": 5469, "per_page": 10}}}
