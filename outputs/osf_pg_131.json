Banissy, Alice Gregory, Natalie Bowling, Aikaterini Vafeiadou"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "The following predictions will be examined in a UK adult sample, who do not report experience of long-term health conditions or impairments. \n\nPrevious literature indicates that pleasant touch such as that experienced during sex and massage influences subjective sleep quality (Dittami et al., 2007, Owais et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2020). Interestingly, Pallesen et al. (2020) found gender differences in this association between sexual activity and sleep with men reporting different effects of sex on sleep depending on whether they reached orgasm or not, while this was not true for women. The relationship between sleep and other types of touch is less widely researched. However, cuddling and affective caressing have been found to have calming effects (van Anders et al., 2012; Triscoli, Croy, Olausson &amp; Sailer, 2017) and young people in romantic relationships prefer to sleep in positions where they touch one another (Junker, Bergel, Deresko, Freund &amp; Schredl, 2016). Furthermore, wider evidence indicates that bed sharing itself affects sleep quality (e.g. Troxel, Robles, Hall, Buysse, 2007; Troxel, 2010; Richter, Adam, Geiss, Peter &amp; Niklewski; 2016). The broader literature has also shown that attitudes to and experiences of touch and sleep vary depending on individual differences, such as age (Sehlstedt et al., 2016), sexual preference (Chen &amp; Shiu, 2017) gender (Trotter, McGlone, Reniers &amp; Deakin, 2018), cultural background (e.g. Dibiase &amp; Gunnoe, 2004) and attachment style (Adams, Stoops, Skomro, 2014; Adams &amp; McWilliams, 2015; Krah\u00e9 et al., 2018). Based on the previous literature around touch and sleep, several hypotheses are made:\n\nHypothesis 1.: We expect that bed sharing with touch will be reported to influence sleep quality, with mainly positive effects reported for six different types of touch that are investigated (see below for details) relative to negative and neutral effects of bed sharing without touch on subjective sleep quality.\nHypothesis 2.: We expect that respondents who experience more frequent touch in their everyday life will report differences in their subjective quality of sleep compared with those who experience less frequent touch.\nHypothesis 3.: We predict that respondents who report touch at bedtime in their childhood (measured by item 3 of the Touch Test TEAQ) will report better sleep quality as adults compared to those who do not report touch at bedtime in their childhood.\nHypothesis 4. (exploratory): We expect that the impact of touch on sleep quality may also be influenced by the following factors: age, gender, sexual preference, ethnicity and attachment (based on known differences in these groups related to touch and sleep in isolation).  \n\nNote that for this study Sleep Quality is measured via responses to the following items: \n\n1. \"How would you rate your sleep quality for the majority of nights during the past month?\"(hereafter called Overall Sleep Quality)\n2. \"During the majority of the days and nights in the past month how many hours of actual sleep did you get at night? This may be different to the number of hours you spent in bed.\" (hereafter called Sleep Duration)\n3. \"Thinking about a typical night in the last month... How long does it take you to fall asleep?\" (hereafter called Sleep Latency)\n4. \"If you then wake up during the night, how long are you awake in total (add up all the time when you are awake)?\" (hereafter called Night Awakening)\n5. \"How many times did you wake up between the time you first fell asleep and your final awakening?\" (hereafter called Times Awake)\n \n"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

Judgments of how different types of touch and bedsharing without touch are related to sleep quality (hereafter called Touch-Sleep Measure). Judgments are collected by asking participants to group touch/bedsharing descriptions to one of three possible answers. The three answer possibilities are: \n- \u201cI think that it would have a negative effect on my sleep quality\u201d\n- \u201cI think that it would have no effect on my sleep quality\u201d \n- \u201cI think that it would have a positive effect on my sleep quality\u201d. \nTouch and bedsharing descriptors are: \n- A gentle stroke by your partner\n- A short good-night hug from your partner\n- A massage from your partner\n- Intimate touch from your partner\n- Preparing to sleep in a position in which you and your partner are touching one another\n- Preparing to sleep in a position in which you are your partner are not touching one another\n\nTouch and other scale measurement:\n\n1. Anxiety and Avoidance in adult attachment. They are measured by a 12-item version of the Experiences in Close Relationships Questionnaire (ECR-12; Lafontaine et al., 2015).\n2. Two items to measure current touch (hereafter called Current Touch):\n \u201cWhen was the last time that somebody touched you intentionally, not including formal gestures such as handshakes in meetings?\u201d.

Banissy, Alice Gregory, Natalie Bowling, Aikaterini Vafeiadou", "q2": "The following predictions will be examined in a UK adult sample, who do not report experience of long-term health conditions or impairments. \n\nPrevious literature indicates that pleasant touch such as that experienced during sex and massage influences subjective sleep quality (Dittami et al., 2007, Owais et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2020). Interestingly, Pallesen et al. (2020) found gender differences in this association between sexual activity and sleep with men reporting different effects of sex on sleep depending on whether they reached orgasm or not, while this was not true for women. The relationship between sleep and other types of touch is less widely researched. However, cuddling and affective caressing have been found to have calming effects (van Anders et al., 2012; Triscoli, Croy, Olausson &amp; Sailer, 2017) and young people in romantic relationships prefer to sleep in positions where they touch one another (Junker, Bergel, Deresko, Freund &amp; Schredl, 2016). Furthermore, wider evidence indicates that bed sharing itself affects sleep quality (e.g. Troxel, Robles, Hall, Buysse, 2007; Troxel, 2010; Richter, Adam, Geiss, Peter &amp; Niklewski; 2016). The broader literature has also shown that attitudes to and experiences of touch and sleep vary depending on individual differences, such as age (Sehlstedt et al., 2016), sexual preference (Chen &amp; Shiu, 2017) gender (Trotter, McGlone, Reniers &amp; Deakin, 2018), cultural background (e.g. Dibiase &amp; Gunnoe, 2004) and attachment style (Adams, Stoops, Skomro, 2014; Adams &amp; McWilliams, 2015; Krah\u00e9 et al., 2018). Based on the previous literature around touch and sleep, several hypotheses are made:\n\nHypothesis 1.: We expect that bed sharing with touch will be reported to influence sleep quality, with mainly positive effects reported for six different types of touch that are investigated (see below for details) relative to negative and neutral effects of bed sharing without touch on subjective sleep quality.\nHypothesis 2.: We expect that respondents who experience more frequent touch in their everyday life will report differences in their subjective quality of sleep compared with those who experience less frequent touch.\nHypothesis 3.: We predict that respondents who report touch at bedtime in their childhood (measured by item 3 of the Touch Test TEAQ) will report better sleep quality as adults compared to those who do not report touch at bedtime in their childhood.\nHypothesis 4. (exploratory): We expect that the impact of touch on sleep quality may also be influenced by the following factors: age, gender, sexual preference, ethnicity and attachment (based on known differences in these groups related to touch and sleep in isolation).  \n\nNote that for this study Sleep Quality is measured via responses to the following items: \n\n1. \"How would you rate your sleep quality for the majority of nights during the past month?\"(hereafter called Overall Sleep Quality)\n2. \"During the majority of the days and nights in the past month how many hours of actual sleep did you get at night? This may be different to the number of hours you spent in bed.\" (hereafter called Sleep Duration)\n3. \"Thinking about a typical night in the last month... How long does it take you to fall asleep?\" (hereafter called Sleep Latency)\n4. \"If you then wake up during the night, how long are you awake in total (add up all the time when you are awake)?\" (hereafter called Night Awakening)\n5. \"How many times did you wake up between the time you first fell asleep and your final awakening?\" (hereafter called Times Awake)\n \n", "q3": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.
