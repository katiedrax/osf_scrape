Our version of the game consists of three rounds that vary in the level of uncertainty about the buyer\u2019s WTP. In each of these rounds, 3 sellers start out with a lottery ticket that they can sell to a buyer for valuable coins (each coin is worth 1 eurocent, and will be paid out in real money at the end of the experimental session). In each round the sellers have to indicate how many coins they are minimally willing to accept for their lottery ticket (WTA). If the 3 WTAs together are lower than the amount the buyer is maximally willing to pay (WTP), the three sellers will sell their lottery tickets for the amount they asked. The buyer\u2019s WTP is randomly determined by the computer, and is either certain (i.e., 200 coins = \u20ac2), slightly uncertain (150 to 250 coins = \u20ac1.50 to \u20ac2.50), or highly uncertain (100 to 300 coins = \u20ac1 to \u20ac3). If the WTAs together exceed the buyer\u2019s WTP, the sellers will keep their lottery tickets. With these tickets they can participate in a lottery, that is held at the end of the experimental session. Each lottery ticket has a 1 in 36 chance of yielding a prize of 20 euros. So, lottery tickets are valuable, with an expected profit of 20/36 = \u20ac0.55 per lottery ticket.

That is, upon hearing a \u201cround\u201d vs \u201c\u2018sharp\u201d sounding pseudoword, will they associate it with a round/ edgy shape? Research with human adults and children shows that they form these associations and that it may support language learning.\n\nPrevious work with great apes found no evidence for sound symbolism (Margiotoudi et al., 2019). Here we follow up on these results by testing a language trained great ape: the bonobo Kanzi. Kanzi is able to match hundreds of spoken english words to pictures that depict objects in a matching to sample task.\n\nIn the study of Margiotoudi and colleagues it was unclear whether great apes paid attention to the sound cues at all. By embedding sound symbolic probe trials in a familiar crossmodal matching to sample task, we will make sure that Kanzi is a) paying attention to the sound cue and b) is actively trying to link it to a picture. \n", "study_type": "Experiment"}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=dy3ew", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "dy3ew", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "dy3ew", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/5cu7a/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5cu7a", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dwrhb/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "dwrhb", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5d2d2268d28338002c2432d2/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5d2d2268d28338002c2432d2", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/dy3ew/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dy3ew/"}}, {"id": "ayb23", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Effectiveness of needle interventions for lateral elbow tendinopathy.

We are measuring support in terms of a) negative affective response to target, b) positive affective response to target, c) liking for target, d) belief that target\u2019s attribution for rejection harms the ingroup, e) agreement with target\u2019s attribution for the rejection, f) perceptions that the target experienced discrimination, and g) perceptions that the target was harmed by the rejection. For negative affect and harms ingroup, lower scores = greater support. For all other variables, higher scores = greater support.\n\nBased on SCT and previous research (e.g., Garcia et al., 2005; 2010), we are predicting interactions for all the above variables with support being higher when self-categorization and target attribution are congruent (i.e., self-categorization and personal performance or group-categorization and discrimination) rather than incongruent (i.e., self-categorization and discrimination or group-categorization and personal performance). We also expect that perceived discrimination and harm to target will reveal two main effects. We expect that both perceived discrimination and harm to target will be higher in discrimination than person responsibility condition and higher in group-categorization than individual condition.\n\nIn addition to the above hypotheses, we predict that the conditional effects of perceptions of the target (negative affect, positive affect, and liking) will occur indirectly through evaluations of the target\u2019s attribution (harm to ingroup and agreement with attribution) and perceptions of the job decision (perceived discrimination). We expect that harm to ingroup will be higher in incongruent than congruent conditions, which will be associated with decreased liking and positive affect and increased negative affect.

The inclusion of the BFI is to provide some \u201cwork\u201d for participants to do; after all, people who are highly motivated to learn about self-esteem should be willing to answer some self-esteem irrelevant items to get to the self-esteem feedback that they desire.

Because we are running the present study in February, there is a good chance that less people will be interested in doing any studies, decreasing our effective sample size.", "analyses": "We will conduct two simple t-tests, which examine whether advertising condition (cash award vs. self-esteem feedback) is associated with a difference in the average SEIS-Positive and/or SEIS-Negative scores of people who complete the study.\nWe hypothesize that SEIS-Positive and \u2013Negative scores will each be higher in the self-esteem feedback condition relative to the cash award condition.\nWe will also attempt to control for possible differences in simple trait self-esteem when looking at this difference in a regression framework. That is,\nCondition (contrast-coded) + trait self-esteem --&gt; self-esteem importance (positive)\nAnd\nCondition (contrast-coded) + trait self-esteem --&gt; self-esteem importance (negative)\n", "outliers": "We will only retain scores from participants who complete the ENTIRE survey in each given condition, since our interest is in the completion of a study for a given reward, not initial attraction.", "dependent": "The main DV is continuous scores on our two scales: the scale of self-esteem importance (positive) and the scale of self-esteem importance (negative).", "conditions": "All possible participants will be assigned to one of two conditions, in which they are invited to participate in a study in exchange only for personality (self-esteem) feedback, OR for a cash award. They will be given two weeks to complete the survey after the invitation is sent out, to help avoid the risk that some participants may not complete the survey due to irrelevant reasons (e.g. if we ran the survey for only a couple of days, participants might simply have a few exams on those days, creating an artificial barrier against their participating). We reason that two weeks should provide an adequate time to complete the brief survey, including two weekends during which participants should hopefully be freed to respond.\nUsing a Qualtrics function, individuals who have not completed the survey after the first week will receive an automatic reminder from Qualtrics reminding them that they only have seven days left, and reminding them that they can get self-esteem feedback (vs cash award) by completing it.\n", "hypothesis": "We will be contacting participants from a large prescreen list via email. These individuals will be invited to learn about their self-esteem by completing a very quick study, or to receive an entry into a cash draw. In reality, regardless of condition, they will indeed receive bona fide feedback about their relative self-esteem levels, reported as low/medium/high based on normative data we collected through an earlier prescreening process \u2013 and also be entered into a cash draw. Therefore, the only difference among participants is whether their invitation email focuses on getting accurate self-esteem feedback, or focuses on getting a possible cash award.\nEach participant is directed to a Qualtrics survey in which they fill out a consent form, then complete the BFI-44 (a 44 item scale that takes under five minutes to complete), the Self-Esteem Importance Scale (a 20-item scale that takes about two minutes to complete), and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (a 10-item scale that takes about one minute to complete). The inclusion of the BFI is to provide some \u201cwork\u201d for participants to do; after all, people who are highly motivated to learn about self-esteem should be willing to answer some self-esteem irrelevant items to get to the self-esteem feedback that they desire. The SEIS has been included so we can assess a roughly four-month test-retest reliability of that measure. Afterwards, participants receive genuine information feedback about their trait self-esteem based on their actual scores. That is, participants with low self-esteem (below 25th percentile) get one kind of feedback, whereas participants with high self-esteem (above 75th) get a different feedback. Those in the middle get told that their self-esteem is moderate. (See materials for specific feedback provided.)\nAt the end of the study, we will explain the true purpose of the study to participants in a debriefing form: all that we are interested in is who did this \u2018bonus study\u2019 whose sole reward is learning about their self-esteem (vs cash award). We hypothesize that self-esteem importance scores should be elevated in the study version that is only reinforced with accurate self-esteem feedback, compared to the study version in which cash incentives are used. The logic is that people who think that self-esteem leads to important consequences \u2013 positive or negative \u2013 should be more motivated to learn about their self-esteem levels, since knowing this information should be more consequential in their minds. However, they should not be any more interested in receiving a cash award (a very general and non-specific reinforcer).", "study_type": "Experiment"}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=rjmb5", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "parent": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/3287q/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "3287q", "type": "registrations"}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/ca-1/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "ca-1", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/3287q/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "3287q", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "rjmb5", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/4szkb/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "4szkb", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ygux4/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "ygux4", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5d2d2268d28338002c2432d2/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5d2d2268d28338002c2432d2", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/rjmb5/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rjmb5/"}}, {"id": "6vqz5", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Study 3.
