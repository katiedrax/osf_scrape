The researchers developed separate task analyses for three common office-related tasks including shredding paper, copying documents, and scanning documents. Each task analysis consists of 10 steps of similar levels of difficulty. Tasks will be broken into their individual steps and then recorded sequentially using the Task Analysis app. Each step of the task analysis includes the following three components: (a) directions for the individual step, (b) a picture of the completed step, and (c) recording of a researcher completing that step, while reading the directions for the step aloud. Using the Task Analysis app on the iPhone, participants will be able to view the step-by-step task analysis for each office task.

(GHA, 2016). Despite the vast sum of money spent each year, little evidence exists on the effectiveness of emergency aid. Research on humanitarian assistance is challenging as it must overcome security concerns, logistical hurdles, a relative paucity of high quality monitoring data, and the urgency of humanitarian action. At the same time, there is an increasing demand from donors, policy-makers and implementing agencies to know what works and why, as this is directly linked to the efficient use of limited resources to achieve development outcomes. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), humanitarian actors have been present for over 20 years in response to on-going armed conflict and low state capacity in the mountainous east of the country. Acute crises such as population displacement and natural disasters exacerbate a situation of chronic vulnerability, especially among the rural population. As of May 2017, the IDMC estimated that ongoing conflicts in North and South Kivu and an increase in inter-communal clashes in southern and central regions such as Tanganyika, the Kasais, Ituri and Uele, had caused 922,000 people to be displaced from their homes, with an additional 130,000 displaced due to natural disasters over the course of 2016 alone. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimates there are some 3.8 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in DRC as of May 2017, the highest number in Africa. Most of these IDPs lack sufficient access to food, clean water, and sanitation facilities, and threats to security are pervasive. Similar conditions hold even for most non-displaced rural populations in the east. In May 2014, the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie), in partnership with the DRC Humanitarian Pooled Fund (HPF), requested qualifications from research teams interested in studying the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance in eastern Congo. HPF and 3ie matched qualified research teams with humanitarian organizations that had previously expressed interest in the methods promoted by 3ie. Our research team was matched with the Rapid Response to Movements of Population (RRMP) program, jointly managed by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and OCHA. The program that evolved into RRMP began in 2004. Currently, RRMP8 (May 2017 \u2013 April 2018) provides humanitarian assistance to groups of 500 or more households in North Kivu, South Kivu, Ituri, ex-Katanga and Tanganyika who have fled from armed conflict or natural disasters, or have recently returned to their home communities after such displacement. The program also responds to epidemics such as cholera. The RRMP8 budget is approximately 21 million USD. RRMP is a complex program that provides assistance with non-food items, health, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), and education. To reach a consensus on a feasible and relevant study design, representatives from HPF, UNICEF, OCHA, the NGOs that implement RRMP, and the research team met a number of times over three years. The final design focuses on the largest component of RRMP: vouchers for non-food items.

It is however very difficult to identify (and then target) non-compliers because claiming to follow the rules is socially desirable. Drawing on data from three survey experiments, we examine the efficacy of \u201cface-saving\u201d treatments as a means of reducing social desirability and enhancing measurement of compliance. These treatments should make it more acceptable and guilty-free for citizens to admit non-compliance. We thus expect to find the proportion of non-compliance to be systematically higher in the group received the face-saving question. Considering the present context and the importance of accurately measuring and then targeting non-compliance, we argue that scholars around the world should adopt the face-saving question.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-21T04:48:14.173100", "date_modified": "2020-04-21T04:45:04.179420", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["Compliance", "Coronavirus", "COVID19", "COVID-19", "Lockdown", "Measurement", "Public health", "self-isolation", "Social distance", "Survey experiment"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Project contributors"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "16b59ef75a30102a76add32a6344513865ba294dd58542ae1f83d3f28db8b3bc59dc61b727ac5cab6b89e2c69ec87f236bc877babee837537a7053ddc22101a482bfceb927bb0354c7244573db1483a491f97e7a1871c959f3ac904d14cfe153af3dc4a1e1b55464bb9703b4a246b4f06ae2cf840e0b73f5b9957de9d21219cbe1e24ff21c7de3cb1accf9f6e5c678f2", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-21T04:48:14.154108", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Daoust, \u00c9ric B\u00e9langer, Ruth Dassonneville, Erick Lachapelle, Cliffton van der Linden, Richard Nadeau, Justin Savoie"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "We expect that citizens who receive the face-saving treatment will more readily admit to non-compliance."}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Sexual orientation: Participants were asked to self-report their sexual orientation from a list of options including heterosexual, bisexual, demisexual, heterosexual, gay/lesbian, and pansexual. Sexual orientation was also assessed using the Kinsey Sexual Attraction Scale (Kinsey et al., 1953). \n2. Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (SIAD): The study coordinator assesses SIAD symptoms by conducting a phone screen with each participant, asking them to respond to questions about desire and arousal difficulties. Participants are asked whether they have experienced an absence/reduction in the following: sexual interest, sexual thoughts/fantasies, initiation of sexual activity or receptivity to sexual advances, responses to erotic cues (e.g., a sex scene in a movie), sexual excitement/pleasure, and genital/non-genital sensations. A diagnosis of SIAD is made if women endorse at least three of these six symptoms for a duration of 6 months or longer, and report that these symptoms are causing significant personal distress. \n\nOutcome Measures (Dependent Variables)\nHypothesis 1: Visual Attention (Primary Endpoint)\nWe will measure three dependent variables of interest: (1) Total fixation count (TFC) is the total number of fixations in an area of interest (AOI); (2) Total fixation duration (TFD) is the total amount of time spent (in seconds) in an AOI across the total stimulus presentation time; (3) Proportion of time (PT) is the percentage of the total stimulus presentation time spent in a particular AOI. For each trial, TFC, TFD, and PT will be calculated for each sexual and non-sexual image, In addition, PT will be calculated for the region of sexual contact (i.e., penile-vaginal penetration, cunnilingus, fellatio) within each sexual image.  These scores will be averaged across 20 experimental trials to result in mean controlled attention scores for each target type (i.e., sexual image, non-sexual image, region of sexual contact within the sexual image). \n\nHypothesis 2: Implicit Appraisals (Secondary Endpoint)\nSC-IAT effects will be operationalized by D-scores, which range from -2, indicative of a negative implicit bias towards sexual cues,  to +2, indicative of a positive implicit bias. \n\nHypothesis 3: Explicit Appraisals (Secondary Endpoint)\nWe will use a self-report measure of attitudes towards sex developed by Bulmer &amp; Izuma (2018). We refer to this scale as the Sex Semantic Differential Scale; please find it attached to this registration application. \n\nPredictors/Covariates\n1. Asexual identity: Assessed using the Asexuality Identification Scale (AIS; Yule, Brotto, &amp; Gorzalka, 2015). Respondents use a Likert scale to rate the applicability of various statements (e.g., I would be content if I never had sex again) to their experience, with responses ranging from 1 (completely false) to 5 (completely true). \n2. Sexual Interest/Desire: Assessed using the Sexual Desire Inventory-2 (SDI-2; Spector, Carey, &amp; Steinberg, 1996). Participants are presented with 14 statements and use 8- and 9-point Likert scales to rate the frequency and intensity of their feelings of desire, as well as the importance of engaging in partnered and non-partnered sexual activities. \n3. Sexual Distress: Assessed by the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS-R; Derogatis, Clayton, Lewis-D'Agostino, Wunderlich, &amp; Fu, 2008). Respondents rate 12 statements using a Likert  scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (always) to indicate how often they experienced distress related to sexual problems. \n4. Depressive Symptoms: Assessed by the second edition of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977). The BDI-II consists of 21 statements that participants rate on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3, with scores greater than 15 typically being used to identify individuals likely to meet diagnostic criteria for depression. The CES-D includes 20 statements (e.g., I was bothered by things that don't usually bother me), and participants indicate how often they felt or behaved a certain way in the past week using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (rarely or none of the time - less than 1 day) to 3 (most or all of the time - 5-7 days). \n5. Genital Self-Image: Assessed by the Female Genital Self-Image Scale (FGSIS; Herbenick &amp; Reece, 2010). Respondents rate seven statements about their genitals using a 4-point response scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). \n6. Sexual Aversion: Assessed by the Sexual Aversion Scale (Katz, Gipson, Kearl, &amp; Krikovitch, 1989). Respondents rated the applicability of 30 statements (e.g., I worry a lot about sex) to their experience using a Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all like me) to 4 (a lot like me). \n7. Genital pain: Women will be assessed during a phone screen for symptoms of Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPPD), and will be asked whether they have experienced difficulties with vaginal penetration, pain in their genitals or lower abdomen, pain-related anxiety, or unwanted tensing/tightening of the pelvic floor muscles. A diagnosis of GPPPD will be given if they endorse any of these criteria for a duration of 6 months or longer, and if they report that these symptoms cause personally significant distress.  \n8. Site: Given that asexual individuals make up approximately 0.4-1% of the general population (Aicken, Mercer, &amp; Cassell, 2013; Bogaert, 2004, 2013), we recruited from two different Canadian cities (i.e., Vancouver, Toronto) in order to meet our target sample size.

These scores will be averaged across 20 experimental trials to result in mean TFC, TFD, and PT scores for two AOIs  (i.e., sexual image, non-sexual image) with a PT score only for the AOI containing the area of sexual contact. \n\nHypothesis 2: Implicit Appraisals (Outcome Measure)\nD-scores for each participant will be calculated by the INQUISIT software program using the standard IAT scoring algorithm (Greenwald, Nosek, &amp; Banjali, 2003). \n\nHypothesis 3: Explicit Appraisals (Outcome Measure) \nParticipants\u2019 ratings on the 11 questions of the Sex Semantic Differential Scale (SSDS) will be averaged to yield a mean score for each subject. \n\nPredictors/Covariates\n1. Asexual identity: Total AIS scores (12-60) will be calculated by summing individual responses, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood that the participant identifies as asexual.\n2: Sexual Interest/Desire: Dyadic and solitary subscale scores will be calculated by summing individual items, with the former ranging from 0 to 70 and the latter from 0 to 31.  Higher scores indicate greater desire. Item 14 will not be included in these calculations, as it does not load onto either factor (Spector et al., 1996).\n3: Sexual Distress: Total scores ranging from 0 to 48 will be calculated by summing individual items. Higher scores are indicative of greater sex-related distress, and scores &gt;11 have been recommended to distinguish individuals with clinically low desire from age-matched controls (Derogatis et al., 2007). \n4: Depressive symptoms: Total scores for the BDI-II will be calculated by summing individual items, ranging from 0-84, with higher scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms.  CES-D info must be included. \n5: Genital Self-Image: A total FGSIS score (7-28) will calculated by summing all individual item scores. Higher scores indicated more positive genital self-image.\n6: Sexual Aversion: Total scores and scale means will be calculated. Higher scores are indicative of greater sexual aversion. \n7: Genital pain: No indices will be calculated for this variable. Instead,  participants who identify as heterosexual will be assigned a value of 1 if they meet diagnostic criteria for GPPPD, or 0 if they do not meet diagnostic criteria (i.e., 1 = GPPPD present, 0 = GPPPD absent). \n8.

", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "n/a", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Grouping Variables \n1. Sexual orientation: Participants were asked to self-report their sexual orientation from a list of options including heterosexual, bisexual, demisexual, heterosexual, gay/lesbian, and pansexual. Sexual orientation was also assessed using the Kinsey Sexual Attraction Scale (Kinsey et al., 1953). \n2. Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (SIAD): The study coordinator assesses SIAD symptoms by conducting a phone screen with each participant, asking them to respond to questions about desire and arousal difficulties. Participants are asked whether they have experienced an absence/reduction in the following: sexual interest, sexual thoughts/fantasies, initiation of sexual activity or receptivity to sexual advances, responses to erotic cues (e.g., a sex scene in a movie), sexual excitement/pleasure, and genital/non-genital sensations. A diagnosis of SIAD is made if women endorse at least three of these six symptoms for a duration of 6 months or longer, and report that these symptoms are causing significant personal distress. \n\nOutcome Measures (Dependent Variables)\nHypothesis 1: Visual Attention (Primary Endpoint)\nWe will measure three dependent variables of interest: (1) Total fixation count (TFC) is the total number of fixations in an area of interest (AOI); (2) Total fixation duration (TFD) is the total amount of time spent (in seconds) in an AOI across the total stimulus presentation time; (3) Proportion of time (PT) is the percentage of the total stimulus presentation time spent in a particular AOI. For each trial, TFC, TFD, and PT will be calculated for each sexual and non-sexual image, In addition, PT will be calculated for the region of sexual contact (i.e., penile-vaginal penetration, cunnilingus, fellatio) within each sexual image.  These scores will be averaged across 20 experimental trials to result in mean controlled attention scores for each target type (i.e., sexual image, non-sexual image, region of sexual contact within the sexual image). \n\nHypothesis 2: Implicit Appraisals (Secondary Endpoint)\nSC-IAT effects will be operationalized by D-scores, which range from -2, indicative of a negative implicit bias towards sexual cues,  to +2, indicative of a positive implicit bias. \n\nHypothesis 3: Explicit Appraisals (Secondary Endpoint)\nWe will use a self-report measure of attitudes towards sex developed by Bulmer &amp; Izuma (2018). We refer to this scale as the Sex Semantic Differential Scale; please find it attached to this registration application. \n\nPredictors/Covariates\n1. Asexual identity: Assessed using the Asexuality Identification Scale (AIS; Yule, Brotto, &amp; Gorzalka, 2015). Respondents use a Likert scale to rate the applicability of various statements (e.g., I would be content if I never had sex again) to their experience, with responses ranging from 1 (completely false) to 5 (completely true). \n2. Sexual Interest/Desire: Assessed using the Sexual Desire Inventory-2 (SDI-2; Spector, Carey, &amp; Steinberg, 1996). Participants are presented with 14 statements and use 8- and 9-point Likert scales to rate the frequency and intensity of their feelings of desire, as well as the importance of engaging in partnered and non-partnered sexual activities. \n3. Sexual Distress: Assessed by the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS-R; Derogatis, Clayton, Lewis-D'Agostino, Wunderlich, &amp; Fu, 2008). Respondents rate 12 statements using a Likert  scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (always) to indicate how often they experienced distress related to sexual problems. \n4. Depressive Symptoms: Assessed by the second edition of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977). The BDI-II consists of 21 statements that participants rate on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3, with scores greater than 15 typically being used to identify individuals likely to meet diagnostic criteria for depression. The CES-D includes 20 statements (e.g., I was bothered by things that don't usually bother me), and participants indicate how often they felt or behaved a certain way in the past week using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (rarely or none of the time - less than 1 day) to 3 (most or all of the time - 5-7 days). \n5. Genital Self-Image: Assessed by the Female Genital Self-Image Scale (FGSIS; Herbenick &amp; Reece, 2010). Respondents rate seven statements about their genitals using a 4-point response scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). \n6. Sexual Aversion: Assessed by the Sexual Aversion Scale (Katz, Gipson, Kearl, &amp; Krikovitch, 1989). Respondents rated the applicability of 30 statements (e.g., I worry a lot about sex) to their experience using a Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all like me) to 4 (a lot like me). \n7. Genital pain: Women will be assessed during a phone screen for symptoms of Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPPD), and will be asked whether they have experienced difficulties with vaginal penetration, pain in their genitals or lower abdomen, pain-related anxiety, or unwanted tensing/tightening of the pelvic floor muscles. A diagnosis of GPPPD will be given if they endorse any of these criteria for a duration of 6 months or longer, and if they report that these symptoms cause personally significant distress.  \n8. Site: Given that asexual individuals make up approximately 0.4-1% of the general population (Aicken, Mercer, &amp; Cassell, 2013; Bogaert, 2004, 2013), we recruited from two different Canadian cities (i.e., Vancouver, Toronto) in order to meet our target sample size.

Higher scores indicate greater desire. Item 14 will not be included in these calculations, as it does not load onto either factor (Spector et al., 1996).\n3: Sexual Distress: Total scores ranging from 0 to 48 will be calculated by summing individual items. Higher scores are indicative of greater sex-related distress, and scores &gt;11 have been recommended to distinguish individuals with clinically low desire from age-matched controls (Derogatis et al., 2007). \n4: Depressive symptoms: Total scores for the BDI-II will be calculated by summing individual items, ranging from 0-84, with higher scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms.  CES-D info must be included. \n5: Genital Self-Image: A total FGSIS score (7-28) will calculated by summing all individual item scores. Higher scores indicated more positive genital self-image.\n6: Sexual Aversion: Total scores and scale means will be calculated. Higher scores are indicative of greater sexual aversion. \n7: Genital pain: No indices will be calculated for this variable. Instead,  participants who identify as heterosexual will be assigned a value of 1 if they meet diagnostic criteria for GPPPD, or 0 if they do not meet diagnostic criteria (i.e., 1 = GPPPD present, 0 = GPPPD absent). \n8.

This knowledge hinges on a variety of factors including the type of technologies used in PC, the type of health worker, and how technologically advanced is the context and setting of the PC in question.
