We encounter these personalities every day; the Machiavellian who has tricked you into giving something up, the narcissist who constantly brags about themselves, the subclinical psychopath who has physically hurt you, and the sadist who hurts people for fun. Cyberbullying is prominent in today\u2019s society, as well as other online behaviors such as trolling. Trolling involves being deceptive online for no reason and towards people the person doesn\u2019t know, and tricking people into humiliating themselves (Buckels, Trapnell, &amp; Paulhus, 2014). Online trolls are individuals who partake in deceptive, destructive, or disruptive behavior in a social setting on the Internet with no apparent instrumental purpose (Buckels, Trapnell &amp; Paulhus, 2014). There are many possible predictors of social media trolling behavior, specifically psychosocial disorders. As these individuals have no apparent purpose, we need an explanation for the behavior displayed by these online trolls is searched for. With research, one can gain an understanding of these behaviors. To begin to conduct research in order to understand trolling behaviors, one has to understand why these behaviors are prevalent in certain individuals. Research also indicates that those who are narcissists and those with antisocial personality disorder use social media more often than others (Rosen, Whaling, Rab, Carrier &amp; Cheever, 2013). An online \u201ctroll\u201d is a separate personality related entity, and in order to understand this identity, one must understand the self- presentation that\u2019s goes into its construction (Fox &amp; Rooney, 2015).\n\n \n\nThe behavior displayed by trolls over the Internet can not only give a lot of insight into the psychosocial disorders an individual may or may not possess or develop, but can also have severe effects on the individual on the receiving end of the trolls\u2019 malicious behavior. By understanding the psychosocial predictors of social media trolling, the online behavior may be prevented along with its substantial and negative consequences to its victims (Howard, Zolnierek, Critz, Dailey &amp; Ceballos, 2019). There is a relationship believed to be between the Big Five personality traits, Dark Triad traits, and sadism with bullying and/ or cyberbullying (van Geel, Goemans, Toprak &amp; Vedder, 2017).If there is a relation between theses personality disorders and cyberbullying, as well as with increased social media use, then the negative behavior of online trolls can be predicted and prevented. This would solve the issue of the negative consequences trolling can have, while addressing the psychosocial disorder the \u2018troll\u2019 is experiencing. Understanding the meaning of an online \u201ctroll\u201d and what traits they possess can also help society establish constructs of identity, as traits from the Dark Triad can manifest in both trolls and victims (Linton &amp; Power, 2013).", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-19T18:19:05.275864", "date_modified": "2020-04-04T21:14:26.812759", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Ashley Evans", "Katie Gatewood", "Tai Lambert"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "ea5b1b2983e6b3449d0799673f1b665968df0907da88f0f3b5beda7f19a1a71d46d69d90ccf9b8067a306f2458cce2b0fdb7942b0e03a7c809018e65f75233da806a1557defe530c07e0647ea4900fc516dc819480fca8dc41d01bdf55bb8e4bea4d35856bbc84dd1ac151bb46f2a6a2d10cb706e962567c920dc47d5c8c411eeb4b21ed7948da05cca0c96810e101d1", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-19T18:19:05.259256", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Ashley Evans, Katie Gatewood, Tai Lambert"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Individuals who participate more in negative social media interactions are more likely to possess or develop the personality disorders which make up the Dark Tetrad."}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

Specifically, in pilot work, we expected that higher scores on the belief measure would predict higher agreement with high intervention practices but lower agreement with low intervention practices. Our initial pilot work supported the former prediction, but not the latter - that is, higher scores on the belief measure predicted higher agreement with high intervention practices, but belief score did not predict agreement with low intervention practices. \n\nWe think that these findings are likely due to the fact that we intentionally did not design our low intervention items to be as extreme as many of our high intervention items. That is, while many of our high intervention items involved more extreme parental intervention (e.g., 'taking over' and doing work on behalf of the child), our low intervention items were intended to embody a more autonomy-supportive approach (e.g., encouraging the child to work independently, but being available for help if needed). Considering these practices on a spectrum from extremely low to extremely high parental intervention, the low intervention practices we presented to parents are quite far from the extremely low (i.e., neglectful) end of the spectrum, whereas the high intervention practices we used are relatively closer to the extremely high end of the spectrum.

Specifically, in pilot work, we expected that higher scores on the belief measure would predict higher agreement with high intervention practices but lower agreement with low intervention practices. Our initial pilot work supported the former prediction, but not the latter - that is, higher scores on the belief measure predicted higher agreement with high intervention practices, but belief score did not predict agreement with low intervention practices. \n\nWe think that these findings are likely due to the fact that we intentionally did not design our low intervention items to be as extreme as many of our high intervention items. That is, while many of our high intervention items involved more extreme parental intervention (e.g., 'taking over' and doing work on behalf of the child), our low intervention items were intended to embody a more autonomy-supportive approach (e.g., encouraging the child to work independently, but being available for help if needed). Considering these practices on a spectrum from extremely low to extremely high parental intervention, the low intervention practices we presented to parents are quite far from the extremely low (i.e., neglectful) end of the spectrum, whereas the high intervention practices we used are relatively closer to the extremely high end of the spectrum. Because the study to which this preregistration pertains aims to replicate this pilot work (using the same high and low intervention items), our primary hypothesis follows accordingly.\n\nH1: There will be an interaction between overall scores on a novel parent belief measure [where higher scores indicate greater endorsement of the idea that parental intervention is necessary for a young adult child\u2019s success; items adapted from Padilla-Walker &amp; Nelson, 2012] and type of parental practice (either high or low intervention) endorsed for specific achievement-related scenarios.\n\nH1a: Higher scores on the belief measure will predict higher agreement with high intervention   practices.\nH1b: Higher scores on the belief measure will not predict agreement with low intervention practices.", "q3": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.
