The extent to which the later option is discounted varies largely between people, and research has shown mixed age effects.

Thus, for older adults, the greater the delay between now and an outcome, the greater their uncertainty about whether they will be alive and able to realize that outcome. This predicts that for longer time delays, older adults will discount more than younger adults. However, for shorter time delays older adults should not show a differences from younger adults.

We will measure age (in years) as the continuous covariate, and will measure future time perspective, as measured by the FTP scale (Carstensen and Lang, 1996), as a mediator.\n- KS: should I add our demographic questions &amp; savings &amp; safety net questions here too?", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "H1: We hypothesize that across all ages, we will see greater discounting (or greater proportion of sooner options) with longer time delays.\n\nH2: We hypothesize that this increase in discounting for longer time delays will vary by age. Specifically, we predict that age differences in time preferences will only appear with longer time delays. For shorter time delays (days, weeks, months), there will be no age differences in discount rates. For longer time delays (years), older adults will show greater discounting than younger adults because of uncertainty about their future.\n\nWe will test these hypotheses by predicting the proportion of sooner options chosen with two models:\n\nFirst, we will test a 3 (k-values: 0.1, 0.05, 0.005) by 4 (time: days, weeks, months, years) by Age (25-84 years) ANCOVA. \n\nH1: Main effect of delay with longer delays (years) having greater acceptance of sooner option.\nH2: Age * Delay interaction such that age difference only appear for longer delays (years)\n\nNext, we will convert the categorical predictors above into continuous variables.

These two continuous predictors (log(k) and delay in days) will be used in a linear model.\n\n\nH1: Main effect of number of days such that longer delays ( &gt; 365 days) having greater acceptance of
