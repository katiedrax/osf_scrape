Adolescent pregnancy has consistently been associated with adverse outcomes for both the young mother and infant  Delaying childbirth amongst adolescent girls is critical to avoiding the adverse outcomes of early childbearing, improving maternal, newborn and child health, as well as the educational and economic prospects of adolescent girls. In Asia and the Pacific, reducing adolescent pregnancy remains a major concern. South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific have the highest adolescent populations in the world, as well as high and stagnating adolescent birth rates, despite other countries globally benefiting from declining rates. \n\nChanges in urbanisation, globalisation and migration in Asia and the Pacific have contributed to shifting sexual values, norms and behaviours of adolescents, which have not been well investigated. Major gaps in knowledge in the region concerning sexually active adolescents (i.e. girls and boys), young adolescents aged 10-14 years and marginalized and vulnerable populations remain; particularly how their attitudes, behaviours and knowledge concerning sexual relationships, premarital sex, early marriage, and risk taking contribute to adolescent pregnancy. Understanding these gaps and how they contribute to adolescent pregnancy in Asia and the Pacific may help identify cultural and country-specific factors required to improve outcomes in the region.                   \n                                                             \n This research thesis will investigate the knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of girls and boys influencing adolescent pregnancy rates in the Asia and Pacific region via a scoping review of peer-reviewed and grey literature.

Adolescent pregnancy has consistently been associated with adverse outcomes for both the young mother and infant  Delaying childbirth amongst adolescent girls is critical to avoiding the adverse outcomes of early childbearing, improving maternal, newborn and child health, as well as the educational and economic prospects of adolescent girls. In Asia and the Pacific, reducing adolescent pregnancy remains a major concern. South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific have the highest adolescent populations in the world, as well as high and stagnating adolescent birth rates, despite other countries globally benefiting from declining rates. \n\nChanges in urbanisation, globalisation and migration in Asia and the Pacific have contributed to shifting sexual values, norms and behaviours of adolescents, which have not been well investigated. Major gaps in knowledge in the region concerning sexually active adolescents (i.e. girls and boys), young adolescents aged 10-14 years and marginalized and vulnerable populations remain; particularly how their attitudes, behaviours and knowledge concerning sexual relationships, premarital sex, early marriage, and risk taking contribute to adolescent pregnancy. Understanding these gaps and how they contribute to adolescent pregnancy in Asia and the Pacific may help identify cultural and country-specific factors required to improve outcomes in the region.                   \n                                                             \n This research thesis will investigate the knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of girls and boys influencing adolescent pregnancy rates in the Asia and Pacific region via a scoping review of peer-reviewed and grey literature.

issues. This study will evaluate how fact-check readers and the general public in Italy view fact-checking, how interested they are in reading it when offered alternate content options, and what effects it has on what they know about politics. Specifically, we examine how different audiences select and respond to information from the Italian fact-checking website Pagella Politica, contrasting the behavior of readers of Pagella Politica and other Italian news sites with a general population sample. Respondents are given a list of articles to choose from and then asked respondents which article they would choose to read. We experimentally vary aspects of this choice to see how it affects the article(s) that people indicate they would like to read. We will also randomize whether respondents are assigned to the articles they would choose to read or not, allowing us to contrast the effects of assigned exposure to fact-checking with the effects when people have an option to select non-political news instead."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: Selective exposure We expect that people will not choose to read negative fact-checks about a favored party as much as those about a disfavored party. In this study, the fact-checks included in the study as treatments have a middle-ground rating of \u201cNi\u201d (an Italian idiom that combines \u201cNo\u201d and \u201cSi\u201d). Our specific expectation is that respondents will be more likely to read a fact-check of a statement from a party that they do not identify with or feel positively toward (H1a) and that providing a graphic indicating that the rating is mixed will increase the prevalence of this type of selective exposure (H1b). These effects may vary by political sophistication (i.e., knowledge) or sample - i.e., general population vs. Pagella Politica/Italian news site reader (RQ1). We also are interested to see if people are inclined to select fact-checks about the issue they see as the most important problem (RQ2a), which is our primary measure of issue salience, and whether selective exposure is greater on high-salience issues of this type (RQ2b). Finally, our study looks at results from two different samples -- a sample of Italian fact-check readers and a sample from a web-based panel of Italians. We expect that fact-check readers will select fact-checks more often than respondents from our general Italian sample. H2 and H3: Differential learning effects Our design asks people to select the content they are interested in, and separately randomizes what content people receive. While we discuss the design in more detail below, key features are necessary to explain our hypotheses. Respondents are assigned to one of three conditions -- receive fact-checking content regardless of which content they would prefer (25%), receive entertainment content regardless of the content they prefer (25%), or receive the content they prefer (50%). On average, we expect that exposure to fact-checking leads to learning about politics.

This study will evaluate how fact-check readers and the general public in Italy view fact-checking, how interested they are in reading it when offered alternate content options, and what effects it has on what they know about politics. Specifically, we examine how different audiences select and respond to information from the Italian fact-checking website Pagella Politica, contrasting the behavior of readers of Pagella Politica and other Italian news sites with a general population sample. Respondents are given a list of articles to choose from and then asked respondents which article they would choose to read. We experimentally vary aspects of this choice to see how it affects the article(s) that people indicate they would like to read. We will also randomize whether respondents are assigned to the articles they would choose to read or not, allowing us to contrast the effects of assigned exposure to fact-checking with the effects when people have an option to select non-political news instead.", "q16": "H1: Selective exposure We expect that people will not choose to read negative fact-checks about a favored party as much as those about a disfavored party. In this study, the fact-checks included in the study as treatments have a middle-ground rating of \u201cNi\u201d (an Italian idiom that combines \u201cNo\u201d and \u201cSi\u201d). Our specific expectation is that respondents will be more likely to read a fact-check of a statement from a party that they do not identify with or feel positively toward (H1a) and that providing a graphic indicating that the rating is mixed will increase the prevalence of this type of selective exposure (H1b). These effects may vary by political sophistication (i.e., knowledge) or sample - i.e., general population vs. Pagella Politica/Italian news site reader (RQ1). We also are interested to see if people are inclined to select fact-checks about the issue they see as the most important problem (RQ2a), which is our primary measure of issue salience, and whether selective exposure is greater on high-salience issues of this type (RQ2b). Finally, our study looks at results from two different samples -- a sample of Italian fact-check readers and a sample from a web-based panel of Italians. We expect that fact-check readers will select fact-checks more often than respondents from our general Italian sample. H2 and H3: Differential learning effects Our design asks people to select the content they are interested in, and separately randomizes what content people receive. While we discuss the design in more detail below, key features are necessary to explain our hypotheses. Respondents are assigned to one of three conditions -- receive fact-checking content regardless of which content they would prefer (25%), receive entertainment content regardless of the content they prefer (25%), or receive the content they prefer (50%). On average, we expect that exposure to fact-checking leads to learning about politics. Thus, our overall expectations are that respondents in the assigned exposure condition will learn more than those in the content choice condition relative to the control group (H2). We also expect learning effects to be lower for counter-attitudinal information than for pro-attitudinal information in the assigned exposure condition (H3a) and when comparing learning in the the content choice condition and assigned exposure conditions relative to the control group (H3b).
