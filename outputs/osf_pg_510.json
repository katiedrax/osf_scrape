We will construct a generalized linear model with fairness evaluation as the outcome variable and Vote composition (Fixed vs. Mixed) and Group (Groups present vs. No Groups present) as predictor variables. We will additionally test whether the interaction term (Vote composition x Group) explains additional variance. We predict that voting will be perceived as equally fair across conditions at T1 (however, one possibility is that voting will be perceived as less fair in the Groups present conditions at T1, as the proportions in the class may lead participants to view voting as less fair system; we will test for this possibility). and T2 but differ at T3. Specifically, we predict that there will be a main effect of Vote composition: across both Groups present and No Group, participants in the Fixed conditions will view voting as less fair at T3 than participants in the Mixed conditions. We will additionally examine whether there is a main effect of Group or an Interaction between Group and Vote composition. One possibility is that the presence of groups will make the fixedness of preferences more salient. If this is the case, then we expect there to be a difference between the Fixed conditions, such that there is a greater decrease in perceived fairness in the Fixed Groups present condition than in the Fixed No Groups present condition. \n\nDifference from T1 to T2: As described above, we will compute the difference between participants\u2019 fairness evaluations at T1 and T2 (T2-T1). We will compare this difference score across the four conditions, again using a generalized linear model with difference score as the outcome and Vote composition and Group as predictor variables. \n\nDifference from T2 to T3: We will compute the difference between participants\u2019 fairness evaluations at T2 and T3 (T3-T2). We will compare this difference score across the conditions in the same way as described above. We predict that there will be a main effect of Voting composition\u2014that this difference score will be greater in the Fixed conditions than in the Mixed conditions. We also expect that there will be a main effect of Group, such that this difference score will be larger in the Fixed Group condition than in the Fixed No Group condition. \n\nHow likely is the decision rule to yield the same outcome: We will compare how likely participants think the decision rule is to yield the same outcome (popcorn) across the two conditions by constructing a generalized linear model with perceived voting outcome as the outcome variable and Voting composition and Group as predictor variables. We predict that there will be a main effect of Voting composition such that participants will think the procedure is more likely to yield popcorn in the Fixed conditions than in the Mixed conditions.  \n\nPerceived outcome ~ Perceived change in fairness: To examine whether participants\u2019 fairness evaluations relate to how likely they think the procedure is to yield a fixed outcome, we will construct a generalized linear model predicting T3-T2 difference score by perceived outcome, Voting composition, and Group (we will examine whether the interaction between perceived outcome and Voting composition explains additional variance). We predict that the more likely participants are to think that voting will yield popcorn as the outcome, the more participants\u2019 fairness evaluation will decrease from T2 to T3. We predict that this relation will be stronger in the Fixed conditions (though likely present in both conditions) and strongest in the Fixed Group condition. \n\nDesire difference: We will compute a difference score between participants\u2019 judgments of the two class member\u2019s desires to vote again. We will compare this difference score across the conditions (using a generalized linear model with difference score as the outcome and Voting composition and Group as predictors). We predict that participants in the Fixed conditions will think that an individual who has consistently won will prefer to vote again compared to one who has consistently lost. In contrast, we predict that participants in the Mixed conditions will think that two individuals in the class will want to vote at equal rates. \n\nDifference in desire ~ Perceived change in fairness: To examine whether participants\u2019 judgments of the individuals\u2019 desires relates to their perception of fairness, we will construct a generalized linear model predicting difference in desires by change in perceived fairness (T3-T2), Voting composition, and Group (and we will consider whether the interaction terms explain additional variance).

We told participants that the class would vote to decide what to eat for snack time. Participants then saw the class vote across several iterations (i.e., several different days). We examined whether adults considered the composition of the winning group when evaluating the fairness of the procedure. In a first study, we demonstrated that adults viewed iterated votes as increasingly less fair if the majority group was consistently comprised of individuals from only one social group (e.g., there are more blues, blues always vote for one option, and thus blues always win). In a second study, we demonstrated that the composition of the winning group mattered. Here, the individuals that comprised the winning majority group varied from day to day such that the winning group at times contains individuals from both social groups (e.g., the winning group at times contains both blues and greens). In this case, adults\u2019 viewed voting as consistently fair, even after iterated trials. These studies demonstrate that the composition of the winning group influences how fair adults judge voting to be. However, it is unclear from these results if adults opposition stems from the same social group repeatedly winning, or the same individuals repeatedly winning. Thus, in this next study, we examine whether or not the presence of groups, specifically, drives this effect.

This is a 2x2 design in which we will manipulate whether there is or is not group membership (2: Groups present or No Groups present) and the majority composition (2: Mixed preferences or Fixed preferences). All participants will see the class vote across three iterations and will be randomly assigned to one of the four conditions. \n\nGroups present or No Groups present. In the Groups present  conditions, participants will see two primary groups, as in the previous studies. Participants will be told that there are two kinds of kids in the class: Blue kids and Green kids. One of these groups comprises the majority of the class (3 out of 5 kids) and the other comprises the minority of the class (2 out of 5 kids). Which color group is the majority or minority will be counterbalanced across participants. In the No Groups present condition, participants will see a classroom of five individual characters who do not belong to social groups (i.e., each individual is a different color and there is no mention of social groups).\n \nFixed preferences. \nIn the Fixed preferences conditions, the individuals that comprise the winning majority group do not change across trials. That is, individuals vote for the same options across iterations and the same individuals always win. \nGroups present. In the Groups present condition with Fixed preferences, the three individuals that comprise the majority social group (e.g., the Greens) always vote for one option (e.g., popcorn) and always win, whereas the two individuals that comprise the minority social group (e.g., the Blues) always vote for the other option (e.g., chips) and always lose.  \nNo Groups present. In the No Groups present condition with Fixed preferences, three individuals (e.g., Pink, Blue, Purple) always vote for the one option (e.g., popcorn) and always win, whereas the other two individuals (e.g., Green, Yellow) always vote for the other option (e.g., chips) and always lose. Importantly, the same individuals always win but these individuals are not part of a social group. \n\nMixed preferences. \nIn the Mixed preferences conditions, the individuals that comprise the winning majority group vary from trial to trial.

That is, we expect to replicate results from the previous experiments and also expand the result by demonstrating that fairness evaluations are not necessarily tied to group membership. Instead, we expect fairness evaluations to have to do with the iteration of who does or does not get their way. \n\nAlthough we expect that the main effect of Vote Composition will be present in both Groups present and No Groups present conditions, we suspect that the main effect may be stronger in the Groups present condition than the No Groups present condition.

We will construct a generalized linear model with fairness evaluation as the outcome variable and Vote composition (Fixed vs. Mixed) and Group (Groups present vs. No Groups present) as predictor variables. We will additionally test whether the interaction term (Vote composition x Group) explains additional variance. We predict that voting will be perceived as equally fair across conditions at T1 (however, one possibility is that voting will be perceived as less fair in the Groups present conditions at T1, as the proportions in the class may lead participants to view voting as less fair system; we will test for this possibility). and T2 but differ at T3. Specifically, we predict that there will be a main effect of Vote composition: across both Groups present and No Group, participants in the Fixed conditions will view voting as less fair at T3 than participants in the Mixed conditions. We will additionally examine whether there is a main effect of Group or an Interaction between Group and Vote composition. One possibility is that the presence of groups will make the fixedness of preferences more salient. If this is the case, then we expect there to be a difference between the Fixed conditions, such that there is a greater decrease in perceived fairness in the Fixed Groups present condition than in the Fixed No Groups present condition. \n\nDifference from T1 to T2: As described above, we will compute the difference between participants\u2019 fairness evaluations at T1 and T2 (T2-T1). We will compare this difference score across the four conditions, again using a generalized linear model with difference score as the outcome and Vote composition and Group as predictor variables. \n\nDifference from T2 to T3: We will compute the difference between participants\u2019 fairness evaluations at T2 and T3 (T3-T2). We will compare this difference score across the conditions in the same way as described above. We predict that there will be a main effect of Voting composition\u2014that this difference score will be greater in the Fixed conditions than in the Mixed conditions. We also expect that there will be a main effect of Group, such that this difference score will be larger in the Fixed Group condition than in the Fixed No Group condition. \n\nHow likely is the decision rule to yield the same outcome: We will compare how likely participants think the decision rule is to yield the same outcome (popcorn) across the two conditions by constructing a generalized linear model with perceived voting outcome as the outcome variable and Voting composition and Group as predictor variables. We predict that there will be a main effect of Voting composition such that participants will think the procedure is more likely to yield popcorn in the Fixed conditions than in the Mixed conditions.  \n\nPerceived outcome ~ Perceived change in fairness: To examine whether participants\u2019 fairness evaluations relate to how likely they think the procedure is to yield a fixed outcome, we will construct a generalized linear model predicting T3-T2 difference score by perceived outcome, Voting composition, and Group (we will examine whether the interaction between perceived outcome and Voting composition explains additional variance). We predict that the more likely participants are to think that voting will yield popcorn as the outcome, the more participants\u2019 fairness evaluation will decrease from T2 to T3. We predict that this relation will be stronger in the Fixed conditions (though likely present in both conditions) and strongest in the Fixed Group condition. \n\nDesire difference: We will compute a difference score between participants\u2019 judgments of the two class member\u2019s desires to vote again. We will compare this difference score across the conditions (using a generalized linear model with difference score as the outcome and Voting composition and Group as predictors). We predict that participants in the Fixed conditions will think that an individual who has consistently won will prefer to vote again compared to one who has consistently lost. In contrast, we predict that participants in the Mixed conditions will think that two individuals in the class will want to vote at equal rates. \n\nDifference in desire ~ Perceived change in fairness: To examine whether participants\u2019 judgments of the individuals\u2019 desires relates to their perception of fairness, we will construct a generalized linear model predicting difference in desires by change in perceived fairness (T3-T2), Voting composition, and Group (and we will consider whether the interaction terms explain additional variance).

comparison classes by assuming a logistic function that encodes a basic-level bias as an intercept and an effect of frequency of the NP in a corpus (the Google WebGram corpus). Since our item_sets come from a group of participants and are quite heterogeneous, we do not know whether the specific NP used is a basic level or subordinate level category (i.e., should the basic-level bias make the specific comparison class more likely or less likely?). Thus, we treat the sub-basic vs. basic-super status of the items as an unknown bernoulli variable that we infer on an item_set basis (e.g., basketball players, soccer players, gymnasts as instance of people; the specific NPs would likely be subordinate categories, whereas the general NP [people] would be a basic level category; dogs, fish, and birds would be instances of animals; the specific NPs would likely be basic level categories).

Thus, there are 540 unique items in this experiment, and we aim for a total of 27,000 ratings (50 per item).

We define a model in the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework to predict comparison class inferences that we measured in a different experiment (https://osf.io/xuc96). The model makes inferences dependent on prior knowledge about categories, which we model as gaussian distributions with mean and variances that we infer using Bayesian inference.
