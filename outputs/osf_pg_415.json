However, the majority of energy consumers are not on the right energy tariff for them. A standard classical account of this would be that consumers have imperfect information over the quantities of interest required to compute what energy tariff is cheapest - e.g. they don't know how much energy costs or how much energy they use or at what time of day they use it (the latter is necessary if consumers are choosing between off-peak tariffs as well as just the conventional flat-rate tariffs). An alternative explanation that is gaining increasing momentum is that consumers lack the computational skills required to identify the cheapest tariff or at least that they will not devote the cognitive attention required to work it out. Some argue that these 'stylised\u2019 anecdotes about real-world consumer behaviour imply that we should alter or change the model that we use to explain consumer decision making and, moreover, that corrective policies should be introduced to prevent consumers from making these mistakes. However, as argued elsewhere (e.g. Allcott, 2011), we should be very careful before drawing such conclusions. First, the claim that the average consumer is not on the cheapest tariff for them is an inference based on the difference between the average available retail energy tariff and the cheapest available retail electricity tariff using modelled average energy consumption rather than from observed consumption and the consumers\u2019 actual tariff and it does not account for the possibility that consumers are maximising other components than price (e.g. quality of service, green energy etc). Second, in the absence of smart meters which record actual energy use, it is highly likely that imperfect information is playing a major role in poor tariff selection; it is only if imperfect information cannot explain all of the poor selection that the classical economic model is false. Third, even if poor computational skills do cause people to choose a sub-optimal tariff, it is not necessarily true that a corrective policy (e.g. price regulation) would reduce the number of domestic consumers who are overpaying for their energy. Finally, just because some \u2018naive\u2019 consumers choose the wrong tariff, does not imply that the welfare costs of these mistakes are large; it is only if a large proportion of consumers fail to select the right tariff that energy companies will be able to \u2018charge what they want\u2019 because demand will be insufficiently elastic (Varian, 1980). Therefore, the central question around energy tariffs is whether there is sub-optimal decision making which purportedly corrective policies could correct \u2013 in other words, can energy consumers select the cheapest electricity tariff when given all the information required to make the right choice? If not, are there any definable characteristics for which consumers make better choices than others which regulators could use for targeting corrective policies? If not, is poor computation skills or unwillingness to exert cognitive effort more likely to account for this poor decision making? A survey administered to a panel of market research participants in the UK will be used to answer these questions.

Lastly, unlike Taiwanese, many Indonesians have no chance to meet all out-group members due to the wide and dispersed territory of Indonesia. In sum, the stable party system helps Taiwanese establish partisan stereotypes based on long term observations; polarized and competitive party competition (Clark and Tan, 2012) motivates the average Taiwanese to use partisan stereotypes to judge a new friend\u2019s party identification and to avoid discussing politics with anyone who holds opposite political positions; and the non-descent-based ethnic cleavage further complicates Taiwanese partisan stereotypes.

The subjects of this experiment will be Taiwanese citizens who grew up in Taiwan. In other words, all foreigners, Taiwanese who grew up in foreign countries, and Taiwanese under the age of 18 will be excluded. Before subjects begin the online survey questionnaire, they will be explicitly informed that they are participating in an experiment and what they are asked to do during this experiment. The outcome variable will be the evaluated party identification of fictitious people whose profile will be showed to the subjects. Subjects will read one personal profile on the screen, and then they will be asked to use their intuition to choose this fictitious person\u2019s political party identification from the two major political parties, the DPP and the KMT.

The option (1) and (9) represent two most extreme point on the political spectrum, respectively, and Neutral (non-partisan) represents the midpoint. Given that this 9-point measurement of party identification does not violate the transitivity assumption in Taiwan (Shiao, 2009), my outcome variable is an ordinal scale. The personal profile shown on the screen contains personal information which consists of five attributes including gender, age, language use, hometown, and occupation. Each of the attributes contains multiple values. In Taiwan, although one\u2019s ethnicity cannot be easily judged based on facial characteristics, language use offers a hint that this person may belong to which ethnic group. Even though more than 90% of Taiwanese speak Mandarin Chinese fluently (Chang and Lu, 2014), speaking standard Mandarin without any Taiwanese accent could imply that the speaker is a Mainlander as opposed to another ethnic group who speaks Hakka, Min-nan, or Mandarin Chinese with Taiwanese accent. Occupation tells people not only one\u2019s social class but also the possible position on social welfare policies or cross-strait policies.

All subjects will use their own computers or laptops to do the online survey questionnaire, and the data will be electronically sent to me.

This experiment tests how different variations of text messages sent to registered voters encouraging voting can increase voter turnout in the 2018 midterm elections. Despite widespread use, SMS messages have received little scholarly attention as a medium for campaign communication (Dale and Strauss 2009; Malhotra et al 2011; Bhatti et al 2017b). This experiment is part of a series of experiments in the 2018 general election to build on this prior research. The experiment compares three treatments and a uncontacted control group. The Information treatment relies on positive descriptive norms, civic duty and information about voting to increase turnout. These tactics are very common in voter mobilization and have been successful in past randomized controlled tests (see Green and Gerber 2015 for review). The Social Pressure treatment seeks to elicit a perception that the recipient\u2019s voting behavior is being monitored by informing the recipient that voter turnout is public record and that a post-election survey about \u201cyour experience at the polls\u201d will be conducted. The perception of monitoring is considered the \u201cactive ingredient\u201d in social pressure mailings (see Green and Gerber 2015). The psychological reactance against social pressure tactics can be mitigated by disguising the message with a survey (Mann 2010). The Political Efficacy treatment encourages recipients to believe \u201cyour vote makes a difference\u201d. Increased feelings of political efficacy are correlated with higher turnout, so this encouragement is expected to increase turnout. It is frequently used in voter mobilization treatments delivered in other forms of communication (see Green and Gerber 2015). The experiment is conducted in multiple states covering a range of electoral contexts (defined by competitiveness, voting procedures, and other characteristics). In four states, the treatments were targeted at both early in person voting (EIPV) and Election Day voting (EDay voting): Illinois, Texas, West Virginia, Wisconsin. In five states, the treatments targeted only Election Day voting: Iowa, Minnesota, New Jersey, North Dakota, Virginia. In the states with EIPV and EDay voting, the experiment addresses a secondary research question about mobilization for these two types of in-person voting: is it more effective to mobilize voters to vote early, to vote on Election Day, or to mobilize for early voting and then for Election Day voting? To the best of our knowledge, this question has received almost no attention despite the widespread availability of early in person voting (cf. Mann and Mayhew 2012). Therefore, treatment records in these states are assigned to mobilization for EIPV only (20%), Election Day only (20%), or both (60%)."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "See attached pre-analysis plan document"}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "See attached pre-analysis plan document"}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "United States"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "2,372,939"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "Skidmore College IRB 1810-762"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "10/25/18"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q27": {"extra": [], "value": "Vote.org (see pre-analysis plan for details)"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q30": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q32": {"extra": [], "value": "C93, D72"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design", "Field Experiments"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Elections"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e3868e9fa39b701831daa86", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/g3tu9/providers/osfstorage/5e3868e9fa39b701831daa86", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/g3tu9/providers/osfstorage/5e3868e9fa39b701831daa86", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/g3tu9/providers/osfstorage/5e3868e9fa39b701831daa86?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/g3tu9/providers/osfstorage/5e3868e9fa39b701831daa86"}, "attributes": {"etag": "939ca137987e2984038e20f85efcbff10a0c8d0f44aca3e34a599e4b0859b130", "kind": "file", "name": "20190314AD_PAP.docx", "path": "/5e3868e9fa39b701831daa86", "size": 39875, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "1b7755502b09c5d34dce9757f5bd191a", "sha256": "930c57a7953f393e0a199cd4fd5b1449dfc28e4f5d4ebe142bdc971d4f1df509"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 39875, "modified": "2020-02-03T18:39:37.814827+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "g3tu9", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20190314AD_PAP.docx", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T18:39:37+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "g3tu9", "sha256": "930c57a7953f393e0a199cd4fd5b1449dfc28e4f5d4ebe142bdc971d4f1df509", "viewUrl": "/project/e28rd/files/osfstorage/5e3868ed57427b01830c5911/", "selectedFileName": "20190314AD_PAP.docx"}], "value": "20190314AD_PAP.docx"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "GOTV via SMS: Social Pressure and Political Efficacy Experiment", "q2": "Christopher Mann | Katherine Haenschen", "q3": "20190314AD", "q4": "03/14/2019 - 19:41", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to researcher access to outcome data", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "10/19/18", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "This field experiment examines SMS text messages as a method of voter mobilization.
