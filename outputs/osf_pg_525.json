The second form included 25% thin-beautiful associations and 75% wide-beautiful associations. This second form was for the experimental group, it was the latter which represented the retraining procedure. At the beginning of the task, the age and sex of the participant were asked. This task has to be administered to all participants. \nA test of the procedure on a computer consisted of a combination such as \"slim-beautiful\" and \"round-beautiful\". Synonyms of these words were used, such as \"Thin-Beautiful\", \"Large-Sexy\" for each test.\nThen we ask the participant through instructions explicitly written on the screen to perform a categorization task using two keys, the \"E\" key and the \"I\" key. When a combination of a word related to size and a word related to beauty appeared, they had to press the \"I\" key as soon as possible.

The second task consisted of two computer IATs. A first Animal IAT and a second Machine IAT.\nIn the first IAT Animals we want to test the strength of the associations between each pair of concepts (thin or round women with photographs) and the pairs of attributes (human or animal traits). As for attributes, we take the words that the participants have to classify in the article by Bernard et al. (2014). The human words presented are moral, tradition, hair, foot and mouth. The animal words are nature, instinct, breeding, paw and snout. Bernard et al. chose the words describing the two different concepts with a pretest. Twenty participants gave their level of agreement with different words according to whether they were typical of animals or humans on a 9-point scale.\nPour finir, les deux IAT \u00e9taient compos\u00e9s de 7 blocs comme pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans la table 1. \nThe photographs of women were taken from Assos website, an online clothing sales site, with a large size category. All the women in the photographs were taken on full feet, with the same postures and the same clothes (sweater and pants).\nIn the second IAT Machine we want to test the strength of associations between each concept pairs (overweight or slim women, with the same photographs) and attribute pairs (human or machine traits). For the human items they are the same as for the first IAT. For the machine items we will take them from Loughnan &amp; Haslam (2007) who used words like android, artificial, automaton, computer, machine, mechanical, robot, synthetic in their study on the implicit associations between different social and non-human categories.\nFinally, the two IATs will be composed of 7 blocks.\n\n\n\n\nComposition of the two IATs, based on Greenwald, Mc Ghee &amp; Schwartz (1998) : \n-\tBlock 1 (20 trials): Discrimination in the target category with Photographs of slim and plump women.\n-\tBlock 2 (20 trials): Discrimination of the attribute category with Human attributes (IAT Machine and Animals) vs animals (IAT animals) vs machine (IAT Machine)\n-\tBlock 3 (20 trials): Initial combined categorization with for IAT Animals \uf0e0Target presentation Round and Animal attribute VS Thin target and human attribute.

And for IAT Machine \uf0e0 Thin target presentation and Machine attribute VS round target and Human attribute.\n-\tBlock 5 (20 or 40 trials):  Discrimination overturned target category with reverse of thin and round categories of block 1 on the right and left of the screen\n-\tBlock 6 (20 trials): Discrimination combined category reversed with reverse of the associations on the right and left of the screen of blocks 3 and 4.\n-\tBlock 7 (40 trials) : Discrimination combined category reversed with reverse of the associations on the right and left of the screen of blocks 3 and 4.\n\nProcedure. The participant will be received in an experimental box, the exact nature of the experience, which is the work on dehumanization, will not be revealed to the participant. After reading the information sheet and signing the consent forms, the participant will be in front of the computer screen. He will first read the instructions related to the retraining task, then performed the task. Following this first task, the participant will perform the second task, the two IAT, on the computer as well. This will end when the participant will have completed the IAT tests.

And for IAT Machine \uf0e0 Thin target presentation and Machine attribute VS round target and Human attribute.\n-\tBlock 5 (20 or 40 trials):  Discrimination overturned target category with reverse of thin and round categories of block 1 on the right and left of the screen\n-\tBlock 6 (20 trials): Discrimination combined category reversed with reverse of the associations on the right and left of the screen of blocks 3 and 4.\n-\tBlock 7 (40 trials) : Discrimination combined category reversed with reverse of the associations on the right and left of the screen of blocks 3 and 4.\n\nProcedure. The participant will be received in an experimental box, the exact nature of the experience, which is the work on dehumanization, will not be revealed to the participant. After reading the information sheet and signing the consent forms, the participant will be in front of the computer screen. He will first read the instructions related to the retraining task, then performed the task. Following this first task, the participant will perform the second task, the two IAT, on the computer as well. This will end when the participant will have completed the IAT tests. Explanations will be then given to the participants on the nature of the experience, thanks will be presented for participating in the experience and the participant's experience sheet signed.\n", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question1c": "Comparison of response times to the two IATs (aminals and robots) for the control group and the retraining group.

Higher SUCRA scores correspond to greater weaning success rate or lower proportion requiring reintubation and mortality. Forest plots represent the results of NMA and summary relative mean effects, 95% confidence intervals and SUCRA for all comparisons together. The results of SUCRA were summarized with all interventions and outcomes in a rank-heat plot. \n", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "We did a network meta-analysis using a frequentist approach and provided a point estimate from the network and a 95% CI from the frequency distribution of the estimate. All network meta-analyses were done with the statistical package \u201cnetmeta\u201d 0.9-0 (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/netmeta/index.html) in R 3.4.2 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria) and Stata, version 14 (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas).\n We examined the symmetry and geometry of the evidence by producing a network plot with node for the number of study subjects and connection size corresponding to the number of studies. The contribution of each direct comparison to the estimation of the network summary effects was calculated according to the combination of the variance of the direct treatment effect and the network structure.\nIn order to include all studies within one framework and prevent lower precision of estimating effect size, we chose \u201clumping treatments\u201d designs and made an assumption that no difference in efficacy due to clinical setting of ventilatory inspiratory pressure or Positive end expiratory pressure (eg. PSV with pressure 8 mmHg vs. 5 mmHg).\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=fs8ze", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "fs8ze", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "fs8ze", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/n46cu/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "n46cu", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5m97b/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5m97b", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/fs8ze/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fs8ze/"}}], "links": {"first": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json", "last": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "prev": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=524", "next": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=526", "meta": {"total": 5469, "per_page": 10}}}
