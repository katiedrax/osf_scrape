T cell re-activation is currently effectuated through the FDA and EMA approved drugs Ipilimumab, Atezolizumab, Avelumab, Pembrolizumab, Durvalumab, and Nivolumab, which target the PD1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4/B7.1/2 inhibitory mechanisms. These treatment strategies are tested in various organs, combinations, and lines of treatment. The drugs are highly efficient in patients with tumors that have a high mutation burden, mismatch repair deficiency/microsatellite instability, and high levels of tumor-infiltrating T cells, which are hallmarks of the hereditary cancer syndrome, Lynch syndrome. Though inclusion in clinical studies is based on patients having this tumor phenotype, up against 50% does not respond and predictive biomarkers are currently investigated to increase the response rates. \n\nReview questions\nThis scoping review aims to: \n1)\tSystematically map current knowledge and gaps in the literature on the outcome from the FDA and EMA approved T-cell activating drugs Ipilimumab, Pembrolizumab, Atezolizumab, Avelumab, Durvalumab, and Nivolumab in patients with mismatch repair deficient/microsatellite instable tumors?

There are no selection criteria regarding tumor type. \n\nConcept\nAll patients have been treated with the FDA and EMA approved T cell activating drugs Ipilimumab, Pembrolizumab, Avelumab, Atezolizumab, Durvalumab, or Nivolumab and tumor progression or regression (scored according to the RECIST criteria) and/or overall/progression-free survival have been collected in a medical setting. For some studies, biomarkers may have been investigated retrospectively to determine their predictive value. \n\nContext\nAll periods of time and duration of follow-up before March 20, 2020, are eligible. \n\nPrimary outcomes (optional)\nPrimary outcomes include: objective response rate, overall survival, progression-free survival, progressive disease, resistance and biomarker analyses (protein analyses, gene expression analyses or DNA mutation analyses) on immune response and immune evasion pathways. \n\nSecondary outcomes (optional)\nSecondary outcomes include: all of the primary outcomes described above but specifically in Lynch syndrome patients.\n\nData extraction\nThe full set of titles and abstracts retrieved will be independently screened for eligibility by three authors (Maria Rasmussen and Christina Therkildsen) and the level of agreement will be discussed. A pilot search has been conducted to study the selection criteria and compare articles identified in the beginning and end of the screening process. A third reviewer (Jon Durhuus) will be consulted where agreement cannot be achieved. \nA standardized data extraction formula will be developed and pilot-tested among all reviewers. Data extraction will include: tumor type (e.g. location, organ, level of mismatch repair deficiency, level of microsatellite instability), treatment regimen (e.g. pharmaceutical drug used, line of treatment, combinational treatment, period), outcome (e.g. objective response rate, overall survival, progression-free survival, resistance), and biomarkers (e.g. name of the protein/genes, type of analyses, level of expression, percentage of positive tumors).  All studies need to be on homo sapiens and written in English. Conference abstracts will be screened, but only included if all requested data are available.\n\nRisk of quality assessment\nSince this is a scoping review, quality assessment will not be conducted.\n\nStrategy of synthesis\nThe synthesis will focus on providing: 1) mapping the outcomes from checkpoint-based immunotherapy in patients with mismatch repair deficient/microsatellite instable tumors and 2) describe the predictive value of immune response and immune evasion-related possible up-coming biomarkers associated with tumor-induced immune evasion mechanisms.\n\nReview general information\nType of review\nScoping review\n\nLanguage\nEnglish\n\nCountry\nDenmark\n\nDissemination plans\nResults will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nKeywords\nImmunotherapy, mismatch repair deficient cancer, microsatellite instability, scoping review, predictive biomarkers\n\nCurrent review status\nOngoing (reviewing title and abstract)", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-20T13:29:17.034316", "date_modified": "2020-04-20T13:05:04.158868", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Clinical Research Centre", "Copenhagen University Hospital", "Denmark.

Who is at risk of developing mental-health issues during the pandemic? Results from data-collection in a recent COVID-19 related project, aiming to delineate the role of general risk attitudes in shaping perceptions of the pandemic (and vice versa \u2013 see preregistration protocol: https://osf.io/cexyu), showed that people with a general disposition towards being risk averse exhibited more COVID-19 related anxiety. The predictive power of general risk attitude (GRA) in predicting COVID-19 related anxiety was much stronger than for age, income, and, educational level. It also was independent of gender (which also showed strong predictive power), domain-specific risk attitudes, frequency measures of everyday risk taking, and general decision-making skill (measures for which there was no predictive power). \nThis is concerning because risk aversion and trait anxiety can together propel behavior such as panic buying, avoidance behavior leading to overly limited socialization, and self-medication. Moreover, being risk averse is a common trait, and the results thus hints the concerning possibility that many individuals in the general population may develop mental-health problems that are not easily fixed by providing safety nets (e.g., proper health care health risk-groups and economic risk-groups, since the anxiousness may be situated in a more dispositional manner.\nThe present study will examine the effect of GRA in greater detail, delineating possible mediators and moderators.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-20T12:23:47.234781", "date_modified": "2020-04-20T12:17:19.974850", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["Anxiety", "COVID-19", "Psychology", "Risk"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "b1db42be621deed1a9df879da545f62880874ca6ad09ea0d36b9e4168a982b9d0f32ffdf9543dd92ab5e1e2792e260e8e302490d0bf8ee073c8f50ff5e1684da509d418c6761367d453d9cb8b20c74f3d46f504c95c6aefa88f8c84ed3c6796c7664248dfc3c6c87fa747231ccce681de184392a01601c981e2a65260ef057edbfe07239393378999f4154b8388aca03", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-20T12:23:47.217913", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Philip Millroth"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "1.\tTest if the finding that GRA predict COVID-Anxiety can be replicated (Bayesian factorial regression with COVID-Anxiety derived from best items from measures 8 and 9 as the dependent variable and GRA (derived from measure 6) as covariate.

Most silhouettes were acquired through internet search using Google Images (images.google.com) under the creative commons license, searching either directly for silhouettes or images that we edited into black-white-silhouettes using GIMP. \n\nWe restricted our image search to images labelled \u201cavailable for reuse with modification\u201d.\nThe sources of the silhouettes are most notably Pixabay (pixabay.com; n = 477), CleanPNG (cleanpng.com; n = 34), and svgsilh (svgsilh.com; n = 32). Twenty silhouettes were created for this project by a graphic designer. We collected a wide range of images, depicting persons, animals, objects, and scenes, which we indicate in a category column in the database for easier stimulus selection. Special focus was put on collecting images of a wide range of valence (positive, negative, and neutral) as well as arousal (low, medium, and high). Every image was scaled and/or cropped to a size of 300 x 300 pixels. \n\nIn a series of pre-studies (online and in the lab) we collected valence, arousal and clarity ratings (\u2018How clearly can you tell what is depicted on the picture?\u2019) on 9pt Likert scales from a total of 180 German-speakers (preregistration under https://osf.io/yecxk), as well as 50 Chinese-speakers. Based on this data, we excluded those black-on-white silhouette images, that received a mean clarity rating of less than 4.5 (from either language group) (n = 11). We then identified those images with a mean clarity rating higher than 4.5 but lower than 5.5 (again from either language group) (n = 44), which were assessed individually by CK and GL. In this process, another 26 images were excluded from the silhouette stimulus set, resulting in a total of 37 exclusions, which means that from the 620 original images, 583 silhouettes remained in the database. \n\nBased on the rating data from the remaining 583 black-on-white silhouettes, we divided the data into 3 equal parts to define cut-off points for the three valence categories (negative: 1\u20134.83, neutral: 4.84\u20136.53, positive: 6.54\u20138.7) and the three arousal categories (low: 2.38\u20134.69, mid: 4.7\u20135.83, high: 5.84\u20138.84). We pseudo-randomly assigned the 583 silhouette images to 4 stimulus lists (3 * 146 + 1 * 145), making sure that across all 4 lists, mean clarity, mean valence and mean arousal were similar, and that the number of stimuli across the 3 \u00d7 3 affective categories (valence \u00d7 arousal) was comparable. Where this was not the case, CK manually reassigned stimuli to lists until the values for each criterion mentioned above were largely comparable.\n\n2.2 Participants\nWe plan to recruit 800 participants representative of the US population on Prolific (https://www.prolific.co/). After successful participation in the study, participants will receive monetary compensation. Participants will be randomly assigned to a stimulus list and a rating condition (either valence or arousal).\n\nWith this sample size, there will be 400 subjects for valence ratings and also 400 for arousal ratings, each divided into 4 lists, hence around 100 ratings per image. With 100 ratings, the 95% CI of the aggregate mean rating for each image is estimated (Kauermann &amp; K\u00fcchenhoff, 2011; Manitz, 2017) to be generally within a reasonably narrow range: within a 0.50 point range for valence and within a 0.64 point range for arousal, on the 9 point scale; based on the mean of image ratings SDs (1.28 for valence, 1.64 for arousal) from our pilot study with Austrian students.\n\n2.3 Procedure / Data collection\n\n### General Procedure: After presenting the informed consent and asking for demographical data, we explain the terms valance or arousal to the participants, depending on which rating condition the participant is assigned to. After the instruction, the experiment starts. Participants see a silhouette stimulus (300 x 300 px) on a grey background (hex color #808080) for 2 seconds. After this time has elapsed, the image disappears and is replaced by the rating scale (again, depending on the participant\u2019s rating condition) \u2013 either a valence rating scale (9 pt Likert scale from very negative to very positive), or an arousal scale (9 pt Likert scale from very low to very high). Participants can enter their ratings via clicks on the scales and submit their rating by pressing a button that appears below the scales as soon as a rating value is selected, or they can skip the rating. After confirming their choice by pressing the submit button, the next image appears on screen, and so on. A total of 146 or a total of 145 images (see Material) is presented to each participant. We incorporate two attention checks:\n\n### Attention Check 1: After all items that have to be rated have been displayed, a silhouette image is shown for which participants have to indicate, what was depicted on it. Participants, who do not answer this question correctly, will have failed Attention Check 1.\n\n### Attention Check 2: We will measure intrarater reliability by presenting again 10 previously rated pictures at the end of the test: Five from among the most negatively rated and five from among the most positively rated images. We then correlate (Spearman\u2019s Rho) the ratings for these with the ones previously given for the same images. \n\n\n2.4 Exclusions\n\n### Skipped images: For each silhouette, participants have the option to skip the rating. Data from participants who skip the rating for more than 20% of the items will be excluded. \n\n### Attention Checks: All participants who have an intrarater reliability with a rho smaller than .7 will be excluded. Participants who fail Attention Check 1 AND have an intrarater reliability with a rho smaller than .8 will also be excluded.\n\n3 Statistical Analysis\nTo assess the image ratings, we will report extensive descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations of ratings per image, their correlations, and rater reliabilities) as well as the potential effects of conventional demographic variables, largely following the paper by Kurdi et al. (2017). \n\n4. References\n\nKauermann, G., &amp; K\u00fcchenhoff, H. (2011). Stichproben: Methoden und praktische Umsetzung mit R. Springer-Verlag.

This latter search will focus on systematic reviews.\n\nEligibility Criteria\nPopulation: Studies focused on deceased individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, SARS or MERS will be eligible for inclusion. \n\nIntervention: Studies addressing the safe management of dead bodies amongst the above stated population will be included. This will address the handling during different phases of the process, including: \n\u2022\tthe preparation of the corpse (e.g., embalming);\n\u2022\ttransfer of the corpse;\n\u2022\thandling during religious rituals;\n\u2022\tstorage of the corpse (e.g. morgues, ice rinks (one proposed strategy in Canada \u2013 just an example))\n\u2022\tdisposal of the corpse (burial, cremation).\n\nComparator: Alternative ways of management of dead bodies (to be finalized through the literature review)\n\nOutcomes: \n\u2022\tRisk of COVID19 transmission to individuals handling the corpses and others exposed (e.g. relatives).

The effect measures for these outcomes will depend on study design and available data.  \n\nStudy Design: No restrictions will be placed on study design. However, evidence will be prioritized by study design as follows: i) randomized controlled trials ii) non-randomized comparative studies; iii) non-comparative studies (i.e., case reports, case series); iv) qualitative studies; or v) mechanistic studies. We will also review modelling studies.\n\nLanguage: We will not apply any language restrictions.\n\nStudy Selection\nSearch results will be imported into a single EndNote database and duplicates will be identified and removed. A PRISMA flow diagram will be used to report the flow of studies throughout the selection process. All screening will be conducted using Covidence software.\n\nWe will use the standard systematic review approach for primary studies. Specifically, all reviewers will pilot-test a title and abstract screening guide using the same 30 abstracts. Once the form is calibrated, reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts in duplicate. Articles deemed potentially relevant by either reviewer will move on to full-text screening. All reviewers will pilot-test a full-text screening form using the same 5 full-text articles. Once the form is calibrated, two reviewers will independently screen full-texts and disagreement will be resolved by a third reviewer. We will record the primary reason for exclusion at the full-text screening stage.\n\nData Extraction\nTwo independent reviewers will extract data. Minimal data will be extracted addressing the following domains: study identifier; study design; setting; population characteristics; intervention and comparator characteristics; outcomes (quantitative if possible); source of funding and reported conflicts of interests; ethical approval; study limitations or other important comments. One reviewer will extract data for identified guidance documents and a second reviewer would verify the extracted data.\n\nRisk of Bias Assessment\nOne reviewer will perform risk of bias assessments and a second reviewer will verify all assessments. We will use the Cochrane risk of bias tool (version 2) for randomized controlled trials, and the Newcastle Ottawa scale for non-randomized studies.\n\nSynthesis\nWe will synthesize data in both tabular and narrative formats. We will conduct meta-analyses depending on the nature of the collected data. A single reviewer will grade the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach and a second reviewer will verify all assessments. If applicable, we will follow published guidance for rating the certainty in evidence in the absence\nof a single estimate of effect (2, 3). Evidence will be presented using GRADE Evidence Profiles developed in the GRADEpro (www.gradepro.org) software (4, 5).\n\nDissemination Plan\nIn addition to preparing a report for WHO, we will disseminate the findings to the scientific community through publication in a peer-reviewed journal and by making it available directly to core stakeholders as reports.\n\nOrganizational Affiliation of the Review: WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Diseases, Research Methods and Recommendations and the Michael G.
