It is wildly used in digestive diseases by strengthening the spleen, replenishing qi, and invigorating bloodm and has been proved by the China Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic gastritis (approved No. Z20040003). More and more clinical studies have reported the application of WFC for better efficacy in patients with CAG[7,8]. According the consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of integrated Chinese and Western medicine for chronic atrophic gastritis in 2017, WFC was recommended as an alternative treatment for CAG[9]. However, the consensus did not grade the quality level of evidence of this patent medicine. A systematic review is urgently needed to support the effectiveness and safety of WFC.

Epidemiological studies have reported that 20% of people over 20 years old suffer from rotator cuff tears, while 25% of people over 50 years old suffer from rotator cuff tears, which is the main cause of shoulder joint pain and dysfunction and greatly affects patients\u2019 work efficiency and quality of life. An epidemiological study in the United States reports that 4.5 million people are hospitalized every year for Rotator cuff tears. The rotator cuff is composed of supraspinatus muscle, infraspinatus muscle, subscapularis muscle and teres minor muscle. It starts from the shoulder rib and attaches around the humeral head, forming a sleeve like structure at the anatomical neck of the humeral head. The function of the rotator cuff is to support and stabilize the shoulder and humeral joint, maintain the sealing function of the shoulder joint cavity, maintain the synovial fluid to nourish the articular cartilage, and prevent the secondary osteoarthritis. The treatment principle of rotator cuff tears is to reduce pain and improve the function of shoulder joint. The most common actions taken at present to relieve the symptoms of rotator cuff tears include steroid injections, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physical therapy, exercise therapy, manual therapy, ultrasound therapy and acupuncture. In practice, people with rotator cuff tears seldom receive a single intervention in isolation. Acupuncture and manual therapy usually delivered together as components of a physical therapy intervention, are commonly used in the management of rotator cuff tears. Acupuncture is commonly used for musculoskeletal disorders, and it has been suggested as a meaningful nonsurgical intervention for managing shoulder pain and dysfunction. Manual therapy is also commonly used in the management of rotator cuff tears. Manual therapy includes any clinician-applied movement of the joints and other structures, for example mobilization (of which several types exist) or manipulation. The aims of both types of interventions are to improve function, promote healing, increase joint range, strengthen weakened muscles and correct imbalance in the stabilizing function of the rotator cuff. The mechanism of acupuncture treatment has not been fully elucidated. Some studies have pointed out that the mechanism of acupuncture and moxibustion treatment may be related to the local effect, which refers to the release of neuropeptide and other substances by stimulating the sensory nerve endings of skin and muscle tissue. The research shows that acupuncture can promote the release of \u03b2-endorphin and increase the concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine in brain tissue, so as to reduce the sensitivity of tissue to pain and improve joint activity. Manual therapy can stimulate peripheral mechanoreceptors and inhibit nociceptors to reducing pain, and can enhance exchange between synovial \ufb02uid and cartilage matrix to increasing joint mobility. Previous systematic reviews have not assessed acupuncture and manual therapy for rotator cuff tears together. Consequently, we decided to conduct a systematic review based on the best currently available evidence and methodology to evaluate whether acupuncture and manual therapy is effect and safety for pain and function of rotator cuff tears.
