The Intergroup Anxiety scale (Stephan &amp; Stephan, 1985) will measure negative emotions toward interacting with a group of African Americans (i.e., 0 = not at all, 9 = extremely). Participants will be asked to indicate the extent to which they feel each of six negative items (e.g., uncertain, worried, awkward, anxious, threatened, and nervous) and six positive items (e.g., comfortable, trusting, friendly, confident, safe, and at ease). Positive items will be reverse-coded, and items will be combined to form a measure of intergroup anxiety. \n\nSelf-compassion. Self-compassion will be measured using the 12-item Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form (Raes, Pommier, Neff, &amp; Van Gucht, 2011). An example item includes: \u201cI try to see my failings as part of the human condition\u201d and the scale is measured using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Almost never, 5 = Almost always).\n\nGroup identification. Study 2 will include a measure of group identification. The 4-item importance to identity subscale of the Collective Self-Esteem scale will be used (Luhtanen &amp; Crocker, 1992). The race-specific version of the scale will be used to examine importance of one\u2019s identity as a White American. An example item includes \u201cThe racial/ethnic group I belong to is an important reflection of who I am\u201d (1 = strongly disagree; 7 = strongly agree). Participants will also be asked to answer the following question: \"How strongly identified do you feel toward your ethnic/racial group?\" (1 = not at all strongly; 4 = very strongly). \n\nOutgroup attitudes. Participants will be asked to provide their attitudes toward African Americans. Following Amiot and Hornsey (2010), participants will first be given feeling thermometers (e.g., 0 to 100, cold/warm, unfriendly/friendly, distant/close, different/similar) and asked to indicate the amount of warmth they feel toward African Americans. Then, participants will be provided with a series of adjectives (i.e., intelligent, friendly, likeable, immature, cultivated, boring, talented, sympathetic, stubborn, trustworthy, bad, dishonest, truthful) and asked to indicate how they believe African Americans rank on each adjective (i.e., 1 = not at all; 9 = extremely). Negative adjectives will be reverse-coded, meaning that higher scores will indicate more positive ratings for African Americans. The feeling thermometers and adjectives will be standardized and combined to form a single index of attitudes toward African Americans. To mask the interest in collecting responses toward African Americans, participants will make feeling thermometer ratings toward 4 other racial categories (White, Hispanic, Asian, and other ethnic Americans). Participants will also rate White and other ethnic Americans on the adjectives ratings. \n\nJob candidate evaluation. Study 2 measures will also include a measure of outgroup prejudice as operationalized by evaluation of an outgroup job candidate (vs. an ingroup candidate). Participants\u2019 ratings of the job candidate\u2019s qualifications will be measured using four items used in Fein &amp; Spencer (1997): \u201cI feel this person would make an excellent candidate for the position in question,\u201d \u201cI would likely give this person serious consideration for the position in question,\u201d \u201cI would guess that this person is in the top 20% of people interviewed,\u201d and \u201cI felt favorably toward this person\u201d (1= strongly disagree; 7= strongly agree)."}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Study2_Qualtrics_Measures.docx"}, "nodeId": "wd92y", "sha256": "38b39542223085066de45e8bdd16bd71e5dffc9043448a9e28daf53a88e638e0", "viewUrl": "/project/n6am5/files/osfstorage/5e83a5db1ab243017fe02bf0/", "selectedFileName": "Study2_Qualtrics_Measures.docx"}], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q19": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "First, in a regression analysis, condition (1 = self-affirmation; 0 = control), job candidate (1 = outgroup; 0 = ingroup), and their interaction will be examined as a predictor of the two prejudice outcomes: outgroup attitudes and job candidate ratings.

In addition, a person with similar educational experience will provide feedback on candidate qualifications. Candidate qualifications will furthermore be pretested with a different sample to determine how well qualified the candidate qualifications are for the job position.  Photos for the purported job candidates are chosen from the Chicago Face Database (Photos BM-232 &amp; WM-254; Ma, Correll, &amp; Wittenbrink, 2015). The job position will be adapted from a real job ad posted online. ", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Intergroup anxiety. The Intergroup Anxiety scale (Stephan &amp; Stephan, 1985) will measure negative emotions toward interacting with a group of African Americans (i.e., 0 = not at all, 9 = extremely). Participants will be asked to indicate the extent to which they feel each of six negative items (e.g., uncertain, worried, awkward, anxious, threatened, and nervous) and six positive items (e.g., comfortable, trusting, friendly, confident, safe, and at ease). Positive items will be reverse-coded, and items will be combined to form a measure of intergroup anxiety. \n\nSelf-compassion. Self-compassion will be measured using the 12-item Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form (Raes, Pommier, Neff, &amp; Van Gucht, 2011). An example item includes: \u201cI try to see my failings as part of the human condition\u201d and the scale is measured using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Almost never, 5 = Almost always).\n\nGroup identification. Study 2 will include a measure of group identification. The 4-item importance to identity subscale of the Collective Self-Esteem scale will be used (Luhtanen &amp; Crocker, 1992). The race-specific version of the scale will be used to examine importance of one\u2019s identity as a White American. An example item includes \u201cThe racial/ethnic group I belong to is an important reflection of who I am\u201d (1 = strongly disagree; 7 = strongly agree). Participants will also be asked to answer the following question: \"How strongly identified do you feel toward your ethnic/racial group?\" (1 = not at all strongly; 4 = very strongly). \n\nOutgroup attitudes. Participants will be asked to provide their attitudes toward African Americans. Following Amiot and Hornsey (2010), participants will first be given feeling thermometers (e.g., 0 to 100, cold/warm, unfriendly/friendly, distant/close, different/similar) and asked to indicate the amount of warmth they feel toward African Americans. Then, participants will be provided with a series of adjectives (i.e., intelligent, friendly, likeable, immature, cultivated, boring, talented, sympathetic, stubborn, trustworthy, bad, dishonest, truthful) and asked to indicate how they believe African Americans rank on each adjective (i.e., 1 = not at all; 9 = extremely). Negative adjectives will be reverse-coded, meaning that higher scores will indicate more positive ratings for African Americans. The feeling thermometers and adjectives will be standardized and combined to form a single index of attitudes toward African Americans. To mask the interest in collecting responses toward African Americans, participants will make feeling thermometer ratings toward 4 other racial categories (White, Hispanic, Asian, and other ethnic Americans). Participants will also rate White and other ethnic Americans on the adjectives ratings. \n\nJob candidate evaluation. Study 2 measures will also include a measure of outgroup prejudice as operationalized by evaluation of an outgroup job candidate (vs. an ingroup candidate). Participants\u2019 ratings of the job candidate\u2019s qualifications will be measured using four items used in Fein &amp; Spencer (1997): \u201cI feel this person would make an excellent candidate for the position in question,\u201d \u201cI would likely give this person serious consideration for the position in question,\u201d \u201cI would guess that this person is in the top 20% of people interviewed,\u201d and \u201cI felt favorably toward this person\u201d (1= strongly disagree; 7= strongly agree).", "q17.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e83a5db1ab243017fe02bf0", "file_name": "Study2_Qualtrics_Measures.docx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/n6am5/files/osfstorage/5e83a5db1ab243017fe02bf0", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e83a5db1ab243017fe02bf0"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "38b39542223085066de45e8bdd16bd71e5dffc9043448a9e28daf53a88e638e0"}}], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "First, in a regression analysis, condition (1 = self-affirmation; 0 = control), job candidate (1 = outgroup; 0 = ingroup), and their interaction will be examined as a predictor of the two prejudice outcomes: outgroup attitudes and job candidate ratings. It will be examined using contrast analyses whether the self-affirmation/outgroup conditions (3) are significantly different from the self-affirmation/ingroup (-1), control/outgroup (-1), and control/ingroup (-1) conditions. Then, to test the theoretical model depicted in Figure 2, the PROCESS macro (Version 3; Hayes, 2013) will be used to determine the parallel mediational influences of intergroup anxiety and self-compassion, and the moderating influences of group identification, on both prejudice outcomes. Group identification will be examined as a moderator of two pathways: the path between self-affirmation and intergroup anxiety, and the path between self-affirmation and outgroup attitudes.
