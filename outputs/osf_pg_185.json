So, the question remains that if the TMT manipulations are ineffective at all or if there are some working manipulations to study death anxiety. In this study, we will test three different MS manipulations that were claimed to be working in the literature (Cox et al., 2009; Kesebir, 2014; Luo, Shi, Yang, Wang, and Han, 2014) and compare these manipulations to identify an effective MS manipulation. \n\nIn the first MS manipulation, Cox et al.

In this task, participants will solve a very simple anagram. \n\nIn the second experiment (Cox et al., 2009), the participants in the experimental MS condition will complete Fear of Death Anxiety Scale (Templar, 1970) and the participants in the control conditions will complete an identical scale that measures fear of public speaking. Then the participants will complete PANAS (Watson, and, Tellegen,1998). After that participants will complete a 5-minute task (of delay). In this task, participants will solve a very simple anagram. \n\nIn the third experiment  (Luo, Shi, Yang, Wang and, Han, 2014), the participants in the experimental MS condition will rate twenty-eight statements on negative emotions related to death and participants in the control condition will rate twenty-eight statements on negative emotions (unrelated to death). Then the participants will complete PANAS (Watson, Clark, and Tellegen, 1998). After that participants will complete a 5-minute task (of delay). In this task, participants will solve a very simple anagram. \n\nAfter completing these tasks, all participants will be asked how difficult the tasks were and then they will complete two separate manipulation check tasks. In the first task all participants will rate 5 questions (see the survey questions on the attached document) adapted from Lou at al., (2014) on a 10-point Likert type scale (1 refers to Not at all and 10 refers to Extremely). In the second task, participants will complete the death-thought accessibility scale (Greenberg, Pyszczynski, Solomon, Simon, and Breus, 1994).\n\n\n\n\n", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. This scale was prepared by Watson, Clark, and Tellegen (1998). The scale consists of 20 different adjectives.

Participants will rate 5 questions (see the survey questions on the attached document) on a 10-point Likert type scale (1 refers to Not at all and 10 refers to Extremely). Three of the questions are about death-related anxiety and 2 of them are about unpleasant feelings.  \n\nDeath-Thought Accessibility. This measurement tool was prepared by Greenberg, Pyszczynski, Solomon, Simon, and Breus (1994). There are 25 incomplete words. 7 of them can be completed by both death-related and neutral words. Others can be completed by only neutral words. \n\nVignettes and related questions: A protagonist in each vignette violates some moral motive of a specific social-relational situation. The vignettes and questions were adopted from Dalgar (2019) and measures how participants evaluate the emotional and motivational condition of the protagonist after each vignette. \n\nDemographic questions; date of birth, sex, educational level, educational level of individual's own mother, monthly income range, and perceived socioeconomic state, religious and political orientations. \n\nDelay task which consists of anagram puzzle and related question about the difficulty of the puzzle was prepared by Do\u011fulu (2017). \n\n\n\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "A principal component analysis with 5 items of manipulation check that was adapted from Lou et al.

The frequency of death-related words will be computed. \n\nPositive affect and negative affect variables will be computed by the mean of the related items.

essential for the informative value and predictive power of systematic reviews/meta-analysis in medical research, as their results are used for treatment recommendations or development of clinical guidelines. Accordingly, evaluation of internal and external validity of clinical trials, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is a key step for research implantation into clinical practice (J\u00fcni, Altman &amp; Egger, 2001). Internal validity considers how robust the study was conducted and reported. The focus of internal validity is the methodological quality as well as risk of bias of a study and allows a judgement as to how far the measured effects can be trusted (Cochrane Germany, 2016). External validity indicates whether study results can be transferred to another (patient) population, situation and/or circumstance (clinical context). Its evaluation depends on the specificity of the research question, the inclusion and exclusion criteria and the setting of the study (Cochrane Germany, 2016).\nIn health research, however, external validity is often neglected within the quality assessment process of clinical studies (Burchett et al., 2018; Dekkers et al., 2009). One possible explanation might be the lack of a gold standard for assessing external validity of clinical trials. Some reviews have examined frameworks and tools for assessing external validity of clinical trials in health research (Burchett et al., 2011; Cambon et al., 2012; Dyrvig et al., 2014; Nasser et al., 2011). New measurement instruments have been published since then. To our knowledge no comprehensive evaluation of the psychometric properties of measurement tools has been performed yet. In addition, consensus regarding terminology, criteria and evaluation of external validity in medical research is currently missing (Burchett et al., 2018; Burford et al., 2013; Dekkers et al., 2009). Accordingly, there is a need to scientifically evaluate the psychometric properties of tools to measure the external validity of clinical trials. This seems to be particularly important in the case of RCTs, as this research design is considered to be most suitable for investigating cause and effects mechanisms. Depending on the results of this planned review, the need to develop a new measurement tool for this purpose will be evaluated.\nThere is evidence that the accuracy of external validity assessment depends on the study design of the study considered for evaluation (Bornh\u00f6ft et al., 2006; Gartlehner et al., 2006; Thorpe et al., 2009). Furthermore, it was shown, that for instance, the reliability of external validity evaluations with the same measurement tool differs between randomized and non-randomized trials (Downs &amp; Out, 1998). In addition, due to differences in requested information for reporting guidelines, e.g. CONSORT, STROBE, respective items used for assessing the external validity can vary between different research designs. In line with the importance of RCTs in the medical field, this planned review will focus on measurement tools evaluating external validity of RCTs.\n\nThe aim of this review is to identify tools to measure the external validity of RCTs and to further evaluate their psychometric properties. Objectives:\n1.\tTo identify published measurement tools to assess the external validity of RCTs.\n2.\tTo analyze the characteristics and restrictions of these measurement tools in terms of terminology and criteria for assessing external validity.\n3.\tTo evaluate psychometric properties of tools to assess the external validity of RCTs.\n4.\tTo make recommendations for or against the use of tools to assess the external validity of RCTs in future systematic reviews.\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "We hypothesize varying and incomplete psychometric evaluations and psychometric properties of the existing tools to measure the external validity of RCTs.

A literature search will be carried out to identify published tools to assess the external validity of RCTs. Abstracts and full\u2010text screening will be performed independently by two researchers, in relation to a priori defined in- and exclusion criteria. \n(see Appendix 1: search strategy and inclusion criteria)\n\nNext, a literature search will be carried out for studies evaluating psychometric properties of each prior included tool. Data extraction will be performed independently by two researchers (see Appendix 1).\n\nAs an intermediate step, we will perform a scoping review evaluating the characteristics as well as limitations of existing quality assessment tools that include adequate items to assess the external validity of clinical trials. The summary and report of the results for the scoping review will be carried out based on recommendations of Arksey &amp; O\u2019Malley (2005) and Colquhoun et al. (2014).\n\n\nRisk of bias assessment\nThe risk of bias assessment will be carried out using the COSMIN tool (Mokkink et al., 2018b) to evaluate robustness of the applied methods and the quality of the psychometric properties of the included tools. The COSMIN checklist is a valid tool (Mokkink et al. 2010a; Mokkink et al. 2010b; Mokkink et al. 2017; Terwee et al., 2018) designed for systematic evaluation of methodological quality in studies assessing the psychometric properties of health measurement instruments (Mokkink et al., 2018b). Although this checklist was specifically developed for systematic reviews of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), it can also be used for reviews of non-PROMs (Prinsen et al., 2018). As mentioned in the COSMIN user manual, adaptations for some items in the COSMIN Risk of Bias checklist might be necessary, in relation to the construct being measured (Mokkink et al., 2018c, p. 9). Therefore, we will perform pilot tests of the assessment of psychometric properties of measurement tools assessing the quality (internal validity/methodological quality) of RCTs, to ensure feasibility and reliability during the planned evaluation of the included tools. After each testing, results and problems regarding the comprehensibility and feasibility of the instructions, items and response options will be discussed. If needed, adaptations and/or supplements will be done for the instruction of the evaluation with the COSMIN risk of bias checklist. Adaptations will be done until saturation has been reached. To ensure face validity, no items of the COSMIN risk of bias tool will be modified, but we consider to specify some items if appropriate. Pilot-tests will be performed before data extraction. After data extraction, all included psychometric studies will be systematically evaluated by two independent reviewers. In case of disagreement, a third reviewer will be available to discuss and achieve consensus.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Appendix 1_search strategy.pdf"}, "nodeId": "cynaf", "sha256": "89067c18aab86cee0462180a245613eba01868fcfe317ed2c395505a436eff03", "viewUrl": "/project/ptg4d/files/osfstorage/5e6244b00f987d02004972c2/", "selectedFileName": "Appendix 1_search strategy.pdf"}], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "N/A.

Journal of clinical epidemiology, 62(5), 464-475.\n", "q8.question": "systematic review of psychometric properties", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "This systematic review will be carried out in accordance with the Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement (Liberati et al., 2009) and the COSMIN methodology for systematic reviews of measurement instruments in health sciences (Mokkink et al., 2018a; Prinsen et al., 2018; Terwee et al., 2018). \n\n\nLiterature search, data extraction and management\nThe eligibility criteria and search strategy will be elaborated in collaboration with a research librarian. A literature search will be carried out to identify published tools to assess the external validity of RCTs. Abstracts and full\u2010text screening will be performed independently by two researchers, in relation to a priori defined in- and exclusion criteria. \n(see Appendix 1: search strategy and inclusion criteria)\n\nNext, a literature search will be carried out for studies evaluating psychometric properties of each prior included tool. Data extraction will be performed independently by two researchers (see Appendix 1).\n\nAs an intermediate step, we will perform a scoping review evaluating the characteristics as well as limitations of existing quality assessment tools that include adequate items to assess the external validity of clinical trials. The summary and report of the results for the scoping review will be carried out based on recommendations of Arksey &amp; O\u2019Malley (2005) and Colquhoun et al. (2014).\n\n\nRisk of bias assessment\nThe risk of bias assessment will be carried out using the COSMIN tool (Mokkink et al., 2018b) to evaluate robustness of the applied methods and the quality of the psychometric properties of the included tools. The COSMIN checklist is a valid tool (Mokkink et al. 2010a; Mokkink et al. 2010b; Mokkink et al. 2017; Terwee et al., 2018) designed for systematic evaluation of methodological quality in studies assessing the psychometric properties of health measurement instruments (Mokkink et al., 2018b). Although this checklist was specifically developed for systematic reviews of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), it can also be used for reviews of non-PROMs (Prinsen et al., 2018). As mentioned in the COSMIN user manual, adaptations for some items in the COSMIN Risk of Bias checklist might be necessary, in relation to the construct being measured (Mokkink et al., 2018c, p. 9). Therefore, we will perform pilot tests of the assessment of psychometric properties of measurement tools assessing the quality (internal validity/methodological quality) of RCTs, to ensure feasibility and reliability during the planned evaluation of the included tools. After each testing, results and problems regarding the comprehensibility and feasibility of the instructions, items and response options will be discussed. If needed, adaptations and/or supplements will be done for the instruction of the evaluation with the COSMIN risk of bias checklist. Adaptations will be done until saturation has been reached. To ensure face validity, no items of the COSMIN risk of bias tool will be modified, but we consider to specify some items if appropriate. Pilot-tests will be performed before data extraction. After data extraction, all included psychometric studies will be systematically evaluated by two independent reviewers. In case of disagreement, a third reviewer will be available to discuss and achieve consensus.\n", "q12.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e6244b00f987d02004972c2", "file_name": "Appendix 1_search strategy.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/ptg4d/files/osfstorage/5e6244b00f987d02004972c2", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e6244b00f987d02004972c2"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "89067c18aab86cee0462180a245613eba01868fcfe317ed2c395505a436eff03"}}], "q16.question": "N/A", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Characteristics and limitations of tools: interpretability, feasibility and psychometric properties of included tools according to COSMIN methodology.

We will use the revised version by Hetmann (2018). It consists of 13 items for 'belief in free will' and 10 items for 'belief in free act'. Participants answer the items on a 5-point scale. Before filling out the questionnaire, the participants will be given a text, which defines free will and free act and gives the reader an idea of the difference between the two concepts. After the text the participants have to answer two comprehension questions about it.\n\nIn addition, 'belief in free will' will be measured with the subscale \"free will\" of the FAD-Plus by Paulhus and Carey (2011). It consists of 7 items, which are answered on a 5-point scale.\n\nThe construct 'motivation to empathy' will be measured with the subscale \"perspective taking\" of the \"Saarbr\u00fccker Pers\u00f6nlichkeitsfragebogen\" by Paulus (2009). This scale is the German version of the \"Interpersonal Reactivity Index \" (IRI; Davis, 1980). This subscale consists of four items, which are answered on a 5-point-scale.\n\nThe construct 'search for causes of crime' will be measured with a newly developed 1-item-scale. Participants will be asked 'What do you think, which factors can have an influence, why persons commit crimes?'. They can choose out of 29 possible answers, where they can pick as much answers as they would like to. \n\nThe construct 'retributional punishment' will be measured with the scale 'Retribution as Revenge and Retribution as Just Deserts' by Gerber and Jackson (2013). For the usage the scale was translated into German. The scale consists of 12 items, which are answered on a 7-point scale.\n\nThe construct 'forgiveness of others' will be measured with the scale \"Skala der Bereitschaft zu verzeihen\" (SBV) by Allemand, Sassin-Meng, Huber and Schmitt (2008). It consists of 8 fictional scenarios, where a perpetrator harms the participant. In 4 of the scenarios the perpetrator shows repentance, in the other 4 not. The participants are then asked, if they could forgive the perpetrator for this transgression completely. Answers are given on a 5-point scale.\n\nThe engagement with the issue of free will will be measured with a single item and answered on a 5-point scale.\n\nPolitical orientation and religiousness will be included as covariates in the analyses.\nPolitical orientation will be measured with a slider with the two poles 'left' and 'right'.\nReligiousness will as well be measured with a slider with the two poles 'non-religious' and 'religious'."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q19": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "To test hypotheses H1 and H5a we will compute a linear regression model with 8 predictors.

We will use the revised version by Hetmann (2018). It consists of 13 items for 'belief in free will' and 10 items for 'belief in free act'. Participants answer the items on a 5-point scale. Before filling out the questionnaire, the participants will be given a text, which defines free will and free act and gives the reader an idea of the difference between the two concepts. After the text the participants have to answer two comprehension questions about it.\n\nIn addition, 'belief in free will' will be measured with the subscale \"free will\" of the FAD-Plus by Paulhus and Carey (2011).

This scale is the German version of the \"Interpersonal Reactivity Index \" (IRI; Davis, 1980). This subscale consists of four items, which are answered on a 5-point-scale.\n\nThe construct 'search for causes of crime' will be measured with a newly developed 1-item-scale.

It consists of 8 fictional scenarios, where a perpetrator harms the participant. In 4 of the scenarios the perpetrator shows repentance, in the other 4 not. The participants are then asked, if they could forgive the perpetrator for this transgression completely. Answers are given on a 5-point scale.\n\nThe engagement with the issue of free will will be measured with a single item and answered on a 5-point scale.\n\nPolitical orientation and religiousness will be included as covariates in the analyses.\nPolitical orientation will be measured with a slider with the two poles 'left' and 'right'.\nReligiousness will as well be measured with a slider with the two poles 'non-religious' and 'religious'.", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "To test hypotheses H1 and H5a we will compute a linear regression model with 8 predictors.

We tried to replicate the main effect of analytic cognitive style on the likelihood to accept supernatural causation vs. effect of source of information (how the profile is \u201cproduced\u201d). Compared to original study (Bouvet &amp; Bonnefon, 2015) we extend the research by experimental design where we manipulated the analytic cognitive style as well as the source of the profile (psychology test vs. astrology profile), and by controlling prior paranormal beliefs, anomalous experiences, paranormal attribution to these experiences, and emotion (depression, anxiety) as possible mediators of the relationship between analytic cognitive style and gullibility. \nWe found out that analytic cognitive style together with the knowledge of the source of information (astrology vs. psychology) and prior paranormal beliefs (PBS) affected gullibility in case of uncanny event: people in psychology condition (psychological test as source of information) perceived the fake profile as more accurate (were more gullible), but source of information was only marginally significant predictor of gullibility; stronger predictors of gullibility were the analytic cognitive style and prior paranormal beliefs (PBS). \nThe main aim of the planned study is to support findings from Study 1: we will try to replicate the main effect of analytic cognitive style and the source of information (how the profile is \u201cproduced\u201d) on the likelihood to accept supernatural causation by expanded manipulation of the analytic cognitive style. Because in the Study 1 manipulation of analytic thinking through simple instruction did not work, in Study 2 we will modify the manipulation in two ways. First, we will manipulate cognitive style in two directions; we will induce analytic as well as intuitive cognitive style. Second, we will extend the manipulation form: we will use the verbal priming \u2013 instruction as well as task inducing analytic or intuitive cognitive style.\nOur main research questions are:\n1)\tDoes analytic cognitive style prevent gullibility and susceptibility to the paranormal explanation of uncanny event (in comparison to intuitive cognitive style and control condition)?\n2)\tOr possibly, is it the knowledge of the source of information that affects gullibility and susceptibility to the paranormal explanation of uncanny events?\n3)\tDo prior paranormal beliefs, proneness to anomalous experience and explanation, and negative emotionality predict gullibility and susceptibility to paranormal explanations of an uncanny event over and above analytical thinking?"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "We plan a 3x2 experiment with between-participant design.

Compared to original study (Bouvet &amp; Bonnefon, 2015) we extend the research by experimental design where we manipulated the analytic cognitive style as well as the source of the profile (psychology test vs. astrology profile), and by controlling prior paranormal beliefs, anomalous experiences, paranormal attribution to these experiences, and emotion (depression, anxiety) as possible mediators of the relationship between analytic cognitive style and gullibility. \nWe found out that analytic cognitive style together with the knowledge of the source of information (astrology vs. psychology) and prior paranormal beliefs (PBS) affected gullibility in case of uncanny event: people in psychology condition (psychological test as source of information) perceived the fake profile as more accurate (were more gullible), but source of information was only marginally significant predictor of gullibility; stronger predictors of gullibility were the analytic cognitive style and prior paranormal beliefs (PBS). \nThe main aim of the planned study is to support findings from Study 1: we will try to replicate the main effect of analytic cognitive style and the source of information (how the profile is \u201cproduced\u201d) on the likelihood to accept supernatural causation by expanded manipulation of the analytic cognitive style. Because in the Study 1 manipulation of analytic thinking through simple instruction did not work, in Study 2 we will modify the manipulation in two ways. First, we will manipulate cognitive style in two directions; we will induce analytic as well as intuitive cognitive style. Second, we will extend the manipulation form: we will use the verbal priming \u2013 instruction as well as task inducing analytic or intuitive cognitive style.\nOur main research questions are:\n1)\tDoes analytic cognitive style prevent gullibility and susceptibility to the paranormal explanation of uncanny event (in comparison to intuitive cognitive style and control condition)?\n2)\tOr possibly, is it the knowledge of the source of information that affects gullibility and susceptibility to the paranormal explanation of uncanny events?\n3)\tDo prior paranormal beliefs, proneness to anomalous experience and explanation, and negative emotionality predict gullibility and susceptibility to paranormal explanations of an uncanny event over and above analytical thinking?", "q4": "We plan a 3x2 experiment with between-participant design.

range of poor life outcomes (Morrisroe, 2014). Early identification of children at-risk of reading difficulties is of paramount importance. The number of children with English as an Additional Language (EAL) (20.1% in 2016; Schools, pupils and their characteristics: January 2016 SFR 20/2016 DfE) and children living in poverty (DWP, 2015/2016) continues to rise. Children from these backgrounds are at a disadvantage entering formal education because their pre-school environment can lead to weaknesses in the English language skills which underpin reading development (e.g., Chaippe, Siegel &amp; Wade-Woolley, 2009; D\u2019Angiulli, Siegel &amp; Hertzman, 2004; D\u2019Angiulli, Siegel &amp; Maggi, 2004; Hoff, 2015). Traditional screening measures are static and assess existing knowledge, which is a product of a child\u2019s capacity to learn and their language experience. If a child performs poorly on a static measure, it is not possible to determine whether this is due to environmental factors or whether the child has an underlying reading disorder. The DART project will establish whether dynamic learning tasks (Grigorenko, 2009) can improve screening for reading disorders.

Early identification of children at-risk of reading difficulties is of paramount importance. The number of children with English as an Additional Language (EAL) (20.1% in 2016; Schools, pupils and their characteristics: January 2016 SFR 20/2016 DfE) and children living in poverty (DWP, 2015/2016) continues to rise. Children from these backgrounds are at a disadvantage entering formal education because their pre-school environment can lead to weaknesses in the English language skills which underpin reading development (e.g., Chaippe, Siegel &amp; Wade-Woolley, 2009; D\u2019Angiulli, Siegel &amp; Hertzman, 2004; D\u2019Angiulli, Siegel &amp; Maggi, 2004; Hoff, 2015).

been conducted to explore the effects of confirmation bias within the justice system, and factors such as time pressure, demands for high clearance rate, and media attention increases the risk of confirmation bias during investigations and interrogations (Findley &amp; Scott, 2006). Confirmation bias may result in misinterpretation of evidence (Ask, Rebelius &amp; Granhag, 2008) and create a guilt-confirming investigation (Rassin et al, 2010), which also affects the conduction of interrogations. The perceived credibility of suspects statement decreases while the risk of using confrontational interrogation methods with leading and guilt-driven questions increases (Powell, Hughes Scholes &amp; Sharman, 2012), which in turn can induce false confessions and wrongfully imprisonment of an innocent suspect (Hartwig, Granhag, Str\u00f6mwall &amp; Vrij, 2005). Even though much research within the field of legal psychology has explored the effects of confirmation bias, they often focus on either investigations or interrogations. They can almost be categorized as two different fields of research, even though interrogations are a vital part of the investigation, and to my knowledge, these two fields rarely been linked together. Therefore, this research will examine whether the initial focus in the investigation (biased or not) affects the interpretation of the interrogation.\n\nMethod\n\nParticipants \n     To conduct this research, a survey (created in Qualtrics) will be distributed to two of the authors\u00b4 contacts within the police force who agreed to pass the survey forward to their colleagues, as well as teachers within the Swedish police academy. The survey will also be published in a Facebook-group with police officers as members. \nAn a priori power analysis was computed to test the required sample size. In previous research on bias in investigations (Ask, Rebelius &amp; Granhag, 2008; Fahsing &amp; Ask, 2016; O\u00b4Brien, 2009) and interrogations/interviews (Hill et al; Kassin et al), effect sizes have ranged between 0.45 and 0.95. Specifically, a previous study using the same stimulus material as the present study (Ask &amp; Granhag, 2005) found an effect size of d = 0.52, (i.e., a medium effect according to Cohens guidelines; Cohen, 1988). Given a power level of .80, \u03b1 = .05 and the expected effect size of d = 0.52, a total sample size of 120 participants is required as a minimum. If a sample size of 120 participants is not met within the time window available for data collection, a sensitivity test will be computed using the actual number of participants and same values of power (0.8) and alpha (0.05), to calculate the smallest detectable effect size. \n\n\nProcedure and Materials\n     Besides information about voluntary participation, anonymity, and instructions, the survey contains a vignette depicting a homicide case (based on Ask &amp; Granhag, 2005), where the police found the victim dead in her apartment. Another woman was also found in the apartment and hence became the prime suspect. The participants will randomly be assigned into one of two groups; the \u00b4suspect guilty\u00b4 condition will get a motive of jealousy, while the \u00b4alternative suspect\u00b4 condition will be introduced to an alternative suspect, a man who previously threatened the victim. All participants will then rate their perception of the prime suspect probability of guilt (e.g., How likely is it that the prime suspect is guilty? How strong do you consider the support is at the time, for the suspect guilt?), before reading a draft from an interrogation of the prime suspect, which will be held constant for all participants. After a repeated measure of guilt, all participants will rate their perception of the interrogation through questions about guilt ( i.e., to what extent do you think the interrogation provides support for the suspects guilt?), components defining the interrogation method (e.g., to what extent do you think the interrogation was manipulative? To what extent do you think the interrogator asked open-ended questions?), and the suspect statement (e.g., to what extent do you think the information given by the suspect is reliable?). All questions will be answered on a 1-7 point scale (1 = not at all, 7 = to a very high degree). Finally, participants will be asked about gender, age, and experience within police investigations and interrogations, before they are thanked for their participation and informed that the case and interrogation were fictive and produced for the current study. See the uploaded file for the survey material.  \n\nHypothesis\n1.\tParticipants in the \u00b4suspect guilty\u00b4 condition will interpret the interrogation as more incriminating than participants in the \u00b4alternative suspect\u00b4 condition.\n2.\tParticipants in the suspect guilty condition will rate the interrogation as better conducted (e.g., less manipulative, less guilt presumptive) than participants in the alternative suspect\u00b4 condition.\n3.\tParticipants in the \u00b4suspect guilty\u00b4 condition will ascribe more guilt towards the prime suspect after reading the suspect interrogation, than participants in \u00b4alternative suspects\u00b4 condition. \n4.\tParticipants in the \u00b4suspect guilty\u00b4 condition will display a stronger increase in ratings of the suspects\u00b4 guilt after having read the suspect interrogation compared with participants in the \u00b4alternative suspects\u00b4 condition. \n\nAnalysis\n     Before data analysis to test the hypotheses, the internal reliability of questions intended to measure the same underlying construct will be controlled through Cronbach\u00b4s alpha, and indexes will be calculated. Given that all requirements are met, the following analysis methods will be used. A Significance level of .05 will be used for all significance testing. \nTo test Hypothesis 1, an independent t-test will be conducted using experimental condition (suspect guilty vs. alternative suspect) as the independent variable and participants\u00b4 ratings of the extent to which the interrogation indicates that the suspect is guilty, as the dependent variable. The hypothesis will be considered supported if participants in the suspect guilty condition make significantly higher guilt ratings than participants in the alternative suspect condition.  \n     For Hypothesis 2, a principal component analysis (PCA) will be conducted to check the relatedness and correlation between all the measured aspects of the interrogation (i.e., interrogation method and suspects\u00b4 statement) in order to identify which variables to combine into index variables to use in the main analysis. A MANOVA will then be conducted to measure the overall effect on participants\u00b4 perception of the interrogation, using condition (suspect guilty vs alternative suspects) as the independent variable, and the identified variables of the suspect interrogation, as dependent variables. If a significant multivariate effect is detected, univariate tests will be calculated to identify how each variable differed between the two conditions. Hypothesis 2 will be considered supported if participants in the guilty suspect condition rate the interrogation as better conducted than participants in the alternative suspect condition. \nTo test Hypothesis 3, an independent t-test will be conducted using experimental condition (suspect guilty vs alternative suspects) as the independent variable and participants ratings of the suspect\u00b4s guilt after the interrogation as the dependent variable. The hypothesis will be considered supported if participants in the suspect guilty condition make significantly higher guilt ratings than participants in the alternative suspect condition.\n     With participants\u00b4 pre- and post-interrogation ratings of the suspects\u00b4 guilt as the dependent variable, a mixed ANOVA will be conducted to test Hypothesis 4. The analysis will use experimental condition (suspect guilty vs alternative suspect) as the between-subject variable and time (before vs after interrogation) as the within-subject variable. The hypothesis will be considered supported if (a) the Condition x Time interaction is significant and (b) the increase in guilt ratings is larger in the suspect guilty condition than in the alternative suspect condition. \n\nReferences\n\nAsk, K., &amp; Granhag, P.

Confirmation bias may result in misinterpretation of evidence (Ask, Rebelius &amp; Granhag, 2008) and create a guilt-confirming investigation (Rassin et al, 2010), which also affects the conduction of interrogations. The perceived credibility of suspects statement decreases while the risk of using confrontational interrogation methods with leading and guilt-driven questions increases (Powell, Hughes Scholes &amp; Sharman, 2012), which in turn can induce false confessions and wrongfully imprisonment of an innocent suspect (Hartwig, Granhag, Str\u00f6mwall &amp; Vrij, 2005). Even though much research within the field of legal psychology has explored the effects of confirmation bias, they often focus on either investigations or interrogations. They can almost be categorized as two different fields of research, even though interrogations are a vital part of the investigation, and to my knowledge, these two fields rarely been linked together. Therefore, this research will examine whether the initial focus in the investigation (biased or not) affects the interpretation of the interrogation.\n\nMethod\n\nParticipants \n     To conduct this research, a survey (created in Qualtrics) will be distributed to two of the authors\u00b4 contacts within the police force who agreed to pass the survey forward to their colleagues, as well as teachers within the Swedish police academy. The survey will also be published in a Facebook-group with police officers as members. \nAn a priori power analysis was computed to test the required sample size. In previous research on bias in investigations (Ask, Rebelius &amp; Granhag, 2008; Fahsing &amp; Ask, 2016; O\u00b4Brien, 2009) and interrogations/interviews (Hill et al; Kassin et al), effect sizes have ranged between 0.45 and 0.95. Specifically, a previous study using the same stimulus material as the present study (Ask &amp; Granhag, 2005) found an effect size of d = 0.52, (i.e., a medium effect according to Cohens guidelines; Cohen, 1988). Given a power level of .80, \u03b1 = .05 and the expected effect size of d = 0.52, a total sample size of 120 participants is required as a minimum. If a sample size of 120 participants is not met within the time window available for data collection, a sensitivity test will be computed using the actual number of participants and same values of power (0.8) and alpha (0.05), to calculate the smallest detectable effect size. \n\n\nProcedure and Materials\n     Besides information about voluntary participation, anonymity, and instructions, the survey contains a vignette depicting a homicide case (based on Ask &amp; Granhag, 2005), where the police found the victim dead in her apartment.
