The two questions will either be related to their future death or to a future exam depending on the experimental condition. Experimenters will be blind to participants\u2019 mortality salience condition (but not to room temperature). \nMortality salience will be activated by two open-ended questions (e.g., Arndt et al., 1998; Greenberg, Simon, Harmon-Jones et al., 1995; Rosenblatt et al., 1989).

Covering the surface of the screen with a piece of Plexiglas can turn the screen into a reflective mirror-like surface when the background color is dark, but not when using a light-colored background color.

the seemingly selfless act of punishing. This implies that third-party punishment constitutes a signaling mechanism, and that punishment carries key information about the punisher. Nevertheless, how the signal is determined has not been fully examined.   \nThe signaling function of punishing could depend on an essential component of third-party punishment, its proportionality. In this study, I will test how severity, a fundamental constituent of proportionality, influences the perceived warmth, competence and potential social role (i.e. leader vs friend) of the punisher. Likewise, I will evaluate how proportionality influences the perceived motivations of the punishers (i.e. genuine moral concern vs motives of self interest).", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-03-30T23:15:21.068418", "date_modified": "2020-03-30T22:15:52.938693", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Juan Camilo Salcedo"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "1fadf51a9b37feaa4d2a0ffcf313da32022d57ac62f865de429c916bfa5b7644a69d7e201f3d54181b808da336cd54d4b842ede79543a506b9b4503c8d77423531ca04482eb71b530fc063c3f049fba2a9be7bbd3acd6300bb2abd50fbde8018c0c967f5afd6fd3a4c52b2919d714fde818ad540e3ea06e11571f75e3645ad615e1a4113163838a8c9e952ad2106e4a2", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-03-30T23:15:21.050055", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Juan Camilo Salcedo"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "1.
