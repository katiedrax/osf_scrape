attribution and misattribution in public goods provision by refugees, migrants, and low-income natives in Greece. As such, it contributes to the budding literature on refugee integration efforts and their political effects, as well as to the conversation on how refugees perceive and build trust with their host governments. This study will be accomplished via a nationwide school survey experiment conducted in Greece throughout the month of June 2016. There are a number of existing experimental evaluations of public services focused on vulnerable populations\u2019 experiences and attribution of these services. Irene Bloemraad\u2019s book Becoming a Citizen (2006) examines how settlement assistance helps facilitate immigrants\u2019 integration into the host country. But does public goods provision lead to misattribution of the source, or rather, does it lead vulnerable groups to build trust discriminately, with the service-providing institutions, organizations, or parties? Elizabeth Linos\u2019s (2013) work in Honduras indicates that even when a conditional cash transfer program was administered nationally, the program increased an incumbent mayor\u2019s chance at re-election by a whopping 39%, without significantly influencing voting behavior in presidential elections. It seems that misattribution can be a serious concern, especially in low-information settings. As such, our objective with this experiment is to examine attribution and misattribution of a food program to different levels of Greek government. More specifically, our experimental manipulation will focus on the extent to which satisfaction with Greek NGO\u2019s (Prolepsis\u2019s) school food program makes certain groups more satisfied with all levels of governance and public services (i.e., if they attribute their satisfaction with one program indiscriminately) or, if there is greater satisfaction at more local levels such that the satisfaction does not \u201ctrickle up.\u201d We plan to make information about the origins of the funding salient for some (but not all) of these government-funded meals. To do so, in the \u201ctreatment\u201d group, we remind people that the regional Greek government is contributing funds for the school lunch program. We will then ask questions about satisfaction with the program itself, with the national government, and the regional government. We anticipate that many low-income respondents will miss distinctions between different levels of government, and positive feelings towards the food program will extend to the regional government funding the program and to the central government (currently run by the opposite political party) (see Dekker et al. 2015, 634)."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: Support for the regional government will increase among respondents who have been reminded that the regional government is contributing to the free lunch program. H2: Support for the national government will not change among respondents who have been reminded that the regional government is contributing to the free lunch program. H3: Support for the food program will not change among respondents who have been reminded that regional government is contributing to the free lunch program. We seek to assess these groups\u2019 level of satisfaction with public service programs and Prolepsis\u2019s school food program in particular. We specifically examine distinctions in satisfaction based on information about the provider of this food program. We expect an increase in support (i.e., satisfaction) for the regional government when the credit attribution is made salient, while satisfaction with the national government/the food program itself should be indistinguishable between treatment and control. Based on prior research, we expect to find significant subgroup effects related to overall satisfaction levels with public policy. We expect different subgroups will respond very differently to the experimental manipulation just proposed. More specifically, it will be interesting to see the differential responses of Albanian, Syrian Afghani/Pakistani, and Roma groups. We will also examine cohort effects as well as location-based and education-based variations. Cohorts/Ethnicities: As Maxwell (2010) finds, there is significant variation in political attitudes across migrant generations in Europe. While \u201cfirst-generation migrants have the most positive attitudes\u2026native-origin and second-generation migrant-origin individuals have similar political trust and satisfaction scores\u201d (26). Maxwell argues that subjective integration factors related to the stages of migration explain this outcome. Specifically, \u201cfirst- generation migrants, who have gone through the disruptive process of changing countries, will have lower expectations and be more likely to have positive evaluations of the host society\u201d (26). In contrast, \u201cnative-origin and second-generation migrant origin individuals have been raised in the same society and are likely to share perspectives toward that society\u2019s political institutions\u201d(26). Since each of these ethnic groups is associated with different cohorts of immigration, we expect differential results. In short, we hypothesize that (a) baseline levels of satisfaction with the program, and especially with different levels of Greek government will differ depending on whether respondents are native Greeks, long-time residents, or recent arrivals and (b) native Greeks and long-term residents will be better able to attribute credit correctly than than recent arrivals. That is, we should see less \u201ctrickling up\u201d among native Greeks (and possibly long-term residents) than among recent arrivals. Location: When we obtain zip code information, we will be able to distinguish households who (a) live in rural vs. urban areas; (b) live in relatively more impoverished vs. relatively less impoverished areas (acknowledging gradations of poverty within low-income communities); and (c) live in ethnically heterogeneous vs. homogenous communities. We expect that respondents in more urban areas tend to misattribute satisfaction with the food program to the national government more often than do rural households, who may be more closely tied to their respective regional government. We also expect more impoverished households to be more likely to be indiscriminate in their attribution of public goods programs. We also expect different effects in Roma communities\u2014which are geographically segregated, homogenous, and should be identifiable by zip code and other characteristics. (We also expect baseline satisfaction levels with the national and regional governments to differ by location, in accordance with the geographic distribution of results in the most recent elections, in which the national government was disproportionately successful in large cities). Education: Based on Prolepsis\u2019s portion of the survey, we will be able to distinguish between the education levels of respondents. As such, we expect more highly educated respondents to be better able to distinguish between the regional/national government, and in turn, expect less educated respondents to be more indiscriminate in their attribution of satisfaction. Poverty/Hunger: We expect that levels of satisfaction with a food lunch program (and with governments given credit for this program) may depend on respondents\u2019 income and in particular on their need for food supplementation. Employment/Integration: We expect that respondents who are better integrated in Greek society, as proxied by the length of time they have resided in Greece, their ability to secure employment, and other measures, will be both more satisfied with government efforts, and better able to distinguish between regional and national government efforts."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "As a certified NGO that works closely with many public schools across Greece, Prolepsis is allowed to conduct surveys to measure school children\u2019s nutritional and health attributes and assess future needs. As such, Prolepsis conducts an annual survey in conjunction with their partner schools and asks students to take a survey home to their parents/guardians assessing nutritional and other health measures. They will be sending out the annual survey in June of 2016, and will be collected throughout the month. Participants in our survey are thus identified through these cooperating public schools. The survey questionnaire will be distributed to approximately 10,000 households, 50% of which are expected to respond. All these surveys are anonymous, and have a 4 digit identifying number of the subject's choice. This 4 digit number will not be linked to individual identifiers. Our experimental manipulation will focus on the extent to which satisfaction with the Prolepsis school food program makes certain groups more satisfied with all levels of governance (i.e., if they attribute their satisfaction with the program to different government levels indiscriminately) or, if there is greater satisfaction at more local levels such that the satisfaction does not \u201ctrickle up.\u201d We plan to make information about the origins of the funding salient for some (but not all) of these government-funded meals. We do this by reminding half of households that the regional Greek government is contributing funds for the school lunch program. We will then ask questions about satisfaction with the food program itself, with the regional government, as well as with the national government. With an expected response rate of 50%, we should have 5,000 household respondents in total, with 2,500 households each in treatment and control. After households are either reminded of the regional government\u2019s support for the food program or not, we measure satisfaction with the program, with the national government, and with the regional government. This design provides a simple comparison across treatment and control groups. In the past, Prolepsis\u2019s annual questionnaires had yielded a 50% response rate, so we expect something similar this time, since we are just adding an extra page of questions to the standard survey. As such, respondents should not experience much in the way of survey exhaustion. We have specifically limited the contents of our survey to avoid this pitfall. Our power calculations were made using the website http://clincalc.com/Stats/SampleSize.aspx, and are based on an alpha of 0.05, and a power value of 80%. With 5,000 expected observations, we will able to tell apart an increase in (approximate) support from 50% to 54% for the regional government between control and treatment, and (comparative) increase in support for national government from 40 to 44%. We expect that, on average, respondents\u2019 baseline satisfaction with their regional government is higher, as this is a well-documented phenomenon across countries (Putnam et al. 1994; Klandermans et al. 2001). For balance tests, we will have access through the partnering NGO, Prolepsis, to summary data for each of the experimental groups. However, we will not receive individual identifying data at any point to protect the rights and anonymity of respondents. This is not a serious limitation to our study, since we are seeking aggregate changes in response rate by subgroups, and as such, no individually identifying data would be necessary for our analyses."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Greece"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "5000"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "2016-04-8621"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "5/26/16"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q27": {"extra": [], "value": "Prolepsis"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q30": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design", "Survey Methodology"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Development", "Ethnic Politics", "Governance"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e3844a757427b01610c3f8e", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/yjfsa/providers/osfstorage/5e3844a757427b01610c3f8e", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/yjfsa/providers/osfstorage/5e3844a757427b01610c3f8e", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/yjfsa/providers/osfstorage/5e3844a757427b01610c3f8e?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/yjfsa/providers/osfstorage/5e3844a757427b01610c3f8e"}, "attributes": {"etag": "cf82ce99d42239d6b313de6b8b3f2a825eb8042a5b545f62b7a3b22785878de6", "kind": "file", "name": "20160601AD_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e3844a757427b01610c3f8e", "size": 146938, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "6f7299766a87d8541055e013638c1d50", "sha256": "14cd8b2093b25a395b04443f3844143ef1c04ddc1e1fe212d849be3311b5b203"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 146938, "modified": "2020-02-03T16:04:55.169338+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "yjfsa", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20160601AD_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T16:04:55+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "yjfsa", "sha256": "14cd8b2093b25a395b04443f3844143ef1c04ddc1e1fe212d849be3311b5b203", "viewUrl": "/project/2ef3w/files/osfstorage/5e3844acfa39b701691db2cc/", "selectedFileName": "20160601AD_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20160601AD_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Public Services in Low Income Communities: Understanding Migrant and Minority Integration Efforts and the Credit Attribution of Public Goods Provision", "q2": "Katerina Linos | Laura Jakli | Melissa Anne Carlson", "q3": "20160601AD", "q4": "06/01/2016 - 21:56", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to assignment of treatment", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "6/2/16", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "This experimental survey analysis examines political attribution and misattribution in public goods provision by refugees, migrants, and low-income natives in Greece. As such, it contributes to the budding literature on refugee integration efforts and their political effects, as well as to the conversation on how refugees perceive and build trust with their host governments. This study will be accomplished via a nationwide school survey experiment conducted in Greece throughout the month of June 2016. There are a number of existing experimental evaluations of public services focused on vulnerable populations\u2019 experiences and attribution of these services. Irene Bloemraad\u2019s book Becoming a Citizen (2006) examines how settlement assistance helps facilitate immigrants\u2019 integration into the host country. But does public goods provision lead to misattribution of the source, or rather, does it lead vulnerable groups to build trust discriminately, with the service-providing institutions, organizations, or parties? Elizabeth Linos\u2019s (2013) work in Honduras indicates that even when a conditional cash transfer program was administered nationally, the program increased an incumbent mayor\u2019s chance at re-election by a whopping 39%, without significantly influencing voting behavior in presidential elections. It seems that misattribution can be a serious concern, especially in low-information settings. As such, our objective with this experiment is to examine attribution and misattribution of a food program to different levels of Greek government. More specifically, our experimental manipulation will focus on the extent to which satisfaction with Greek NGO\u2019s (Prolepsis\u2019s) school food program makes certain groups more satisfied with all levels of governance and public services (i.e., if they attribute their satisfaction with one program indiscriminately) or, if there is greater satisfaction at more local levels such that the satisfaction does not \u201ctrickle up.\u201d We plan to make information about the origins of the funding salient for some (but not all) of these government-funded meals. To do so, in the \u201ctreatment\u201d group, we remind people that the regional Greek government is contributing funds for the school lunch program. We will then ask questions about satisfaction with the program itself, with the national government, and the regional government. We anticipate that many low-income respondents will miss distinctions between different levels of government, and positive feelings towards the food program will extend to the regional government funding the program and to the central government (currently run by the opposite political party) (see Dekker et al. 2015, 634).", "q16": "H1: Support for the regional government will increase among respondents who have been reminded that the regional government is contributing to the free lunch program. H2: Support for the national government will not change among respondents who have been reminded that the regional government is contributing to the free lunch program. H3: Support for the food program will not change among respondents who have been reminded that regional government is contributing to the free lunch program. We seek to assess these groups\u2019 level of satisfaction with public service programs and Prolepsis\u2019s school food program in particular. We specifically examine distinctions in satisfaction based on information about the provider of this food program. We expect an increase in support (i.e., satisfaction) for the regional government when the credit attribution is made salient, while satisfaction with the national government/the food program itself should be indistinguishable between treatment and control. Based on prior research, we expect to find significant subgroup effects related to overall satisfaction levels with public policy. We expect different subgroups will respond very differently to the experimental manipulation just proposed. More specifically, it will be interesting to see the differential responses of Albanian, Syrian Afghani/Pakistani, and Roma groups. We will also examine cohort effects as well as location-based and education-based variations. Cohorts/Ethnicities: As Maxwell (2010) finds, there is significant variation in political attitudes across migrant generations in Europe. While \u201cfirst-generation migrants have the most positive attitudes\u2026native-origin and second-generation migrant-origin individuals have similar political trust and satisfaction scores\u201d (26). Maxwell argues that subjective integration factors related to the stages of migration explain this outcome. Specifically, \u201cfirst- generation migrants, who have gone through the disruptive process of changing countries, will have lower expectations and be more likely to have positive evaluations of the host society\u201d (26). In contrast, \u201cnative-origin and second-generation migrant origin individuals have been raised in the same society and are likely to share perspectives toward that society\u2019s political institutions\u201d(26). Since each of these ethnic groups is associated with different cohorts of immigration, we expect differential results. In short, we hypothesize that (a) baseline levels of satisfaction with the program, and especially with different levels of Greek government will differ depending on whether respondents are native Greeks, long-time residents, or recent arrivals and (b) native Greeks and long-term residents will be better able to attribute credit correctly than than recent arrivals. That is, we should see less \u201ctrickling up\u201d among native Greeks (and possibly long-term residents) than among recent arrivals. Location: When we obtain zip code information, we will be able to distinguish households who (a) live in rural vs. urban areas; (b) live in relatively more impoverished vs. relatively less impoverished areas (acknowledging gradations of poverty within low-income communities); and (c) live in ethnically heterogeneous vs. homogenous communities. We expect that respondents in more urban areas tend to misattribute satisfaction with the food program to the national government more often than do rural households, who may be more closely tied to their respective regional government. We also expect more impoverished households to be more likely to be indiscriminate in their attribution of public goods programs. We also expect different effects in Roma communities\u2014which are geographically segregated, homogenous, and should be identifiable by zip code and other characteristics. (We also expect baseline satisfaction levels with the national and regional governments to differ by location, in accordance with the geographic distribution of results in the most recent elections, in which the national government was disproportionately successful in large cities). Education: Based on Prolepsis\u2019s portion of the survey, we will be able to distinguish between the education levels of respondents. As such, we expect more highly educated respondents to be better able to distinguish between the regional/national government, and in turn, expect less educated respondents to be more indiscriminate in their attribution of satisfaction. Poverty/Hunger: We expect that levels of satisfaction with a food lunch program (and with governments given credit for this program) may depend on respondents\u2019 income and in particular on their need for food supplementation. Employment/Integration: We expect that respondents who are better integrated in Greek society, as proxied by the length of time they have resided in Greece, their ability to secure employment, and other measures, will be both more satisfied with government efforts, and better able to distinguish between regional and national government efforts.", "q17": "As a certified NGO that works closely with many public schools across Greece, Prolepsis is allowed to conduct surveys to measure school children\u2019s nutritional and health attributes and assess future needs. As such, Prolepsis conducts an annual survey in conjunction with their partner schools and asks students to take a survey home to their parents/guardians assessing nutritional and other health measures. They will be sending out the annual survey in June of 2016, and will be collected throughout the month. Participants in our survey are thus identified through these cooperating public schools. The survey questionnaire will be distributed to approximately 10,000 households, 50% of which are expected to respond.

barriers faced by refugees, migrants, and low-income natives in Greece. More specifically, this study examines how to effectively strengthen these vulnerable populations\u2019 ability to access free vaccination programs\u2014via different informational interventions. To do so, we plan to examine how these groups access basic rights and services, what barriers they face, and in turn experimentally vary informational interventions to examine how to best to remove these obstacles. This will be accomplished via a nationwide school survey experiment conducted in Greece throughout the month of June 2016. This study offers an experimental examination of informational interventions and their effectiveness in reducing vulnerable groups\u2019 barriers to accessing vaccination programs. We have selected our focus as low-income communities because our findings can help understand how these barriers to health play out in particularly vulnerable areas. More specifically, this study contributes to an understanding of the conditions under which informational interventions are effective for different vulnerable groups. We measure behavioral change, examining how standard messaging about vaccination (i.e. messaging concerning the health benefits of vaccines) compares to two other types of messaging, messaging about legal rights and legal obligations. More specifically, we examine whether (a) messaging about vaccines\u2019 impact on disease prevention (b) messaging about legal entitlements to vaccinations or (c) messaging about legal requirements for vaccination is more or less effective in mobilizing individuals to access vaccination programs. We suspect that members of different vulnerable communities may respond differently to different messages. In sum, the most innovative element of this research project is that we can actually operationalize the effectiveness of informational interventions (via discrepancies in respondents\u2019 willingness to reach out for more information) and thereby measure behavioral changes. Note that we do not track behavioral change across time in individuals, but use random assignment into our experimental conditions to draw inference about behavioral impacts. The simplest building block for our research stems from the literature on information primes \u2013most prominently associated with the work of Iyengar and Kinder (1982). Priming concerns the notion that ideas that have been recently encountered or frequently activated are more likely to come to mind and this will be used in interpreting social events. In our case, we assume that priming respondents with information about the importance of vaccination should raise the saliency of this health concern, and thus \u201ctreated\u201d participants should have a higher propensity to mobilize around the issue of vaccination. While a multitude of scholars have focused on what types of ideas have the greatest \u201cpriming\u201d power, finding again and again that priming an issue as a norm (i.e., \u201csocial pressure\u201d) is an effective way to actually influence individuals\u2019 behaviors (Cialdini et al. 1990; Gerber, Green and Larimer 2008), we know much less about the power of legal rights and obligations frames. Based on Schwartz and Orleans (1967) and later, a replication by McGraw and Scholz (1991), it appears that emphasizing legal obligations has a greater positive impact on tax compliance than did emphasizing self-interest (in our case, this parallels the simple health message). These studies suggest that the legal obligations framework can be a powerful tool in promoting certain behaviors. However, in general, there is a dearth of literature on the discrepancy between invoking legal rights versus legal obligations. Our study serves to fill this gap. With this experiment, we also build on a strand of research in the human rights tradition that suggests that the language of fundamental rights can move public opinion. For example, support for torture declines (Wallace 2014), while support for health and labor rights (Linos 2013), as well as women\u2019s rights (Chilton 2016) increases when the language of fundamental rights is made salient to respondents. This strand of research has been criticized for lacking external validity; in particular, scholars question whether a response to a survey item would translate into any type of behavioral change. In our study, we plan to build on prior work, by asking respondents to take concrete follow-up action (i.e., making a phone-call). Furthermore, prior priming studies often focus on the creation of public goods, and there is less work on whether peer pressure might facilitate the realization of individual legal rights\u2014such as to vaccination. What we do know based on the aforementioned body of literature is that, generally, we can reasonably expect a 3 to 3.5 percentage point increase (i.e., mobilization) in the treatment group based on these classic informational interventions (Pande 2011). However, it is possible that the effect deviates when we use informational interventions not to create public goods, but instead to facilitate the realization of a health right."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "We will be able to determine respondents\u2019 nationality, how many kids they have, and how long they have lived in Greece, and also obtain zip code information.

We will also have access to information on comparative survey response rates among Greeks and non-Greeks. This population will be used to test our main hypothesis with regard to the impact of varying informational interventions on vaccination. This hypothesis is enumerated below. H1: Relatively minor legal rights and obligations framing interventions can significantly reduce barriers to accessing vaccination programs in comparison to the standard messaging frame about health benefits. In sum, we plan to investigate whether (a) providing people with information about legal entitlements; or (b) providing people with information about legal obligations, can significantly affect low-income communities\u2019 willingness to access vaccination programs, as compared to (c) standard messaging about health benefits. Once again, the literature our research references concerns information provision (Iyengar and Kinder 1982; Gerber, Green and Larimer 2008; Cialdini et al. 1990). We assume that informing and/or priming respondents with regard to their legal rights and/or legal obligations should raise the salience of concern for vaccination, and thus households in these particular treatment groups should have a higher propensity to seek out more information on free vaccination programs versus the standard health messaging treatment. We are uncertain whether the legal rights or legal obligations frame will produce the most significant effect. Our theoretical prior is thus agnostic on this point, due to the dearth of literature on this specific distinction. In all likelihood, we will be able to conduct limited subgroup analyses. As such, we offer some hypotheses about which subgroups are likely to be especially impacted by our experiment. Ethnicity/Length of Residence in Greece: Populations in low-income communities face significant barriers to the exercise of fundamental rights. These include lack of information about vaccination programs, bureaucratic hurdles (e.g. long queues, extensive paperwork), perceived and actual social stigma, and linguistic barriers. We expect these barriers to intersect in different ways for different groups. As such, we expect differential responses between more recent arrivals in the past decade (such as Syrian, Afghani, and Pakistani migrants) and more established groups (such as the Roma, Albanians, and ethnic Greeks). For example, ethnic Greeks and other long-term residents already have access to vaccines, so they might not feel the need to call in to obtain more information. At the same time, the ease of accessing additional information varies in the opposite direction; it is much easier for a Greek or long term resident to call in. We remain agnostic in our overall prediction as to whether Greeks/long term residents will call in at higher levels, because these two mechanisms work in opposite directions. Meanwhile, recently arrived migrants and refugees (Syrian, Afghani, Pakistani) often face heavy obstacles: in addition to language and race-based barriers, the Greek state requires extensive documentation before individuals can access any benefit. We expect that informational interventions may help overcome these recent arrivals\u2019 barriers, but we are uncertain how effective an informational intervention alone will be for these groups. Additionally, we expect that differential experiences with different modes of communication (email, phone, mail) are a function of Greek language skills. As such, Syrian refugees as well as recent Afghani and Pakistani migrants may feel more hesitant to reach out via phone, but more open to using email or traditional mail to connect and reach out for more information. We examine these variations in a related study (which will not be enumerated, as it is not the focus of this pre-analysis plan). In addition, we expect that the language of rights and obligations may resonate differently among more established and integrated populations, and as compared to recent arrivals. Location/Network Density: When we obtain zip code information, we will be able to distinguish households who (a) live in rural vs. urban areas; (b) live in relatively more impoverished vs. relatively less impoverished areas (acknowledging gradations of poverty within low-income communities); and (c) live in ethnically heterogeneous vs. homogenous communities. We expect that respondents in less impoverished and more urban areas would change their opinions more in response to the invocation of legal rights and obligations language, as they are probably more familiar with these types of frames and have had greater prior exposure to this type of material. Additionally, since network density is a function of population density, we expect urban respondents to feel more at ease in accessing additional information. This can also at least partially be a function of how quickly recent arrivals can be integrated into Greek culture and acquire Greek language skills; we expect recent arrivals in urban areas with denser networks to be more comfortable reaching out for more information than recent arrivals residing in rural communities. We also expect that social ties are stronger in homogenous communities, which helps facilitate the same process as network density. We also expect different effects in Roma communities\u2014which are geographically segregated and should be identifiable by zip code and other characteristics."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "As a certified NGO that works closely with many public schools across Greece, Prolepsis is allowed to conduct surveys to measure school children\u2019s nutritional and health characteristics and assess future needs.

They will be sending out the annual survey in June of 2016, and will be collected throughout the month. Participants in our survey are thus identified through these cooperating public schools. The sample population for our study will be approximately 10,000 households, but we expect very low response rates to our treatments. All these surveys are anonymous, and have a 4 digit identifying number of the subject's choice. This 4 digit number will not be linked to individual identifiers. The evaluation sample consists of 10,000 households who will receive a school survey, with approximately 3,333 selected into receiving information about legal rights, and another 3,333 with information about legal requirements, on the hypothesis that each of these treatments could shift behavior, but that the legal requirements will have a stronger effect than the legal rights. There will also be a third treatment group (n=3,333) as a baseline measure, offering the standard health rationale for vaccination. In past years, approximately 50% of households receiving the Prolepsis survey completed it, so we should have 5,000 household respondents in total. However, we expect most of these not to reach out for more information on vaccination; we expect no more than 5% of people initially contacted to call in ask for additional information. So we are expecting about 500 phone calls, distributed unevenly among the three treatment conditions. Our dependent variable is binary: subjects are coded as \u201c1\u201d if they choose to reach out for more information on vaccination programs, and \u201c0\u201d if they choose not to inquire via the phone hotline.

More specifically, this study examines how to effectively strengthen these vulnerable populations\u2019 ability to access free vaccination programs\u2014via different informational interventions. To do so, we plan to examine how these groups access basic rights and services, what barriers they face, and in turn experimentally vary informational interventions to examine how to best to remove these obstacles. This will be accomplished via a nationwide school survey experiment conducted in Greece throughout the month of June 2016. This study offers an experimental examination of informational interventions and their effectiveness in reducing vulnerable groups\u2019 barriers to accessing vaccination programs. We have selected our focus as low-income communities because our findings can help understand how these barriers to health play out in particularly vulnerable areas. More specifically, this study contributes to an understanding of the conditions under which informational interventions are effective for different vulnerable groups. We measure behavioral change, examining how standard messaging about vaccination (i.e. messaging concerning the health benefits of vaccines) compares to two other types of messaging, messaging about legal rights and legal obligations. More specifically, we examine whether (a) messaging about vaccines\u2019 impact on disease prevention (b) messaging about legal entitlements to vaccinations or (c) messaging about legal requirements for vaccination is more or less effective in mobilizing individuals to access vaccination programs. We suspect that members of different vulnerable communities may respond differently to different messages. In sum, the most innovative element of this research project is that we can actually operationalize the effectiveness of informational interventions (via discrepancies in respondents\u2019 willingness to reach out for more information) and thereby measure behavioral changes. Note that we do not track behavioral change across time in individuals, but use random assignment into our experimental conditions to draw inference about behavioral impacts. The simplest building block for our research stems from the literature on information primes \u2013most prominently associated with the work of Iyengar and Kinder (1982). Priming concerns the notion that ideas that have been recently encountered or frequently activated are more likely to come to mind and this will be used in interpreting social events. In our case, we assume that priming respondents with information about the importance of vaccination should raise the saliency of this health concern, and thus \u201ctreated\u201d participants should have a higher propensity to mobilize around the issue of vaccination. While a multitude of scholars have focused on what types of ideas have the greatest \u201cpriming\u201d power, finding again and again that priming an issue as a norm (i.e., \u201csocial pressure\u201d) is an effective way to actually influence individuals\u2019 behaviors (Cialdini et al. 1990; Gerber, Green and Larimer 2008), we know much less about the power of legal rights and obligations frames. Based on Schwartz and Orleans (1967) and later, a replication by McGraw and Scholz (1991), it appears that emphasizing legal obligations has a greater positive impact on tax compliance than did emphasizing self-interest (in our case, this parallels the simple health message). These studies suggest that the legal obligations framework can be a powerful tool in promoting certain behaviors. However, in general, there is a dearth of literature on the discrepancy between invoking legal rights versus legal obligations. Our study serves to fill this gap. With this experiment, we also build on a strand of research in the human rights tradition that suggests that the language of fundamental rights can move public opinion. For example, support for torture declines (Wallace 2014), while support for health and labor rights (Linos 2013), as well as women\u2019s rights (Chilton 2016) increases when the language of fundamental rights is made salient to respondents. This strand of research has been criticized for lacking external validity; in particular, scholars question whether a response to a survey item would translate into any type of behavioral change. In our study, we plan to build on prior work, by asking respondents to take concrete follow-up action (i.e., making a phone-call). Furthermore, prior priming studies often focus on the creation of public goods, and there is less work on whether peer pressure might facilitate the realization of individual legal rights\u2014such as to vaccination. What we do know based on the aforementioned body of literature is that, generally, we can reasonably expect a 3 to 3.5 percentage point increase (i.e., mobilization) in the treatment group based on these classic informational interventions (Pande 2011).

Two of the most common theoretical explanations offered in the literature \u2013 self-justification theory (e.g. Staw, 1976) and prospect theory (e.g. Whyte, 1986) \u2013 conceptualise escalation as an \u201cirrational\u201d deviation from standard economic theory: Escalation is explained as an effect of self-justification (i.e. caused by the psychological need to be consistent with previous decisions) or of loss aversion (i.e. caused by the salience of the loss of the sunk cost). However, in the context of political decision-making, I hypothesize that it may be entirely \u201crational\u201d for a politician to escalate a commitment in order to avoid blame from voters for the failure of the project and the incurred sunk cost.

refugees, migrants, and low-income natives in Greece. In turn, this study examines how to effectively strengthen these vulnerable populations\u2019 ability to exercise the basic rights to which they are entitled. To do so, we plan to examine how these groups access dental care in particular, vary the types of barriers they face, and then reflect on how best to remove these obstacles. We chose to focus on dental care based on focus groups and interviews we fielded earlier on, which suggested that the need for dental care was particularly high among poor communities in Greece. This will be accomplished via a nationwide school survey experiment conducted in Greece throughout the month of June 2016. There are a number of existing experimental evaluations of barriers to legal rights and public services focused on vulnerable populations\u2019 experiences. However, this type of research primarily focuses on understanding the experiences of a single minority group, whereas ours examines different types of barriers faced by a variety of low-income groups. This allows us to make a number of important baseline comparisons. Furthermore, most examinations of barrier reduction fail to measure actual behavior change, and therefore raise concerns about external validity (Wallace 2014; Chilton 2016). We vary multiple types of barriers (from self-addressed, stamped mailers to phone hotlines to more difficult mailers), so that we can compare the relative effectiveness of each. Our theoretical contribution is thereby twofold: 1) we move the study of low-income communities\u2019 barriers from the traditional single-group focus to a comparative examination, and 2) we operationalize the difficulty of barriers as a function of willingness to take action (e.g., willingness to call a hotline to find out more information about free dental programs). More specifically, this study contributes to an understanding of the conditions under which different vulnerable groups access their health rights. We measure behavioral change, examining whether (a) self-addressed, stamped mailers; (b) more \u201cdifficult\u201d mailers that require purchasing a stamp; (c) phone hotlines, or (d) an email is most effective in mobilizing groups to access free dental programs. In sum, the most innovative element of this research project is that we can actually operationalize the gradient of difficulty imposed by each of these barriers (via discrepancies in respondents\u2019 willingness to reach out for more information) and thereby measure behavioral changes. Note that we do not track behavioral change across time in individuals, but use random assignment into our experimental conditions to draw inference about behavioral impacts. Our theoretical contribution is simple; although more and more scholars are experimenting with easing access to public services and barrier reduction techniques, this body of work is still largely underdeveloped. Grossman and Michelitch (2015) just recently collected data from Uganda on the effectiveness of text messaging software in connecting vulnerable groups to local politicians. However, as Ensor and Cooper (2006) find, these \u201cdemand-side barriers\u201d have been rarely studied, and even more rarely has there been experimental manipulation of barrier-reducing technologies. Over the past decade, some studies have experimented with demand side financing (DSF) mechanisms to transfer purchasing power to vulnerable populations (Schmidt et al. 2010). However, demand-side financial interventions are still much more prominent in the literature than non-financial ones, and even when studies feature non-financial interventions, they are mostly informational interventions (Jacobs et al. 2012). As such, it has been difficult to understand the relative effectiveness of non-monetary interventions in comparison to one another\u2014especially interventions that, like our study, mimic various gradations of bureaucratic barriers. Our objective with this experiment is to move towards filling this gap."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: Different \u201cdegrees\u201d of bureaucratic inconveniences can significantly affect vulnerable groups\u2019 willingness to seek out more information on their health rights. As such, we expect more mobilization via the self-addressed (\u201ceasy\u201d) post-card variant versus the non-self-addressed (\u201cdifficult\u201d) variant. We are less certain about the discrepancies between email and phone hotlines, but generally assume that phone hotlines are the most convenient resource (i.e., weakest barrier) for ethnic Greeks, Roma, and Albanian populations who speak Greek well, whereas this may not be quite as \u201ceasy\u201d of a barrier for recent arrivals. With the email variant, the issue may be one of Internet access, and as such, the self-addressed post-card may produce a relatively easier access point to vulnerable, low-income groups. In all likelihood, we will be able to conduct very limited subgroup analyses. From the names of respondents, we can infer ethnicity, and from their zip codes, we can approximate income. In a follow up question for phone respondents, we will also be able to ask: \u201cHave you lived in Greece for more or less than 5 years?\u201d to obtain an approximate measure on recent arrivals. As such, we offer some hypotheses about which subgroups are likely to be especially impacted by our experiments. Ethnicity: Populations in low-income communities face significant barriers to the exercise of fundamental rights. These include lack of information about legal rights, bureaucratic hurdles (e.g. long queues, extensive paperwork), perceived and actual social stigma, and linguistic barriers. We expect these barriers to intersect in different ways for different groups. As such, we expect differential responses between Albanian, Syrian, Afghani/Pakistani, Roma, and ethnic Greek groups. For example, preliminary pilot interviews suggest that members of the Roma community (a stigmatized Greek minority) are well informed about entitlements, but face racism in obtaining benefits from the Greek state. In contrast, Greek nationals who have only recently become unemployed are sometimes poorly informed about social benefits, and are hesitant to discuss their plight in front of neighbors. Recently arrived migrants and refugees (Syrian, Afghani, Pakistani) often face the heaviest obstacles: in addition to language and race-based barriers, the Greek state requires extensive documentation before individuals can access any benefit. This can be especially onerous for recent arrivals. However, we do expect Syrians to be, generally, better informed than their Afghani and Pakistani counterparts, because there have been substantial resources and funding set aside toward addressing the crisis situation of Syrian refugees. The plight of Syrian refugees has also been a prominent issue in the media over the last year. As such, we expect that differential experiences with different modes of communication (email, phone, mail) are a function of culture, past experiences with bureaucracy, as well as a function of Greek language skills. We expect that Syrian refugees as well as recent Afghani and Pakistani migrants may feel more hesitant to reach out via phone, but more open to using email or traditional mail to connect and reach out for more information. It is difficult to know beforehand exactly which households have regular internet access, and as such, we cannot predict how well the phone hotline versus the email variant will perform as access points to dental program information. Cohorts: As mentioned, we will, at most, obtain a binary measure of cohort (new arrival versus more established migrants/populations). Similar to our hypothesis for different ethnic groups, we expect that differential experiences with different modes of communication (email, phone, mail) are also a function of cohort effects, as well as a function of Greek language skills. As such, new arrivals may feel more hesitant to reach out via phone, but more open to using email or traditional mail to connect and reach out for more information. Location: When we obtain zip code information, we will be able to distinguish households who (a) live in rural vs. urban areas; (b) live in relatively more impoverished vs. relatively less impoverished areas (acknowledging gradations of poverty within low-income communities); and (c) live in ethnically heterogeneous vs. homogenous communities. We expect more impoverished groups to be discouraged by the \u201chard\u201d postcard variant due to the price of stamps, and we expect internet access to be a more difficult barrier in more impoverished areas as well, in turn decreasing the effectiveness of the email variant. We expect urban areas to be more motivated to either call the phone hotline or send an email, but rural areas to be more accustomed to continuing outreach via more traditional mail methods. We also expect different effects in Roma communities\u2014which are geographically segregated, homogenous, and should be identifiable by zip code and other characteristics. Specifically, we expect each barrier to prove more difficult to overcome in Roma communities due to heavy stigmatization around their uptake of social benefits."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "As a certified NGO that works closely with many public schools across Greece, Prolepsis is allowed to conduct surveys to measure school children\u2019s nutritional and health attributes and assess future needs. As such, Prolepsis conducts an annual survey in conjunction with their partner schools and asks students to take a survey home to their parents/guardians assessing nutritional and other health measures. They will be sending out the annual survey in June of 2016, and will be collected throughout the month. Participants in our survey are thus identified through these cooperating public schools. The sample population for our study will be approximately 10,000 households, but we expect very low response rates to our treatments. All these surveys are anonymous, and have a 4 digit identifying number of the subject's choice. This 4 digit number will not be linked to individual identifiers. We plan to vary the follow-up action we ask respondents to undertake, to better assess whether small bureaucratic conveniences or inconveniences make a significant difference in the uptake of rights. First, we plan to vary whether we ask people to (a) mail in a stamped, self-addressed envelope; (b) write an address and purchase a stamp, before mailing the same postcard; (c) call a phone number; or (4) send an email (n=2,500 each). If resources permit, we will also examine whether it matters whether the number listed corresponds to someone the parents know personally (e.g. the school principal) or someone the parents do not know (e.g. an NGO). While we are sending the survey questionnaire to 10,000 households, we expect only about 1-8% of households to solicit follow-up information, depending on the treatment condition. As such, we expect approximately 25-200 respondents per treatment. This sample will be used to test one main hypothesis with regard to the impact of varying bureaucratic inconveniences.

In turn, this study examines how to effectively strengthen these vulnerable populations\u2019 ability to exercise the basic rights to which they are entitled. To do so, we plan to examine how these groups access dental care in particular, vary the types of barriers they face, and then reflect on how best to remove these obstacles. We chose to focus on dental care based on focus groups and interviews we fielded earlier on, which suggested that the need for dental care was particularly high among poor communities in Greece. This will be accomplished via a nationwide school survey experiment conducted in Greece throughout the month of June 2016. There are a number of existing experimental evaluations of barriers to legal rights and public services focused on vulnerable populations\u2019 experiences. However, this type of research primarily focuses on understanding the experiences of a single minority group, whereas ours examines different types of barriers faced by a variety of low-income groups. This allows us to make a number of important baseline comparisons. Furthermore, most examinations of barrier reduction fail to measure actual behavior change, and therefore raise concerns about external validity (Wallace 2014; Chilton 2016). We vary multiple types of barriers (from self-addressed, stamped mailers to phone hotlines to more difficult mailers), so that we can compare the relative effectiveness of each. Our theoretical contribution is thereby twofold: 1) we move the study of low-income communities\u2019 barriers from the traditional single-group focus to a comparative examination, and 2) we operationalize the difficulty of barriers as a function of willingness to take action (e.g., willingness to call a hotline to find out more information about free dental programs). More specifically, this study contributes to an understanding of the conditions under which different vulnerable groups access their health rights. We measure behavioral change, examining whether (a) self-addressed, stamped mailers; (b) more \u201cdifficult\u201d mailers that require purchasing a stamp; (c) phone hotlines, or (d) an email is most effective in mobilizing groups to access free dental programs. In sum, the most innovative element of this research project is that we can actually operationalize the gradient of difficulty imposed by each of these barriers (via discrepancies in respondents\u2019 willingness to reach out for more information) and thereby measure behavioral changes. Note that we do not track behavioral change across time in individuals, but use random assignment into our experimental conditions to draw inference about behavioral impacts. Our theoretical contribution is simple; although more and more scholars are experimenting with easing access to public services and barrier reduction techniques, this body of work is still largely underdeveloped. Grossman and Michelitch (2015) just recently collected data from Uganda on the effectiveness of text messaging software in connecting vulnerable groups to local politicians. However, as Ensor and Cooper (2006) find, these \u201cdemand-side barriers\u201d have been rarely studied, and even more rarely has there been experimental manipulation of barrier-reducing technologies. Over the past decade, some studies have experimented with demand side financing (DSF) mechanisms to transfer purchasing power to vulnerable populations (Schmidt et al. 2010). However, demand-side financial interventions are still much more prominent in the literature than non-financial ones, and even when studies feature non-financial interventions, they are mostly informational interventions (Jacobs et al. 2012). As such, it has been difficult to understand the relative effectiveness of non-monetary interventions in comparison to one another\u2014especially interventions that, like our study, mimic various gradations of bureaucratic barriers. Our objective with this experiment is to move towards filling this gap.", "q16": "H1: Different \u201cdegrees\u201d of bureaucratic inconveniences can significantly affect vulnerable groups\u2019 willingness to seek out more information on their health rights. As such, we expect more mobilization via the self-addressed (\u201ceasy\u201d) post-card variant versus the non-self-addressed (\u201cdifficult\u201d) variant. We are less certain about the discrepancies between email and phone hotlines, but generally assume that phone hotlines are the most convenient resource (i.e., weakest barrier) for ethnic Greeks, Roma, and Albanian populations who speak Greek well, whereas this may not be quite as \u201ceasy\u201d of a barrier for recent arrivals. With the email variant, the issue may be one of Internet access, and as such, the self-addressed post-card may produce a relatively easier access point to vulnerable, low-income groups. In all likelihood, we will be able to conduct very limited subgroup analyses. From the names of respondents, we can infer ethnicity, and from their zip codes, we can approximate income. In a follow up question for phone respondents, we will also be able to ask: \u201cHave you lived in Greece for more or less than 5 years?\u201d to obtain an approximate measure on recent arrivals. As such, we offer some hypotheses about which subgroups are likely to be especially impacted by our experiments. Ethnicity: Populations in low-income communities face significant barriers to the exercise of fundamental rights. These include lack of information about legal rights, bureaucratic hurdles (e.g. long queues, extensive paperwork), perceived and actual social stigma, and linguistic barriers. We expect these barriers to intersect in different ways for different groups. As such, we expect differential responses between Albanian, Syrian, Afghani/Pakistani, Roma, and ethnic Greek groups. For example, preliminary pilot interviews suggest that members of the Roma community (a stigmatized Greek minority) are well informed about entitlements, but face racism in obtaining benefits from the Greek state. In contrast, Greek nationals who have only recently become unemployed are sometimes poorly informed about social benefits, and are hesitant to discuss their plight in front of neighbors. Recently arrived migrants and refugees (Syrian, Afghani, Pakistani) often face the heaviest obstacles: in addition to language and race-based barriers, the Greek state requires extensive documentation before individuals can access any benefit. This can be especially onerous for recent arrivals. However, we do expect Syrians to be, generally, better informed than their Afghani and Pakistani counterparts, because there have been substantial resources and funding set aside toward addressing the crisis situation of Syrian refugees. The plight of Syrian refugees has also been a prominent issue in the media over the last year. As such, we expect that differential experiences with different modes of communication (email, phone, mail) are a function of culture, past experiences with bureaucracy, as well as a function of Greek language skills. We expect that Syrian refugees as well as recent Afghani and Pakistani migrants may feel more hesitant to reach out via phone, but more open to using email or traditional mail to connect and reach out for more information. It is difficult to know beforehand exactly which households have regular internet access, and as such, we cannot predict how well the phone hotline versus the email variant will perform as access points to dental program information. Cohorts: As mentioned, we will, at most, obtain a binary measure of cohort (new arrival versus more established migrants/populations). Similar to our hypothesis for different ethnic groups, we expect that differential experiences with different modes of communication (email, phone, mail) are also a function of cohort effects, as well as a function of Greek language skills. As such, new arrivals may feel more hesitant to reach out via phone, but more open to using email or traditional mail to connect and reach out for more information. Location: When we obtain zip code information, we will be able to distinguish households who (a) live in rural vs. urban areas; (b) live in relatively more impoverished vs. relatively less impoverished areas (acknowledging gradations of poverty within low-income communities); and (c) live in ethnically heterogeneous vs. homogenous communities. We expect more impoverished groups to be discouraged by the \u201chard\u201d postcard variant due to the price of stamps, and we expect internet access to be a more difficult barrier in more impoverished areas as well, in turn decreasing the effectiveness of the email variant. We expect urban areas to be more motivated to either call the phone hotline or send an email, but rural areas to be more accustomed to continuing outreach via more traditional mail methods. We also expect different effects in Roma communities\u2014which are geographically segregated, homogenous, and should be identifiable by zip code and other characteristics. Specifically, we expect each barrier to prove more difficult to overcome in Roma communities due to heavy stigmatization around their uptake of social benefits.", "q17": "As a certified NGO that works closely with many public schools across Greece, Prolepsis is allowed to conduct surveys to measure school children\u2019s nutritional and health attributes and assess future needs. As such, Prolepsis conducts an annual survey in conjunction with their partner schools and asks students to take a survey home to their parents/guardians assessing nutritional and other health measures. They will be sending out the annual survey in June of 2016, and will be collected throughout the month. Participants in our survey are thus identified through these cooperating public schools. The sample population for our study will be approximately 10,000 households, but we expect very low response rates to our treatments. All these surveys are anonymous, and have a 4 digit identifying number of the subject's choice. This 4 digit number will not be linked to individual identifiers. We plan to vary the follow-up action we ask respondents to undertake, to better assess whether small bureaucratic conveniences or inconveniences make a significant difference in the uptake of rights. First, we plan to vary whether we ask people to (a) mail in a stamped, self-addressed envelope; (b) write an address and purchase a stamp, before mailing the same postcard; (c) call a phone number; or (4) send an email (n=2,500 each). If resources permit, we will also examine whether it matters whether the number listed corresponds to someone the parents know personally (e.g. the school principal) or someone the parents do not know (e.g. an NGO). While we are sending the survey questionnaire to 10,000 households, we expect only about 1-8% of households to solicit follow-up information, depending on the treatment condition. As such, we expect approximately 25-200 respondents per treatment. This sample will be used to test one main hypothesis with regard to the impact of varying bureaucratic inconveniences. Based on Prolepsis\u2019s past annual questionnaires and their experience with different mediums of communication, we expect a 5% response rate to the easy postcard variant, 1% response rate to the \u201chard\u201d post-card variant, 8% by phone, and 4-5% by email.
