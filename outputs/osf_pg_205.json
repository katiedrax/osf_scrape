For instance, the greater the effort to cover a distance, the longer people perceive this distance. The present multilevel Bayesian meta-analysis supports the existence of a small action constraint effect on distance estimation, Hedge\u2019s g = 0.29, 95% CrI [0.16, 0.47] (Nstudies = 37, Nparticipants = 1035). This effect slightly varied according to the action constraint category (i.e., effort, weight, and tool-use) but not according to participants\u2019 motor intention. Some authors argued such effects reflect experimental demand biases rather than genuine perceptual effects. Our meta-analysis did not allow to dismiss this possibility, but it did not support it. We provide field-specific conventions for interpreting action constraint effect sizes and minimum sample size to detect them with various levels of power. We encourage researchers to update this meta-analysis using our online repository (https://osf.io/bc3wn/) to send their published or unpublished data.\n\nKeywords: perception-action, visual

The condition is characterized by pain, stiffness, and dysfunction of the affected shoulder. The prevalence of shoulder adhesive capsulitis is about 2% to 5% in general adult population and 10% to 20% in diabetics of the general population. The majority of patients diagnosed with adhesive capsulitis are women between 40 and 60 years of age. Patients with shoulder adhesive capsulitis are more likely to experience sleepless, anxiety, and even disability, which may seriously affect the patients\u2019 daily life and occupational activities. As a self-limited disease, shoulder adhesive capsulitis can persist for years with some patients never regaining full function of their shoulder, which may account for an enormous economic pressure on healthcare.  In the UK, for example, the National Health Service (NHS) costs at least \u00a344.1 million to \u00a3110.3 million based on a single general practitioner consultation for each case. Currently, the treatments of shoulder adhesive capsulitis include cortisone injections, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physiotherapy, arthroscopic capsular release and manipulation under anesthesia, etc. However, most of the treatments only have some effective therapy in a short-term, and the majority of these interventions are often accompanied by varying degrees of side-effects. \n     Bee venom acupuncture is a form of acupuncture in which bee venom is applied to the tips of acupuncture needles, stingers are extracted from bees, or bees are held with an instrument, such as a forceps, squeezed to cause the stinger to emerge from the lower abdomen, and then either the needles or stinger is applied acupoints on the skin. Bee venom acupuncture has been widely used as a complementary and alternative therapy to relieve pain and inflammation for 3000 years. Studies have demonstrated that bee venom acupuncture contains many kinds of components which may show pharmacological actions such as anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, anti-fibrosis and anti-arthrosclerosis. With these pharmaceutical characteristics, bee venom acupuncture has been used as the therapeutic method in treating osteoarthritis keen pain, Parkinson\u2019s disease,  rheumatoid arthritis,  etc. Moreover, studies have indicated that bee venom acupuncture with physical therapy can be more effective in improving pain and function than physical therapy alone, and may help to improve long-term of life in patients with shoulder adhesive capsulitis. \nAlthough bee venom acupuncture has been utilized to treat shoulder adhesive capsulitis for a long time, there was no systematic review conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of bee venom acupuncture for shoulder adhesive capsulitis.

The condition is characterized by pain, stiffness, and dysfunction of the affected shoulder. The prevalence of shoulder adhesive capsulitis is about 2% to 5% in general adult population and 10% to 20% in diabetics of the general population. The majority of patients diagnosed with adhesive capsulitis are women between 40 and 60 years of age. Patients with shoulder adhesive capsulitis are more likely to experience sleepless, anxiety, and even disability, which may seriously affect the patients\u2019 daily life and occupational activities. As a self-limited disease, shoulder adhesive capsulitis can persist for years with some patients never regaining full function of their shoulder, which may account for an enormous economic pressure on healthcare.  In the UK, for example, the National Health Service (NHS) costs at least \u00a344.1 million to \u00a3110.3 million based on a single general practitioner consultation for each case. Currently, the treatments of shoulder adhesive capsulitis include cortisone injections, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physiotherapy, arthroscopic capsular release and manipulation under anesthesia, etc. However, most of the treatments only have some effective therapy in a short-term, and the majority of these interventions are often accompanied by varying degrees of side-effects. \n     Bee venom acupuncture is a form of acupuncture in which bee venom is applied to the tips of acupuncture needles, stingers are extracted from bees, or bees are held with an instrument, such as a forceps, squeezed to cause the stinger to emerge from the lower abdomen, and then either the needles or stinger is applied acupoints on the skin. Bee venom acupuncture has been widely used as a complementary and alternative therapy to relieve pain and inflammation for 3000 years. Studies have demonstrated that bee venom acupuncture contains many kinds of components which may show pharmacological actions such as anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, anti-fibrosis and anti-arthrosclerosis. With these pharmaceutical characteristics, bee venom acupuncture has been used as the therapeutic method in treating osteoarthritis keen pain, Parkinson\u2019s disease,  rheumatoid arthritis,  etc. Moreover, studies have indicated that bee venom acupuncture with physical therapy can be more effective in improving pain and function than physical therapy alone, and may help to improve long-term of life in patients with shoulder adhesive capsulitis. \nAlthough bee venom acupuncture has been utilized to treat shoulder adhesive capsulitis for a long time, there was no systematic review conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of bee venom acupuncture for shoulder adhesive capsulitis. Therefore, we conducted this systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of bee venom acupuncture for shoulder adhesive capsulitis.\n", "q5": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies.", "q6": ["No blinding is involved in this study."], "q7": "", "q9": "", "q10": "Registration prior to analysis of the data", "q11": "", "q13": "As this is a systematic review, no sample size is needed.", "q14": "", "q15": "", "q20": "", "q21": "", "q22": "", "q23": "Missing data will obtain by contacting authors.", "q24": "", "q25": "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE), which is a method of grading the level of evidence and is developed by the GRADE Working Group, will be applied to evaluate the quality of evidence by two independent reviewers (HYF and HYF).

After each participant had been given the next set of questionnaires, I played a short movie clip from the movie The Champ for all participants to watch before filling out the scales. After watching the video, participants completed the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (Nordgren, McDonnel, &amp; Loewenstein, 2011) to measure their mood and ensure the manipulation was effective.

Half of the papers instructed participants to write a sad personal event, and the other half instructed them to write about a positive personal event. After all the papers had been handed out, I started a timer for five minutes and instructed the participants to begin writing for the entire duration of the five minutes. After the five minutes of writing, I collected their short stories and scales and handed out the next set of questions for them to fill out later. After each participant had been given the next set of questionnaires, I played a short movie clip from the movie The Champ for all participants to watch before filling out the scales. After watching the video, participants completed the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (Nordgren, McDonnel, &amp; Loewenstein, 2011) to measure their mood and ensure the manipulation was effective. They then filled out the last three scales they received in the handout.  The first of these scales was the Self-Overlap Scale (Aron, Aron, &amp; Smollan, 1992), followed by the Shen\u2019s State Empathy Scale (Shen, 2010), which will both be used to measure the extent to which they identified and empathized with the character. Then, participants rated on a scale from one to ten how painful the situation in the video was for the little boy. After completing these scales, all participants answered the attached list of ten questions to measure their memory of the video. Lastly, participants were asked five questions regarding their sex, age, ethnicity, and year in school, which were also included in the handout. After handing in the last packet of scales and questions, they were then be given the opportunity to have a debriefing session with me. During this session I fully explained the purpose of the study. Before they signed out, all participants were given a debriefing document on which they wrote out five things that they are thankful for in order to ease those in the sad condition into a more positive mood. This document also thanked them for their participation, outlined the purpose of the study, and included the contact information for Dr. Veit, the ONU Institutional Review Board, and Olivet\u2019s Counseling Services, and for myself. At the end of the debriefing session, I asked each student to write their name, email and which class they wished to receive extra credit for on a separate form. ", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "I manipulated the participants' mood by randomly assigning them to either a happy or sad condition. Participants in the sad condition wrote for five minutes about a sad or upsetting personal event and participants in the happy condition wrote for five minutes about a happy or positive personal event. \n", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Mood: Mood will be evaluated before and after the IV manipulation to see if it was effective in creating a sad mood. \nEmpathy: Empathy will be evaluated to tell how much empathy each participant had towards the little boy in the video. A baseline of their prosocial behavior will also be evaluated. \nPain: I will ask each participant to rate on a scale from one to ten how painful the situation in the video was for the little boy. \nMemory: Memory will evaluated by asking participants 10 questions relating to the movie clip.\nBaseline need for cognition: In order to control for the confounding variable of the participants\u2019 memory of the movie clip that is not based on their congruency of mood with the character or empathy with the character in the movie clip, I will get a baseline of their need for cognition before they answer the 10 questions about the movie clip.  ", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": " Mood will be measured by using the Faces-Pain Scale-Revised (Nordgren, McDonnel, &amp; Loewenstein, 2011), which gives participants six choices of faces on a scale of 0 to 10 from a neutral to negative mood. I will also get a baseline of their mood at the beginning of the study using the Brief Mood Introspection Scale, which has 16 moods that participants rate on a continuum from 1 to 4 using the following criteria: (definitely do not feel) (do not feel) (slightly feel) (definitely feel), followed by a scale from -10 to 10 from a very unpleasant mood to a pleasant mood (Mayer &amp; Gaschke, 2013). Empathy will be measured using the Self-Overlap Scale, which has them choose between seven pictures depicting how much they empathize with the boy in the movie clip (Aron, Aron, &amp; Smollan, 1992). This will be followed by the Shen\u2019s State Empathy Scale, which includes a list of 12 items on a scale of 0 to for with 0 being \u201cnot at all\u201d and 4 being \u201ccompletely\u201d (Shen, 2010). I will also get a baseline of their empathy and prosocial behavior tendencies using the prosocialness scale for adults, which has 16 items and participants will check off any of them that apply to them (Caprara, Steca, Zelli, &amp; Capanna, 2005). To measure how much pain they thought the boy in the clip was in I will ask each participant to rate on a scale from one to ten how painful the situation in the video was for the little boy. I will measure their memory by asking them ten questions relating to the movie clip. In order to control for the memory of the movie clip that was not based on their emotional congruency or empathy with the character I will get a baseline of their need for cognition using the 18-Item Need for Cognition Scale (Cacioppo, 1983).

Rationale\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder\ncharacterized by unusual levels of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Given the large variability in the expression of this disorder, an extensive search for biological markers of the disorder has been conducted, looking for those characteristics that allow to distinguish clinical cases from the general population and to deepen the knowledge about the physiology of the disorder.\nAmong the different techniques used to identify biological markers in psychiatric disorders,\neye- tracking methodologies and the study of eye movements provides a powerful research tool to assess working functions of the brain and processes related to the flexible control of behavior such as decision making and task switching (Pouget, 2019). Since we can fixate on only one visual target at any one time, we are constantly selecting among different alternatives upon which to focus (Milea et al., 2007), resisting distractor stimuli and overriding predominant responses that are incompatible with the goal we have in mind (Polner et al., 2015; Roberts et al., 2011). This ability to withhold actions to refrain from acting reflexively, habitually or impulsively (Bompas et al., 2019), and to minimize the\nprocessing of irrelevant information while selecting relevant information (Ettinger et al., 2018) is identified as inhibition and is one of the fundamental components of the executive control of behavior (Bari &amp; Robbins, 2013; Miyake et al., 2000).\nDeficits in inhibitory control have been proposed as one of the main characteristics of ADHD\n(Barkley, 1997; Wodka et al., 2007). Evidence of differences between cases and typical population when executing tasks such as the go/no-go (Epstein et al., 2007; Uebel et al., 2010; Wiersema &amp; Roeyers, 2009) and stop-signal tasks (Alderson et al., 2008; Schachar et al., 2007; Tillman et al., 2008) supports this hypothesis. Oculomotor tasks, however, provide the advantage of assessing motor responses that are reflex-like in nature and do not have to be trained (Roberts et al., 2011). There is an increasing number of studies where the inhibition of unwanted responses is assessed in ADHD using paradigms such as the antisaccade task, the countermanding saccadic task, the oculomotor capture task, and the memory-guided saccade task, among others (see Table 1 in Appendix A for detailed information). In addition, prosaccade, fixational control, and smooth pursuit tasks are frequently used to measure processes of visual attention, basic sensorimotor transformations, and other visuomotor\nfunctions (see Table 2 in Appendix A). To summarize and quantify the effects reported in the\noculomotor outcome measures across different tasks of eye movements will provide useful\ninformation about the sensitivity of these tasks as tools to assess inhibitory impairments in ADHD.\n\nKey Questions:\nOn the basis of these findings, we formulate the following research questions:\n- Primary Research Question and Hypothesis: ADHD patients have impaired oculomotor\ninhibitory control compared to healthy individuals.\n- Exploratory Research Question 1: What are the effects of potential moderators such as age,\nsex and medication status?\n- Exploratory Research Question 2: Which of the employed oculomotor inhibitory control\noutcomes show the greatest sensitivity to ADHD?\n- Exploratory Research Question 3: Are there other, non-inhibitory oculomotor deficits in\nADHD, involving temporal or spatial aspects of eye movements? How do these effect sizes\ncompare to those of our Primary Research Question?\n- Exploratory Research Question 4: How do the effect sizes from Research Question 1\nqualitatively compare to effect sizes of other inhibitory tasks from published meta-analyses,\ne.g. of the stop-signal, go/no-go, Eriksen flanker and Stroop tasks?\n\n7. Objectives\nTo summarize the effects reported in studies that compared the inhibition of oculomotor\nresponses between ADHD patients and non-clinical controls (children, adolescents, and adults). No intervention effects will be studied; however, we will consider medication status of ADHD participants as potential moderator, if sufficient data are available (ON/OFF, medication type, and dose). The analyses will focus on case-control comparisons; age, sex and medication status will be included as moderators. The primary outcomes will be the measures related to the inhibition of oculomotor responses in different tasks (Table 1). We will analyze additional measures related to temporal and spatial aspects of eye movements as secondary outcomes (Table 2).\nThis meta-analysis will be conducted following PRISMA-P (2015) guidelines (Shamseer et\nal., 2015) and will be pre-registered at Open Science Framework (OSF) before data extraction.\n\nSECTION 3: Methods\n\n8. Eligibility criteria\nThe search phase was last updated in February 2020. We searched for studies assessing eye\nmovements in individuals with ADHD. Figure 1 (Appendix A) depicts the search flow and the criteria used for the review.\n\n9. Information sources\nElectronic database search was conducted in PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and Web of Science (www.webofknowledge.com). Detailed information is found in Table 3 (Appendix A). No data extraction was done during pre-registration. We also scanned the reference lists of relevant reviews identified through the search to ensure literature saturation. We searched for supplementary files to make sure that all relevant material has been identified.\n\n10. Search strategy \nWe used terms related to \u201ceye movements\u201d or \u201ceye tracking\u201d, combined with \u201cADHD\u201d or\n\u201cAttention Deficit with Hyperactivity Disorder\u201d. General inhibitory control-related terms (not\ninvolving eye movements) were not included in the search to be able to detect relevant findings in ADHD studies that are not explicitly assessing inhibitory control but might include oculomotor measures related with this domain (e.g. anticipatory responses, number of deviations from a given target).\nThe PubMed search strategy was: (oculomotor OR \"ocular motor\" OR \"eye movement\" OR\n\"eye movements\" OR saccade OR saccades OR saccadic OR antisaccade OR antisaccades OR\nantisaccadic OR countermanding OR \"smooth pursuit\" OR \"smooth eye\" OR \"pursuit eye\" OR \"eye tracking\" OR eyetracking OR eyetracker OR eye-tracker) AND (adhd OR \"attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder\").\nAfter PubMed search, we adapted the terms to the syntax of Web of Science as follows:\nTOPIC: ((oculomotor OR \"ocular motor\" OR \"eye movement\" OR \"eye movements\" OR saccade OR saccades OR saccadic OR antisaccade OR antisaccades OR antisaccadic OR countermanding OR \"smooth pursuit\" OR \"smooth eye\" OR \"pursuit eye\" OR \"eye tracking\" OR eyetracking OR eyetracker OR eye-tracker) AND (adhd OR \"attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\")).\nThe results retrieved in each search were double-checked by a second researcher (UE). The\nsearch strategy completed until this point is depicted in the flow diagram in Figure 1.\n\n11. Study records\n11a. Mechanism(s) used to manage records and data throughout the review: We have\nadapted Excel templates reported elsewhere (Moreau &amp; Gamble, 2020) to manage records obtained from the literature search.\n\n11b. Process for selecting studies: YC conducted the first screening by reviewing the titles\nand abstracts yielded by the search (abstract screening). A score ranging from 0 to 2 was assigned to each record as follows: 0=unsuitable (no ADHD sample, or no oculomotor measure), 1=questionable (ADHD sample but suitability of oculomotor measure to be discussed, open population with ADHD-like characteristics, comorbid samples, reviews with valuable information, rapid eye movements (REM) during sleep) and, 2=likely suitable (research studies with at least one group of individuals with ADHD, and oculomotor measures related to inhibitory control).\nAfter abstract screening, we decided to exclude studies about REM sleep since these cannot\nbe used to index inhibitory oculomotor control as conceptualized in this study. The primary researcher screened full texts and decided whether these were suitable for inclusion. Again, a score from 0 to 2 was assigned to each record, as above.\nA second researcher (SS) will double-check full texts and score them independently and blind\nto the scores from the first researcher. Level of agreement will be assessed, and disagreement resolved through discussion with the leading member of the research project (UE). We will record the reasons for excluding studies. Researchers will not be blind to journal titles, study authors or institutions.\n\n11c. Planned method of extracting data: Data extraction will be completed by YC and\nconfirmed independently in a subset of 10 studies by SS. If any information from the studies is incomplete or unclear we will contact the corresponding and/or other author(s) on the paper by email, three times over three weeks. If no response is received four weeks after the first email and eligibility cannot be determined, the study will be excluded.\n\n12. Data items\nFor each selected study, information will be extracted on publication (names of authors, publication year, journal, language), sample characteristics (diagnostic status, sample size, average age, sex distribution), the type of criteria used to define ADHD (e.g., DSM-III, DSM-IV, DSM-5, ICD-10). When possible, we will extract the scores from the scales used to characterize ADHD and the severity of ADHD symptoms (inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity), and the medication status (ON/OFF, type of medication, dose).\n\n13. Outcomes and prioritization\nThe outcome measures to be considered are enlisted below, each outcome is defined in Table 1 and Table 2 (Appendix A):\n\nPrimary outcomes (measures reported as inhibitory control parameters):\n1. Direction errors (antisaccade tasks)\n2. Saccades to distractors (oculomotor capture task)\n3. Intrusive saccades (oculomotor capture task)\n4. Anticipatory saccades (memory-guided saccade task)\n5. Intrusive saccades (memory-guided saccade task)\n6. Stop signal reaction time (saccadic countermanding task)\n7. Intrusive saccades (prolonged fixation task)\n8. Anticipatory saccades (smooth pursuit)\n\nSecondary outcomes (measures related to timing and spatial parameters of oculomotor response):\n1. Saccadic reaction time (mean, SD, CV) (visually-guided, memory-guided, antisaccade,\noculomotor capture)\n2. Express saccades (visually-guided, memory-guided, antisaccade, oculomotor capture)\n3. Saccadic gain (visually-guided, memory-guided, antisaccade, oculomotor capture)\n4. Distance error / spatial accuracy (visually-guided, memory-guided, antisaccade, oculomotor capture)\n5. Saccadic velocity (mean and peak velocity) (visually-guided, memory-guided, antisaccade,\noculomotor capture)\n6. Fixation duration (prolonged fixation task)\n7. Pursuit gain (smooth pursuit)\n8. Catch-up saccades (smooth pursuit)\n9. Back-up saccades (smooth pursuit)\n10. Square jerk waves (smooth pursuit)\n\n14. Risk of bias in individual studies\nPapers selected for inclusion will be subjected to appraisal following the guidelines of the JBI\nCritical Appraisal Checklist for Analytical Cross Sectional Studies, a tool designed by the Joanna Briggs Institute (https://reviewersmanual.joannabriggs.org/). This checklist allows to assess the methodological quality of individual studies and to determine the extent to which each study has addressed the possibility of bias in its design, conduct, and analysis (Moola et al., 2017). \n\n15. Data synthesis\n15a. Criteria for data synthesis: We will analyze those outcomes (e.g. direction errors from\nantisaccade task) that are reported in at least five different studies (k=5), to ensure we have enough data to proceed with statistical analyses. Means and standard deviations will be extracted from those oculomotor measures and we will calculate the standardized mean difference (Hedge\u2019s g) if it is not already reported. When the mean and SD are not provided in a study, we will request them to the authors. If they do not reply within the defined time (Item 11c) or provide sufficient information, the study will be excluded. If the number of studies reporting each outcome is sufficient, we will conduct meta-analyses using a random-effects model for each outcome. Our main parameter will be the effect size representing the differences between ADHD participants and controls.\nMeasures will be combined and calculated using \u201cmetafor\u201d package (Viechtbauer, 2010) for\nR (version 3.6.1, http://www.r-project.org/).\n\n15b. Planned analyses:\n- Individual effect sizes for each outcome will be entered into a random-effects model to\ncompute an overall effect size.\n- Summary effect sizes will be computed using a restricted maximum-likelihood estimator.\n- Heterogeneity will be assessed in the studies by calculating the I2 value, which describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is explained by heterogeneity rather than chance (Higgins et al., 2003).\n\n15c. Additional analyses: If heterogeneity explains a large amount of variance (I2&gt; 75%), metaregression analyses will be conducted including age, sex, medication status, as factors to explore their influences as potential sources of variance. If needed, a subgroup analyses will be implemented depending on what factor or factors are found to be strong moderators.\n\n15d. Alternative analyses: In the case quantitative analyses are not possible, or we found\nqualitative information that is relevant for the meta-analysis, we will synthesize the information in the text and in tables to summarise the main characteristics of the included studies, and to explore the differences and relationships among the reported findings.\n\n16. Planned assessment of meta-bias(es)\n- Funnel plot of the selected studies will be used to inspect the symmetry of effect size distribution.\n- Linear regression test for funnel plot asymmetry will be considered to test for publication\nbias.\n- In the case of significant publication bias, trim-and-fill analyses will be implemented.\n\n17. Confidence in cumulative estimate\nGiven that the protocol is not designed to assess intervention effects or other clinical\nimplications, we consider this section not necessary.\n\nSECTION 4: Additional information\n\nDeviations from the plan: NA.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAlderson, R.

Rationale\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder\ncharacterized by unusual levels of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Given the large variability in the expression of this disorder, an extensive search for biological markers of the disorder has been conducted, looking for those characteristics that allow to distinguish clinical cases from the general population and to deepen the knowledge about the physiology of the disorder.\nAmong the different techniques used to identify biological markers in psychiatric disorders,\neye- tracking methodologies and the study of eye movements provides a powerful research tool to assess working functions of the brain and processes related to the flexible control of behavior such as decision making and task switching (Pouget, 2019). Since we can fixate on only one visual target at any one time, we are constantly selecting among different alternatives upon which to focus (Milea et al., 2007), resisting distractor stimuli and overriding predominant responses that are incompatible with the goal we have in mind (Polner et al., 2015; Roberts et al., 2011). This ability to withhold actions to refrain from acting reflexively, habitually or impulsively (Bompas et al., 2019), and to minimize the\nprocessing of irrelevant information while selecting relevant information (Ettinger et al., 2018) is identified as inhibition and is one of the fundamental components of the executive control of behavior (Bari &amp; Robbins, 2013; Miyake et al., 2000).\nDeficits in inhibitory control have been proposed as one of the main characteristics of ADHD\n(Barkley, 1997; Wodka et al., 2007). Evidence of differences between cases and typical population when executing tasks such as the go/no-go (Epstein et al., 2007; Uebel et al., 2010; Wiersema &amp; Roeyers, 2009) and stop-signal tasks (Alderson et al., 2008; Schachar et al., 2007; Tillman et al., 2008) supports this hypothesis. Oculomotor tasks, however, provide the advantage of assessing motor responses that are reflex-like in nature and do not have to be trained (Roberts et al., 2011). There is an increasing number of studies where the inhibition of unwanted responses is assessed in ADHD using paradigms such as the antisaccade task, the countermanding saccadic task, the oculomotor capture task, and the memory-guided saccade task, among others (see Table 1 in Appendix A for detailed information). In addition, prosaccade, fixational control, and smooth pursuit tasks are frequently used to measure processes of visual attention, basic sensorimotor transformations, and other visuomotor\nfunctions (see Table 2 in Appendix A). To summarize and quantify the effects reported in the\noculomotor outcome measures across different tasks of eye movements will provide useful\ninformation about the sensitivity of these tasks as tools to assess inhibitory impairments in ADHD.\n\nKey Questions:\nOn the basis of these findings, we formulate the following research questions:\n- Primary Research Question and Hypothesis: ADHD patients have impaired oculomotor\ninhibitory control compared to healthy individuals.\n- Exploratory Research Question 1: What are the effects of potential moderators such as age,\nsex and medication status?\n- Exploratory Research Question 2: Which of the employed oculomotor inhibitory control\noutcomes show the greatest sensitivity to ADHD?\n- Exploratory Research Question 3: Are there other, non-inhibitory oculomotor deficits in\nADHD, involving temporal or spatial aspects of eye movements? How do these effect sizes\ncompare to those of our Primary Research Question?\n- Exploratory Research Question 4: How do the effect sizes from Research Question 1\nqualitatively compare to effect sizes of other inhibitory tasks from published meta-analyses,\ne.g. of the stop-signal, go/no-go, Eriksen flanker and Stroop tasks?\n\n7. Objectives\nTo summarize the effects reported in studies that compared the inhibition of oculomotor\nresponses between ADHD patients and non-clinical controls (children, adolescents, and adults). No intervention effects will be studied; however, we will consider medication status of ADHD participants as potential moderator, if sufficient data are available (ON/OFF, medication type, and dose). The analyses will focus on case-control comparisons; age, sex and medication status will be included as moderators. The primary outcomes will be the measures related to the inhibition of oculomotor responses in different tasks (Table 1). We will analyze additional measures related to temporal and spatial aspects of eye movements as secondary outcomes (Table 2).\nThis meta-analysis will be conducted following PRISMA-P (2015) guidelines (Shamseer et\nal., 2015) and will be pre-registered at Open Science Framework (OSF) before data extraction.\n\nSECTION 3: Methods\n\n8. Eligibility criteria\nThe search phase was last updated in February 2020. We searched for studies assessing eye\nmovements in individuals with ADHD. Figure 1 (Appendix A) depicts the search flow and the criteria used for the review.\n\n9. Information sources\nElectronic database search was conducted in PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and Web of Science (www.webofknowledge.com). Detailed information is found in Table 3 (Appendix A). No data extraction was done during pre-registration. We also scanned the reference lists of relevant reviews identified through the search to ensure literature saturation. We searched for supplementary files to make sure that all relevant material has been identified.\n\n10. Search strategy \nWe used terms related to \u201ceye movements\u201d or \u201ceye tracking\u201d, combined with \u201cADHD\u201d or\n\u201cAttention Deficit with Hyperactivity Disorder\u201d. General inhibitory control-related terms (not\ninvolving eye movements) were not included in the search to be able to detect relevant findings in ADHD studies that are not explicitly assessing inhibitory control but might include oculomotor measures related with this domain (e.g. anticipatory responses, number of deviations from a given target).\nThe PubMed search strategy was: (oculomotor OR \"ocular motor\" OR \"eye movement\" OR\n\"eye movements\" OR saccade OR saccades OR saccadic OR antisaccade OR antisaccades OR\nantisaccadic OR countermanding OR \"smooth pursuit\" OR \"smooth eye\" OR \"pursuit eye\" OR \"eye tracking\" OR eyetracking OR eyetracker OR eye-tracker) AND (adhd OR \"attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder\").\nAfter PubMed search, we adapted the terms to the syntax of Web of Science as follows:\nTOPIC: ((oculomotor OR \"ocular motor\" OR \"eye movement\" OR \"eye movements\" OR saccade OR saccades OR saccadic OR antisaccade OR antisaccades OR antisaccadic OR countermanding OR \"smooth pursuit\" OR \"smooth eye\" OR \"pursuit eye\" OR \"eye tracking\" OR eyetracking OR eyetracker OR eye-tracker) AND (adhd OR \"attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\")).\nThe results retrieved in each search were double-checked by a second researcher (UE). The\nsearch strategy completed until this point is depicted in the flow diagram in Figure 1.\n\n11. Study records\n11a. Mechanism(s) used to manage records and data throughout the review: We have\nadapted Excel templates reported elsewhere (Moreau &amp; Gamble, 2020) to manage records obtained from the literature search.\n\n11b. Process for selecting studies: YC conducted the first screening by reviewing the titles\nand abstracts yielded by the search (abstract screening). A score ranging from 0 to 2 was assigned to each record as follows: 0=unsuitable (no ADHD sample, or no oculomotor measure), 1=questionable (ADHD sample but suitability of oculomotor measure to be discussed, open population with ADHD-like characteristics, comorbid samples, reviews with valuable information, rapid eye movements (REM) during sleep) and, 2=likely suitable (research studies with at least one group of individuals with ADHD, and oculomotor measures related to inhibitory control).\nAfter abstract screening, we decided to exclude studies about REM sleep since these cannot\nbe used to index inhibitory oculomotor control as conceptualized in this study. The primary researcher screened full texts and decided whether these were suitable for inclusion. Again, a score from 0 to 2 was assigned to each record, as above.\nA second researcher (SS) will double-check full texts and score them independently and blind\nto the scores from the first researcher. Level of agreement will be assessed, and disagreement resolved through discussion with the leading member of the research project (UE). We will record the reasons for excluding studies. Researchers will not be blind to journal titles, study authors or institutions.\n\n11c. Planned method of extracting data: Data extraction will be completed by YC and\nconfirmed independently in a subset of 10 studies by SS. If any information from the studies is incomplete or unclear we will contact the corresponding and/or other author(s) on the paper by email, three times over three weeks. If no response is received four weeks after the first email and eligibility cannot be determined, the study will be excluded.\n\n12. Data items\nFor each selected study, information will be extracted on publication (names of authors, publication year, journal, language), sample characteristics (diagnostic status, sample size, average age, sex distribution), the type of criteria used to define ADHD (e.g., DSM-III, DSM-IV, DSM-5, ICD-10). When possible, we will extract the scores from the scales used to characterize ADHD and the severity of ADHD symptoms (inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity), and the medication status (ON/OFF, type of medication, dose).\n\n13. Outcomes and prioritization\nThe outcome measures to be considered are enlisted below, each outcome is defined in Table 1 and Table 2 (Appendix A):\n\nPrimary outcomes (measures reported as inhibitory control parameters):\n1. Direction errors (antisaccade tasks)\n2. Saccades to distractors (oculomotor capture task)\n3. Intrusive saccades (oculomotor capture task)\n4. Anticipatory saccades (memory-guided saccade task)\n5. Intrusive saccades (memory-guided saccade task)\n6. Stop signal reaction time (saccadic countermanding task)\n7. Intrusive saccades (prolonged fixation task)\n8. Anticipatory saccades (smooth pursuit)\n\nSecondary outcomes (measures related to timing and spatial parameters of oculomotor response):\n1. Saccadic reaction time (mean, SD, CV) (visually-guided, memory-guided, antisaccade,\noculomotor capture)\n2. Express saccades (visually-guided, memory-guided, antisaccade, oculomotor capture)\n3. Saccadic gain (visually-guided, memory-guided, antisaccade, oculomotor capture)\n4. Distance error / spatial accuracy (visually-guided, memory-guided, antisaccade, oculomotor capture)\n5. Saccadic velocity (mean and peak velocity) (visually-guided, memory-guided, antisaccade,\noculomotor capture)\n6. Fixation duration (prolonged fixation task)\n7. Pursuit gain (smooth pursuit)\n8. Catch-up saccades (smooth pursuit)\n9. Back-up saccades (smooth pursuit)\n10. Square jerk waves (smooth pursuit)\n\n14. Risk of bias in individual studies\nPapers selected for inclusion will be subjected to appraisal following the guidelines of the JBI\nCritical Appraisal Checklist for Analytical Cross Sectional Studies, a tool designed by the Joanna Briggs Institute (https://reviewersmanual.joannabriggs.org/). This checklist allows to assess the methodological quality of individual studies and to determine the extent to which each study has addressed the possibility of bias in its design, conduct, and analysis (Moola et al., 2017). \n\n15. Data synthesis\n15a. Criteria for data synthesis: We will analyze those outcomes (e.g. direction errors from\nantisaccade task) that are reported in at least five different studies (k=5), to ensure we have enough data to proceed with statistical analyses. Means and standard deviations will be extracted from those oculomotor measures and we will calculate the standardized mean difference (Hedge\u2019s g) if it is not already reported. When the mean and SD are not provided in a study, we will request them to the authors. If they do not reply within the defined time (Item 11c) or provide sufficient information, the study will be excluded. If the number of studies reporting each outcome is sufficient, we will conduct meta-analyses using a random-effects model for each outcome. Our main parameter will be the effect size representing the differences between ADHD participants and controls.\nMeasures will be combined and calculated using \u201cmetafor\u201d package (Viechtbauer, 2010) for\nR (version 3.6.1, http://www.r-project.org/).\n\n15b. Planned analyses:\n- Individual effect sizes for each outcome will be entered into a random-effects model to\ncompute an overall effect size.\n- Summary effect sizes will be computed using a restricted maximum-likelihood estimator.\n- Heterogeneity will be assessed in the studies by calculating the I2 value, which describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is explained by heterogeneity rather than chance (Higgins et al., 2003).\n\n15c. Additional analyses: If heterogeneity explains a large amount of variance (I2&gt; 75%), metaregression analyses will be conducted including age, sex, medication status, as factors to explore their influences as potential sources of variance. If needed, a subgroup analyses will be implemented depending on what factor or factors are found to be strong moderators.\n\n15d. Alternative analyses: In the case quantitative analyses are not possible, or we found\nqualitative information that is relevant for the meta-analysis, we will synthesize the information in the text and in tables to summarise the main characteristics of the included studies, and to explore the differences and relationships among the reported findings.\n\n16. Planned assessment of meta-bias(es)\n- Funnel plot of the selected studies will be used to inspect the symmetry of effect size distribution.\n- Linear regression test for funnel plot asymmetry will be considered to test for publication\nbias.\n- In the case of significant publication bias, trim-and-fill analyses will be implemented.\n\n17. Confidence in cumulative estimate\nGiven that the protocol is not designed to assess intervention effects or other clinical\nimplications, we consider this section not necessary.\n\nSECTION 4: Additional information\n\nDeviations from the plan: NA.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAlderson, R.

This meta-analysis is the first to examine whether, for adults diagnosed with emotional disorders, the UP was more efficacious than comparators for the improvements in anxiety, depression, and N/NA. Extensive database searches were narrowed to eighteen UP randomized control trials (RCTs). Meta-analyses of RCT data showed the UP outperformed comparators with effect sizes (pre- to post-treatment) that were large for anxiety and depression and moderate for N/NA, these were stable at short-term follow-up. For anxiety and depressive outcomes the UP surpassed waitlist control and treatment-as-usual comparators and was equivalent to traditional CBT. Moderators for depressive outcomes were non-inferiority studies and for anxiety outcomes the protocol language. These results suggest the UP is efficacious for single and co-occurring emotional disorders. Higher quality RCTs can provide more decisive support for this psychotherapy\u2019s efficacy.
