A narrow information diet may be in part to blame for reinforcing people\u2019s political attitudes (e.g., Levendusky, 2013) and for growing affective polarization or the animosity between people who identify with opposing political parties (e.g., Garrett et al., 2014).

We will explore general as well as different types of heterogeneous effects.\n\n\u2022 Attitude Strength\n-------------------\nafter decreasing news consumption, we expect people to be less aware of (and/or likely to forget about) the existence of extreme opposing views, and so to be less likely to adopt a defensive strategy when it comes to their policy posi- tions (Abelson 1986). Also, \u201cnews vacation\u201d decreases people\u2019s exposure to potentially polarizing party and elite cues, which are known to activate latent partisan biases in the minds of citizens, thereby enhancing the expression of support for various political values (Goren et al., 2012), exacerbating attitude strength (see Druckman et al., 2013), and leading voters to hold more consistent attitudes (Levendusky, 2009), including on contentious political topics (e.g., Hart &amp; Nisbet, 2012; see also Nicholson, 2012). Those on news vacation should consequently hold weaker and less personally important issue attitudes and - a crucial innovation of this project - we predict this to be the case even after accounting for people\u2019s levels of prior like-minded news browsing. In other words, decreasing news will exert effects above and beyond decreasing like-minded news.\n\nIn addition to this aggregate effect, we expect heterogeneous effects dependent on three interrelated factors. First, those with high levels of previous news consumption should be most strongly influenced by the treatment, in that the treatment will constitute the largest change to their typical news behavior. We examine both (a) self-reported and (b) online behavioral indicators of prior news consumption levels. Second, the treatment should have the strongest effects on those whose prior news diet is most ideologically like-minded, as like-minded exposure is known to strengthen individual political atti- tudes (e.g., Levendusky, 2013) and so decreasing news exposure should weaken them. Again, we study like-minded exposure as based on both (a) self-reports and (b) on- line behavioral traces. Third, the treatment effects should depend on the strength of individual political predispositions, such that we expect larger effects for those with stronger and more personally important pre-treatment issue attitudes, stronger par- tisanship, ideology, and party identity strength. The strong political identities and predispositions of those individuals will not be activated by external political cues and will become less accessible (see Knobloch-Westerwick &amp; Meng, 2011). Because those with weak political predispositions have - by definition - less accessible priors, the treat- ment effect should be less pronounced.\n\nTreatment\n---------\nH1: Respondents who did not follow the news for one week will have weaker issue attitudes, compared to those in the control group and to their pre-treatment attitude strength.\n\nH1a: The weakening effect will hold when accounting for people\u2019s prior levels of like-minded exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of news consumption\n--------------------------------------------\nH1b: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of news exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of like-minded news consumption\n--------------------------------------------\nH1c: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of like-minded news exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Pre-treatment Attitude Strength\n--------------------------------------------\nH1d: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher prior attitude strength.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 (Party | Ideology | Party Identity) Strength\n--------------------------------------------------------\nH1e,f,g: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of (party | ideology | party identity) strength.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of news consumption \u00d7 Like-minded news consumption\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nH1h: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher piror levels of news exposure that furthermore is like-minded.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Attitude Importance\n---------------------\nFor the same reasons as above (i.e., decreased activation of one\u2019s political identity, issue positions, and lower exposure to information about the discussed policies), we expect the same set of main and heterogeneous effects on post- test attitude importance.\nTreatment\n---------\nH2: Respondents who did not follow the news for one week will view a set of political issues as less personally important, compared to respondents in the control group and to their pre-treatment issue importance measures.\nH2a: The weakening effect will hold even after accounting for people\u2019s prior levels of like-minded exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of news consumption\n--------------------------------------------\nH2b: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of news exposure\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of like-minded news consumption\n--------------------------------------------------------\nH2c: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of like-minded news exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Pre-treatment Attitude Importance\n---------------------------------------------        \nH2d: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher prior attitude importance. \n\nTreatment \u00d7 (Party | Ideology | Party Identity) Strength\n--------------------------------------------------------\nH2e,f,g: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of (party | ideology | party identity) strength.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of news consumption \u00d7 Like-minded news consumption\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nH2h The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher piror levels of news exposure that, moreover, is like-minded.\n\n\n[ B ] AFFECTIVE POLARIZATION\n----------------------------\n----------------------------\n\nQuestion 2: Do people\u2019s levels of affective polarization decrease after not following news for\none week?\n\nAffective polarization, or the extent to which people hold negative attitudes towards political out-groups, can be related to one\u2019s partisan opponents (e.g., Democrats for a Republican), one\u2019s ideological outgroup (e.g., conservatives for a liberal), and/or toward those who hold different views on various political issues. This project assesses all these (potentially dis- tinct) outgroups. We expect people\u2019s levels of affective polarization to decrease after \u201cnews vacation,\u201d during which they are not exposed to (a) salient political cues from the elites and the media, which are found to activate partisan identities and influence cognitions, attitudes, and behaviors (e.g., Druckman et al., 2013; Nicholson, 2012) and (b) media coverage that tends to highlight the existence and relevance of political conflict between Democrats and the Republicans (see Levendusky &amp; Malhotra, 2016), factors that activate and exacerbate peo- ple\u2019s dislike towards the political outgroup. Ultimately, affective polarization should decrease among the treated groups. We expect the effect to be heterogeneous, respondents with higher levels of prior news exposure, higher levels of like-minded news exposure, and with stronger party, ideology, and party identity should depolarize at a higher rate than their counterparts with lower levels of (like-minded) news exposure and with weaker political predispositions in the treatment group and than their counterparts with comparable levels of (like-minded) news consumption and of political predispositions in the control group.\n\nTreatment\n---------\nH3: The levels of (party- | ideology- | issue-)based affective polarization will be lower for respondents who did not follow the news for one week, compared to respondents in the control group and to their pre-treatment levels of affective polarization.\n\nH3a: The lowering effects will hold even after accounting for people\u2019s prior levels of like-minded exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of news consumption\n--------------------------------------------\nH3b: The lowering effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of news exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of like-minded news consumption\n--------------------------------------------------------\nH3c: The lowering effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of like-minded news exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 (Partisan | Ideology | Party Identity) Strength\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nH3d,e,f: The lowering effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of (party | ideology | party identity) strength.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of news consumption \u00d7 Like-minded news consumption\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nH3h: The lowering effect will be stronger among those with higher piror levels of news exposure that, moreover, is like-minded.\n\n\n\n[ C ] PERCEPTION OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM\n\nQuestion 3: Does people\u2019s perception of the political system improve after not being exposed\nto news for one week?\n\nLiterature suggests that a positive perception of the political system contributes to political stability and facilitates a well-functioning democracy (Marien and Hooghe 2001, Acemoglu et al. 2001, Agroskin et al. 2015). In this experiment we focus on the effects of our treatment on three systemic indicators: a) whether respondents believe that the out-party wants to harm the country (i.e., attribution of malevolence), b) whether politicians should be open to compromise, and c) perceived polarization. In line with affective polarization hypotheses, we expect \u201cnews vacation\u201d to decrease the awareness of and familiarity with the presence of divergent views, conflicted groups, and divisive policies, therefore leading to more positive evaluations of the state and health of the political system (see Levendusky &amp; Malhotra, 2016). As before, we expect the effects to be stronger among those with higher prior (like-mined) news exposure and with stronger party, ideology and party identity. Participants with lower (like-minded) news exposure and with weaker party and ideological attachments are likely to have lower prior attribution of malevolence, higher support for compromise across party lines, and be less aware of the salient political conflicts (perceived polarization). For those people, therefore, \u201cnews vacation\u201d may have less pronounced effects compared to those who consume a lot of (like-minded) news and to strong partisans/ideologues.\n\n\n\u2022 Attribution of Malevolence\n----------------------------\nThe extent to which people believe that the other party wants to harm the country.\n\nTreatment\n---------\nH4: Respondents who do not follow the news for one week will be less likely to perceive that the other party wants to harm the country, compared to respondents in the control group and to their prior levels of attribution of malevolence.\n\nH4a: The lowering effect will hold when accounting for people\u2019s prior levels of like- minded exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of news consumption\n--------------------------------------------\nH4b: The lowering effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of news exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of like-minded news consumption\n--------------------------------------------------------\nH4c: The lowering effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels like- minded news exposure. \n\nTreatment \u00d7 (Partisan | Ideology | Party Identity) Strength\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nH4d,e,f The lowering effects will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of (party | ideology | party identity) strength.\n\n\n\u2022 Willingness to Compromise \n----------------------------\nThe extent to which people believe that politicians should be open to compromise. \n\nTreatment\n---------\nH5: Respondents who are not exposed to news for one week will be more likely to believe that politicians should be willing to compromise, relative to the control group and to their pre-test levels of support for compromise.\n\nH5a: The positive effect will hold when accounting for people\u2019s prior levels of like- minded exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of news consumption\n--------------------------------------------\nH5b: The positive effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of news exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of like-minded news consumption\n--------------------------------------------------------\nH5c: The positive effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of like- minded news exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 (Partisan | Ideology | Party Identity) Strength\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nH5d,e,f: The positive effect will be stronger among those with higher levels of (party | ideology | party identity) strength.\n\n\n\u2022 Perceived Polarization\n------------------------\nThe extent to which people see polarization as prevalent. \n\nTreatment\n---------\nH6: Respondents who are not exposed to the news for one week will less likely to perceive political polarization as a prevalent phenomenon, compared to those in the control group and their pretest levels of perceived polarization.\n\nH6a: The weakening effect will hold when accounting for people\u2019s prior levels of like-minded exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of news consumption\n--------------------------------------------\nH6b: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of news exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of like-minded news consumption\n--------------------------------------------------------\nH6c: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of like-minded news exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 (Partisan | Ideology | Party Identity) Strength\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nH6d,e,f: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher levels of (party | ideology | party identity) strength.\n\n[ D ] POLITICAL PARTICIPATION AND KNOWLEDGE\n-------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion 4: Does people\u2019s political engagement (i.e., political participation and political knowledge) decrease after not being exposed to news?\n\nDecades of research clearly show that attending to news enhances political knowledge (because people become aware of the important policies and facts of the day) (Delli Carpini &amp; Keeter, 1996; see also Beam et al, 2017) and that it also motivates people to take part in the political process, partly because they become aware of the important issues and feel more efficacious (Putnam 2000, Norris 2000, Prior 2007). Therefore, those on a \u201cnews vacation\u201d should have lower knowledge of the facts of the day and lower reported participatory intentions.\n\nTreatment\n---------\nH7: Respondents who are not exposed to the news for a week will know less about recent political events than those in a control group.\n\nH8: Respondents who are not exposed to the news for a week will have lower participatory intentions, relative to the respondents in a control group and to their pre-treatment participatory intentions.\n\n\n[ E ] WELL BEING\n----------------\n----------------\n\nQuestion 5: Does people\u2019s well being improve after not being exposed to news?\n\nA recent survey from the American Psychological Association found that\u201cnews consumption\nhas a downside.\u201d More than half of Americans say the news causes them stress, and many re-\nport feeling anxiety, fatigue or sleep loss as a result (Jan 31, 2018, see https://time.com/5125894/is- reading-news-bad-for-you/). Other research similarly suggests that watching daily news cor- relates with negative affect, especially when news is personally relevant (Hoog &amp; Verboon, 2019) and that hard news consumption is associated with decline in mental well-being, likely because the news focus on negative stories, generating a sense of powerlessnes (Boukes &amp; Vliegenthart, 2017). To our knowledge, overtime causal estimates are missing in the liter- ature. We fill this gap and expect that the well-being of respondents will improve after a \u201cnews vacation.\u201d In line with the expectations presented above, we particularly expect this to be the case for those with high levels of prior news consumption.\n\nTreatment\n---------\nH9a: Not being exposed to news for a week will improve respondents\u2019 well being relative to the well being of the respondents in a control group.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 (Partisan | Ideology | Party Identity) Strength\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nH9b,c,d: Not being exposed to news for a week have the strongest effect on improved well being for those respondents with higher (party | ideology | party identity)."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Because those with weak political predispositions have - by definition - less accessible priors, the treat- ment effect should be less pronounced.\n\nTreatment\n---------\nH1: Respondents who did not follow the news for one week will have weaker issue attitudes, compared to those in the control group and to their pre-treatment attitude strength.\n\nH1a: The weakening effect will hold when accounting for people\u2019s prior levels of like-minded exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of news consumption\n--------------------------------------------\nH1b: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of news exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of like-minded news consumption\n--------------------------------------------\nH1c: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of like-minded news exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Pre-treatment Attitude Strength\n--------------------------------------------\nH1d: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher prior attitude strength.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 (Party | Ideology | Party Identity) Strength\n--------------------------------------------------------\nH1e,f,g: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of (party | ideology | party identity) strength.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of news consumption \u00d7 Like-minded news consumption\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nH1h: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher piror levels of news exposure that furthermore is like-minded.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Attitude Importance\n---------------------\nFor the same reasons as above (i.e., decreased activation of one\u2019s political identity, issue positions, and lower exposure to information about the discussed policies), we expect the same set of main and heterogeneous effects on post- test attitude importance.\nTreatment\n---------\nH2: Respondents who did not follow the news for one week will view a set of political issues as less personally important, compared to respondents in the control group and to their pre-treatment issue importance measures.\nH2a: The weakening effect will hold even after accounting for people\u2019s prior levels of like-minded exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of news consumption\n--------------------------------------------\nH2b: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of news exposure\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of like-minded news consumption\n--------------------------------------------------------\nH2c: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of like-minded news exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Pre-treatment Attitude Importance\n---------------------------------------------        \nH2d: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher prior attitude importance. \n\nTreatment \u00d7 (Party | Ideology | Party Identity) Strength\n--------------------------------------------------------\nH2e,f,g: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of (party | ideology | party identity) strength.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of news consumption \u00d7 Like-minded news consumption\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nH2h The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher piror levels of news exposure that, moreover, is like-minded.\n\n\n[ B ] AFFECTIVE POLARIZATION\n----------------------------\n----------------------------\n\nQuestion 2: Do people\u2019s levels of affective polarization decrease after not following news for\none week?\n\nAffective polarization, or the extent to which people hold negative attitudes towards political out-groups, can be related to one\u2019s partisan opponents (e.g., Democrats for a Republican), one\u2019s ideological outgroup (e.g., conservatives for a liberal), and/or toward those who hold different views on various political issues. This project assesses all these (potentially dis- tinct) outgroups. We expect people\u2019s levels of affective polarization to decrease after \u201cnews vacation,\u201d during which they are not exposed to (a) salient political cues from the elites and the media, which are found to activate partisan identities and influence cognitions, attitudes, and behaviors (e.g., Druckman et al., 2013; Nicholson, 2012) and (b) media coverage that tends to highlight the existence and relevance of political conflict between Democrats and the Republicans (see Levendusky &amp; Malhotra, 2016), factors that activate and exacerbate peo- ple\u2019s dislike towards the political outgroup. Ultimately, affective polarization should decrease among the treated groups. We expect the effect to be heterogeneous, respondents with higher levels of prior news exposure, higher levels of like-minded news exposure, and with stronger party, ideology, and party identity should depolarize at a higher rate than their counterparts with lower levels of (like-minded) news exposure and with weaker political predispositions in the treatment group and than their counterparts with comparable levels of (like-minded) news consumption and of political predispositions in the control group.\n\nTreatment\n---------\nH3: The levels of (party- | ideology- | issue-)based affective polarization will be lower for respondents who did not follow the news for one week, compared to respondents in the control group and to their pre-treatment levels of affective polarization.\n\nH3a: The lowering effects will hold even after accounting for people\u2019s prior levels of like-minded exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of news consumption\n--------------------------------------------\nH3b: The lowering effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of news exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of like-minded news consumption\n--------------------------------------------------------\nH3c: The lowering effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of like-minded news exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 (Partisan | Ideology | Party Identity) Strength\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nH3d,e,f: The lowering effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of (party | ideology | party identity) strength.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of news consumption \u00d7 Like-minded news consumption\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nH3h: The lowering effect will be stronger among those with higher piror levels of news exposure that, moreover, is like-minded.\n\n\n\n[ C ] PERCEPTION OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM\n\nQuestion 3: Does people\u2019s perception of the political system improve after not being exposed\nto news for one week?\n\nLiterature suggests that a positive perception of the political system contributes to political stability and facilitates a well-functioning democracy (Marien and Hooghe 2001, Acemoglu et al. 2001, Agroskin et al. 2015). In this experiment we focus on the effects of our treatment on three systemic indicators: a) whether respondents believe that the out-party wants to harm the country (i.e., attribution of malevolence), b) whether politicians should be open to compromise, and c) perceived polarization. In line with affective polarization hypotheses, we expect \u201cnews vacation\u201d to decrease the awareness of and familiarity with the presence of divergent views, conflicted groups, and divisive policies, therefore leading to more positive evaluations of the state and health of the political system (see Levendusky &amp; Malhotra, 2016). As before, we expect the effects to be stronger among those with higher prior (like-mined) news exposure and with stronger party, ideology and party identity. Participants with lower (like-minded) news exposure and with weaker party and ideological attachments are likely to have lower prior attribution of malevolence, higher support for compromise across party lines, and be less aware of the salient political conflicts (perceived polarization). For those people, therefore, \u201cnews vacation\u201d may have less pronounced effects compared to those who consume a lot of (like-minded) news and to strong partisans/ideologues.\n\n\n\u2022 Attribution of Malevolence\n----------------------------\nThe extent to which people believe that the other party wants to harm the country.\n\nTreatment\n---------\nH4: Respondents who do not follow the news for one week will be less likely to perceive that the other party wants to harm the country, compared to respondents in the control group and to their prior levels of attribution of malevolence.\n\nH4a: The lowering effect will hold when accounting for people\u2019s prior levels of like- minded exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of news consumption\n--------------------------------------------\nH4b: The lowering effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of news exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of like-minded news consumption\n--------------------------------------------------------\nH4c: The lowering effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels like- minded news exposure. \n\nTreatment \u00d7 (Partisan | Ideology | Party Identity) Strength\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nH4d,e,f The lowering effects will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of (party | ideology | party identity) strength.\n\n\n\u2022 Willingness to Compromise \n----------------------------\nThe extent to which people believe that politicians should be open to compromise. \n\nTreatment\n---------\nH5: Respondents who are not exposed to news for one week will be more likely to believe that politicians should be willing to compromise, relative to the control group and to their pre-test levels of support for compromise.\n\nH5a: The positive effect will hold when accounting for people\u2019s prior levels of like- minded exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of news consumption\n--------------------------------------------\nH5b: The positive effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of news exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of like-minded news consumption\n--------------------------------------------------------\nH5c: The positive effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of like- minded news exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 (Partisan | Ideology | Party Identity) Strength\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nH5d,e,f: The positive effect will be stronger among those with higher levels of (party | ideology | party identity) strength.\n\n\n\u2022 Perceived Polarization\n------------------------\nThe extent to which people see polarization as prevalent. \n\nTreatment\n---------\nH6: Respondents who are not exposed to the news for one week will less likely to perceive political polarization as a prevalent phenomenon, compared to those in the control group and their pretest levels of perceived polarization.\n\nH6a: The weakening effect will hold when accounting for people\u2019s prior levels of like-minded exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of news consumption\n--------------------------------------------\nH6b: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of news exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 Prior levels of like-minded news consumption\n--------------------------------------------------------\nH6c: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher prior levels of like-minded news exposure.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 (Partisan | Ideology | Party Identity) Strength\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nH6d,e,f: The weakening effect will be stronger among those with higher levels of (party | ideology | party identity) strength.\n\n[ D ] POLITICAL PARTICIPATION AND KNOWLEDGE\n-------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion 4: Does people\u2019s political engagement (i.e., political participation and political knowledge) decrease after not being exposed to news?\n\nDecades of research clearly show that attending to news enhances political knowledge (because people become aware of the important policies and facts of the day) (Delli Carpini &amp; Keeter, 1996; see also Beam et al, 2017) and that it also motivates people to take part in the political process, partly because they become aware of the important issues and feel more efficacious (Putnam 2000, Norris 2000, Prior 2007). Therefore, those on a \u201cnews vacation\u201d should have lower knowledge of the facts of the day and lower reported participatory intentions.\n\nTreatment\n---------\nH7: Respondents who are not exposed to the news for a week will know less about recent political events than those in a control group.\n\nH8: Respondents who are not exposed to the news for a week will have lower participatory intentions, relative to the respondents in a control group and to their pre-treatment participatory intentions.\n\n\n[ E ] WELL BEING\n----------------\n----------------\n\nQuestion 5: Does people\u2019s well being improve after not being exposed to news?\n\nA recent survey from the American Psychological Association found that\u201cnews consumption\nhas a downside.\u201d More than half of Americans say the news causes them stress, and many re-\nport feeling anxiety, fatigue or sleep loss as a result (Jan 31, 2018, see https://time.com/5125894/is- reading-news-bad-for-you/). Other research similarly suggests that watching daily news cor- relates with negative affect, especially when news is personally relevant (Hoog &amp; Verboon, 2019) and that hard news consumption is associated with decline in mental well-being, likely because the news focus on negative stories, generating a sense of powerlessnes (Boukes &amp; Vliegenthart, 2017). To our knowledge, overtime causal estimates are missing in the liter- ature. We fill this gap and expect that the well-being of respondents will improve after a \u201cnews vacation.\u201d In line with the expectations presented above, we particularly expect this to be the case for those with high levels of prior news consumption.\n\nTreatment\n---------\nH9a: Not being exposed to news for a week will improve respondents\u2019 well being relative to the well being of the respondents in a control group.\n\nTreatment \u00d7 (Partisan | Ideology | Party Identity) Strength\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nH9b,c,d: Not being exposed to news for a week have the strongest effect on improved well being for those respondents with higher (party | ideology | party identity).", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Individual cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) and group cognitive behavior therapy (GCBT) are commonly used in treating anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. However, it remains unclear which one is more effective and acceptable for treating children and adolescents with anxiety disorder.\nMethod: Eight electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest and LILACS) were searched from inception to October 2019. We included randomized controlled trials comparing ICBT with GCBT for anxiety disorder in children and adolescents (aged \u2264 18 years). Primary outcomes were the efficacy (mean change in anxiety symptom scores at post-treatment) and acceptability (all-cause discontinuation). Secondary outcomes were remission and mean change in anxiety symptom scores at follow-up.\nResult: Nine studies with 871 participants were selected in the meta-analysis. The pooled analyses indicated no significant difference between ICBT and GCBT for reducing the symptoms of anxiety at posttreatment (standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.26 to 0.06, p = 0.22), follow-up (SMD, -0.44; 95% CI, -1.08 to 0.19, p = 0.17) and remission (odds ratio [OR], 1.15; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.66, p = 0.47). No statistically significant difference for acceptability was found between the two therapy types (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.61 to 2.77, p = 0.50). ICBT was superior to control group in anxiety symptoms reduction (SMD = -0.30, p = 0.009) and remission (OR = 4.00, p = 0.0002), and GCBT was superior to control group in remission (OR = 7.17, p &lt; 0.0001). Subgroup analysis showed that ICBT was significantly more effective than GCBT in adolescents at post-treatment, but no significant in children.\nConclusion: ICBT and GCBT are effective in treating anxiety disorder in children and adolescents with no differences in efficacy and acceptability. In adolescents, ICBT seems to be more beneficial than GCBT.

The pooled analyses indicated no significant difference between ICBT and GCBT for reducing the symptoms of anxiety at posttreatment (standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.26 to 0.06, p = 0.22), follow-up (SMD, -0.44; 95% CI, -1.08 to 0.19, p = 0.17) and remission (odds ratio [OR], 1.15; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.66, p = 0.47). No statistically significant difference for acceptability was found between the two therapy types (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.61 to 2.77, p = 0.50). ICBT was superior to control group in anxiety symptoms reduction (SMD = -0.30, p = 0.009) and remission (OR = 4.00, p = 0.0002), and GCBT was superior to control group in remission (OR = 7.17, p &lt; 0.0001). Subgroup analysis showed that ICBT was significantly more effective than GCBT in adolescents at post-treatment, but no significant in children.\nConclusion: ICBT and GCBT are effective in treating anxiety disorder in children and adolescents with no differences in efficacy and acceptability. In adolescents, ICBT seems to be more beneficial than GCBT. Further well-designed clinical studies should be performed to confirm these findings.\n\nKey Words: Anxiety disorder, individual cognitive behavior therapy, group cognitive behavior therapy, child,

Research has frequently found that low SES is related to increased levels of stress hormones. For example, lower SES; determined by levels of education and income, was associated with increased levels of adrenaline and cortisol (Cohen et al, 2006).  Another study found that family SES was inversely related to cortisol levels, which lead to the conclusion that SES may have links to cardiovascular disease via cortisol reactivity to stress (Kapuko et al, 2002). There is ample evidence supporting the relationship between SES and stress, however, further investigation is vital to understand the factors which may buffer this relationship.\nThe current investigation will measure perceived socioeconomic status using the The MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status (Adler et al, 2000). \nIndividual differences such as personality can predict a person\u2019s reaction to stress. A relatively understudied personality trait, in relation to stress reactivity, is psychopathic personality. The relatively small number of studies which have investigated this trait, which is characterised by callousness and a lack of remorse in relation to stress have found that it is associated with blunted stress reactivity. Participants classed as high psychopathy among a sample of 48 incarcerated males had the lowest scores on Stanford Acute Stress reactivity questionnaire (Pham 2012). In terms of physiological reactions, urine, adrenaline and noradrenaline were measured in 24 male prisoners 2 weeks, 1 week and directly before their trial (Lidberg et al 1978). High psychopathy was linked to no increase in adrenaline or noradrenaline immediately before the trial, which is seemingly the most stressful timepoint, again supporting the notion of blunted stress reactivity in individuals high on psychopathy. \nHowever, a large majority of research into psychopathy is conducted using the incarcerated population when investigating the effects of psychopathic traits and stress, meaning we have a lack of knowledge about how psychopathic traits, among the non-incarcerated population, may be advantageous or detrimental in everyday life. Therefore, in the current study, we will administer a measure of psychopathic traits to members of the general population and measure their subjective stress response using the Perceived Stress Reactivity Scale (PSRS; Schlotz et al, 2011).\nThere is research suggesting that Socioeconomic Status (SES) may be associated with psychopathic traits. For example, increased callous-unemotional and narcissistic tendencies was found in youths with low SES (Sadeh et al, 2010), as well as risky decision-making being associated with psychopathic tendencies in children raised in benign home environments (Guo et al, 2009).

depends on the shared legitimacy of the process that decides who holds power, including, critically, the consent of the losers. If the public does not believe that elected officials were chosen via a fair process, their trust in the government and confidence in the democratic system could erode dangerously. It is therefore critical to determine the factors that affect the public's perceptions of electoral fairness and legitimacy. Electoral victories by candidates who fail to win a popular vote plurality may present a challenge to perceptions of legitimacy, especially as the popular vote winner's margin increases. These decreases in perceptions of legitimacy for winning candidates who lose the popular vote may be greatest among supporters of the party of the losing candidate.

Participants indicate the extent to which they support 16 items on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly oppose, 7 = strongly favor). SDO7 conceptualizes SDO as comprised of two subdimensions, with half the items on each subscale framed in the positive (pro-traits) and half in the negative (con-traits): the dominance (SDO-D) subdimension and the egalitarianism (SDO-E) subdimension. Con-traits are reversed coded to calculate mean subscale scores for each dimension, with higher scores meaning the participants are more in favor of group dominance. \n\nSocial attitudes consistent with support for and willingness to comply with authority figures will be measured with the Attitudes Toward Authority Scale (ATA) (Varley, Votruba, &amp; Shiota, in progress). The ATA is comprised of 16 items across four subscales measuring attitudes toward supporting and complying with authority figures: submission to formal authority, challenging authority, inherent superiority, and support for traditional norms.

A voice instrumentality score will be calculated based on the proportional match between the voice expressed by the group members (always that they do not think they should lose lottery tickets as a penalty) and what the DRA actually decides their participants should receive. This design is a variation of the design used in the justice literature that asks the audience to respond to (un)fair treatment in the form of compensation (Folger &amp; Konovsky, 1989; Margalit et al., unpublished manuscript) and voice instrumentality in deciding new activities for a university or work place activity (Avery &amp; Quinones, 2002; Cornelis et al., 2013; Folger et al., 1979; de Vries et al., 2012).

The scale consists of 17-items that participants rate on a 6-point agreement scale (1 = strongly disagree; 6 = strongly agree). \n\nParticipants will indicate how they think of themselves in relation to the other members of their group on a series of items using five circles that overlap to varying degrees to measure identity fusion (Swann et al., 2009).

Further, they will be told that within each group of four, the person who scored highest on the critical thinking task will be assigned as the superordinate group member, the Deputy Research Assistant (DRA). The surveys will measure attitudes toward authorities and social dominance orientation. The critical thinking task will be 15 GRE questions, including 10 considered easy and 5 considered difficult. Each participant will serve in the role of DRA and participant once in counterbalanced order. Following the initial surveys, participants will receive instructions about the role they have been assigned for the first task based on their responses to the initial. Each participant will be randomly assigned to receive one of three group identity instructions with their role instructions. The group identity instructions will instruct the participant to think of their group in one of three ways: as separate individuals, as a single unit, and as two groups (a group of participants with a DRA or a DRA with participants depending on their role) working toward a common goal. This manipulation is based on the identity fusion and dual identity literatures (Gaertner et al, 1998; Gaertner et al, 1990).\n\nParticipants will be instructed to complete a version of the winter problem, selecting items for a trip hosted by the university outdoor adventure center, via an online chat with their \u201cgroup\u201d in Slack. After completing the winter problem once, the participants will be assigned to a new group and complete another version of a similar task. Following each task, participants will make evaluations of themselves and their team. Participants will be told that they will receive five lottery tickets for a gift card for each task, however, that they could lose lottery tickets for failing to follow the instructions and rules. The DRA will evaluate each participant in their group and decide whether the participant will lose tickets and if so how many. Each participant will be randomly assigned to the voice or no voice condition for the instructions on compensation. In the voice condition, the DRA will receive input from each participant in their group about whether they should lose tickets and if so how many. The participants will be asked whether they should lose tickets and if so how many it should be. In the no voice condition, DRA will not receive sanction suggestions from participants. The participants will not be asked for a sanction suggestion. Finally, participants in the role of a participant will be randomly assigned to be told they have lost one ticket or four tickets. \n\nParticipants will complete the adapted Family Justice Scale, the group identity measures, and the Allophilia scale about their group members. Participants will be thanked for their time, debriefed on the purpose of the study, and compensated for their participation. \n", "q10.uploader": [], "q14.question": "We manipulated the order of the role participants were instructed to be in with their groups. The two levels for this categorical variable are DRA, Participant and Participant, DRA. \n\nWe manipulated voice when participants were in the participant and the DRA role. Participants were randomly presented with the opportunity to tell their DRA whether and how much they would be sanctioned. The two levels of this categorical variable are voice and no voice. Participants were randomly presented with the sanctioning preferences of each participant or not. The two levels of this categorical variable are voice and no voice. \n\nWe manipulated how participants were instructed to think about their group. The three levels of this categorical variable are individual, group, two groups (role and group). \n\nWe manipulated how many lottery tickets participants were told they lost when in the participant role. The two levels of this categorical variable are one and four.

Participants indicate the extent to which they support 16 items on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly oppose, 7 = strongly favor). SDO7 conceptualizes SDO as comprised of two subdimensions, with half the items on each subscale framed in the positive (pro-traits) and half in the negative (con-traits): the dominance (SDO-D) subdimension and the egalitarianism (SDO-E) subdimension. Con-traits are reversed coded to calculate mean subscale scores for each dimension, with higher scores meaning the participants are more in favor of group dominance. \n\nSocial attitudes consistent with support for and willingness to comply with authority figures will be measured with the Attitudes Toward Authority Scale (ATA) (Varley, Votruba, &amp; Shiota, in progress). The ATA is comprised of 16 items across four subscales measuring attitudes toward supporting and complying with authority figures: submission to formal authority, challenging authority, inherent superiority, and support for traditional norms. Participants will be asked to rate their agreement with each item on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). \n\nParticipants will be instructed that they will receive five lottery tickets as compensation for their time. Participants in the DRA role will be instructed that part of their role is to enforce the rules of the game to ensure the task is completed without problems. Therefore, if someone breaks a rule, they will have the ability to remove lottery tickets as a penalty for the rule breaking. At the end of the study they will be asked to report how many lottery tickets each member of their group is to be penalized. A voice instrumentality score will be calculated based on the proportional match between the voice expressed by the group members (always that they do not think they should lose lottery tickets as a penalty) and what the DRA actually decides their participants should receive. This design is a variation of the design used in the justice literature that asks the audience to respond to (un)fair treatment in the form of compensation (Folger &amp; Konovsky, 1989; Margalit et al., unpublished manuscript) and voice instrumentality in deciding new activities for a university or work place activity (Avery &amp; Quinones, 2002; Cornelis et al., 2013; Folger et al., 1979; de Vries et al., 2012). When participants are in the participant role they will be told they are being penalized and receiving fair (minus 1 lottery ticket) or unfair (minus 4 lottery tickets) treatment. \n\nParticipants will complete an adapted version of the Family Justice Scale (Fondacaro et al., 2002) to evaluate their own and the Deputy Research Assistant's decision-making procedures. Participants will be asked to rate their agreement with 36 items on a 5-point scale, 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The Process Control, Voice, Neutrality, Dignity/Respect, Trust, and Global Fairness subscales will be included. A mean scale score will be calculated for each subscale. \n\nThe Allophilia scale (Alfieri &amp; Marta, 2011; Pittinsky, Rosenthal, &amp; Montoya, 2011) will measure outgroup liking as conceptualized to include having positive feelings toward the group (affection), being comfortable around the outgroup (comfort), a sense of sharing something and belonging with the outgroup (kinship), seeking contact with the outgroup (engagement), and having a favorable impression toward the outgroup (enthusiasm). The scale consists of 17-items that participants rate on a 6-point agreement scale (1 = strongly disagree; 6 = strongly agree). \n\nParticipants will indicate how they think of themselves in relation to the other members of their group on a series of items using five circles that overlap to varying degrees to measure identity fusion (Swann et al., 2009). Additionally, three questions will assess the extent to which participants feel the leader and the team are part of the same group: \u201cDo you think that team leaders and team members are all members of the same group,\u201d \u201cOn this team, there are not team leaders and team members, but only members of the team,\u201d and \u201cIt is possible to say that team members and team leaders of this task are on the same team.\u201d The degree of overlap will be used as a manipulation check on the group identity manipulation and measure of identity overlap.

Preliminary and ANOVA analyses will be conducted in SPSS 26. Mediation and moderated-mediation analyses will be conducted in MPlus 7. Preliminary analyses, including descriptive statistics and correlations, will be used to assess normality and fit for factorial ANOVA and mediation. \n\nThe study is a mixed-factorial design with one within-group factor (role) and two between-group factors (voice and group representation). Mixed-group factorial analysis of variance will be used to test the research hypotheses that participants will evaluate their own decision-making and others\u2019 decision-making processes by examining main effects and interaction effects of the conditions on evaluations of fairness and the Family Justice Scale subscales. Additionally, it will examine the main effects and interaction effects of voice condition and group representation on worker compensation. Finally, the main effects and interaction effects of the conditions on the Allophilia will be examined.   \n\nNext, structural equation modeling will be used to compare evaluations of the decision-making processes of Deputy Research Assistant and participants. The structural model will be used with bootstrapped analysis (Shrout &amp; Bolger, 2002) to test the modeled indirect effects of voice condition on evaluations of fairness through perceptions of voice, neutrality, trust, and respect. The moderating effect of group-representation condition on the indirect effects mediating the effect of voice condition on perceptions of fairness will be examined. Additionally, the moderating effect of group identity on the effect of affect toward the other group members on the evaluations of fairness will also be examined. The bootstrap approach maximizes statistical power through resampling while minimizing the risk of Type 1 errors and creates confidence intervals (CI\u2019s) through empirical approximation of sampling distributions of indirect effects. Nonparametric resampling methods (bias-correct bootstrap) with 5000 samples drawn to derive the 95% CI\u2019s will be used for the modeled indirect effect of the procedural justice and outcome conditions on global fairness. \n\nThe same analyses will then be repeated for participants while in the participant condition as well as in the DRA condition. The specific indirect effects of each condition will be examined and compared in magnitude and direction for the fairness evaluations as well as for compensation decisions. \n", "q17.uploader": []},
