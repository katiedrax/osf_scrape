If an abattoir was reported to have slaughtered &gt; 10,000 pigs/day, the records corresponding to that abattoir for that day were removed from the dataset. 10,000 pigs/abattoir/day was chosen as we are not aware of any UK abattoir able to process that number of pigs in one day, indicating that reports of such numbers are incorrect. Note here, that only total numbers of pigs have been looked at in these data and the variable of interest (respiratory prevalence) had not yet been calculated when these data discrepancies were found.", "q23": "Missing data mainly come from the fact that production data cannot be matched to the years of slaughter data with which we were provided. Some producers gave data from pre-August 2009 (44 farms, 336 batches)  and post-2015 (71 farms, 462 batches)  and the slaughter records we have begin August 2009 and finish December 2015. We treated these data as missing completely at random and data will not be imputed.\n\nSome missing data (173 lorry loads of pigs taken to the abattoir) come from outliers removed in the slaughter data (see 21). It is unknown why these data were anomalous (after speaking to the data provider) and for this reason, we treated the data as missing completely at random and data will not be imputed.\n\nThe last cases of missing data come from unsuccessful matching between production data and slaughter data. This could be for a range of reasons including: \n\u2022\tTypos or errors in input from producers (production data) or processors (slaughter data) meaning unique farm identifiers could not be matched between datasets\n\u2022\tChanges in farm identifier (herdmark / slapmark - a tattoo given to pigs before slaughter to identify their farm of origin)\n\u2022\tIncomplete matches between production data and slaughter data. This occurs where the number of pigs sold in a batch does not match the number slaughtered within a certain timeframe. Mismatches can be either too few pigs matched (more sold than are returned from the slaughter data) or too many matched (fewer sold than are returned from the slaughter data). This may be because of the matching criteria imposed.\n\nOut of the 65 farms which were suitable for matching, three farms did not match any batches. Out of the remaining 62 farms, four farms had no incomplete matching and the remaining 58 farms had at least 1 batch of incomplete matching.
