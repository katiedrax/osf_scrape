We opted for an online experiment to ensure that our sample is as representative as possible of the general population (see Sampling Plan). Moreover, studies demonstrate that the findings of online experiments correlate well with those of traditional lab experiments (Dandurand, F., Shultz, T.R. &amp; Onishi, K.H.,2008).\n\nIn our study, our participants are asked to perform a task and answer a questionnaire. The task consists in a succession of signal detection trials during which they must accurately identify the stimulus. We plan to display 300 trials divided in 3 blocks of 100. Blocks are separated by a message indicating progress to the participant.\n\nWe use the same stimuli as in Chevallier et al., 2016. They both represent a line within a circle. They only differ in the length of the line: it is either 11.5mm or 13mm long. As in any non-trivial signal detection task, the two stimuli are visually similar and difficult to distinguish, thus creating noise in the detection.\n   \nIn each trial, participants are presented with one of the two stimuli (short or long line) for 700ms and must decide which one they see. Answers are given on the participants\u2019 keyboard. Keyboard attribution has been randomized: in one condition, e is short and p is long, in another condition, the opposite is true. If the participant gives the right answer, they move to the next trial. If not, they risk facing a negative feedback (or punishments).\nIn this experiment, punishment is the text \u201c-5 pennies\u201d displayed in red and size 48. The punishment is displayed during 1 second before disappearing. The next trial can start after the feedback disappears. Participants can only make two types of error: they can either mistakenly identify a long line or a short line. As in Pizzagalli, 2004 and Chevallier, 2016, punishment on these two mistakes is asymmetrical. The asymmetry has been randomized:\n-          In one condition, answering \u201cshort\u201d when a \u201clong\u201d line was displayed is punished 75% of the time, whereas the other error was punished 25% of the time.\n-          In a second condition, answering \u201clong\u201d when a \u201cshort\u201d line was displayed is punished 75% of the time, while the other error was punished 25% of the time.\n\nIn both conditions, one type of error is substantially more punished than the other one. We categorize the most punished line as the \u201charsh\u201d line and the least punished line as the \u201clenient\u201d line. This asymmetry is assumed to bias the participants\u2019 decision in favor of the lenient line. The amplitude of the response bias serves as a proxy for negativity bias. \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "short_stim.bmp"}, "nodeId": "tyb84", "sha256": "298630851b47c67d36706bbe3b5721845364f0ff7f497111412c853d6a109f28", "viewUrl": "/project/g9chs/files/osfstorage/5e1c8e1e855d4c00e8b6e6fe/", "selectedFileName": "short_stim.bmp"}, {"data": {"name": "long_stim.bmp"}, "nodeId": "tyb84", "sha256": "456bf7fe7b9576fa6fa3cebc20491089a79476fe9b8d52dd221aa687c9962588", "viewUrl": "/project/g9chs/files/osfstorage/5e1c8e1e855d4c00e8b6e6fc/", "selectedFileName": "long_stim.bmp"}], "value": ""}}}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q10": {"extra": [], "value": "Registration prior to creation of data"}, "q11": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q12": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "1)      Sample selection\nParticipants will be recruited using the Prolific platform.

We will classify our data into a standard signal detection theory typology:\n\n-          If the lenient stimulus is displayed and the answer was the lenient stimulus, the observation is classified as a \u201chit\u201d\n-          If the lenient stimulus is displayed and the answer was the harsh stimulus, the observation is classified as a \u201cmiss\u201d\n-          If the harsh stimulus is displayed and the answer was the lenient stimulus, the observation is classified as a \u201cfalse alarm\u201d\n-          If the harsh stimulus is displayed and the answer was the harsh stimulus, the observation is classified as a \u201ccorrect rejection\u201d\n\n\nOnce we have identified the 4 types of answers for each participant, we can compute accuracy and bias for each participant using SDT methods of calculation:\n\n-          d\u2019 = (1/2)* log((hits * correct rejections) / (misses * false alarms))\n-          b = (1/2) * log((hits * false alarms) / (misses * correct rejections))\n \n\nImportantly, we intend to correct our data in cases where participants are 100% accurate for either stimulus. In these cases, we will modify accuracy rate to 98%. This minor change is unlikely to have a significant effect on our results and is yet necessary to compute d\u2019 or b (otherwise we may be dividing by zero). This procedure is the exact same as the one used in Chevallier et al 2016 and is adapted from Hautus MJ., 1995.  (Hautus MJ., 1995 Corrections for extreme proportions and their biasing effects on estimated values ofd\u2032. Behav Res Methods Instrum Comput. 1995;27: 46\u201351.)\n\n\nAfter we have computed d\u2019 and b by participant, we perform the same analysis by block. We then  compute our main variable of interest, which is the overall change of response bias throughout blocks (\u0394b). \u0394b is defined as the difference between the response bias for the last block and the first block. Our interpretation is that the higher \u0394b, the more participants\u2019 behavior has been influenced by negative feedback cues. \n\n \n4)  \tResponse bias and SES\n\nThe last step of our analysis is to test the correlation between SES and \u0394b. As in Chevallier et al., 2016 we first run a repeated-measures ANOVA with block as a within-subject factor to test whether response bias changed over time. \nWe then examine the relationship between our SES variables and \u0394b using correlations, a median-split based on participants\u2019 response to the questionnaire. More precisely, we will compute correlations between: \n\n\u2022\t\u0394b and the objective SES indice\n\u2022\t\u0394b and the subjective SES indice\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q21": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Our analysis plan, including exclusion criteria and variable manipulation, is mostly adapted from Chevallier et al. 2016. \n\n1.\tExclusion criteria\nWe will exclude from analysis participants with the following characteristics: \n\u2022\tTask accuracy is 2 SD below average\n\u2022\tReported total monthly income is 0 or above \u00a312,500\n\u2022\tStudents\n\u2022\tMore than 40% of observations has been removed due to unusual response time (see below)\n\n2.\t  Handling outlier observations:\nBefore engaging in further analysis, we will scrutinize reaction times to identify outliers.

In Chevallier et al, 2016, 3.6% of trials were removed from analysis. \n", "q23": "", "q24": "", "q25": "", "q8.question": "1)  \tOverview:\nOur research is an observational study that aims to establish a correlation between socioeconomic status and negativity bias.\nTo do so, we use a standard signal detection task adapted from Pizzagalli, 2004 and Chevallier et al., 2016. \n2)  \tMethod\nThe experiment was designed using the survey platform Qualtrics and will be distributed online using the Prolific distribution platform. We opted for an online experiment to ensure that our sample is as representative as possible of the general population (see Sampling Plan). Moreover, studies demonstrate that the findings of online experiments correlate well with those of traditional lab experiments (Dandurand, F., Shultz, T.R. &amp; Onishi, K.H.,2008).\n\nIn our study, our participants are asked to perform a task and answer a questionnaire. The task consists in a succession of signal detection trials during which they must accurately identify the stimulus. We plan to display 300 trials divided in 3 blocks of 100. Blocks are separated by a message indicating progress to the participant.\n\nWe use the same stimuli as in Chevallier et al., 2016. They both represent a line within a circle. They only differ in the length of the line: it is either 11.5mm or 13mm long. As in any non-trivial signal detection task, the two stimuli are visually similar and difficult to distinguish, thus creating noise in the detection.\n   \nIn each trial, participants are presented with one of the two stimuli (short or long line) for 700ms and must decide which one they see. Answers are given on the participants\u2019 keyboard. Keyboard attribution has been randomized: in one condition, e is short and p is long, in another condition, the opposite is true. If the participant gives the right answer, they move to the next trial. If not, they risk facing a negative feedback (or punishments).\nIn this experiment, punishment is the text \u201c-5 pennies\u201d displayed in red and size 48. The punishment is displayed during 1 second before disappearing. The next trial can start after the feedback disappears. Participants can only make two types of error: they can either mistakenly identify a long line or a short line. As in Pizzagalli, 2004 and Chevallier, 2016, punishment on these two mistakes is asymmetrical. The asymmetry has been randomized:\n-          In one condition, answering \u201cshort\u201d when a \u201clong\u201d line was displayed is punished 75% of the time, whereas the other error was punished 25% of the time.\n-          In a second condition, answering \u201clong\u201d when a \u201cshort\u201d line was displayed is punished 75% of the time, while the other error was punished 25% of the time.\n\nIn both conditions, one type of error is substantially more punished than the other one. We categorize the most punished line as the \u201charsh\u201d line and the least punished line as the \u201clenient\u201d line. This asymmetry is assumed to bias the participants\u2019 decision in favor of the lenient line. The amplitude of the response bias serves as a proxy for negativity bias. \n", "q8.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e1c8e1e855d4c00e8b6e6fe", "file_name": "short_stim.bmp", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/g9chs/files/osfstorage/5e1c8e1e855d4c00e8b6e6fe", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e1c8e1e855d4c00e8b6e6fe"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "298630851b47c67d36706bbe3b5721845364f0ff7f497111412c853d6a109f28"}}, {"file_id": "5e1c8e1e855d4c00e8b6e6fc", "file_name": "long_stim.bmp", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/g9chs/files/osfstorage/5e1c8e1e855d4c00e8b6e6fc", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e1c8e1e855d4c00e8b6e6fc"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "456bf7fe7b9576fa6fa3cebc20491089a79476fe9b8d52dd221aa687c9962588"}}], "q12.question": "1)      Sample selection\nParticipants will be recruited using the Prolific platform.

All scripts will be made available on the OSF portal.\n\n1)  \tData summary:\nThe second step of our analysis is to summarize our data. Namely, we are interested in knowing the following basing facts about our data:\n-          The average number of displayed negative feedback for each participant\n-          The average number of correct answers for each participant\n-          The average number of displayed negative feedback and correct answers by block and by stimulus type (short or long line)\nThis basic overview of our data allows us to ensure that nothing went wrong with data collection.\n\n\n \n2)  \tCompute a measure of negativity bias using signal detection theory:\n\nTo use signal detection theory, we will mainly be interested in the proportion of correct answers by stimulus type. We will classify our data into a standard signal detection theory typology:\n\n-          If the lenient stimulus is displayed and the answer was the lenient stimulus, the observation is classified as a \u201chit\u201d\n-          If the lenient stimulus is displayed and the answer was the harsh stimulus, the observation is classified as a \u201cmiss\u201d\n-          If the harsh stimulus is displayed and the answer was the lenient stimulus, the observation is classified as a \u201cfalse alarm\u201d\n-          If the harsh stimulus is displayed and the answer was the harsh stimulus, the observation is classified as a \u201ccorrect rejection\u201d\n\n\nOnce we have identified the 4 types of answers for each participant, we can compute accuracy and bias for each participant using SDT methods of calculation:\n\n-          d\u2019 = (1/2)* log((hits * correct rejections) / (misses * false alarms))\n-          b = (1/2) * log((hits * false alarms) / (misses * correct rejections))\n \n\nImportantly, we intend to correct our data in cases where participants are 100% accurate for either stimulus. In these cases, we will modify accuracy rate to 98%. This minor change is unlikely to have a significant effect on our results and is yet necessary to compute d\u2019 or b (otherwise we may be dividing by zero). This procedure is the exact same as the one used in Chevallier et al 2016 and is adapted from Hautus MJ., 1995.  (Hautus MJ., 1995 Corrections for extreme proportions and their biasing effects on estimated values ofd\u2032. Behav Res Methods Instrum Comput. 1995;27: 46\u201351.)\n\n\nAfter we have computed d\u2019 and b by participant, we perform the same analysis by block. We then  compute our main variable of interest, which is the overall change of response bias throughout blocks (\u0394b). \u0394b is defined as the difference between the response bias for the last block and the first block. Our interpretation is that the higher \u0394b, the more participants\u2019 behavior has been influenced by negative feedback cues. \n\n \n4)  \tResponse bias and SES\n\nThe last step of our analysis is to test the correlation between SES and \u0394b. As in Chevallier et al., 2016 we first run a repeated-measures ANOVA with block as a within-subject factor to test whether response bias changed over time. \nWe then examine the relationship between our SES variables and \u0394b using correlations, a median-split based on participants\u2019 response to the questionnaire. More precisely, we will compute correlations between: \n\n\u2022\t\u0394b and the objective SES indice\n\u2022\t\u0394b and the subjective SES indice\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []},

To keep our vignettes as realistic as possible, it is necessary to take a certain work context into account. In order to make sure all participants can relate to these vignettes equally, only teachers in primary, secondary or higher educations are included in our sample. By making sure our vignettes match the work context of our participants, we increase ecological validity of our experiment (Morton and Williams 2010).", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "The manipulation of variables is described in the documents 'Survey_study1.docx' and 'Survey_study2.docx'.

Research has shown that the transition to parenthood is associated with changes in new parents\u2019 self-esteem (Bleidorn et al., 2016). Most people, and especially women, experience small to moderate decreases in self-esteem when they become parents. However, longitudinal research has also highlighted reliable individual differences in new parents\u2019 self-esteem change before and after the transition to parenthood. What leads to these individual differences in self-esteem during the transition to parenthood?\nOne possible explanation for individual differences in self-esteem during the transition to the parenthood role is that some parents may feel better suited to the demands and struggles of parenthood than others (Hutteman et al., 2014; Hutteman, Bleidorn, Penke, &amp; Denissen, 2013). Most people, especially those who are transitioning into parenthood, may have expectations about what a prototypical parent is like. Such expectations can be described in terms of the Big Five traits emotional stability, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness (John, Naumann, &amp; Soto, 2008).The degree to which parents\u2019 own personality matches these expectations may have important implications for their self-esteem. \nThese expectations are likely somewhat similar across people given the similar responsibilities associated with the parent role from person to person. For example, people may tend to believe that parents are typically high in conscientiousness, because this helps them meet the challenges and demands associated with the parent role. However, beliefs about the prototypical parent personality may also differ across people: rather than high conscientiousness, some people may view high agreeableness or high emotional stability as the most prototypical parent traits. Whether or not these beliefs are actually valid, they may be critically linked to new parents\u2019 self-esteem as they transition to parenthood. A detail-oriented, well-organized, and responsible new parent who believes conscientiousness is important for parenthood may feel confident and experience increases in self-esteem during the transition to the parenthood role. In contrast, expecting parents who are low in this trait but believe that parents are typically high in conscientiousness may feel less confident and report diminished self-esteem because they feel their personality is not well-suited to master the demands associated with the parent role (Erol &amp; Orth, 2011).\nTo date, no research has examined the prototypical personality profile associated with the parent role nor the degree to which beliefs about the match between prototypical and personal (i.e., actual, self-reported) parent personality shape new parents\u2019 self-esteem. In this study, we plan to examine three questions related to this issue. \nFirst, we will identify the average Big Five profile of a prototypical parent personality and examine agreement about this profile among expecting parents. Since parenthood can be viewed as an indicator of maturity (Hutteman et al., 2014), and maturity is typically associated with increases in certain traits (Roberts &amp; Wood, 2006), we expect the prototypical parent to be rated as having high levels of emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. However, people likely have different ideas of what the prototypical parent represents, thus we also expect differences in prototypical parent trait ratings across participants. We expect this to be the case for all traits, with the least amount of consensus for extraversion and openness, as these traits are not often referenced when discussing maturation or parenthood.\nSecond, we will use polynomial regression and response surface analyses (RSA; Edwards, 2002) to assess whether the correspondence between parents\u2019 own personality and their beliefs about the prototypical parent\u2019s personality is associated with their levels of self-esteem. We will estimate separate models for each of the Big Five traits and each model will include three variables: a parent\u2019s rating of their own personal trait level, a parent\u2019s rating of a prototypical parent\u2019s personality trait level, and a parent\u2019s rating of their own level of self-esteem. We expect to find that all Big Five personal trait ratings are positively related to self-esteem (Robins, Tracy, Trzesniewski, Potter, &amp; Gosling, 2001), with the largest main effects for emotional stability and extraversion (Bleidorn et al., 2016). Moreover, we expect to find interaction effects between personal and prototypical parent trait ratings for all traits, indicating that people whose traits are more closely matched to their perceptions of the prototypical parent will have higher self-esteem (see below, for more details about RSA). We expect interaction effects to be relatively larger for openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness compared to those observed for emotional stability and extraversion. The reason for this is that personal ratings of openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness alone are weakly associated with self-esteem. In other words, the match between parent trait expectations and personal ratings of openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness may be more associated with self-esteem than for emotional stability and extraversion. \nThird, using follow-up assessments of parents\u2019 Big Five personality traits and self-esteem after the transition to parenthood, we will examine whether parents\u2019 personality traits change in the direction of their ratings of a prototypical parent\u2019s personality, and if interactions between personal trait ratings, prototypical parent trait ratings, and self-esteem replicate after the transition to parenthood. The demands associated with the parent role may evoke trait changes in the direction of that role (Hutteman et al., 2014; Roberts &amp; Wood, 2006). Although research has not found mean-level tends in personality change after parenthood (van Scheppingen et al., 2016), there may be individual differences in trait change during this life transition. Such differences may reflect individual differences in new parents\u2019 beliefs about a prototypical parent\u2019s personality. To address this hypothesis, we will test whether the squared difference between personal traits and prototypical parent traits is smaller at the second compared to the first assessment.\nNext, we will run the RSA models again with follow-up personality trait and self-esteem assessments. Given the nature of our design and sample, we will explore whether effects identified at the first assessment replicate. Although parents\u2019 traits may change in certain trait domains after the transition to parenthood, meeting their individual role expectations may no longer be associated with their self-esteem. New parents may gain more insights into the parent role, realize that there are various ways to master the challenges associated with this role, or potentially adjust or relax their beliefs of a typical parent\u2019s personality during the transition to parenthood. Each of these changes could be associated with diminished or less rigid expectations about the parent role than was the case prior to parenthood. Thus, there may no longer be an association between personality trait ratings and self-esteem after the transition to parenthood compared to before the transition. \n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "We have 6 directional hypotheses and 1 exploratory hypothesis.\n1.\tThere will be relative agreement about the personality trait levels of a prototypical parent for all traits.\n2.\tThere will be stronger agreement in prototypical parent ratings of traits associated with maturation than traits that are not associated with maturation.\n3.\tThe prototypical parent will have high levels of emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.\n4.\tHigher levels of all personal Big Five traits will be associated with higher levels of self-esteem.

For H1-H3, we will test relative and differential consensus in prototypical parent trait ratings using packages car version 3.0-5 (Fox &amp; Weisberg, 2019) and multilevel version 2.6 (Bliese, 2016). For H4-H7, we will create response surface analysis (RSA) plots using the RSA package version 0.9.13 (Sch\u00f6nbrodt &amp; Humberg, 2018) estimated though polynomial regression. We will handle missing data using full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation. Given the number of statistical tests we will perform, we will interpret p-values equal to or lower than .01 as significant. We will report exact p-values as well as 95% confidence intervals for all tests.\nWe have used this dataset in past research to examine self-other personality agreement in the BFI self-report data with respect to the developmental trajectory of traits in the total sample (parents and nonparents; Lenhausen, van Scheppingen, &amp; Bleidorn, under review). However, we have not examined interactions between the BFI and TIPI-based prototypical parent ratings, and therefore have no direct knowledge pertinent to the hypotheses of this study.\nPrototypical parent\nFirst, we will use the TIPI ratings to identify the degree of consensus for each Big Five trait and the agreed upon profile of a prototypical parent. We will calculate the rwg coefficient for each trait to assess relative agreement about the personality trait levels of a prototypical parent for all traits. This coefficient calculates the proportion of observed variance over the variance in random ratings, subtracted from 1 (James, Demaree, &amp; Wolf, 1984). We will interpret rwg &lt; .30 as poor agreement whereas rwg &gt; .50 will indicate moderate to strong agreement (LeBreton &amp; Senter, 2008). We expect all five coefficients to be &gt; .30 (H1).\nWe expect to find greater consensus for emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness (H2). We will test whether the rwg  values for emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness are significantly higher than the rwg  values for extraversion and openness by comparing confidence intervals of the rwg  value for each trait (Cohen, Doveh, &amp; Eick, 2001; Cohen, Doveh, &amp; Nahum-Shani, 2009). Specifically, a distribution of rwg  is created by repeatedly drawing random samples. This distribution will be used to calculate confidence intervals for each trait. Moreover, we expect this consensus will reflect the prototypical parent having high levels of emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness (H3). Thus, we will test whether trait ratings for emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness are significantly higher than openness and extraversion.\nResponse Surface Analysis\nSecond, we will construct RSA plots estimated from polynomial regression models to assess whether the correspondence between parents\u2019 own personality and their beliefs about the prototypical parent\u2019s personality is associated with their levels of self-esteem at wave 1. In this equation, self-esteem is the dependent variable and personal and prototypical parent trait ratings are the independent variables (Figure 1). The regression equation for these models includes linear terms for personal (b1) and prototypical trait ratings (b2), quadratic terms for both personal (b3) and prototypical (b5) trait ratings, and the linear interaction between variables (b4). We will run model comparison tests using Akaike information criteria (AIC) to compare fits of nested models. First, we will run the full model including linear and quadratic terms for each level and the interaction term between personal and prototypical parent ratings. Then, we will subsequently subtract terms and calculate the AIC of each nested model containing one fewer term. A higher AIC value will indicate more misfit in the model. These comparison tests will allow us to ascertain the terms that best explain the data. \nRSA plots visualize the results of these models as a surface in a three-dimensional coordinate system. The three-dimensional surface in RSA can be described by 5 coefficients that are calculated using the terms obtained from the polynomial regression equation: a1 = b1 + b2; a2 = b3 + b4 + b5; a3 = b1 \u2013 b2;  a4 = b3 \u2013 b4 + b5; a5 = b3 \u2013 b5. These 5 coefficients determine the line of congruence (LOC), the line of incongruence (LOIC), and the ridge line of the plotted surface. \nThe LOC reflects instances where the predictor values perfectly match (e.g., a person high in conscientiousness rates high levels of conscientiousness as being prototypical of a parent\u2019s personality); the LOIC reflects instances where the predictor variables are the exact opposite of one another (e.g., a person low in conscientiousness rates high levels of conscientiousness as being prototypical of a parent\u2019s personality; Barranti, Carlson, &amp; C\u00f4t\u00e9, 2017). The coefficients a1 and a2 form the LOC, such that a1 represents the linear slope of the line and a2 indicates the curvilinear effect. The coefficients a3 and a4 form the LOIC, such that a3 represents the linear slope of the line and a4 indicates the curvilinear effect. The coefficient a5 represents the ridge line of the response surface (Sch\u00f6nbrodt, Humberg, &amp; Nestler, 2018), indicating the optimum outcome value. In other words, this is the line on the plot where the predictor variables are associated with the highest levels of the outcome variable. \nA hypothetical RSA plot exemplifying the former terms and supporting the strict congruence hypothesis is depicted in the hypothetical response surface in Figure 2a. Strict congruence occurs when the outcome variable is consistently highest along the LOC. This surface shows people with high personal levels of a certain trait who rated that trait as being highly prototypical for a parent had the highest levels of self-esteem. Likewise, people with low personal levels of a certain trait who rated that trait as being prototypically low for a parent also had the highest levels of self-esteem In this plot, a significant negative a4 value along with nonsignificant a1 \u2013 a3 values would result in an inverted U-shaped parabola, supporting the congruence hypothesis (Humberg, Nestler, &amp; Back, 2019). Moreover, an a5  value of 0 supports strict congruence, indicating the ridge line of the surface is located strictly on the LOC, i.e., the highest levels of self-esteem do not significantly differ from the LOC (Sch\u00f6nbrodt et al., 2018). Together, these values depict the optimal level of self-esteem as occurring along the LOC\u2014the line in the plot on which personal and prototypical trait ratings perfectly match one another. Along the LOIC, people for whom personal ratings and ratings of the prototype differ (in either direction) would have lower levels of self-esteem. A looser interpretation of the congruence hypothesis also includes linear or curvilinear main effects of independent variables. In the present study, we do not expect to find strict congruence in our RSA plots as reflected in Figure 2a. Rather, we expect an amalgam of main and interaction effects for all five trait domains.\nIn our RSA plots, we expect to find positive main effects for all personal trait ratings on self-esteem. However, we expect personal trait ratings of emotional stability and extraversion to be stronger indicators of levels of self-esteem than personal trait ratings of openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Specifically, we expect linear and possibly also quadratic effect sizes to be higher for personal ratings of emotional stability and extraversion than openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.\nThe resulting plot we expect for mostly positive main effects is depicted in the hypothetical response surface in Figure 2b, in which higher levels of personal trait ratings predict higher self-esteem, regardless of levels of prototypical parent trait ratings. Statistically, a positive main effects model produces a significant positive a1 value and a nonsignificant a2 value, illustrating that higher levels of trait ratings are associated with higher levels of self-esteem, as opposed to equally high levels of self-esteem along the LOC. A significant positive a3 value and a significant negative a4 value would indicate that higher levels of personal trait ratings are associated with higher levels of self-esteem along the LOIC, regardless of prototypical parent trait ratings. A significant negative a5 value would indicate that the optimal level of self-esteem is significantly different than the LOC, i.e., a perfect match between both trait ratings is not associated with the highest levels of self-esteem. We will run model comparison tests to determine the terms that best explain the variance in the data (i.e., linear, quadratic, and interaction). We will then compare linear and quadratic effect sizes across traits to determine if personal trait ratings of emotional stability and extraversion are stronger predictors of self-esteem than personal trait ratings of openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. These analyses will allow us to address H4.\nWe expect to find interaction effects for all five trait domains on self-esteem. We expect the interaction effects for openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness to support the congruence hypothesis depicted in Figure 2c. Specifically, we expect that the LOC will be associated with the highest levels of self-esteem. In this hypothetical RSA plot, people with lower personal ratings of a trait who rate that trait as being equally low for a prototypical parent still have higher levels of self-esteem than people with low personal ratings of this trait who rate a prototypical parent to be higher in this trait. We will run model comparison tests to determine if the interaction between trait ratings is significant. First, we will run the full model including linear and quadratic terms for each level and the interaction term between personal and prototypical parent ratings. Then, we will test whether deleting the interaction term would lead to a significant decrease in model fit. We expect this interaction effect to be stronger for openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness than emotional stability and extraversion. We will compare interaction effect sizes across traits to determine if the interaction between trait ratings for openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness is a higher predictor of self-esteem than the interaction between trait ratings for emotional stability and extraversion. These analyses will allow us to address H5.\nPost-transition analyses\nThird, we will use wave 1 (pre-transition) and wave 2 (post-transition) personal trait ratings with wave 1 prototypical parent ratings to assess if match between reports increases after the transition to parenthood. Specifically, we will compare the squared differences between personal trait ratings at wave 1/ wave 2 and prototypical parent trait ratings at wave 1 for each of the five trait domains using dependent t-tests. A significant decrease in the squared differences between wave 1 and wave 2 would suggest a significant increase in congruence after the transition to parenthood. This analysis will allow us to address H6.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "RSA figures.pdf"}, "nodeId": "nh5s8", "sha256": "1b2ed3ae4e6969e1cd411c610c9f6b36401b6dfc2a488917944a1bffef2e3ee4", "viewUrl": "/project/wfj9m/files/osfstorage/5e191908855d4c0034b7059f/", "selectedFileName": "RSA figures.pdf"}], "value": ""}}}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q21": {"extra": [], "value": "Given the number of statistical tests we will perform, we will interpret p-values equal to or lower than .01 as significant.

Research has shown that the transition to parenthood is associated with changes in new parents\u2019 self-esteem (Bleidorn et al., 2016). Most people, and especially women, experience small to moderate decreases in self-esteem when they become parents. However, longitudinal research has also highlighted reliable individual differences in new parents\u2019 self-esteem change before and after the transition to parenthood. What leads to these individual differences in self-esteem during the transition to parenthood?\nOne possible explanation for individual differences in self-esteem during the transition to the parenthood role is that some parents may feel better suited to the demands and struggles of parenthood than others (Hutteman et al., 2014; Hutteman, Bleidorn, Penke, &amp; Denissen, 2013). Most people, especially those who are transitioning into parenthood, may have expectations about what a prototypical parent is like. Such expectations can be described in terms of the Big Five traits emotional stability, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness (John, Naumann, &amp; Soto, 2008).The degree to which parents\u2019 own personality matches these expectations may have important implications for their self-esteem. \nThese expectations are likely somewhat similar across people given the similar responsibilities associated with the parent role from person to person. For example, people may tend to believe that parents are typically high in conscientiousness, because this helps them meet the challenges and demands associated with the parent role. However, beliefs about the prototypical parent personality may also differ across people: rather than high conscientiousness, some people may view high agreeableness or high emotional stability as the most prototypical parent traits. Whether or not these beliefs are actually valid, they may be critically linked to new parents\u2019 self-esteem as they transition to parenthood. A detail-oriented, well-organized, and responsible new parent who believes conscientiousness is important for parenthood may feel confident and experience increases in self-esteem during the transition to the parenthood role. In contrast, expecting parents who are low in this trait but believe that parents are typically high in conscientiousness may feel less confident and report diminished self-esteem because they feel their personality is not well-suited to master the demands associated with the parent role (Erol &amp; Orth, 2011).\nTo date, no research has examined the prototypical personality profile associated with the parent role nor the degree to which beliefs about the match between prototypical and personal (i.e., actual, self-reported) parent personality shape new parents\u2019 self-esteem. In this study, we plan to examine three questions related to this issue. \nFirst, we will identify the average Big Five profile of a prototypical parent personality and examine agreement about this profile among expecting parents. Since parenthood can be viewed as an indicator of maturity (Hutteman et al., 2014), and maturity is typically associated with increases in certain traits (Roberts &amp; Wood, 2006), we expect the prototypical parent to be rated as having high levels of emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. However, people likely have different ideas of what the prototypical parent represents, thus we also expect differences in prototypical parent trait ratings across participants. We expect this to be the case for all traits, with the least amount of consensus for extraversion and openness, as these traits are not often referenced when discussing maturation or parenthood.\nSecond, we will use polynomial regression and response surface analyses (RSA; Edwards, 2002) to assess whether the correspondence between parents\u2019 own personality and their beliefs about the prototypical parent\u2019s personality is associated with their levels of self-esteem. We will estimate separate models for each of the Big Five traits and each model will include three variables: a parent\u2019s rating of their own personal trait level, a parent\u2019s rating of a prototypical parent\u2019s personality trait level, and a parent\u2019s rating of their own level of self-esteem. We expect to find that all Big Five personal trait ratings are positively related to self-esteem (Robins, Tracy, Trzesniewski, Potter, &amp; Gosling, 2001), with the largest main effects for emotional stability and extraversion (Bleidorn et al., 2016). Moreover, we expect to find interaction effects between personal and prototypical parent trait ratings for all traits, indicating that people whose traits are more closely matched to their perceptions of the prototypical parent will have higher self-esteem (see below, for more details about RSA). We expect interaction effects to be relatively larger for openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness compared to those observed for emotional stability and extraversion. The reason for this is that personal ratings of openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness alone are weakly associated with self-esteem. In other words, the match between parent trait expectations and personal ratings of openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness may be more associated with self-esteem than for emotional stability and extraversion. \nThird, using follow-up assessments of parents\u2019 Big Five personality traits and self-esteem after the transition to parenthood, we will examine whether parents\u2019 personality traits change in the direction of their ratings of a prototypical parent\u2019s personality, and if interactions between personal trait ratings, prototypical parent trait ratings, and self-esteem replicate after the transition to parenthood. The demands associated with the parent role may evoke trait changes in the direction of that role (Hutteman et al., 2014; Roberts &amp; Wood, 2006). Although research has not found mean-level tends in personality change after parenthood (van Scheppingen et al., 2016), there may be individual differences in trait change during this life transition. Such differences may reflect individual differences in new parents\u2019 beliefs about a prototypical parent\u2019s personality. To address this hypothesis, we will test whether the squared difference between personal traits and prototypical parent traits is smaller at the second compared to the first assessment.\nNext, we will run the RSA models again with follow-up personality trait and self-esteem assessments. Given the nature of our design and sample, we will explore whether effects identified at the first assessment replicate. Although parents\u2019 traits may change in certain trait domains after the transition to parenthood, meeting their individual role expectations may no longer be associated with their self-esteem. New parents may gain more insights into the parent role, realize that there are various ways to master the challenges associated with this role, or potentially adjust or relax their beliefs of a typical parent\u2019s personality during the transition to parenthood. Each of these changes could be associated with diminished or less rigid expectations about the parent role than was the case prior to parenthood. Thus, there may no longer be an association between personality trait ratings and self-esteem after the transition to parenthood compared to before the transition. \n", "q4": "We have 6 directional hypotheses and 1 exploratory hypothesis.\n1.\tThere will be relative agreement about the personality trait levels of a prototypical parent for all traits.\n2.\tThere will be stronger agreement in prototypical parent ratings of traits associated with maturation than traits that are not associated with maturation.\n3.\tThe prototypical parent will have high levels of emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.\n4.\tHigher levels of all personal Big Five traits will be associated with higher levels of self-esteem.

This effect will be strongest for openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. \n6.\tParents will become more similar to their perceptions of a prototypical parent after the transition to parenthood. \n7.\tWe will explore whether alignment between personal trait ratings and parent trait expectations is still associated with self-esteem after the transition to parenthood for each of the five trait domains. \n", "q5": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

People were asked to participate together with their romantic partner but were also allowed to participate without their partner. Parents-to-be were recruited through midwife practices, hospitals, and small businesses in the Tilburg area of the Netherlands that offered pregnancy or baby-related products and services (e.g., baby stores, yoga studios).

For H1-H3, we will test relative and differential consensus in prototypical parent trait ratings using packages car version 3.0-5 (Fox &amp; Weisberg, 2019) and multilevel version 2.6 (Bliese, 2016). For H4-H7, we will create response surface analysis (RSA) plots using the RSA package version 0.9.13 (Sch\u00f6nbrodt &amp; Humberg, 2018) estimated though polynomial regression. We will handle missing data using full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation. Given the number of statistical tests we will perform, we will interpret p-values equal to or lower than .01 as significant. We will report exact p-values as well as 95% confidence intervals for all tests.\nWe have used this dataset in past research to examine self-other personality agreement in the BFI self-report data with respect to the developmental trajectory of traits in the total sample (parents and nonparents; Lenhausen, van Scheppingen, &amp; Bleidorn, under review). However, we have not examined interactions between the BFI and TIPI-based prototypical parent ratings, and therefore have no direct knowledge pertinent to the hypotheses of this study.\nPrototypical parent\nFirst, we will use the TIPI ratings to identify the degree of consensus for each Big Five trait and the agreed upon profile of a prototypical parent. We will calculate the rwg coefficient for each trait to assess relative agreement about the personality trait levels of a prototypical parent for all traits. This coefficient calculates the proportion of observed variance over the variance in random ratings, subtracted from 1 (James, Demaree, &amp; Wolf, 1984). We will interpret rwg &lt; .30 as poor agreement whereas rwg &gt; .50 will indicate moderate to strong agreement (LeBreton &amp; Senter, 2008). We expect all five coefficients to be &gt; .30 (H1).\nWe expect to find greater consensus for emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness (H2). We will test whether the rwg  values for emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness are significantly higher than the rwg  values for extraversion and openness by comparing confidence intervals of the rwg  value for each trait (Cohen, Doveh, &amp; Eick, 2001; Cohen, Doveh, &amp; Nahum-Shani, 2009). Specifically, a distribution of rwg  is created by repeatedly drawing random samples. This distribution will be used to calculate confidence intervals for each trait. Moreover, we expect this consensus will reflect the prototypical parent having high levels of emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness (H3). Thus, we will test whether trait ratings for emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness are significantly higher than openness and extraversion.\nResponse Surface Analysis\nSecond, we will construct RSA plots estimated from polynomial regression models to assess whether the correspondence between parents\u2019 own personality and their beliefs about the prototypical parent\u2019s personality is associated with their levels of self-esteem at wave 1. In this equation, self-esteem is the dependent variable and personal and prototypical parent trait ratings are the independent variables (Figure 1). The regression equation for these models includes linear terms for personal (b1) and prototypical trait ratings (b2), quadratic terms for both personal (b3) and prototypical (b5) trait ratings, and the linear interaction between variables (b4). We will run model comparison tests using Akaike information criteria (AIC) to compare fits of nested models. First, we will run the full model including linear and quadratic terms for each level and the interaction term between personal and prototypical parent ratings. Then, we will subsequently subtract terms and calculate the AIC of each nested model containing one fewer term. A higher AIC value will indicate more misfit in the model. These comparison tests will allow us to ascertain the terms that best explain the data. \nRSA plots visualize the results of these models as a surface in a three-dimensional coordinate system. The three-dimensional surface in RSA can be described by 5 coefficients that are calculated using the terms obtained from the polynomial regression equation: a1 = b1 + b2; a2 = b3 + b4 + b5; a3 = b1 \u2013 b2;  a4 = b3 \u2013 b4 + b5; a5 = b3 \u2013 b5. These 5 coefficients determine the line of congruence (LOC), the line of incongruence (LOIC), and the ridge line of the plotted surface. \nThe LOC reflects instances where the predictor values perfectly match (e.g., a person high in conscientiousness rates high levels of conscientiousness as being prototypical of a parent\u2019s personality); the LOIC reflects instances where the predictor variables are the exact opposite of one another (e.g., a person low in conscientiousness rates high levels of conscientiousness as being prototypical of a parent\u2019s personality; Barranti, Carlson, &amp; C\u00f4t\u00e9, 2017). The coefficients a1 and a2 form the LOC, such that a1 represents the linear slope of the line and a2 indicates the curvilinear effect. The coefficients a3 and a4 form the LOIC, such that a3 represents the linear slope of the line and a4 indicates the curvilinear effect. The coefficient a5 represents the ridge line of the response surface (Sch\u00f6nbrodt, Humberg, &amp; Nestler, 2018), indicating the optimum outcome value. In other words, this is the line on the plot where the predictor variables are associated with the highest levels of the outcome variable. \nA hypothetical RSA plot exemplifying the former terms and supporting the strict congruence hypothesis is depicted in the hypothetical response surface in Figure 2a. Strict congruence occurs when the outcome variable is consistently highest along the LOC. This surface shows people with high personal levels of a certain trait who rated that trait as being highly prototypical for a parent had the highest levels of self-esteem. Likewise, people with low personal levels of a certain trait who rated that trait as being prototypically low for a parent also had the highest levels of self-esteem In this plot, a significant negative a4 value along with nonsignificant a1 \u2013 a3 values would result in an inverted U-shaped parabola, supporting the congruence hypothesis (Humberg, Nestler, &amp; Back, 2019). Moreover, an a5  value of 0 supports strict congruence, indicating the ridge line of the surface is located strictly on the LOC, i.e., the highest levels of self-esteem do not significantly differ from the LOC (Sch\u00f6nbrodt et al., 2018). Together, these values depict the optimal level of self-esteem as occurring along the LOC\u2014the line in the plot on which personal and prototypical trait ratings perfectly match one another. Along the LOIC, people for whom personal ratings and ratings of the prototype differ (in either direction) would have lower levels of self-esteem. A looser interpretation of the congruence hypothesis also includes linear or curvilinear main effects of independent variables. In the present study, we do not expect to find strict congruence in our RSA plots as reflected in Figure 2a. Rather, we expect an amalgam of main and interaction effects for all five trait domains.\nIn our RSA plots, we expect to find positive main effects for all personal trait ratings on self-esteem. However, we expect personal trait ratings of emotional stability and extraversion to be stronger indicators of levels of self-esteem than personal trait ratings of openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Specifically, we expect linear and possibly also quadratic effect sizes to be higher for personal ratings of emotional stability and extraversion than openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.\nThe resulting plot we expect for mostly positive main effects is depicted in the hypothetical response surface in Figure 2b, in which higher levels of personal trait ratings predict higher self-esteem, regardless of levels of prototypical parent trait ratings. Statistically, a positive main effects model produces a significant positive a1 value and a nonsignificant a2 value, illustrating that higher levels of trait ratings are associated with higher levels of self-esteem, as opposed to equally high levels of self-esteem along the LOC. A significant positive a3 value and a significant negative a4 value would indicate that higher levels of personal trait ratings are associated with higher levels of self-esteem along the LOIC, regardless of prototypical parent trait ratings. A significant negative a5 value would indicate that the optimal level of self-esteem is significantly different than the LOC, i.e., a perfect match between both trait ratings is not associated with the highest levels of self-esteem. We will run model comparison tests to determine the terms that best explain the variance in the data (i.e., linear, quadratic, and interaction). We will then compare linear and quadratic effect sizes across traits to determine if personal trait ratings of emotional stability and extraversion are stronger predictors of self-esteem than personal trait ratings of openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. These analyses will allow us to address H4.\nWe expect to find interaction effects for all five trait domains on self-esteem. We expect the interaction effects for openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness to support the congruence hypothesis depicted in Figure 2c. Specifically, we expect that the LOC will be associated with the highest levels of self-esteem. In this hypothetical RSA plot, people with lower personal ratings of a trait who rate that trait as being equally low for a prototypical parent still have higher levels of self-esteem than people with low personal ratings of this trait who rate a prototypical parent to be higher in this trait. We will run model comparison tests to determine if the interaction between trait ratings is significant. First, we will run the full model including linear and quadratic terms for each level and the interaction term between personal and prototypical parent ratings. Then, we will test whether deleting the interaction term would lead to a significant decrease in model fit. We expect this interaction effect to be stronger for openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness than emotional stability and extraversion. We will compare interaction effect sizes across traits to determine if the interaction between trait ratings for openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness is a higher predictor of self-esteem than the interaction between trait ratings for emotional stability and extraversion. These analyses will allow us to address H5.\nPost-transition analyses\nThird, we will use wave 1 (pre-transition) and wave 2 (post-transition) personal trait ratings with wave 1 prototypical parent ratings to assess if match between reports increases after the transition to parenthood. Specifically, we will compare the squared differences between personal trait ratings at wave 1/ wave 2 and prototypical parent trait ratings at wave 1 for each of the five trait domains using dependent t-tests. A significant decrease in the squared differences between wave 1 and wave 2 would suggest a significant increase in congruence after the transition to parenthood. This analysis will allow us to address H6.\n", "q19.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e191908855d4c0034b7059f", "file_name": "RSA figures.pdf", "file_urls": {"html":
