We ask (1) whether educational access affects hope; (2) whether educational access affects attitudes and behaviors conducive to peace or conflict; and (3) whether these relationships work through hope or hopelessness, concepts frequently invoked in the global discourse surrounding youth and violence. Primarily through use of a quantitative survey, we will compare youth whose aspirations for access to education are fulfilled with those whose aspirations are blocked at three points in time: (1) as applications to university are submitted during their final year of secondary school (2) soon after the release of university admissions decisions , and (3) one year after the release.

Therefore the primary hypotheses to be tested focus on the effect of university access (as defined in our pre-analysis plan) and are the following: 1. University access has an effect on hope; 2. University access has an effect on attitudes and behaviors conducive to peace or conflict. Given that the relevant literature on these relationships has conflicting theories about their directionality, and little previous research has been performed to confirm or reject these theories, we do not propose directionality in our hypotheses. We are also interested in hypotheses about the effect of university attendance on our outcomes as well as the relationship between hope and our outcomes. Answering these questions will require making additional assumptions (as described in our pre-analysis plan) so we consider them to be secondary hypotheses. The secondary hypotheses to be tested are the following: 1. University attendance has an effect on hope; 2. University attendance has an effect on attitudes and behaviors conducive to peace or conflict; 3. Hope is associated with subsequent attitudes and behaviors conducive to peace or conflict. Analyses targeting other quantities of interest, including subgroup effects, will be considered exploratory."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "These causal relationships will be tested by capitalizing on naturally-occurring regression discontinuity designs that are created by the university admissions processes in each country. Although the overarching research design is conceptually similar across the two countries, differences between how admission tests are used in Kenya versus Pakistan will lead to slightly different designs in each country. In Kenya, admissions to university and funding for attendance are determined by an individual\u2019s score on a nationwide standardized exam, the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) and a cutoff and placement determined by Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service (KUCCPS). In Pakistan the situation is slightly more complicated. Here, university-specific entrance exams are the primary determinants of admission. However, interviews and a few other criteria may also play a role after this initial cutoff determines whether applicants will be considered at all. To analyze the effect of \u201caccess\u201d on each targeted outcome, we will use a regression of the outcome on an indicator for scoring above or below the requisite threshold as well as on the \u201cforcing variable\u201d (here, the test score). Key covariates, such as socio-demographic variables and pre-treatment measures of the given outcome variables, and other strong predictors will be included to increase precision. Given the nature of the admissions processes in Kenya and Pakistan, the RDD design is \u201cfuzzy\u201d for some common and some dissimilar reasons. That is, access does not have a one-to-one equivalency with attendance. Therefore, to address our secondary hypotheses about attendance, and when appropriate (that is, when the requisite IV assumptions hold), we will augment each of the standard RDD analyses described above with an instrumental variables (IV) approach. For these analyses, the instrument will be access (scoring above or below the requisite threshold) and the treatment variable will be actually enrolling in and attending the university in question.

Primarily through use of a quantitative survey, we will compare youth whose aspirations for access to education are fulfilled with those whose aspirations are blocked at three points in time: (1) as applications to university are submitted during their final year of secondary school (2) soon after the release of university admissions decisions , and (3) one year after the release. In so doing, we will systematically and quantitatively map the trajectory of youth outcomes as they experience success or failure in their educational goals, thereby illuminating whether educational access or non-access affects hope, and peace and conflict attitudes and behaviors.", "q16": "Our primary hypotheses focus on the most basic questions that we can address with the most rigorous designs/methods. Therefore the primary hypotheses to be tested focus on the effect of university access (as defined in our pre-analysis plan) and are the following: 1. University access has an effect on hope; 2. University access has an effect on attitudes and behaviors conducive to peace or conflict. Given that the relevant literature on these relationships has conflicting theories about their directionality, and little previous research has been performed to confirm or reject these theories, we do not propose directionality in our hypotheses. We are also interested in hypotheses about the effect of university attendance on our outcomes as well as the relationship between hope and our outcomes. Answering these questions will require making additional assumptions (as described in our pre-analysis plan) so we consider them to be secondary hypotheses. The secondary hypotheses to be tested are the following: 1. University attendance has an effect on hope; 2. University attendance has an effect on attitudes and behaviors conducive to peace or conflict; 3. Hope is associated with subsequent attitudes and behaviors conducive to peace or conflict. Analyses targeting other quantities of interest, including subgroup effects, will be considered exploratory.", "q17": "These causal relationships will be tested by capitalizing on naturally-occurring regression discontinuity designs that are created by the university admissions processes in each country. Although the overarching research design is conceptually similar across the two countries, differences between how admission tests are used in Kenya versus Pakistan will lead to slightly different designs in each country. In Kenya, admissions to university and funding for attendance are determined by an individual\u2019s score on a nationwide standardized exam, the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) and a cutoff and placement determined by Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service (KUCCPS). In Pakistan the situation is slightly more complicated. Here, university-specific entrance exams are the primary determinants of admission. However, interviews and a few other criteria may also play a role after this initial cutoff determines whether applicants will be considered at all. To analyze the effect of \u201caccess\u201d on each targeted outcome, we will use a regression of the outcome on an indicator for scoring above or below the requisite threshold as well as on the \u201cforcing variable\u201d (here, the test score). Key covariates, such as socio-demographic variables and pre-treatment measures of the given outcome variables, and other strong predictors will be included to increase precision. Given the nature of the admissions processes in Kenya and Pakistan, the RDD design is \u201cfuzzy\u201d for some common and some dissimilar reasons. That is, access does not have a one-to-one equivalency with attendance. Therefore, to address our secondary hypotheses about attendance, and when appropriate (that is, when the requisite IV assumptions hold), we will augment each of the standard RDD analyses described above with an instrumental variables (IV) approach. For these analyses, the instrument will be access (scoring above or below the requisite threshold) and the treatment variable will be actually enrolling in and attending the university in question. If we find that university access or attendance affects hope as well as subsequent attitudes and behaviors conducive to peace or conflict, we will also estimate the conditional association between hope and these future outcomes. These analyses are based purely on observational data and the assumptions required for the estimates to be interpreted causally are stronger than in our analyses.

Even as media campaigns expand, there is a lack of rigorous evidence about the effect of real-world radio messages on social attitudes and behaviors. This project will provide a rigorous evaluation of the effects of progressive mass media on social attitudes and behaviors in Tanzania\u2019s Tanga. We will assess the effects of messaging through community radio listening by randomly selecting communities to participate in village-level screenings of the radio soap opera Tamapendo, produced by the Tanzanian organization Uzikwasa to increase awareness of and proactive responses to early forced marriage and gender-based violence.

Primary Hypotheses We expect to see the strongest treatment effects in the following areas: 1.1.1. Discussion We hypothesize that a larger proportion of respondents in each treatment group will report having discussed the topic of their village\u2019s assigned treatment group. We will test the joint significance of two (one-sided) treatment effects (Wahapahapa screening on HIV/AIDS discussion, Tamapendo screening on early forced marriage). 1.1.2. Knowledge We hypothesize that a higher proportion of respondents in Wahapahapa assigned villages will be familiar with basic information regarding HIV treatment and transmission We do not anticipate changes in level of knowledge about early forced marriage or intimate partner violence in either group. 1.1.3. Conative Attitudes We hypothesize that a higher proportion of respondents will select actions aligned with norms advocated in the radio screenings: \u25cf Wahapahapa: willingness to reveal HIV/AIDS status to friends and family and accept HIV/AIDS positive coworkers \u25cf Tamapendo: supports girls resisting early forced marriage, willingness to report instances of early forced marriage to authorities 1.1.4. Conative Norms We hypothesize that higher proportion of respondents will report believing that other community members hold conative attitudes that align with the radio screening \u25cf Wahapahapa: willingness to work alongside other HIV positive individuals \u25cf Tamapapendo: willingness to report instances of early forced marriage to authorities, support for women resisting early forced marriage 1.2. Secondary Hypotheses We may observe treatment effects in the following areas: 1.2.1. Cognitive Attitudes We hypothesize that a higher proportion of respondents will report attitudes aligning with those espoused in the radio screening \u25cf Wahapahpa: reduced stigma against HIV positive individuals \u25cf Tampaendo: reduced support for early forced marriage, support for laws banning early forced marriage 1.2.2. Cognitive Norms We hypothesize that a higher proportion of respondents will report believe that their community\u2019s attitudes align with those espoused in the radio screening \u25cf Tamapendo: reduced support for early forced marriage 1.2.3. Priorities We hypothesize that a higher proportion of respondents will report that the topics highlighted in the screenings are community and electoral priorities. \u25cf Tamapendo: votes for hypothetical candidate committed to reducing early forced marriage, lists reducing early forced marriage as a community priority \u25cf Wahapahapa: vote for hypothetical candidate committed to improving access to hiv/aids treatment, lists HIV/AIDS as a community priority 1.3. Tertiary Hypotheses The following hypotheses are premised on the idea that radio dramas cause listeners to rethink their broad views about gender equality: 1.3.1. Intimate Partner Violence We hypothesize that respondents who listen to the Tamapendo screening will report more progressive cognitive and conative attitudes and norms related to intimate partner violence. \u25cf Conative attitudes: willingness to report incidents of intimate partner violence, support for victims responding to intimate partner violence \u25cf Conative norms: believes other community members would report intimate partner violence \u25cf Cognitive attitudes: reduced acceptance of intimate partner violence in different situations \u25cf Cognitive norms: believes other community members accept intimate partner violence 1.3.2. Gender Hierarchy We hypothesize that respondents who listen to the Tampaendo screening will report more progressive cognitive and conative attitudes related to gender hierarchy \u25cf Cognitive attitudes: believes women earning more than men won\u2019t cause problems, believes men and women should share household work equally, believes boys and girls should both go to school, believes girls can go to town for school or work \u25cf Conative attitudes: increased support for allowing girls to migrate to town, increased support for providing financial support for girls to go to town"}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "Overview: One key feature of the design is cluster randomization: Screenings were held in 30 villages between July 25 and September 10th. Villages were blocked into 15 wards and randomly assigned to either Tamapendo (focusing on early forced marriage) or Wahapahapa (focusing on HIV/AIDS stigma). The other is sampling within clusters: In each of 40 randomly selected households in each village, one household member (20 men and 20 women) was invited to attend the radio drama screening. Screenings were typically held in the early afternoon, and in some cases again in the evening. Participants were invited to the screenings at the end of the baseline interview. They were told that the screenings would feature free refreshments, and the screenings were free of charge. They were not told about the content of the program. Randomization: The sampling process yielded 16 blocks (15 blocks for treatment / placebo and one for replacement) of 2 clusters each. We then randomly assigned Treatment and Placebo screening conditions within each pair. In the case that a village needed to be discarded, we specified that we would replace the village with the next village on the ward\u2019s list of randomly ordered. We will conduct randomization after confirming two viable villages in a ward.

These programs are meant to improve social welfare by decreasing the social acceptability of anti-social behavior, such as early forced marriage and domestic violence. Even as media campaigns expand, there is a lack of rigorous evidence about the effect of real-world radio messages on social attitudes and behaviors. This project will provide a rigorous evaluation of the effects of progressive mass media on social attitudes and behaviors in Tanzania\u2019s Tanga. We will assess the effects of messaging through community radio listening by randomly selecting communities to participate in village-level screenings of the radio soap opera Tamapendo, produced by the Tanzanian organization Uzikwasa to increase awareness of and proactive responses to early forced marriage and gender-based violence. To test the effect of the radio screenings, we will compare knowledge and attitudes in villages randomly selected to view the Uzikwasa-produced programs with attitudes in villages randomly selected for the placebo group (who listen to Wahapahapa, a popular radio soap opera focusing on stories involving treatment for HIV-AIDS) 8-10 days after the programs are shown.", "q16": "1.1. Primary Hypotheses We expect to see the strongest treatment effects in the following areas: 1.1.1. Discussion We hypothesize that a larger proportion of respondents in each treatment group will report having discussed the topic of their village\u2019s assigned treatment group. We will test the joint significance of two (one-sided) treatment effects (Wahapahapa screening on HIV/AIDS discussion, Tamapendo screening on early forced marriage). 1.1.2. Knowledge We hypothesize that a higher proportion of respondents in Wahapahapa assigned villages will be familiar with basic information regarding HIV treatment and transmission We do not anticipate changes in level of knowledge about early forced marriage or intimate partner violence in either group. 1.1.3. Conative Attitudes We hypothesize that a higher proportion of respondents will select actions aligned with norms advocated in the radio screenings: \u25cf Wahapahapa: willingness to reveal HIV/AIDS status to friends and family and accept HIV/AIDS positive coworkers \u25cf Tamapendo: supports girls resisting early forced marriage, willingness to report instances of early forced marriage to authorities 1.1.4. Conative Norms We hypothesize that higher proportion of respondents will report believing that other community members hold conative attitudes that align with the radio screening \u25cf Wahapahapa: willingness to work alongside other HIV positive individuals \u25cf Tamapapendo: willingness to report instances of early forced marriage to authorities, support for women resisting early forced marriage 1.2. Secondary Hypotheses We may observe treatment effects in the following areas: 1.2.1. Cognitive Attitudes We hypothesize that a higher proportion of respondents will report attitudes aligning with those espoused in the radio screening \u25cf Wahapahpa: reduced stigma against HIV positive individuals \u25cf Tampaendo: reduced support for early forced marriage, support for laws banning early forced marriage 1.2.2. Cognitive Norms We hypothesize that a higher proportion of respondents will report believe that their community\u2019s attitudes align with those espoused in the radio screening \u25cf Tamapendo: reduced support for early forced marriage 1.2.3. Priorities We hypothesize that a higher proportion of respondents will report that the topics highlighted in the screenings are community and electoral priorities. \u25cf Tamapendo: votes for hypothetical candidate committed to reducing early forced marriage, lists reducing early forced marriage as a community priority \u25cf Wahapahapa: vote for hypothetical candidate committed to improving access to hiv/aids treatment, lists HIV/AIDS as a community priority 1.3. Tertiary Hypotheses The following hypotheses are premised on the idea that radio dramas cause listeners to rethink their broad views about gender equality: 1.3.1. Intimate Partner Violence We hypothesize that respondents who listen to the Tamapendo screening will report more progressive cognitive and conative attitudes and norms related to intimate partner violence. \u25cf Conative attitudes: willingness to report incidents of intimate partner violence, support for victims responding to intimate partner violence \u25cf Conative norms: believes other community members would report intimate partner violence \u25cf Cognitive attitudes: reduced acceptance of intimate partner violence in different situations \u25cf Cognitive norms: believes other community members accept intimate partner violence 1.3.2. Gender Hierarchy We hypothesize that respondents who listen to the Tampaendo screening will report more progressive cognitive and conative attitudes related to gender hierarchy \u25cf Cognitive attitudes: believes women earning more than men won\u2019t cause problems, believes men and women should share household work equally, believes boys and girls should both go to school, believes girls can go to town for school or work \u25cf Conative attitudes: increased support for allowing girls to migrate to town, increased support for providing financial support for girls to go to town", "q17": "Overview: One key feature of the design is cluster randomization: Screenings were held in 30 villages between July 25 and September 10th. Villages were blocked into 15 wards and randomly assigned to either Tamapendo (focusing on early forced marriage) or Wahapahapa (focusing on HIV/AIDS stigma). The other is sampling within clusters: In each of 40 randomly selected households in each village, one household member (20 men and 20 women) was invited to attend the radio drama screening. Screenings were typically held in the early afternoon, and in some cases again in the evening. Participants were invited to the screenings at the end of the baseline interview. They were told that the screenings would feature free refreshments, and the screenings were free of charge. They were not told about the content of the program. Randomization: The sampling process yielded 16 blocks (15 blocks for treatment / placebo and one for replacement) of 2 clusters each. We then randomly assigned Treatment and Placebo screening conditions within each pair. In the case that a village needed to be discarded, we specified that we would replace the village with the next village on the ward\u2019s list of randomly ordered. We will conduct randomization after confirming two viable villages in a ward. In the case that the ward had no new villages meeting the criteria specified in Section 4.1, we would move to the replacement ward. Estimation: For all analyses, we will estimate treatment effects using least squares regression and clustered standard errors, with fixed effects for block (ward).

Moreover, does it matter is the bribe is \u2018petty\u2019 or \u2018grand\u2019? Finally, does it matter for what use the bribe is being committed? We test these questions in this project using an experimental analysis based on a conjoint analysis. In addition, we test research based on joint work by Transparency International and Afrobarometer testing questions about the extent of corruption and progress made fighting corruption. We will conduct our research in Senegal and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.", "q16": "We test several hypotheses regarding different variables and forms of corruption: Gender H1: In comparing individuals, men are more likely to be viewed as corrupt compared to women. H1a. In comparing individuals, female respondents are less likely to view women as corrupt than men. H1b. In comparing individuals, male respondents are less likely to view women as corrupt than men. Education H2: In comparing individuals, those with education from western countries will be viewed as less corrupt than those with education from African countries. H3. In comparing individuals, those with education from former colonies will be viewed as more corrupt than those with education from other countries. Position H4. In comparing individuals, those with public position will be viewed as more corrupt than those with private positions. H5. In comparing individuals, religious leaders will be viewed as less corrupt than leaders holding all other positions. H6. In comparing individuals, traditional leaders will be viewed as less corrupt than leaders holding all other positions except religious leaders. Ethnicity and Religion H7. In comparing individuals, those sharing a common ethnic identity/religion will be less likely to claim corruption compared to those not sharing a common ethnic identity/religion. Corruption H8. In comparing individuals, those paying bribes will be seen as less corrupt compared to those demanding bribes. H9. In comparing individuals, those paying bribes for public gain will be seen as less corrupt than those paying bribes for personal gain. H10. In comparing individuals, those demanding bribes for public gain will be seen as less corrupt than those demanding bribes for personal gain. H11. In comparing individuals, those paying petty bribes will be seen as less corrupt than those paying grand bribes. H12. In comparing individuals, those demanding petty bribes will be seen as less corrupt than those demanding grand bribes. H13. In comparing individuals, those paying petty bribes will be seen as less corrupt than those demanding petty bribes. H14. In comparing individuals, those paying grand bribes will be seen as less corrupt than those demanding grand bribes. H15.

highly polarizing issues. Research tells us that efforts to frame highly politically polarized issues (such as climate change) often fail because an individual's partisan identity is highly salient and drives his or her attitudes on the issue (Bernauer & McGrath, 2016; Hart & Nisbet, 2012; Zhou, 2016). Because climate change has become a cornerstone issue that defines what it means to identify as a Democrat or a Republican in the United States (Bliuc et al., 2015), any mention of climate change activates a partisan identity, leading to policy preferences that reflect that identity. By ignoring the interaction between identity salience (the aspect of an individual\u2019s identity that is most likely to drive attitudes and preferences at a given time) and frame acceptance, policy communicators have overlooked an important factor that can determine the success or failure of climate change framing efforts. One way to increase concern about things that will happen far in the future (such as the impacts of climate change) is to activate an individuals\u2019 identity as a parent. By bringing an individual\u2019s identity as a parent to mind, priming a parental identity may lead them to consider the consequences of their actions and decisions on the welfare of their children and future generations. Encountering a frame about the impacts of climate change on future generations when an individual\u2019s parental identity is salient, then, may increase the effectiveness of the framing effort and increase support for climate change mitigation policies. In this study, I experimentally test this theory through a survey experiment with parents. Through random treatment assignment, I test whether priming a parental identity before presenting a climate change frame increases support for climate change policies, compared to priming a partisan identity, only receiving the frame, or no treatment. Additionally, to understand how conflicting identities influence framing effectiveness, I also test how priming both a parental and a partisan identity changes an individual\u2019s response to a climate change frame.
