Although the number of life years without disability is increasing due to advances in medical technology, the number of persons living with disability, often rooted in chronic disease, is growing. Sensory loss, especially vision loss, is one of the most common chronic conditions that cause disability. In Switzerland, an estimated 325.000 people are affected by a considerable vision loss, most of them in the form of acquired vision loss.\nAlthough the level of disability related to the sensory loss varies depending on different factors within the individual and its context, the experience of sensory loss itself can be categorized as a critical and traumatic life event. Emotional reactions to vision loss include fear, helplessness and frustration. Reduced satisfaction with life, elevated risk for the development of depressive symptoms and negative views of the future may be correlates of experiencing sensory loss. Sensory loss in most cases significantly reduces an individual\u2019s independence and leads to activity limitations and participation restrictions in a highly visual and acoustic environment.\nA growing body of literature has shown that critical life events not only affect the individual but also the people close to them, especially romantic partners and family members. Lately, research on couples has focused on the effects of and coping with stress related to physical or mental illness of one partner. The concept of \u201cwe-disease\u201d expresses the interdependence of both partners when coping with a major stressor. Both partners within the couple unit are affected by the practical and emotional implications the condition brings about. Indeed, the little research that has been published regarding romantic relationships in the context of sensory disability show that the emotional and practical implications of the disability can burden both partners individually, as well as the couple as a system. The impaired partner suffers due to his/her vision loss and loss of independence while the spouse is burdened with additional caretaking, and concerns for the safety and well-being of the impaired partner. \nHowever, as much as both partners and their relationship may be challenged, they can also both support each other and contribute to coping with the impacts of the disability. This idea is central to the concept of \u201cwe-disease\u201d which posits that couples coping with illness or disability of one partner should be considered as a unit instead of dividing them into the traditional roles of patient and partner.\nMutual support, shared coping responsibility and joint coping efforts have been identified as beneficial factors in the context of individual and dyadic adaptation to stressors. More specifically, the concept of dyadic coping has been linked to a variety of positive outcomes at the individual and the dyadic level such as higher well-being and relationship satisfaction. A few studies have begun to examine dyadic coping in the context of chronic illness. The project at hand aims to extend this literature to couples coping with sensory loss, particularly vison loss. \n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Main research questions: \n1) How does vision loss or dual sensory loss (loss of vision and hearing) of one partner psychologically affect (a) the partner with sensory loss, (b) the spouse and (c) the couple relationship? \n2) What are resources that help both partners adapt to the sensory loss and maintain the mental health of both partners?\n\nMain hypotheses:\nOwn and partner dyadic/shared appraisals of the disability are positively related to individual and dyadic functioning as reported by oneself and by the partner. These associations are mediated by self- and partner-reported levels of common/joint dyadic coping (CDC) with CDC being positively related to both the predictor and the outcome.\n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

Although the number of life years without disability is increasing due to advances in medical technology, the number of persons living with disability, often rooted in chronic disease, is growing. Sensory loss, especially vision loss, is one of the most common chronic conditions that cause disability. In Switzerland, an estimated 325.000 people are affected by a considerable vision loss, most of them in the form of acquired vision loss.\nAlthough the level of disability related to the sensory loss varies depending on different factors within the individual and its context, the experience of sensory loss itself can be categorized as a critical and traumatic life event. Emotional reactions to vision loss include fear, helplessness and frustration. Reduced satisfaction with life, elevated risk for the development of depressive symptoms and negative views of the future may be correlates of experiencing sensory loss. Sensory loss in most cases significantly reduces an individual\u2019s independence and leads to activity limitations and participation restrictions in a highly visual and acoustic environment.\nA growing body of literature has shown that critical life events not only affect the individual but also the people close to them, especially romantic partners and family members. Lately, research on couples has focused on the effects of and coping with stress related to physical or mental illness of one partner. The concept of \u201cwe-disease\u201d expresses the interdependence of both partners when coping with a major stressor. Both partners within the couple unit are affected by the practical and emotional implications the condition brings about. Indeed, the little research that has been published regarding romantic relationships in the context of sensory disability show that the emotional and practical implications of the disability can burden both partners individually, as well as the couple as a system. The impaired partner suffers due to his/her vision loss and loss of independence while the spouse is burdened with additional caretaking, and concerns for the safety and well-being of the impaired partner. \nHowever, as much as both partners and their relationship may be challenged, they can also both support each other and contribute to coping with the impacts of the disability. This idea is central to the concept of \u201cwe-disease\u201d which posits that couples coping with illness or disability of one partner should be considered as a unit instead of dividing them into the traditional roles of patient and partner.\nMutual support, shared coping responsibility and joint coping efforts have been identified as beneficial factors in the context of individual and dyadic adaptation to stressors. More specifically, the concept of dyadic coping has been linked to a variety of positive outcomes at the individual and the dyadic level such as higher well-being and relationship satisfaction. A few studies have begun to examine dyadic coping in the context of chronic illness. The project at hand aims to extend this literature to couples coping with sensory loss, particularly vison loss. \n", "q4": "Main research questions: \n1) How does vision loss or dual sensory loss (loss of vision and hearing) of one partner psychologically affect (a) the partner with sensory loss, (b) the spouse and (c) the couple relationship? \n2) What are resources that help both partners adapt to the sensory loss and maintain the mental health of both partners?\n\nMain hypotheses:\nOwn and partner dyadic/shared appraisals of the disability are positively related to individual and dyadic functioning as reported by oneself and by the partner. These associations are mediated by self- and partner-reported levels of common/joint dyadic coping (CDC) with CDC being positively related to both the predictor and the outcome.\n", "q5": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

Slow gait, especially in older adults, is associated with adverse health outcomes including dementia(2, 3) and mortality(4). Understanding contributing factors to slow gait may be beneficial for developing preventative interventions. One area of potential intervention is in the realm of hearing loss. Prior studies have shown that hearing loss is associated with slow gait speed(5-7). However, the relationship is modest. One possible explanation is that this relationship may be moderated by cognitive function or status. \n\nIn older adults, cognitive function has been associated with both hearing status and gait speed. Worse cognitive function, especially executive function, is strongly associated with slower gait speed (5, 6, 8-10). Recent evidence has shown that hearing loss is associated with accelerated cognitive declines in executive function(9), as well as other cognitive domains (9-13). It may be hypothesized that older individuals with worse hearing and poorer executive function would have slower gait speed. Gaining a better understanding of relationships among hearing impairment, cognitive status, and gait speed may be an essential step for developing interventions that improve mobility and eventually the overall quality of life among older adults.\n\n1.\tJ Vespa, D Armstrong, Medina L.

Slow gait, especially in older adults, is associated with adverse health outcomes including dementia(2, 3) and mortality(4). Understanding contributing factors to slow gait may be beneficial for developing preventative interventions. One area of potential intervention is in the realm of hearing loss. Prior studies have shown that hearing loss is associated with slow gait speed(5-7). However, the relationship is modest. One possible explanation is that this relationship may be moderated by cognitive function or status. \n\nIn older adults, cognitive function has been associated with both hearing status and gait speed. Worse cognitive function, especially executive function, is strongly associated with slower gait speed (5, 6, 8-10). Recent evidence has shown that hearing loss is associated with accelerated cognitive declines in executive function(9), as well as other cognitive domains (9-13). It may be hypothesized that older individuals with worse hearing and poorer executive function would have slower gait speed. Gaining a better understanding of relationships among hearing impairment, cognitive status, and gait speed may be an essential step for developing interventions that improve mobility and eventually the overall quality of life among older adults.\n\n1.\tJ Vespa, D Armstrong, Medina L.

(2019).\nHypothesis 3: A predilection for heads and faces will generalize to a behavioral preference of social stimuli. Social attention as measured with eye-tracking in the lab will predict self-chosen exhibition to social stimuli.

Wallsten and Budescu 1995). In areas such as medicine (Gigerenzer 2002), regulation (Sunstein 2007), climate science (Budescu et al. 2014), and national security (Johnston 2004), experts are typically uncomfortable expressing probabilities with numeric precision, and often avoid offering assessing uncertainty at all. Studying more than three thousand doctor-patient interactions, for instance, Braddock et al. (1999) found that physicians described uncertainty about treatment outcomes in 17 percent of complex procedures. In a review of 379 declassified National Intelligence Estimates, Friedman and Zeckhauser (2012) found that four percent of key judgments conveyed probability using quantitative expressions or phrasings with clear numeric equivalents. Vague probability assessments can have clear, negative consequences. In 1961, the Joint Chiefs of Staff determined that the proposed Bay of Pigs invasion was highly tenuous, estimating its chances of success as roughly one in three. But in their report to President John F. Kennedy, the Chiefs wrote only that \u201cthis plan has a fair chance of success,\u201d which Kennedy took to indicate support for the proposal (Wyden 1979, 88-90). Similarly, in his post mortem review of the space shuttle Challenger explosion, Richard Feynman (1986) found that managers and engineers held estimates of rocket failure rates that differed, on average, by a factor of one thousand. Both cases demonstrated obvious miscommunication, generated sharp criticism, and raised the possibility that major crises could have been averted if public officials had made clearer probability assessments. In some fields, vague probability assessments are deliberately encouraged by official guidelines. For instance the U.S. Director of National Intelligence\u2019s 2015 directive on \u201cAnalytic Standards\u201d instructs intelligence analysts to assess likelihood using \u201cwords of estimative probability\u201d that correspond to seven different segments of the number line. This spectrum helps to mitigate extreme miscommunication as in the Bay of Pigs example, but the difference is of degree and not kind. To use this guidance properly, analysts must quantify their judgments and then coarsen those judgments into vaguer, qualitative terms. A similar set of guidelines can be found in U.S. Army doctrine on \u201cComposite Risk Management.\u201d There are several reasons why many scholars and practitioners advocate qualitative probability expressions, but this project focuses on two of those arguments in detail. First, many scholars and practitioners argue that quantifying probability estimates would expose analysts to undue criticism when their estimates fall on the \u201cwrong side of maybe.\u201d Second, clear probability assessments might constrain decision makers\u2019 freedom of action, as explicit expressions of doubt could make policy choices more difficult to sell to the public or more challenging to defend after the fact. Both of these arguments imply that even if quantitative probability assessments are ideal in principle, bureaucratic and political incentives prevent this idea from being implemented in practice. I refer to this idea as cautionary vagueness, which I define as the use of intentionally vague probability assessments as a strategy for mitigating criticism. Though the idea of cautionary vagueness appears widely in scholarship on national security decision making, I argue that there are two main reasons to question this strategy\u2019s effectiveness. First, even if vague probability assessments mitigate blame in some contexts, they can also mitigate credit. When probability assessments fall on the \u201cright side of maybe,\u201d or when risky decisions succeed, public officials may have incentives to emphasize the clarity of their probabilistic reasoning. The logic of cautionary vagueness thus supposes that the benefits of blame avoidance outweigh the costs to credit-claiming. This is plausible, but it is an empirical claim that has never been tested directly, especially in a national security context. Second, it is not clear why quantitative probability assessments should expose analysts and decision makers to greater scrutiny than employing \u201cwords of estimative probability.\u201d It would be one thing for analysts and decision makers to avoid making probability assessments at all: but if they do express probability, does calling a conclusion \u201clikely\u201d really invite less criticism than making an estimate of \u201c65 percent\u201d? In fact, numeric assessments could even mitigate criticism in some cases by dispelling impressions of misplaced certainty. Again, it is an open empirical question as to whether these countervailing effects alleviate or intensify blame on the whole. This project aims to provide the first systematic exploration of cautionary vagueness. The theoretical purpose of this project is to translate ideas about cautionary vagueness into falsifiable hypotheses (and to explain why those hypotheses are worth scrutinizing). I then test those hypotheses using original survey experiments asking respondents to evaluate the quality of analysis and decision making."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Probability assessments are inherently difficult to evaluate. Consider a financial analyst who states that there is a 70 percent chance that a stock price will go up. If the stock price instead goes down, then we can say that the analyst\u2019s estimate was on the \u201cwrong side of maybe,\u201d but there is rarely an objective way to know how much we should attribute this particular discrepancy to bad estimation versus bad luck. Nevertheless, many people naturally criticize estimates that fall on the wrong side of maybe, assuming that uncertain outcomes should have been predictable before the fact. This is called hindsight bias (Fischhoff 1975, Tetlock and Lebow 2001). Analysts may leave probability assessments intentionally vague so as to mitigate such criticism. Scholars of national security often reference this kind of cautionary vagueness. Mark Lowenthal (2006, 128-29), a scholar with three decades\u2019 experience in the U.S. Intelligence Community, criticizes intelligence analysts for using \u201cweasel words\u201d to escape criticism, arguing that this behavior represents \u201canalytical pusillanimity.\u201d One way in which national security may be distinct from other areas of high-stakes decision making is that decision makers might also prefer for analysts to leave probability assessments vague. Dean Acheson (1969, 375), U.S. Secretary of State under President Harry Truman, argued that public officials must often make decisions \u201cclearer than truth,\u201d glossing over doubts in order to defend policy choices to the public. Joshua Rovner (2011) develops a theory of intelligence-policy relations which holds that decision makers aim to cherry-pick analyses in order to oversell their policies. This behavior relates to what scholars call outcome bias: the idea that many people naturally evaluate decision makers on the basis of whether or not their actions appear to have been successful (Baron and Hershey 1988, Gurdal, Miller, and Rustichini 2013). Combined with partisan pressures, outcome bias can lead critics to seize on any information that might raise doubts about the quality of a decision. Explicitly acknowledging uncertainty about a decision\u2019s outcome may court this kind of pushback from critical constituencies. Understanding the use of probability in national security and other areas of high-stakes decision making thus requires grappling with cautionary vagueness, whether or not one approves of the practice. Yet there are two main reasons to question whether cautionary vagueness is as effective as the conventional wisdom supposes. First, even if precise probability assessments engender blame when estimates fall on the wrong side of maybe, they may also increase credit when estimates fall on the right side of maybe. Following the successful 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound in Pakistan, for instance, President Barack Obama and his advisers described to the media how they had parsed probability assessments about the chances that Al Qaeda\u2019s leader was living in that location, including several debates involving numeric percentages. Presumably, White House and intelligence officials believed that this information would improve public perceptions of how carefully they had handled uncertainty. President Obama remarked in an interview regarding his decision making process for the bin Laden raid that, \u201cone of the things you learn as president is that you\u2019re always dealing with probabilities\u201d (Bowden 2012, 161). All participants in this debate were eager to emphasize how this decision was surrounded by uncertainty. Cautionary vagueness thus only benefits public officials if quantifying probability assessments increases blame more than it increases credit. This is plausible: some scholars posit a general negativity bias in public affairs in which blame for bad outcomes tends to stronger than credit for good outcomes (Hood 2011, 9-14). But to date, this claim has not been tested in a national security context. A second reason to question the logic of cautionary vagueness is that precise probability assessments may actually mitigate some kinds of criticism. In the case of the L\u2019Aquila earthquake, public officials were literally put on trial for making their assessments too vague. Similarly, the 2002 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq\u2019s Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction provides an example of how imprecise analysis can plausibly increase analysts\u2019 blame exposure. The bumper-sticker summary of the Iraq NIE is that the U.S. Intelligence Community thought it was a \u201cslam dunk\u201d to conclude that Saddam Hussein was pursuing nuclear weapons. But the estimate itself does not say this \u2013 in fact, the NIE\u2019s key judgments contain no direct statements about the likelihood that Iraq was developing nuclear weapons. Many key judgments refer to Iraq pursuit of \u201cweapons of mass destruction,\u201d which included biological and chemical weapons in addition to nuclear weapons. The NIE states that \u201cin the view of most agencies, Baghdad is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program,\u201d but the estimate includes a specific dissent on this point from the U.S. State Department and does not assess of the probability that this statement is true. To be sure, the information and assumptions presented in the NIE are widely mistaken, and the estimate seems designed to convince readers to believe that Iraq was actively pursuing a nuclear bomb. But this point is mostly implied: it is not stated explicitly, let alone accompanied by a clear probability assessment. Jervis (2006), among others, has thus argued that one of the most important flaws with the Iraq NIE is not just that its arguments were wrong but that the uncertainty surrounding those estimates was left vague. In hindsight, it is impossible to say how the U.S. Intelligence Community might have quantified the probability that Saddam Hussein was pursuing nuclear weapons in 2002. But even if the NIE\u2019s authors had assessed this probability to be as high as 80 percent or 90 percent, this could not have been construed after the fact as a \u201cslam dunk,\u201d and it might have generated useful debate about the sources and implications of residual doubt. Consistent with this point, post-mortem reviews of Iraq WMD intelligence written by the U.S. Senate (2004, 16), the Silberman-Robb Commission (2005, 409, 419), and the UK\u2019s Butler Review (2004, 145) all conclude that a major lesson from the episode is the need for clearer communication of uncertainty. Moreover, it is not at all obvious why numeric percentages should court more controversy than using the \u201cwords of estimative probability\u201d that are currently recommended by the U.S. Director of National Intelligence. Unless analysts constantly use the term \u201ceven chance,\u201d then employing words of estimative probability always runs a risk of falling on the wrong side of maybe. The question then becomes whether assessing a probability as \u201c65 percent\u201d would make analysts worse off than saying that some judgment is \u201clikely\u201d to be true. Again, this assumption is plausible, but unsupported by systematic evidence. Hypotheses I believe that the key questions about cautionary vagueness can be translated into six testable hypotheses. These hypotheses capture arguments about how quantifying probability assessments could either exacerbate or reduce public officials\u2019 exposure to criticism. Where relevant, I explicitly distinguish mechanisms influencing analysts versus decision makers. Following a standard distinctions in the decision sciences, I define analysts as individuals providing probability assessments and decision makers as individuals who use that information to judge prospective actions. I use the term public officials to describe both analysts and decision makers together. Hypothesis 1: Quantifying probability assessments increases criticism. Many scholars and practitioners are inherently skeptical of quantifying subjective judgments. It is thus possible that quantifying probability assessments always exposes analysts and decision makers to criticism. If true, this argument would support the argument that public officials have incentives to leave probability assessments vague. Hypothesis 2: Quantifying probability assessments increases hindsight bias. Probability assessments are especially exposed to criticism when they fall on the \u201cwrong side of maybe.\u201d Many scholars and practitioners believe that quantitative assessments suggest an illusion of rigor that may exacerbate such criticism. If true, this argument would support the argument that analysts have an incentive to leave probability assessments vague. Hypothesis 3: Quantifying probability assessments increases outcome bias. Decision makers are especially exposed to criticism when their actions are unsuccessful. Quantifying probability assessments could exacerbate such criticism by emphasizing how decision makers knowingly took risky actions. If true, this argument would support the argument that decision makers have an incentive to prefer that probability assessments be left vague. Hypothesis 4: Quantifying probability assessments increases credit given to analysts who fall on the \u201cright side of maybe.\u201d If quantifying probability assessments exposes unlucky analysts to greater criticism, then this might also facilitate credit-claiming when those assessments appear to be confirmed by subsequent events. If true, this argument would imply that analysts may not always have incentives to leave probability assessments vague. Hypothesis 5: Quantifying probability assessments increases credit given to decisions with successful outcomes. If quantifying probability assessments creates an illusion of rigor surrounding analysis and decision making, this may work to decision makers\u2019 credit when their actions are perceived to be effective. If true, this argument would imply that decision makers may not always have incentives to prefer that probability assessments be left vague. Hypothesis 6: Quantifying probability assessments expands blame more than it expands credit. If vague probability assessments entail countervailing effects with respect to blame avoidance versus credit-claiming, then a key question is whether either of these effects is clearly stronger on net. If the \u201cnegativity bias\u201d holds, such that quantifying probability assessments generally expands blame more than credit, then this would support the argument that public officials have incentives to leave probability estimates vague."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "In order to test the hypotheses, I designed a survey experiment that presents respondents with either of two descriptive vignettes. The first vignette involves a special forces mission to rescue Americans held hostage by ISIS in Iraq. The second vignette involves a drone strike targeting Al Qaeda leaders in Yemen. Each vignette involves four paragraphs describing how intelligence analysts and national security decision makers assessed uncertainty. The first paragraph describes whether the operation succeeded or failed. For the hostage rescue mission, this paragraph explains either that U.S. special forces retrieved the hostages, or that they found the hostages were not present. Either way, U.S. forces sustained casualties in conducting the mission. In the drone strike vignette, the first paragraph explains either that the attack killed three senior Al Qaeda leaders or that it had mistakenly targeted a wedding party. Either way, civilians were killed in the attack, which generated local protests. The second paragraph of each vignette describes how \u201csources involved with planning the operation stressed that it was a difficult decision that required wrestling with uncertainty.\u201d The paragraph describes several pieces of evidence on which intelligence analysts based their judgments. These pieces of evidence remain constant across scenario versions. The third paragraph of each vignette describes the probability that analysts assigned to the hostages being present, or to the targets of the drone strike being correctly identified. These assessments vary on two dimensions. First, some assessments were above fifty percent, and some were below fifty percent. Thus the scenarios randomly vary whether or not analysts proved to be on the \u201cwrong side of maybe\u201d (though the information on which they based their judgments was always presented identically). Second, some assessments are expressed using words (either \u201clikely\u201d or \u201cunlikely\u201d) and some assessments were expressed using numbers (either \u201c65 percent\u201d or \u201c35 percent\u201d). These probability assessments are each presented twice, highlighted in quotes. The third paragraph concludes with a quote from an unnamed official stating, \u201cThis was a probability thing, and we made sure to weigh the costs and benefits of this operation as thoroughly as possible.\u201d The phrasing mimics a statement reportedly made by President Obama during a debate over the bin Laden raid, and is meant to reinforce the probabilistic nature of the decision. The fourth paragraph of each vignette, which remains constant across scenario versions, presents quotes from public officials stating that \u201cwe analyzed the evidence from every angle we could think of\u201d; \u201cIn these kinds of situations, you have to be willing to take risks\u201d; and \u201cI supported this decision because I believed we could defend it no matter how the mission turned out.\u201d Each respondent will be presented with only one version of only one vignette. After reading the vignette, respondents are asked to \u201cPlease write a few sentences describing how you believe you would have reacted to the uncertainty in this scenario if it had been your decision.\u201d Then respondents are asked, \u201cBased only on the information you read in this scenario, please indicate your level of agreement with each of the following statements.\u201d The first statement is, \u201cU.S. officials made the right decision.\u201d The second statement is, \u201cThe intelligence analysis supporting this decision was sound.\u201d Levels of agreement are recorded on seven-point scales with 1 defined as \u201cStrongly Disagree,\u201d 4 defined as \u201cNeutral,\u201d and 7 defined as \u201cStrongly agree.\u201d These response measures serve as the main dependent variables capturing support or criticism for this study. Asking about levels of agreement/disagreement is intended to avoid priming respondents by directly asking about levels of \u201csupport\u201d or \u201cblame\u201d for their actions. After recording these responses, respondents receive two multiple-choice attention-check questions. The first question asks respondents to identify the outcome of the mission. The second question asks respondents to identify the probability that intelligence analysts attached to their assessment. Respondents who do not answer both questions correctly will be denied payment, and their responses will not appear in the data. After completing these attention-check questions, respondents complete a Berlin adaptive numeracy test (Cokely et al. 2012), and a short battery of demographic questions. I will conduct this experiment on Amazon MTurk, with an initial run of 2,000 respondents. This sample size is based on the following power calculation. -The experiment effectively involves four kinds of scenarios, based on a 2x2 division of (a) whether the decision was successful, and (b) whether analysts provided a favorable or unfavorable assessment.

In areas such as medicine (Gigerenzer 2002), regulation (Sunstein 2007), climate science (Budescu et al. 2014), and national security (Johnston 2004), experts are typically uncomfortable expressing probabilities with numeric precision, and often avoid offering assessing uncertainty at all. Studying more than three thousand doctor-patient interactions, for instance, Braddock et al. (1999) found that physicians described uncertainty about treatment outcomes in 17 percent of complex procedures. In a review of 379 declassified National Intelligence Estimates, Friedman and Zeckhauser (2012) found that four percent of key judgments conveyed probability using quantitative expressions or phrasings with clear numeric equivalents. Vague probability assessments can have clear, negative consequences. In 1961, the Joint Chiefs of Staff determined that the proposed Bay of Pigs invasion was highly tenuous, estimating its chances of success as roughly one in three. But in their report to President John F. Kennedy, the Chiefs wrote only that \u201cthis plan has a fair chance of success,\u201d which Kennedy took to indicate support for the proposal (Wyden 1979, 88-90). Similarly, in his post mortem review of the space shuttle Challenger explosion, Richard Feynman (1986) found that managers and engineers held estimates of rocket failure rates that differed, on average, by a factor of one thousand. Both cases demonstrated obvious miscommunication, generated sharp criticism, and raised the possibility that major crises could have been averted if public officials had made clearer probability assessments. In some fields, vague probability assessments are deliberately encouraged by official guidelines. For instance the U.S. Director of National Intelligence\u2019s 2015 directive on \u201cAnalytic Standards\u201d instructs intelligence analysts to assess likelihood using \u201cwords of estimative probability\u201d that correspond to seven different segments of the number line. This spectrum helps to mitigate extreme miscommunication as in the Bay of Pigs example, but the difference is of degree and not kind. To use this guidance properly, analysts must quantify their judgments and then coarsen those judgments into vaguer, qualitative terms. A similar set of guidelines can be found in U.S. Army doctrine on \u201cComposite Risk Management.\u201d There are several reasons why many scholars and practitioners advocate qualitative probability expressions, but this project focuses on two of those arguments in detail. First, many scholars and practitioners argue that quantifying probability estimates would expose analysts to undue criticism when their estimates fall on the \u201cwrong side of maybe.\u201d Second, clear probability assessments might constrain decision makers\u2019 freedom of action, as explicit expressions of doubt could make policy choices more difficult to sell to the public or more challenging to defend after the fact. Both of these arguments imply that even if quantitative probability assessments are ideal in principle, bureaucratic and political incentives prevent this idea from being implemented in practice. I refer to this idea as cautionary vagueness, which I define as the use of intentionally vague probability assessments as a strategy for mitigating criticism. Though the idea of cautionary vagueness appears widely in scholarship on national security decision making, I argue that there are two main reasons to question this strategy\u2019s effectiveness. First, even if vague probability assessments mitigate blame in some contexts, they can also mitigate credit. When probability assessments fall on the \u201cright side of maybe,\u201d or when risky decisions succeed, public officials may have incentives to emphasize the clarity of their probabilistic reasoning. The logic of cautionary vagueness thus supposes that the benefits of blame avoidance outweigh the costs to credit-claiming. This is plausible, but it is an empirical claim that has never been tested directly, especially in a national security context. Second, it is not clear why quantitative probability assessments should expose analysts and decision makers to greater scrutiny than employing \u201cwords of estimative probability.\u201d It would be one thing for analysts and decision makers to avoid making probability assessments at all: but if they do express probability, does calling a conclusion \u201clikely\u201d really invite less criticism than making an estimate of \u201c65 percent\u201d? In fact, numeric assessments could even mitigate criticism in some cases by dispelling impressions of misplaced certainty. Again, it is an open empirical question as to whether these countervailing effects alleviate or intensify blame on the whole. This project aims to provide the first systematic exploration of cautionary vagueness. The theoretical purpose of this project is to translate ideas about cautionary vagueness into falsifiable hypotheses (and to explain why those hypotheses are worth scrutinizing). I then test those hypotheses using original survey experiments asking respondents to evaluate the quality of analysis and decision making.", "q16": "Probability assessments are inherently difficult to evaluate. Consider a financial analyst who states that there is a 70 percent chance that a stock price will go up. If the stock price instead goes down, then we can say that the analyst\u2019s estimate was on the \u201cwrong side of maybe,\u201d but there is rarely an objective way to know how much we should attribute this particular discrepancy to bad estimation versus bad luck. Nevertheless, many people naturally criticize estimates that fall on the wrong side of maybe, assuming that uncertain outcomes should have been predictable before the fact. This is called hindsight bias (Fischhoff 1975, Tetlock and Lebow 2001). Analysts may leave probability assessments intentionally vague so as to mitigate such criticism. Scholars of national security often reference this kind of cautionary vagueness. Mark Lowenthal (2006, 128-29), a scholar with three decades\u2019 experience in the U.S. Intelligence Community, criticizes intelligence analysts for using \u201cweasel words\u201d to escape criticism, arguing that this behavior represents \u201canalytical pusillanimity.\u201d One way in which national security may be distinct from other areas of high-stakes decision making is that decision makers might also prefer for analysts to leave probability assessments vague. Dean Acheson (1969, 375), U.S. Secretary of State under President Harry Truman, argued that public officials must often make decisions \u201cclearer than truth,\u201d glossing over doubts in order to defend policy choices to the public. Joshua Rovner (2011) develops a theory of intelligence-policy relations which holds that decision makers aim to cherry-pick analyses in order to oversell their policies. This behavior relates to what scholars call outcome bias: the idea that many people naturally evaluate decision makers on the basis of whether or not their actions appear to have been successful (Baron and Hershey 1988, Gurdal, Miller, and Rustichini 2013). Combined with partisan pressures, outcome bias can lead critics to seize on any information that might raise doubts about the quality of a decision. Explicitly acknowledging uncertainty about a decision\u2019s outcome may court this kind of pushback from critical constituencies. Understanding the use of probability in national security and other areas of high-stakes decision making thus requires grappling with cautionary vagueness, whether or not one approves of the practice. Yet there are two main reasons to question whether cautionary vagueness is as effective as the conventional wisdom supposes. First, even if precise probability assessments engender blame when estimates fall on the wrong side of maybe, they may also increase credit when estimates fall on the right side of maybe. Following the successful 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound in Pakistan, for instance, President Barack Obama and his advisers described to the media how they had parsed probability assessments about the chances that Al Qaeda\u2019s leader was living in that location, including several debates involving numeric percentages. Presumably, White House and intelligence officials believed that this information would improve public perceptions of how carefully they had handled uncertainty. President Obama remarked in an interview regarding his decision making process for the bin Laden raid that, \u201cone of the things you learn as president is that you\u2019re always dealing with probabilities\u201d (Bowden 2012, 161). All participants in this debate were eager to emphasize how this decision was surrounded by uncertainty. Cautionary vagueness thus only benefits public officials if quantifying probability assessments increases blame more than it increases credit. This is plausible: some scholars posit a general negativity bias in public affairs in which blame for bad outcomes tends to stronger than credit for good outcomes (Hood 2011, 9-14). But to date, this claim has not been tested in a national security context. A second reason to question the logic of cautionary vagueness is that precise probability assessments may actually mitigate some kinds of criticism. In the case of the L\u2019Aquila earthquake, public officials were literally put on trial for making their assessments too vague. Similarly, the 2002 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq\u2019s Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction provides an example of how imprecise analysis can plausibly increase analysts\u2019 blame exposure. The bumper-sticker summary of the Iraq NIE is that the U.S. Intelligence Community thought it was a \u201cslam dunk\u201d to conclude that Saddam Hussein was pursuing nuclear weapons. But the estimate itself does not say this \u2013 in fact, the NIE\u2019s key judgments contain no direct statements about the likelihood that Iraq was developing nuclear weapons. Many key judgments refer to Iraq pursuit of \u201cweapons of mass destruction,\u201d which included biological and chemical weapons in addition to nuclear weapons. The NIE states that \u201cin the view of most agencies, Baghdad is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program,\u201d but the estimate includes a specific dissent on this point from the U.S. State Department and does not assess of the probability that this statement is true. To be sure, the information and assumptions presented in the NIE are widely mistaken, and the estimate seems designed to convince readers to believe that Iraq was actively pursuing a nuclear bomb. But this point is mostly implied: it is not stated explicitly, let alone accompanied by a clear probability assessment. Jervis (2006), among others, has thus argued that one of the most important flaws with the Iraq NIE is not just that its arguments were wrong but that the uncertainty surrounding those estimates was left vague. In hindsight, it is impossible to say how the U.S. Intelligence Community might have quantified the probability that Saddam Hussein was pursuing nuclear weapons in 2002. But even if the NIE\u2019s authors had assessed this probability to be as high as 80 percent or 90 percent, this could not have been construed after the fact as a \u201cslam dunk,\u201d and it might have generated useful debate about the sources and implications of residual doubt. Consistent with this point, post-mortem reviews of Iraq WMD intelligence written by the U.S. Senate (2004, 16), the Silberman-Robb Commission (2005, 409, 419), and the UK\u2019s Butler Review (2004, 145) all conclude that a major lesson from the episode is the need for clearer communication of uncertainty. Moreover, it is not at all obvious why numeric percentages should court more controversy than using the \u201cwords of estimative probability\u201d that are currently recommended by the U.S. Director of National Intelligence. Unless analysts constantly use the term \u201ceven chance,\u201d then employing words of estimative probability always runs a risk of falling on the wrong side of maybe. The question then becomes whether assessing a probability as \u201c65 percent\u201d would make analysts worse off than saying that some judgment is \u201clikely\u201d to be true. Again, this assumption is plausible, but unsupported by systematic evidence. Hypotheses I believe that the key questions about cautionary vagueness can be translated into six testable hypotheses. These hypotheses capture arguments about how quantifying probability assessments could either exacerbate or reduce public officials\u2019 exposure to criticism. Where relevant, I explicitly distinguish mechanisms influencing analysts versus decision makers. Following a standard distinctions in the decision sciences, I define analysts as individuals providing probability assessments and decision makers as individuals who use that information to judge prospective actions. I use the term public officials to describe both analysts and decision makers together. Hypothesis 1: Quantifying probability assessments increases criticism. Many scholars and practitioners are inherently skeptical of quantifying subjective judgments. It is thus possible that quantifying probability assessments always exposes analysts and decision makers to criticism. If true, this argument would support the argument that public officials have incentives to leave probability assessments vague. Hypothesis 2: Quantifying probability assessments increases hindsight bias. Probability assessments are especially exposed to criticism when they fall on the \u201cwrong side of maybe.\u201d Many scholars and practitioners believe that quantitative assessments suggest an illusion of rigor that may exacerbate such criticism. If true, this argument would support the argument that analysts have an incentive to leave probability assessments vague. Hypothesis 3: Quantifying probability assessments increases outcome bias. Decision makers are especially exposed to criticism when their actions are unsuccessful. Quantifying probability assessments could exacerbate such criticism by emphasizing how decision makers knowingly took risky actions. If true, this argument would support the argument that decision makers have an incentive to prefer that probability assessments be left vague. Hypothesis 4: Quantifying probability assessments increases credit given to analysts who fall on the \u201cright side of maybe.\u201d If quantifying probability assessments exposes unlucky analysts to greater criticism, then this might also facilitate credit-claiming when those assessments appear to be confirmed by subsequent events. If true, this argument would imply that analysts may not always have incentives to leave probability assessments vague. Hypothesis 5: Quantifying probability assessments increases credit given to decisions with successful outcomes. If quantifying probability assessments creates an illusion of rigor surrounding analysis and decision making, this may work to decision makers\u2019 credit when their actions are perceived to be effective. If true, this argument would imply that decision makers may not always have incentives to prefer that probability assessments be left vague. Hypothesis 6: Quantifying probability assessments expands blame more than it expands credit. If vague probability assessments entail countervailing effects with respect to blame avoidance versus credit-claiming, then a key question is whether either of these effects is clearly stronger on net. If the \u201cnegativity bias\u201d holds, such that quantifying probability assessments generally expands blame more than credit, then this would support the argument that public officials have incentives to leave probability estimates vague.", "q17": "In order to test the hypotheses, I designed a survey experiment that presents respondents with either of two descriptive vignettes. The first vignette involves a special forces mission to rescue Americans held hostage by ISIS in Iraq. The second vignette involves a drone strike targeting Al Qaeda leaders in Yemen. Each vignette involves four paragraphs describing how intelligence analysts and national security decision makers assessed uncertainty. The first paragraph describes whether the operation succeeded or failed. For the hostage rescue mission, this paragraph explains either that U.S. special forces retrieved the hostages, or that they found the hostages were not present. Either way, U.S. forces sustained casualties in conducting the mission. In the drone strike vignette, the first paragraph explains either that the attack killed three senior Al Qaeda leaders or that it had mistakenly targeted a wedding party. Either way, civilians were killed in the attack, which generated local protests. The second paragraph of each vignette describes how \u201csources involved with planning the operation stressed that it was a difficult decision that required wrestling with uncertainty.\u201d The paragraph describes several pieces of evidence on which intelligence analysts based their judgments. These pieces of evidence remain constant across scenario versions. The third paragraph of each vignette describes the probability that analysts assigned to the hostages being present, or to the targets of the drone strike being correctly identified. These assessments vary on two dimensions. First, some assessments were above fifty percent, and some were below fifty percent. Thus the scenarios randomly vary whether or not analysts proved to be on the \u201cwrong side of maybe\u201d (though the information on which they based their judgments was always presented identically). Second, some assessments are expressed using words (either \u201clikely\u201d or \u201cunlikely\u201d) and some assessments were expressed using numbers (either \u201c65 percent\u201d or \u201c35 percent\u201d). These probability assessments are each presented twice, highlighted in quotes. The third paragraph concludes with a quote from an unnamed official stating, \u201cThis was a probability thing, and we made sure to weigh the costs and benefits of this operation as thoroughly as possible.\u201d The phrasing mimics a statement reportedly made by President Obama during a debate over the bin Laden raid, and is meant to reinforce the probabilistic nature of the decision. The fourth paragraph of each vignette, which remains constant across scenario versions, presents quotes from public officials stating that \u201cwe analyzed the evidence from every angle we could think of\u201d; \u201cIn these kinds of situations, you have to be willing to take risks\u201d; and \u201cI supported this decision because I believed we could defend it no matter how the mission turned out.\u201d Each respondent will be presented with only one version of only one vignette. After reading the vignette, respondents are asked to \u201cPlease write a few sentences describing how you believe you would have reacted to the uncertainty in this scenario if it had been your decision.\u201d Then respondents are asked, \u201cBased only on the information you read in this scenario, please indicate your level of agreement with each of the following statements.\u201d The first statement is, \u201cU.S. officials made the right decision.\u201d The second statement is, \u201cThe intelligence analysis supporting this decision was sound.\u201d Levels of agreement are recorded on seven-point scales with 1 defined as \u201cStrongly Disagree,\u201d 4 defined as \u201cNeutral,\u201d and 7 defined as \u201cStrongly agree.\u201d These response measures serve as the main dependent variables capturing support or criticism for this study. Asking about levels of agreement/disagreement is intended to avoid priming respondents by directly asking about levels of \u201csupport\u201d or \u201cblame\u201d for their actions. After recording these responses, respondents receive two multiple-choice attention-check questions. The first question asks respondents to identify the outcome of the mission. The second question asks respondents to identify the probability that intelligence analysts attached to their assessment. Respondents who do not answer both questions correctly will be denied payment, and their responses will not appear in the data. After completing these attention-check questions, respondents complete a Berlin adaptive numeracy test (Cokely et al. 2012), and a short battery of demographic questions. I will conduct this experiment on Amazon MTurk, with an initial run of 2,000 respondents. This sample size is based on the following power calculation. -The experiment effectively involves four kinds of scenarios, based on a 2x2 division of (a) whether the decision was successful, and (b) whether analysts provided a favorable or unfavorable assessment. Within each scenario format, I am interested in the treatment effect of quantifying probability assessments. -With 2,000 respondents, there are 500 respondents per scenario format. I aim to identify a treatment effect of 0.5 points. If the standard deviation on each dependent variable is 2.0 (which would be a lot of variation on a 7-point scale), then I would have an 80% chance of capturing an 0.5-point treatment effect in each

Aggression\nUndergraduate Program in Psychology\nBy Evan Moloney, with Raymond Knight, Ph.D., Advisor\n\n\n\nSynopsis and goals of the study:\nSexual aggression, especially sexual harassment, has received a wealth of attention in recent years following the advent of the #MeToo movement and its push to increase protections against sexual misconduct for victims. However, this increased public focus has not been accompanied by any meteoric rise in the number or variety of empirical studies on sexual aggression. Classification of sexually inappropriate and violent behavior remains essentially the same as it was before #MeToo came to prominence. Sexual aggression is a generic term that is typically understood to comprise more specific, though often overlapping, behavioral typologies. Sexual harassment constitutes behaviors including insulting and degrading attitudes or behaviors toward women, unwanted sexual attention, and in some articles, sexual coercion (Fitzgerald, Gelfand &amp; Drasgow, 1995). Sexual coercion, in turn, corresponds to the use of verbal and physical pressuring tactics to gain sex from an unwilling victim, ranging anywhere from use of sulking and charming tactics to rape (Tyler, Hoyt &amp; Whitbeck, 1998; Knight &amp; Sims-Knight, 2011). Sexual sadism, in contrast, describes gratuitous acts of sexual violence that go beyond what is needed to gain sex, either manifested through behaviors or through fantasies (Robertson, Graham, Krstic, &amp; Knight, 2018). Although most published literature tends to treat these three sexual aggression typologies separately, more recent studies have suggested that they may share crucial commonalities that--if better understood--could highlight risk factors that may more accurately predict a person\u2019s likelihood to sexually offend (Sims-Knight &amp; Knight, 2018).\nAcross clinical psychopathology preceding and following the publication of DSM-5, researchers have advocated increased focus on dimensionality of traits and behaviors over traditional categorical classification models (e.g., Widiger &amp; Costa, 1994; Ruscio &amp; Ruscio, 2008; Zachar, 2018; Kreuger et al., 2018).The categorical nature of sexual aggression against women has been called into question (Knight, 2010), and data have shown that the presence of common risk and etiological factors may tie different \u2018types\u2019 of offender regardless of their specific offending behaviors (DeGue &amp; DiLillo, 2004). Models that explain sexual sadism, coercion, and harassment as parts of a clear dimensional structure have been empirically generated and validated (Knight, 2010; Longpre, Guay, Knight, &amp; Benbouriche, 2018; Longpre, Guay &amp; Knight, 2019; Knight, 2018). So, is sexually aggressive behavior best understood (a) as separate typologies of harassment, coercion, and sadism, (b) as an overarching latent construct of sexual aggression in which harassment, coercion, and sadism are distributed and interwoven, or (c) as a combination of an underlying shared latent trait with specific variances attributable to each of the three components?\nIn the present study we will explore which of these three models best accounted for the responses of a large sample of college students.  We administered the Multidimensional Inventory of Development, Sex and Aggression (MIDSA, 2011) to a large sample of college students.  The MIDSA is a contingency-based, computerized assessment tool that contains scales for harassment, coercion, sadism, and many external factors that are relevant to the psychological assessment of sexually aggressive behavior.  Because it encompasses the three relevant components and multiple externally validating scales, the MIDSA provides an apt vehicle both to determine the best fit model among these constructs and to explore with structural equation modeling the covariates of the resulting best fit model.  We examine each of the components in turn.\nIn the first part of the present study, we will seek to present a model of sexual aggression that accounts for both the shared variances between harassing, coercive, and agonistic offending behaviors, and the specific variance within each behavioral set. We will assess the degree of shared and specific variance of behavioral items related to sexual harassment, coercion, and sadism, and to the general factor of sexual aggression overall, using harassment, coercion, and sadism scales included within the MIDSA. We hypothesize that some behavioral items will show stronger shared variance with the sexual aggression factor than they do variance with the specific category governing their MIDSA scales. General and specific factors will be assessed through confirmatory factor analysis, in one-factor, correlated-factors, and bifactor models. We expect all models to show good fit, given the substantial research suggesting construct validity for the  behavioral typologies of sexual harassment, coercion, and sadism, and the aforementioned data that supports a shared variance between all types of sexual aggression. However, we expect that the bifactor model should best account for both the specific and shared variance within the behavioral scales in question. The bifactor model\u2019s resulting general factor will include items that are more indicative of a latent continuum, one that should include items already outlined by the Agonistic Continuum developed by Knight et al., whereas the specific factors will include items that do not fit into a broad continuum of sexual aggression.\nHypothesis I: Competing correlated-factors, one-factor, and bifactor confirmatory models of sexual aggression as measured by harassment, coercion, and sadism scales will all yield good fit, but the bifactor model will yield the best overall fit among the three.\nIn order to validate the potential models we aim to generate in this study, we will use several external validator measures drawn from MIDSA scales that do not primarily relate to sexually aggressive behaviors. Based upon prior research, we set expectations as to which MIDSA scales will best capture the domain of sexual aggression, and which will better capture only one of our expected specific factors of harassment, coercion, and the Agonistic Continuum. \nHypothesis II: Several external validator scales will covary most strongly with the bifactor model\u2019s general core factor of aggression, whereas others will covary most closely with each of its potential specific factors: the combination of harassment and coercion, and the Agonistic Continuum.\nHypothesis IIa: Several external validator scales will covary closely with the general factor of sexual aggression, including Juvenile Delinquency, Juvenile Assaultive Behavior, Adult Conduct Disorder, Adult Nonsexual Offenses.\nHypothesis IIb: Several external validator scales will covary closely with a specific factor combining sexual harassment and coercion, including Hostility toward Women and Hypermasculinity, Hypersexuality, Sexual Preoccupation, Impulsivity, the juvenile and adult drug and alcohol abuse scales, and Pornography Use.\nHypothesis IIc: Several external validator scales will covary with the specific factor of sexual sadism and paraphilic coercion that constitutes the Agonistic Continuum, including Callousness/Risk, problematic sexuality (i.e., Sexual Compulsivity and paraphilic fantasy and behavior), and Expressive Aggression.\nWe will analyze data primarily in MPlus Version 8.3. If necessary, supplementary analyses will be carried out in IBM SPSS 26 and in R version 3.6.2. \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Research Proposal v5.docx"}, "nodeId": "wxmfs", "sha256": "54e5d53600863780c7bf63d3cf2bf98ce8d7c47903a8b9eba00100e3941fbe44", "viewUrl": "/project/bkr37/files/osfstorage/5e3f1aecf1369e02668af111/", "selectedFileName": "Research Proposal v5.docx"}], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"summary": "Harassment, Coercion, and the Agonistic Continuum: Exploring the Structure of Sexual Aggression\nUndergraduate Program in Psychology\nBy Evan Moloney, with Raymond Knight, Ph.D., Advisor\n\n\n\nSynopsis and goals of the study:\nSexual aggression, especially sexual harassment, has received a wealth of attention in recent years following the advent of the #MeToo movement and its push to increase protections against sexual misconduct for victims.

Sexual coercion, in turn, corresponds to the use of verbal and physical pressuring tactics to gain sex from an unwilling victim, ranging anywhere from use of sulking and charming tactics to rape (Tyler, Hoyt &amp; Whitbeck, 1998; Knight &amp; Sims-Knight, 2011). Sexual sadism, in contrast, describes gratuitous acts of sexual violence that go beyond what is needed to gain sex, either manifested through behaviors or through fantasies (Robertson, Graham, Krstic, &amp; Knight, 2018). Although most published literature tends to treat these three sexual aggression typologies separately, more recent studies have suggested that they may share crucial commonalities that--if better understood--could highlight risk factors that may more accurately predict a person\u2019s likelihood to sexually offend (Sims-Knight &amp; Knight, 2018).\nAcross clinical psychopathology preceding and following the publication of DSM-5, researchers have advocated increased focus on dimensionality of traits and behaviors over traditional categorical classification models (e.g., Widiger &amp; Costa, 1994; Ruscio &amp; Ruscio, 2008; Zachar, 2018; Kreuger et al., 2018).The categorical nature of sexual aggression against women has been called into question (Knight, 2010), and data have shown that the presence of common risk and etiological factors may tie different \u2018types\u2019 of offender regardless of their specific offending behaviors (DeGue &amp; DiLillo, 2004). Models that explain sexual sadism, coercion, and harassment as parts of a clear dimensional structure have been empirically generated and validated (Knight, 2010; Longpre, Guay, Knight, &amp; Benbouriche, 2018; Longpre, Guay &amp; Knight, 2019; Knight, 2018). So, is sexually aggressive behavior best understood (a) as separate typologies of harassment, coercion, and sadism, (b) as an overarching latent construct of sexual aggression in which harassment, coercion, and sadism are distributed and interwoven, or (c) as a combination of an underlying shared latent trait with specific variances attributable to each of the three components?\nIn the present study we will explore which of these three models best accounted for the responses of a large sample of college students.  We administered the Multidimensional Inventory of Development, Sex and Aggression (MIDSA, 2011) to a large sample of college students.  The MIDSA is a contingency-based, computerized assessment tool that contains scales for harassment, coercion, sadism, and many external factors that are relevant to the psychological assessment of sexually aggressive behavior.  Because it encompasses the three relevant components and multiple externally validating scales, the MIDSA provides an apt vehicle both to determine the best fit model among these constructs and to explore with structural equation modeling the covariates of the resulting best fit model.  We examine each of the components in turn.\nIn the first part of the present study, we will seek to present a model of sexual aggression that accounts for both the shared variances between harassing, coercive, and agonistic offending behaviors, and the specific variance within each behavioral set. We will assess the degree of shared and specific variance of behavioral items related to sexual harassment, coercion, and sadism, and to the general factor of sexual aggression overall, using harassment, coercion, and sadism scales included within the MIDSA. We hypothesize that some behavioral items will show stronger shared variance with the sexual aggression factor than they do variance with the specific category governing their MIDSA scales. General and specific factors will be assessed through confirmatory factor analysis, in one-factor, correlated-factors, and bifactor models. We expect all models to show good fit, given the substantial research suggesting construct validity for the  behavioral typologies of sexual harassment, coercion, and sadism, and the aforementioned data that supports a shared variance between all types of sexual aggression. However, we expect that the bifactor model should best account for both the specific and shared variance within the behavioral scales in question. The bifactor model\u2019s resulting general factor will include items that are more indicative of a latent continuum, one that should include items already outlined by the Agonistic Continuum developed by Knight et al., whereas the specific factors will include items that do not fit into a broad continuum of sexual aggression.\nHypothesis I: Competing correlated-factors, one-factor, and bifactor confirmatory models of sexual aggression as measured by harassment, coercion, and sadism scales will all yield good fit, but the bifactor model will yield the best overall fit among the three.\nIn order to validate the potential models we aim to generate in this study, we will use several external validator measures drawn from MIDSA scales that do not primarily relate to sexually aggressive behaviors. Based upon prior research, we set expectations as to which MIDSA scales will best capture the domain of sexual aggression, and which will better capture only one of our expected specific factors of harassment, coercion, and the Agonistic Continuum. \nHypothesis II: Several external validator scales will covary most strongly with the bifactor model\u2019s general core factor of aggression, whereas others will covary most closely with each of its potential specific factors: the combination of harassment and coercion, and the Agonistic Continuum.\nHypothesis IIa: Several external validator scales will covary closely with the general factor of sexual aggression, including Juvenile Delinquency, Juvenile Assaultive Behavior, Adult Conduct Disorder, Adult Nonsexual Offenses.\nHypothesis IIb: Several external validator scales will covary closely with a specific factor combining sexual harassment and coercion, including Hostility toward Women and Hypermasculinity, Hypersexuality, Sexual Preoccupation, Impulsivity, the juvenile and adult drug and alcohol abuse scales, and Pornography Use.\nHypothesis IIc: Several external validator scales will covary with the specific factor of sexual sadism and paraphilic coercion that constitutes the Agonistic Continuum, including Callousness/Risk, problematic sexuality (i.e., Sexual Compulsivity and paraphilic fantasy and behavior), and Expressive Aggression.\nWe will analyze data primarily in MPlus Version 8.3. If necessary, supplementary analyses will be carried out in IBM SPSS 26 and in R version 3.6.2. \n", "uploader": [{"file_id": "5e3f1aecf1369e02668af111", "file_name": "Research Proposal v5.docx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/bkr37/files/osfstorage/5e3f1aecf1369e02668af111", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e3f1aecf1369e02668af111"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "54e5d53600863780c7bf63d3cf2bf98ce8d7c47903a8b9eba00100e3941fbe44"}}]}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=bkr37", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "bkr37", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "bkr37", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/4mqx9/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "4mqx9", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wxmfs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "wxmfs", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/bkr37/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bkr37/"}}, {"id": "udvsy", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Dehumanization-type Stereotypes as a Mediator between Generalized Racial Essentialism and Punishment", "description": "The proposed study intends to investigate the relationship between generalized racial essentialism and punishment, using dehumanization as a mediator.

As part of a preliminary study using 54 participants, animalistic dehumanization was attributed to Haitians at a greater rate than Japanese people (\u03b7p2 = 0.41). Mechanistic dehumanization was attributed to Japanese people at a greater rate than Haitians (\u03b7p2 = 0.61).

thought to boost accuracy in memory performance (Evans, Marcon, &amp; Meissner, 2009; Fisher &amp; Schreiber, 2017; Godden &amp; Baddeley, 1975; Smith &amp; Vela, 2001). This beneficial effect of context has been attributed to the overlap between encoding and retrieval cues; participants form unique item-context associations during encoding that can be triggered by context cues during retrieval (Murnane, Phelps, &amp; Malmberg, 1999; Tulving &amp; Thomson, 1973). \n\nA recent study by Doss, Picart and Gallo (2018) has argued that for this same reason, context reinstatement can also systematically distort memory: what we will refer to as the \u2018context illusion effect\u2019. In this study, we explore the extent that this illusion might extend to same and other-race faces. \n\nBlack and White participants will encode Black and White faces superimposed on background scenes (serving as context). Thereafter they will complete a retrieval task in which the faces will either be those the participant previously encoded, new faces or lure faces - faces that are similar to but not the same as previously encoded faces. Context will be reinstated at retrieval for half of the same and lure faces and switched for the other half. Face lures will be generated using Java Psychomorph software (Tiddeman &amp; Perrett, 2002). We expect that participants will falsely recognize lure faces and that this will be greater when context is reinstated than when it is switched. We also expect an interaction effect, with larger context effect for own-race than other-race faces.\n\nNote: This is an amendment (Amendment 1) to our original pre-registration. Data outcomes for White participants in the original pre-registered project suggested that the difficulty of the face memory task may compromise our ability to meaningfully interpret context reinstatement outcomes (i.e., the ability to differentiate studied and similar faces from memory was near chance in some conditions, potentially complicating our ability to draw firm conclusions from the impact of our other measured variables \u2014 race and context \u2014 on face memory). In this amendment, we have added a second study with a modified design. The only change in this experiment is that participants will complete their episodic memory task in 4 blocks rather than 1 large block, making the task easier for participants while not affecting the statistical power identified for this research question.

If this is so, we can present the following hypothesis towards the interaction of Context Reinstatement and the Own Race Bias: the impact of context will be greater on own-race faces since they would enjoy richer face-context conceptual associations. However, it is also possible that the context illusion will be greater with other-race faces than same-race faces, due to more perceptual confusions with other-race faces. Finally, it is possible that both these processes are at play and cancel eachother out. We present these as competing hypotheses towards an interaction effect. \n\n(3) The above-mentioned interaction effects will be observed even while analyzing high-confidence responses, suggesting a false memory effect rather than a guessing effect (Doss, Picart, &amp; Gallo, 2018). \n\n(4) The above-mentioned interaction effects will be the result of conceptual links formed between target faces and contexts, and not mere perceptual familiarity."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

This beneficial effect of context has been attributed to the overlap between encoding and retrieval cues; participants form unique item-context associations during encoding that can be triggered by context cues during retrieval (Murnane, Phelps, &amp; Malmberg, 1999; Tulving &amp; Thomson, 1973). \n\nA recent study by Doss, Picart and Gallo (2018) has argued that for this same reason, context reinstatement can also systematically distort memory: what we will refer to as the \u2018context illusion effect\u2019. In this study, we explore the extent that this illusion might extend to same and other-race faces. \n\nBlack and White participants will encode Black and White faces superimposed on background scenes (serving as context). Thereafter they will complete a retrieval task in which the faces will either be those the participant previously encoded, new faces or lure faces - faces that are similar to but not the same as previously encoded faces. Context will be reinstated at retrieval for half of the same and lure faces and switched for the other half. Face lures will be generated using Java Psychomorph software (Tiddeman &amp; Perrett, 2002). We expect that participants will falsely recognize lure faces and that this will be greater when context is reinstated than when it is switched. We also expect an interaction effect, with larger context effect for own-race than other-race faces.\n\nNote: This is an amendment (Amendment 1) to our original pre-registration. Data outcomes for White participants in the original pre-registered project suggested that the difficulty of the face memory task may compromise our ability to meaningfully interpret context reinstatement outcomes (i.e., the ability to differentiate studied and similar faces from memory was near chance in some conditions, potentially complicating our ability to draw firm conclusions from the impact of our other measured variables \u2014 race and context \u2014 on face memory). In this amendment, we have added a second study with a modified design.

If this is so, we can present the following hypothesis towards the interaction of Context Reinstatement and the Own Race Bias: the impact of context will be greater on own-race faces since they would enjoy richer face-context conceptual associations. However, it is also possible that the context illusion will be greater with other-race faces than same-race faces, due to more perceptual confusions with other-race faces. Finally, it is possible that both these processes are at play and cancel eachother out. We present these as competing hypotheses towards an interaction effect. \n\n(3) The above-mentioned interaction effects will be observed even while analyzing high-confidence responses, suggesting a false memory effect rather than a guessing effect (Doss, Picart, &amp; Gallo, 2018). \n\n(4) The above-mentioned interaction effects will be the result of conceptual links formed between target faces and contexts, and not mere perceptual familiarity.", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.
