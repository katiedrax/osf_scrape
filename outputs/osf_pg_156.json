For manual interception, when playing ball sports or swatting a fly, we need to accurately predict an object's motion trajectory in order hit it successfully. Accurate ocular tracking of an object's motion not only aids perception and prediction of the object's trajectory (Bennett et al., 2010; Spering et al., 2011) but also enhances manual interception (Fooken et al., 2016; de la Malla, 2017). In our natural environment, we often encounter objects that suddenly slow down or speed up. Yet, our ability to perceptually judge accelerations is relatively poor (Brouwer et al., 2002; Bennett &amp; Benguigui, 2013; Mueller et al., 2017) and humans make systematic interception errors when hitting accelerating targets (Brenner et al., 2016; Brenner &amp; Smeets 2009). In contrast, predictive eye velocity can reflect the trajectories of accelerating or decelerating targets but requires long presentations times (&gt;200 ms; e.g., Bennett et. al., 2007; Benguigui &amp; Bennett, 2010). Here we ask whether the eye and hand share the ability to predict the reappearance of accelerating or decelerating targets during manual interception.

We test whether eye and hand integrate target acceleration information across similar time scales.

After initial fixation (for a random time between 400-800 ms), the target moves with an initial velocity and a constant acceleration of -8, -4, 0, 4, or 8 m/s2 and is visible for either 200, 500, or 800 ms (presentation time) before it disappears behind an occluder (see figure). After occlusion, the target reappears for 100 ms. Participants are instructed to predict the time of reappearance of the target by performing a quick interceptive hand movement to hit the target on the screen. The occluder has a constant width and thus, occlusion times depend on the level of acceleration (800, 720, 670, 630, and 600 ms for accelerations of -8, -4, 0, 4, and 8 m/s2, respectively). Target start position and initial velocity are adjusted for each level of acceleration and presentation time so that target position and velocity at the moment of occlusion are the same for all trajectories.

For instance, it has been estimated, that by the age of 4 years, toddlers from low SES families have heard about 30 million less words than peers from higher SES families (Hart and Risley, 1995).
