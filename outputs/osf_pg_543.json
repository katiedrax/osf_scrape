This treatment addresses informational constraints such as lack of information on how and where to file the paperwork. It also addresses the behavioral barriers created by cognitive load by including easy links and holds client attention through reminders. A second treatment arm will receive reminders only. All text messages will include a note that recipients can \u201cText STOP to end messages.\u201d The control group consists of participants receiving the standard letters and automated phone calls currently in effect. \n\nThis research design answers these key questions:\n(1) can a text-messaging program reduce churn; and \n(2) do reminders drive the effects or is a reduction in cognitive load through easy to implement steps necessary to reduce churn. \n\nThe comparison of the two treatments provides evidence on whether reminders alone are beneficial or whether easing the processes and reducing the cognitive load are necessary. We will run the intervention for three months and then iterate on the texts, aiming to identify particularly promising practices. The large sample and the ability to iterate will allow us to explore whether the time of day or day of the week for texts effect their impact, as was found for parent texting;  what the optimal number of text messages is;  and whether certain groups respond differentially including groups by age, location, children, work history, and race/ethnicity.

We have only limited information on the opt-out rates, but believe that 20 percent is a conservative estimate, given opt-out from other studies. While DTA\u2019s caseload fluctuates, a conservative estimate of approximately 10,000 re-certification forms and 15,000 Interim Reports (IRs) will be due every month for SIMP-12 SNAP clients. With an opt out rate of 20 percent, we will have a monthly sample size of around 8,000 household heads (10,000 re-certification due x 80%=8,000) who will need to complete re-certification forms, and of 12,000 household heads (15,000 IRs due x 80%=12,000) who will need to complete an IR.\n\t\nGiven the nature of this project, we intend to treat the maximum number of eligible participants.

The MDE of a binary treatment comparison (C vs T1, C vs T2, or T1 vs T2) for a power of 80 percent, a significance level of 5 percent, and sample sizes of between 60 percent and a 20 percent opt out rate. We anticipate these opt-out rates are much higher than we will encounter with the intervention, since clients have already had the opportunity to opt-out of text message communication.

Media, federal and survey data undercount officer-involved shootings and contain a limited number of community, agency and situational correlates. Despite research demonstrating the correlation between adverse community characteristics such as poverty and officer involved shootings, we have limited national data on this issue. \n\nNORC at the University of Chicago and the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) will conduct a national organizational survey of law enforcement agencies (LEAs) to estimate the agency aggregated numbers of the past 10 years of police officer-involved shootings\u2014including both officers shooting at civilians and officers being shot or shot at\u2014and demographic, situational, agency, and community factors associated with these shootings. This is the first national study to assess the number of officers shooting civilians and officers being shot at in the same dataset, and to measure important correlates of these shootings using advanced analytical methods. This study addresses two important gaps: First, we do not have reliable nationally representative data to estimate the number of police officers shootings of civilians, the number of police officers being shot at, and the overlap between the two. Second, there is little research on how LEA characteristics, structure, resources, culture, policies and training are related to officer-involved shootings. \n\nWe propose three research questions. RQ1: How many civilians did police officers shoot with a firearm and how many police officers were shot at in the past ten years, total and by citizen and officer demographics and situational factors? RQ2: To what extent are agency characteristics, culture, practices and training related to the number/rate of officer-involved shootings? RQ3: Are community factors, such as local gun laws and restrictions and gun violence rates related to agency culture, policing practices and required training and to the number/rate of officer-involved shootings? RQ2 and RQ3 will be examined in terms of both overall officer-involved shootings and broken down by officer and citizen demographics and situational factors, separately for (a) officers shooting civilians and (b) officers being shot at. \n\n", "q4": "We hypothesize that:\n1) The number/rate of officers shooting citizens and officers being shot at will be positively correlated.\n2) The number/rate of officer-involved shootings will vary by citizen and officer demographics and situational factors.\n3) The rate of officer-involved shootings will vary by size/type of agencies, e.g., state police and Sheriffs will have the lowest rate of officer-involved shootings compared to local LEAs, and rates will be lower for larger agencies.\n4) Emphasis on community policing and problem oriented policing will be negatively related to officer-involved shooting.\n5) The requirement and length of training in conflict management will be negatively related to police shooting civilians.\n6) Required training and use of safety equipment will be negatively related to the number of police officers being shot and killed.\n7) Our agency-level variables will be related to police officers shooting civilians and officers being shot at.\n8) The number/rate of police shootings will be higher in places where percent minority is higher.\n9) A higher violent crime rate will be related to higher numbers of officer-involved shootings, with a possible curvilinear relationship.\n10) More gun ownership will result in more officer involved shootings.\n11) States with tighter restrictions on the purchase and use of guns and ammunition will have fewer officer-involved shootings than places with more permissive gun policies.\n12) At least part of the association between community factors and officer-involved shootings will be explained by agency policies, agency culture, and practices.\n13) Our community-level variables will be related to police officers shooting civilians and officers being shot.", "q5": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

The margin of error will be even smaller for estimates less than or greater than 50% (for a 10% prevalence we will have a narrower \u00b1 2% margin of error). We estimate that the power to detect a very small effect size at 10% difference (or an odds ratio (OR) of 1.5) between for example municipal LEAs and county LEAs (according to LEMAS 2013 data, 25% of the LEAs are county level LEAs) is 80% (assuming a two-sided test at the 95% confidence level when one of the groups has an estimated prevalence of 50%). We would have a minimum power of 99% to detect small effect sizes at a difference of 15% (or an OR of 1.8). We will have enough power to conduct subgroup differences, such as agency type, size, and region.

We will restrict the survey to publicly funded civilian LEAs that employ at least one full-time sworn officer with general arrest powers.  The LEA sample recruitment, survey administration, and data collection will be conducted via a NORC subcontract with the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF). LEAs will not be paid for participating in the survey. \n\nTo ensure that LEAs of different sizes are sufficiently represented, the sampling frame will be stratified with the top 75 largest LEAs selected with certainty. Within the second stratum, LEAs will be selected through a probability proportional to size (PPS) method with department size measured by the number of sworn officers. The key advantage of PPS is that it will lead to more efficient sample estimates to the extent that the outcome of interest is correlated with agency size. We will require a sample of about 1,500 LEAs to achieve our goal of 1,000 LEAs (70% participation rate) with complete survey data.  The sample will be weighted such that it is representative of all state and local LEAs in the U.S., adjusting for non-response. \n\nLEAs will be sent an initial cover letter explaining the survey and a hard copy survey by mail. The LEA may take the survey online or by hard copy. Follow-up calls and email reminders will be sent to non-respondents during the period of data collection.\n\nWe will also explore the potential use of existing datasets, such as UCR, local gun law and regulation, and census data, for measures of agency and community correlates, and merge it with our national survey data when possible.
