BI methods involve hierarchical empirical priors derived from non-experimental data and from expert elicitation performed prior to the study.

An important but less studied dimension of RR is the ability to win citizen support and to join the protests. Citizen support for protests is important for three reasons. First, it can increase the attention the protest receives. Second, it can pressure the regime to cater to the protesters demands and reduce. Third, more support will lead to greater willingness to join the protests. RR literature emphasizes that the strategy should increase public support by framing the dissent as less likely to be punished and as less extremist.

The co-optation can reduce support through three channels. First, it could increase the perceived probability that the protests will be suppressed. Second, it could increase the perception that the protests are not justified. Third, it could increase the perception that the protest cannot garner support large enough to protect individuals from risks, thus, reducing their willingness to join the protest. At the same time, we recognize two factors that could mediate the impact of RR. First, it might be the identity of the endorser (village leader versus urban dissident) or the message (rightful versus non-rightful) that impacts support. Second, the impact of frame on willingness to protest may operate through sentiment towards the protest or through perception of willingness of government to repress.

in local decision-making processes. Burkina Faso has experienced an impressive mining boom over the last decade, with mining companies typically investing selectively in local public infrastructures and social services. Over the same period, Burkina Faso has taken numerous attempts to strengthen the role and capacity of municipal governments to provide welfare services to local populations. What do these simultaneous processes signal to local communities about the quality and legitimacy of their municipal government? Do social investments by mining companies improve or worsen citizens\u2019 perception of their municipal government? And do mining companies\u2019 social investments increase or decrease citizens\u2019 willingness to engage in local governance? Ex ante, it is plausible that social investments could either increase or decrease government legitimacy and citizen engagement. Social investment by mining companies may be considered as partial \u201csubstitutes\u201d for the investments citizens expect from and for which they see their local government as being responsible for. By attributing relatively less social investments to their government, citizens may expect to gain less from individual participation in local governance. On the other hand, social investments by mining companies could be perceived as the result of successful government negotiation and leveraging of resources provided by mining projects for local development. This could strengthen government legitimacy beliefs and increase citizens\u2019 expected gains from participation in local governance. We will test these hypotheses using a survey experiment conducted on a random sample of household heads living within a 20km radius from two purposely selected large-scale mining companies operating in Burkina Faso that have both invested in social infrastructure and services in the past. Specifically, we test whether priming citizens\u2019 to think of social investments made by mining companies as opposed to municipal governments affects citizens\u2019 legitimating beliefs, their interest to participate in local decision-making processes and their actual participation in a training workshop on citizen participation."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Welfare service investments by municipal governments are assumed to signal the availability of resources, the capacity and the willingness to provide for local populations. 1.

Concretely, we will prime respondents through an audio podcast that narrates an entertaining short story about a fictive but comparable resource-rich village. Surveyors will then invite respondents to listen to one randomly selected version of the audio podcast.

In group 2, the actor that has invested is not the mining company, but the municipal government.

A follow-up question will serve to measure who respondents believe is responsible for the investments. Group 4 will receive neither information on the infrastructure, nor on the investment. We are interested in the priming effect of hearing about social investments by mining companies versus their own municipal government on citizens\u2019 perceptions of the quality and legitimacy of municipal government and their willingness to participate in local governance. We have multiple measures of each outcome, and also questions designed to assess whether the effect of the podcast on perceptions of governance is driven by prior experiences, perceptions and satisfaction with government, mining company and presumed negotiation power between the two actors: Directly after hearing the podcast, respondents will be asked about whether they are satisfied with and trust the local government in the fictive village; and about whether they perceive the fictive government as effective; and about who they think citizens in the fictive village should ask for help in case the infrastructure is damaged. Then, we will ask respondents about the performance, the effectiveness, the satisfaction and trust in their own municipal government. Also, we ask whether they would vote again for the same party, whether they would participate in a town hall meeting next month and whether they are interested to attend the townhall-meeting on citizen engagement the week after to which we will invite them. Finally, we will measure whether they actually attend the workshop. We will test hypotheses 1 by comparing outcomes in Group 2 to outcomes in Group 4.

Yet we know little about how these intermediary actors function, particularly which local demands they are most responsive to. What are the determinants of broker responsiveness to clients?

We test these expectations through a conjoint survey experiment, administered to a representative sample of 629 slum leaders across 110 slums in two Indian cities.

Existing literature provides the theoretical expectations for the first two traits. Specifically, existing literature expects brokers to privilege co-ethnic and co-partisan clients. These expectations are formalized in the following two hypotheses: H1: Ethnicity: Co-ethnic residents (in our setting defined along the lines of jati (caste), religion, and region of origin) are preferred to non-co-ethnic residents. H2: Partisanship: Co-partisan residents are preferred to non-co-partisan residents. Additionally, both co-investigators have conducted extensive qualitative fieldwork among the urban poor in India. Based on this fieldwork, we derived additional hypotheses of client characteristics likely to inform broker responsiveness. In particular, we theorize that brokers seek to cultivate locally positive reputations in order to build a following, and this incentivizes them to privilege particular types of residents. Specifically, we argue that brokers will privilege residents who are seen as locally needy as well as those who are socially embedded within the slum settlement. Helping such residents is most likely to generate and spread positive reputations of the brokers within their settlement. We measure these expectations in two ways: H3: Need: Residents in low-status jobs are preferred to residents in high-status jobs. H4: Centrality: H4a: Residents whose occupations endow them with social network centrality are preferred to those whose occupations do not. H4b: Residents who have resided in the settlement for a number of years will be preferred to those who are relatively new arrivals.

The expectation of targeting co-ethnics and co-partisans arises out of theories of clientelism privileging the importance of monitoring client reciprocity. Yet such monitoring is difficult in densely populated slums, not to mention a country like India with a robust secret ballot.

For these reasons, we anticipate brokers to prioritize client need and network centrality over co-ethnicity (especially based on narrow ethnic categories such as caste). Finally our neighbor experiment facilitates two kinds of comparisons. First, it allows us to examine the determinants of broker preferences along two dimensions: who to help within the settlement vs. who to let into the settlement to begin with.

We also compare the results of the neighbor experiment with a similar experiment conducted among slum residents in 2015. Here we expect that slum leaders are likely to place greater emphasis on shared partisanship, and lower emphasis on shared ethnicity than slum residents.

Global alcohol-attributable violence is estimated to account for 248,000 annual deaths, and observational studies frequently find alcohol consumption to be positively correlated with homicides.

The administrative data consists of brawl reports from 2014 onward collected by the Security and Justice Secretariat of the city of Bogot\u00e1, which we have referred to as the NUSE database. We will also use records from the Statistical, Criminal, Contravention and Operational Information System (SIEDCO) from the National Police that measure other violent events in the city. Merged with client records from Bavaria, we can measure reported brawls in and around the street segments where the bar is located, given that both sources are geocoded. These data will provide measures for a number of primary outcomes: 1) violent brawls per police quadrant; 2) violent brawls per street segment; and 3) other violent events in both street segments and police quadrants in Bogot\u00e1. Given the available administrative data, we will estimate the effects of the intervention on brawls using a difference-in-differences specification.
