Does assimilation reduce negative attitudes toward immigrants, or are they likely to persist even when immigrants demonstrate a desire to adopt dominant linguistic and cultural practices? To answer these questions, we present a research design for a novel field experiment in Germany, where the issue of immigration has become increasingly salient following the large influx of refugees from protracted conflicts in the Middle East. The experiment is designed to observe host population behavior towards immigrants in the context of common day-to-day, one-shot interactions with strangers. We focus on how host populations reward or sanction both immigrants and fellow natives for the adherence to or violation of social norms.

More assistance will be offered to Germans than to immigrants. 2. Larger social distance measured by language and cultural symbols will result in more discrimination/more negative assessment of immigrants. This implies that: 2a. More assistance will be offered to immigrants who speak German than to immigrants who speak a foreign language. 2b. More assistance will be offered to immigrants who do not wear of hijab than to immigrants who wear a hijab. 2c. More assistance should be given to immigrants who wear a cross than to immigrants who wear a hijab. 3. Immigrants who enforce the anti-littering norm (\"norm assimilation'') will receive more assistance than immigrants who do not enforce the norm. 4. An immigrant who speaks German but wears a hijab might receive more or less assistance than an immigrant who wears a cross but speaks Arabic; but in both of these cases the immigrant will receive less assistance than an immigrant who wears a cross (i.e. no hijab) and speaks German. 5. Social distance exercises a moderating influence on the effects of norm assimilation. Immigrants who enforce the norm but wear a hijab and/or speak a foreign language will receive less assistance than immigrants who enforce the norm and do no wear a hijab and/or speak German. 6. If norm-enforcement by an immigrant is not perceived as a signal of cultural assimilation but rather a threat by an out-group member towards the in-group, then norm enforcement could backfire and reduce assistance to the immigrant (controlling for social distance). 7. The effect of norm-assimilation could be smaller or larger than the effect of language-assimilation. III. Heterogeneous Treatment Effects A separate analysis using the data from this experiment consists of testing whether baseline levels of assistance to norm enforcers---either immigrants or Germans---vary inversely to external temperature. Excessively hot temperatures are expected to induce aggression, which should manifest itself as lower pro-sociality toward others. As in previous sections of this pre-analysis plan, we omit a full discussion of the theory underlying this hypothesis, but our expectations are in line with previous studies of the socio-biological determinants of pro-sociality. 1. Temperature: Temperature variation is exogenous and orthogonal to all other treatment conditions.

(Schaeffer 2014; Van der Meer and Tolsma 2014; Alesina, Baqir, and Easterly 1999; Alesina, Devleeschauwer, et al. 2003; Costa and Kahn 2003; Putnam 2007). A few reasons have been advanced: cooperation in diverse communities might be hindered by prejudice and outgroup discrimination, by cultural differences and disagreement concerning norms and preferred outcomes, or by weak social networks and difficulties in communication and social control across ethnic groups (Habyarimana et al. 2009; Koopmans and Veit 2014; Kimenyi 2006; Algan, H \u0301emet, and Laitin 2011; Miguel and Gugerty 2005; Lieberman and McClendon 2013; Enos and Gidron 2016). However, ethnically diverse communities are often also poor communities, and thus diffused poverty, rather than ethnoracial diversity, might be at the basis of their lower cooperative capacity (Robert J. Sampson and Groves 1989; Robert J. Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls 1997; Robert J Sampson 2012; Bruinsma et al. 2013; Abascal and Baldassarri 2015). Recent behavioral research suggests that scarcity produces a specific mind-set: in particular, people who are subjected to the stress of poverty 1) tend to discount the future more than people who do not live in conditions of chronic disadvantage, and 2) suffer from cognitive burden (Banerjee and Duflo 2011; Mani et al. 2013; Mullainathan and Shafir 2013; Haushofer and Fehr 2014). Here we theorize that these effects of poverty may influence cooperative behavior, as poor individuals might discard the future benefits of cooperation, and might be more erratic in their decision-making. In addition, poverty may also affect expectations: poor people might be considered less reliable cooperation partners, and might have fewer opportunities to participate in cooperative endeavors in the first place. In sum, poverty, as well as diversity, may be related to lower levels of cooperation. We turn to an experimental design to disentangle these two factors. To test various hypotheses concerning the relative effect of ethnic diversity and poverty on cooperative behavior we developed a cooperative investment game and experimentally manipulate the identity of the interaction partner along racial and income lines. In addition, we compare behaviors in the cooperative investment game and a dictator game to distinguish between an underlying discriminatory bias against racial out-groups (and the poor) and discriminatory behavior based on expectations about alter\u2019s behavior. Taken together, our results will contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms that bring about cooperation in diverse communities. Given that poor people often live in communities that are both poor and racially diverse, our research findings might have far-reaching consequences for overall cooperation levels in contemporary societies."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "We will test hypotheses concerning the causal effect of alter\u2019s gender, income, and race in a bilateral cooperative investment task. Our major hypotheses concern the causal effect of alter\u2019s identity \u2013 namely his/her ethnicity and economic status \u2013 on ego\u2019s cooperative behavior. First of all, we expect that participants matched with a \u2018poor\u2019 alter will be less likely to invest. We speculate that this is because poor people tend to be more present-biased, while cooperation typically requires foresight and appreciation of future gains. Assuming that participants are (intuitively) aware of this, they will be more hesitant to invest when interacting with poor rather than rich subjects. Based on previous observational research, we also expect to find a lower propensity to invest in the cooperative game when participants are matched to Black partners. Lower levels of cooperation with ethnic minorities can be due to a variety of reasons, from imbued prejudice towards them (e.g., dislike of Blacks) to specific expectations about minorities\u2019 strategic behavior in cooperative contexts. If negative feelings toward Blacks were driving behavior, we would find lower contributions to Black partners in the dictator game and also find that contributions in the dictator game largely predict behavior in the cooperative investment game. In contrast, if lower cooperation is mainly due to expectations about Blacks\u2019 behavior, then we need to figure out whether these negative expectations are related to ethnicity per se \u2013 i.e., the belief that Blacks are unreliable \u2013 or whether ethnicity is used as a proxy for other factors, such as poverty. In particular, it is possible that part of the discriminatory behavior toward Blacks is driven by considerations regarding the economic conditions of most Blacks. In the latter case, varying information about the economic conditions may affect these expectations. Our research design, allowing us to compare cooperation with high- and low-income Blacks and Whites is mainly intended to address this aspect. Namely, if ethnicity is simply a proxy of economic conditions, we expect that there are no differences in levels of cooperation towards Blacks and Whites once we consider their income status. In contrast, if negative expectations about Blacks exist, beyond economic considerations, we would find that blacks elicit less cooperation than Whites who are in their same income category."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "In order to measure cooperation, we developed a cooperative investment game. In the cooperative investment game, participants are given an endowment, and will have to decide whether they want to keep the endowment, or whether they want to invest their endowment. Keeping the endowment results in participants having the amount paid out immediately. Investing promises a 33% return on their investment after a two weeks wait. This return is only realized if alter chooses to invest, too, however. If the partner chooses not to invest, participants lose 20% of their endowment and still have to wait two weeks to be paid. However, our cooperative investment game adds a time dimension to what is basically a stag-hunt game (Skyrms 2004). This time dimension captures the extent to which individuals tend to discount future gains in favor of an immediate reward. According to recent psychological research (Mullainathan and Shafir 2013; Mani et al. 2013; Haushofer and Fehr 2014), this \u2018present bias\u2019 is quite common among the poor, and, we argue, could be at the origin of their reduced propensity to cooperate. The game was intentionally constructed this way to give us a measure of cooperation that sensitively depends on expectations about alter\u2019s willingness to cooperate, but also to reflect the fact that many real-life cooperation situations involve a time dimension. In terms of data analysis, all hypotheses will be tested using OLS. For the cooperative investment game, we will additionally provide probit estimates. We use heteroskedasticity-robust (White) standard errors to account for the fact that our treatment groups will most likely be slightly unbalanced (as we use a simple randomisation procedure, where participants are allocated to conditions as they arrived) (Samii and Aronow 2012). We will control for pre-treatment characteristics of our subjects (sex, age, race, education, income, household size, occupation) to improve the precision of our estimates. We will test hypotheses concerning the causal effect of our treatments, as well as gather empirical evidence from observational data, and estimate heterogenous treatment effects for subgroups of our sample. Our major hypotheses concern the causal effect of alter\u2019s identity \u2013 namely his/her ethnicity and economic status \u2013 on ego\u2019s cooperative behavior. First of all, we expect that participants matched with a \u2018poor\u2019 alter will be less likely to invest. We speculate that this is because poor people tend to be more present-biased, while cooperation typically requires foresight and appreciation of future gains. Assuming that participants are (intuitively) aware of this, they will be more hesitant to invest when interacting with poor rather than rich subjects. Based on previous observational research, we also expect to find a lower propensity to invest in the cooperative game when participants are matched to Black partners.

A few reasons have been advanced: cooperation in diverse communities might be hindered by prejudice and outgroup discrimination, by cultural differences and disagreement concerning norms and preferred outcomes, or by weak social networks and difficulties in communication and social control across ethnic groups (Habyarimana et al. 2009; Koopmans and Veit 2014; Kimenyi 2006; Algan, H \u0301emet, and Laitin 2011; Miguel and Gugerty 2005; Lieberman and McClendon 2013; Enos and Gidron 2016). However, ethnically diverse communities are often also poor communities, and thus diffused poverty, rather than ethnoracial diversity, might be at the basis of their lower cooperative capacity (Robert J. Sampson and Groves 1989; Robert J. Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls 1997; Robert J Sampson 2012; Bruinsma et al. 2013; Abascal and Baldassarri 2015). Recent behavioral research suggests that scarcity produces a specific mind-set: in particular, people who are subjected to the stress of poverty 1) tend to discount the future more than people who do not live in conditions of chronic disadvantage, and 2) suffer from cognitive burden (Banerjee and Duflo 2011; Mani et al. 2013; Mullainathan and Shafir 2013; Haushofer and Fehr 2014). Here we theorize that these effects of poverty may influence cooperative behavior, as poor individuals might discard the future benefits of cooperation, and might be more erratic in their decision-making. In addition, poverty may also affect expectations: poor people might be considered less reliable cooperation partners, and might have fewer opportunities to participate in cooperative endeavors in the first place. In sum, poverty, as well as diversity, may be related to lower levels of cooperation. We turn to an experimental design to disentangle these two factors. To test various hypotheses concerning the relative effect of ethnic diversity and poverty on cooperative behavior we developed a cooperative investment game and experimentally manipulate the identity of the interaction partner along racial and income lines. In addition, we compare behaviors in the cooperative investment game and a dictator game to distinguish between an underlying discriminatory bias against racial out-groups (and the poor) and discriminatory behavior based on expectations about alter\u2019s behavior. Taken together, our results will contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms that bring about cooperation in diverse communities. Given that poor people often live in communities that are both poor and racially diverse, our research findings might have far-reaching consequences for overall cooperation levels in contemporary societies.", "q16": "We will test hypotheses concerning the causal effect of alter\u2019s gender, income, and race in a bilateral cooperative investment task.

We know a fair amount about the mechanisms that favor cooperation in homogeneous communities. Indeed, most theories of collective action and social capital are based on the assumption of homogeneous communities and close-knit social networks. In small, homogeneous groups, cooperation is likely to emerge through a variety of mechanisms, among which direct and indirect reciprocity, reputation, and peer sanctioning. However, we now live in complex, diverse societies, characterized by differentiation, and individualization. How do we still manage to get along, at least most of the time? Does ethnic diversity undermine solidarity and cooperation, as claimed by a large scholarship based on observational evidence? Are the micro-level mechanisms that work in homogeneous societies less effective in heterogeneous ones? And what makes cooperation in heterogeneous communities difficult? Is it absence of solidarity toward out-group members, or greater uncertainty about alters' behavior, or a reduced capacity to pass information, communicate, and / or sanction? How do people deal with in- and out-group distinctions? Does in-group solidarity extent to the out-group (and develop prosocial behavior toward a generalized other\"), or does in-group cohesion go hand in hand with out-group exclusion? To answer these questions, we perform lab-in-the-field experiments sampling our subject participants from the Italian and immigrant population of the metropolitan city of Milan."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "For Italians, Moroccan immigrants, and Filipino immigrants residing in Milan, we are interested in (1) whether individuals discriminate between co-ethnics vs. non-co-ethnics in terms of generosity and (2) trust (only for Italians), (3) in terms of perceptions of threat (only for Italians), (4) beliefs about competency, and (5) whether individuals cooperate better in homogenous than ethnically mixed groups, (6) and under different types of sanctioning regimes (peer vs. institutionalized sanctioning). Lastly, we also examine how opinion formation and participation in community meetings differ in homogenous vs. heterogeneous groups ."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "To test for discrimination in terms of generosity and trust, we will implement dictator and trust games in which we vary the ethnic identity of alter (either co-ethnic or non-co-ethnic). In the trust games, we also elicit beliefs about the trustworthiness of co-ethnic vs. non-co-ethnic alter. To measure perceptions of threat among Italians, we will implement a threat game (developed by Max Schaub). In addition, to measure beliefs about competency, we implement a new logic puzzle. To measure the effect of co-ethnicity on cooperation, we implement six person public goods games with different ethnic compositions: (a) Homogenous: all Italians, all Moroccan, all Filipino (b) Mixed v1: 3 Italians + 3 Moroccan (c) Mixed v2: 4 Italians + 2 Moroccans; 4 Italians + 2 Filipino (d) Mixed v3: 5 Italians + 1 Moroccan There different versions of the public goods game will be played. - Baseline: 8 contribution rounds, feedback after each round, no punishment is allowed - Peer Punishment: same as baseline, but starting in round 3 players can assign punishment points to others in the group. Punishment points cost 1 unit of the player\u2019s own earnings, and result in a deduction of 3 units to the target. - Monitor Punishment: same as baseline, but starting at round 3, one player is randomly chosen to serve as a monitor for the rest of the game. The monitor continues to make contribution decisions as a member of the group, but also has the power to assign punishment points to any other players in the game. Punishment points cost 1 unit from the public pot, and result in a deduction of 3 units to the target. We will cross match each version of the PGG to each type of group composition.

We know a fair amount about the mechanisms that favor cooperation in homogeneous communities. Indeed, most theories of collective action and social capital are based on the assumption of homogeneous communities and close-knit social networks. In small, homogeneous groups, cooperation is likely to emerge through a variety of mechanisms, among which direct and indirect reciprocity, reputation, and peer sanctioning. However, we now live in complex, diverse societies, characterized by differentiation, and individualization. How do we still manage to get along, at least most of the time? Does ethnic diversity undermine solidarity and cooperation, as claimed by a large scholarship based on observational evidence? Are the micro-level mechanisms that work in homogeneous societies less effective in heterogeneous ones? And what makes cooperation in heterogeneous communities difficult? Is it absence of solidarity toward out-group members, or greater uncertainty about alters' behavior, or a reduced capacity to pass information, communicate, and / or sanction? How do people deal with in- and out-group distinctions? Does in-group solidarity extent to the out-group (and develop prosocial behavior toward a generalized other\"), or does in-group cohesion go hand in hand with out-group exclusion? To answer these questions, we perform lab-in-the-field experiments sampling our subject participants from the Italian and immigrant population of the metropolitan city of Milan.", "q16": "For Italians, Moroccan immigrants, and Filipino immigrants residing in Milan, we are interested in (1) whether individuals discriminate between co-ethnics vs. non-co-ethnics in terms of generosity and (2) trust (only for Italians), (3) in terms of perceptions of threat (only for Italians), (4) beliefs about competency, and (5) whether individuals cooperate better in homogenous than ethnically mixed groups, (6) and under different types of sanctioning regimes (peer vs. institutionalized sanctioning). Lastly, we also examine how opinion formation and participation in community meetings differ in homogenous vs. heterogeneous groups .", "q17": "To test for discrimination in terms of generosity and trust, we will implement dictator and trust games in which we vary the ethnic identity of alter (either co-ethnic or non-co-ethnic). In the trust games, we also elicit beliefs about the trustworthiness of co-ethnic vs. non-co-ethnic alter. To measure perceptions of threat among Italians, we will implement a threat game (developed by Max Schaub). In addition, to measure beliefs about competency, we implement a new logic puzzle. To measure the effect of co-ethnicity on cooperation, we implement six person public goods games with different ethnic compositions: (a) Homogenous: all Italians, all Moroccan, all Filipino (b) Mixed v1: 3 Italians + 3 Moroccan (c) Mixed v2: 4 Italians + 2 Moroccans; 4 Italians + 2 Filipino (d) Mixed v3: 5 Italians + 1 Moroccan There different versions of the public goods game will be played. - Baseline: 8 contribution rounds, feedback after each round, no punishment is allowed - Peer Punishment: same as baseline, but starting in round 3 players can assign punishment points to others in the group. Punishment points cost 1 unit of the player\u2019s own earnings, and result in a deduction of 3 units to the target. - Monitor Punishment: same as baseline, but starting at round 3, one player is randomly chosen to serve as a monitor for the rest of the game. The monitor continues to make contribution decisions as a member of the group, but also has the power to assign punishment points to any other players in the game. Punishment points cost 1 unit from the public pot, and result in a deduction of 3 units to the target. We will cross match each version of the PGG to each type of group composition. For instance, 1/3 of homogenous Italian groups will play the baseline version of the PGG, 1/3 will play the peer punishment version, and 1/3 will play the monitor punishment version. Lastly, to measure how opinion formation/convergence in small group settings is shaped by the ethnic composition of the group, we implement a new task, in which participants are asked to rank the three most important (political) issues for them as citizens of Milan.

While there were 6.1 homicide victims per 100,000 population on average around the world in 2018, Latin America recorded almost three times this rate, with 17.2 victims per 100,000. Survey data indicates that, on average, 20 percent of the population in every Latin American country has been a victim of crime in the past 12 months, and concerns about security have shown high salience among citizens in these countries (Muggah and Tobon, 2018; Perez, 2015). Although criminal violence ranks as a crucial issue for citizens' concerns in Latin America, as a field, political science has not yet paid sufficient attention to the changes of political attitudes and behavior brought by a rise in crime on new democracies. \n\nIn this pre-analysis plan, I discuss a set of experiments specifically designed to understand citizens' preferences for security policies and to describe how past experiences of crime victimization and income inequality shape citizens' strategic decision-making on preferences for security. How do citizens make strategic decisions about security policies on violent democracies? Does exposure to crime affect citizens' willingness to prefer more public investment in security? Does income inequality explain strategic decision-making in voter support for protection? How do concerns about crime enter into the electoral arena, and to which degree does crime exposure, and income differences explain the support for tough-on-crime policies? These are some of the questions I answer with these experiments.\n\nTo derive my hypotheses, I use a model that develops micro-level foundations to understand individual preferences for security, and how crime exposure and income heterogeneity affect citizens' strategic decisions.  I argue that the theoretical and methodological challenges of explaining individual-level decisions to support more protection from the State bear striking similarities to the economic models describing welfare preferences. Economic models of welfare provisions assume individuals shape their choices by considering the social policies' redistributive and insurance effects. Existing models of welfare preferences argue that individuals decide their level of support for social systems considering: i) the net impact between paying taxes and receiving social policies provision by the State (Meltzer and Richard, 1981; Rueda and Stegmueller, 2015;Lupu  and  Pontusson,  2011), and ii) how much protection one needs from the State to counteract uncertainty of an exogenous income loss due to fluctuation of the labor market (Moene and Wallerstein, 2001; Iversen and Soskice, 2001; Rehm, 2016. I propose a framework that expands on this logic behind welfare models to understand individuals' preferences for protection when concerns about crime affect their strategic decisions. Although I work on a general theory of preferences for protection, the empirical work focus in Brazil, a textbook case of a violent democracy.\n\nThe plan describes two online experiments embedded in a national online survey in Brazil. The first experiment measure respondents' sensitivity to protection as a consequence of spatial information about crime, income inequality, and population. The survey presents the respondent with a short vignette and three maps varying the distribution of crime, income, and the city's population. Faced with the three treatments, I ask the respondents to act as a social planner deciding the location of six police stations on this map. The survey measures the area in the map of the police stations under the three distinctive treatment conditions, which I use as a latent measure to understand how information about crime, income, and population shape how people make strategic decisions about police allocation. \n\nThe second experiment estimates the willingness-to-invest on public protection. I employ a paired conjoint analysis in which two police stations are presented simultaneously to respondents; these stations vary on some key institutional features and sociodemographic features of the area in which the station is located. These dimensions are theoretically motivated by the insurance model. After showing the paired stations, respondents will be asked to decide i) how much, from a limited budget, they would invest in each station in order to reduce crime; ii) how much, from a limited budget, they would invest in each station in order to reward excellent performance of the station, iii)  which station the respondent would prefer to have close to her residency.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-09T14:11:30.640571", "date_modified": "2020-04-09T14:08:36.056796", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["Crime Victimization", "Income inequality", "Survey Experiments", "Violence"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "6af28c7ef48a94cd295969fc46a04eb5980458c6aef8de01d6fd9c9d9a098d5ddb6befbd126ccd0471fe9f4c208c4acd72b32039657b1032c669973b0844fdaec08a817d8dde198805224989316fe1cfe9e86ad9bb939e1f3f5366380f489454df26b607a12afd6783e632cf8ee086f4b31bf3fd7f6a2082e8f5540d4b06a8e225ec670fd930737f5907c4157e5f27f5", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-09T14:11:30.615474", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Tiago Ventura"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "## Experiment I: Preferences for Police Allocation\n\nSee section 4 of the PAP for a complete exposition of the hypothesis. \n\nIn this first instrument, I design a framing experiment to capture the micro-level incentives of the insurance model for preferences toward protection. I analyze whether being exposed to information about crime, income inequality (property price), and population affects the respondents' sensitivity to the allocation of public security goods. I expose respondents to a vignette and a hypothetical map colored with three factors: crime rate, income, and population. The experiment uses the same map for all three conditions, only varying the description of the information depicted in the map in each treatment condition. \n\nBefore the respondents see the treatments on a map, the experiment provides a short vignette explaining the map and the task. The respondents assigned the crime and property price condition to receive a vignette about the high incidence of crime in Brazil. In contrast, the respondents assigned to the property price condition will read a vignette highlighting how income inequality works as an explanatory factor for the crime rate in Brazil. The population treatment group reads a vignette depicting only the instructions of the experiment. \n\n\nThe respondents receive a fixed number of police stations to complete the task. I will then collect the location of where the respondents placed the station, considering the distribution of crime, property price, and population. This provides an approximation for the micro-level incentives depicted in the theoretical model. \n\nThe outcome of interest for the experiment is the number of police stations placed in each of the three area colored areas on the map. Therefore, using the population map as a control group, the experiment measures the weight of information about crime, and insurance aspects on the decision to increase police allocation in each area. The same logic can be extracted from the comparison between the income inequality maps and the population map. In other words, the experiment approximates to what extent people drive their decision about police allocation considering insurance and income effects. \n\n## Hypotheses: Experiment 1. \n\nI expect crime and income to positively affect the respondent's decision when asked to act as a social planner in this experiment. Therefore: \n\nHypothesis 1 - Insurance effects: Respondents will allocate more police stations to areas with a high crime rate, compared to areas with a high population in the population map. \n\nHypothesis 2 - Redistributive effects: Respondents will allocate more police stations to areas with high property prices, compared to areas with a high population in the population map. \n\nMy theory also provides expectations for heterogeneous effects, conditional on respondents' crime victimization. In other words, victimization increases insurance concerns and affects the willingness to use police forces for protection. I also expect similar predictions for respondents who reported greater support for tough-on-crime policies in the earlier crime treatment. Therefore:\n\n Hypothesis 3 - Conditional Effects for Crime Victimization\n H3a: Crime victimization and high fear of crime at the respondent level will increase the allocation of police stations in areas with a high crime rate, compared to areas with a high population in the population map. \n \nHypothesis 4 -  Conditional Effects for Punitive Preferences: Respondents with more punitive preferences will increase the allocation of police stations in areas with a high crime rate, compared to areas with a high population in the population map.\n        \nThe second micro-level predictor of my theory expects redistributive concerns - how much one has to protect and the cost of police protection - to explain greater willingness among wealthier respondents to invest in the police. This effect will appear in both the income and crime map. In the former, wealthier individuals will protect their assets, while in the later, these individuals will use police to target areas with high crime. I am agnostic regarding which effect prediction will be larger. Therefore: \n    \nHypothesis 5 -  Conditional Effects for Income:\nH5a: Wealthier respondents will increase the allocation of police stations in areas with high property prices, compared to areas with a high population in the population map.\n H5b: Wealthier respondents will increase the allocation of police stations in areas with a high crime rate, compared to areas with a high population in the population map.\n \n\nFinally, following the model directly, I also expect income to increase the effects of victimization.     \n    \nHypothesis 6 - Conditional Effects for Victimization and Income Inequality: Victimization  will increase the conditional effects for income\n H6a: Wealthier respondents who were a victim of a crime in the last 12 months will show positive and greater effects for the allocation of stations in high crime and high property price areas.  \n\n## Experiment II: Willingness-to-invest in Police Protection\n \nSee section 6 of the PAP for a full exposition of the hypotheses. \n\nI use a conjoint experiment with paired profiles of police stations to investigate the willingness to pay for protection, as well as perceptions of the effectiveness of the police, conditional on police institution's features. In this design, respondents are simultaneously exposed to two police stations varying on six distinct features, with three levels for each of the features. Political scientists have increasingly employed conjoint analysis because of the simultaneous estimation of the treatment effects allowed by this design, namely identifying which combination of attributes is favored over others. The randomization across the levels of the choices allows for an easy identification of the average effect of each component under a condition of multidimensional choice, which replicates how people usually make political decisions in real life. Each respondent will repeat the task two times.  \n\nThe profile for each police station varies in two main dimensions.

"}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Tiago Ventura", "q2": "## Experiment I: Preferences for Police Allocation\n\nSee section 4 of the PAP for a complete exposition of the hypothesis. \n\nIn this first instrument, I design a framing experiment to capture the micro-level incentives of the insurance model for preferences toward protection. I analyze whether being exposed to information about crime, income inequality (property price), and population affects the respondents' sensitivity to the allocation of public security goods. I expose respondents to a vignette and a hypothetical map colored with three factors: crime rate, income, and population. The experiment uses the same map for all three conditions, only varying the description of the information depicted in the map in each treatment condition. \n\nBefore the respondents see the treatments on a map, the experiment provides a short vignette explaining the map and the task. The respondents assigned the crime and property price condition to receive a vignette about the high incidence of crime in Brazil. In contrast, the respondents assigned to the property price condition will read a vignette highlighting how income inequality works as an explanatory factor for the crime rate in Brazil. The population treatment group reads a vignette depicting only the instructions of the experiment. \n\n\nThe respondents receive a fixed number of police stations to complete the task. I will then collect the location of where the respondents placed the station, considering the distribution of crime, property price, and population. This provides an approximation for the micro-level incentives depicted in the theoretical model. \n\nThe outcome of interest for the experiment is the number of police stations placed in each of the three area colored areas on the map. Therefore, using the population map as a control group, the experiment measures the weight of information about crime, and insurance aspects on the decision to increase police allocation in each area. The same logic can be extracted from the comparison between the income inequality maps and the population map. In other words, the experiment approximates to what extent people drive their decision about police allocation considering insurance and income effects. \n\n## Hypotheses: Experiment 1. \n\nI expect crime and income to positively affect the respondent's decision when asked to act as a social planner in this experiment. Therefore: \n\nHypothesis 1 - Insurance effects: Respondents will allocate more police stations to areas with a high crime rate, compared to areas with a high population in the population map. \n\nHypothesis 2 - Redistributive effects: Respondents will allocate more police stations to areas with high property prices, compared to areas with a high population in the population map. \n\nMy theory also provides expectations for heterogeneous effects, conditional on respondents' crime victimization. In other words, victimization increases insurance concerns and affects the willingness to use police forces for protection. I also expect similar predictions for respondents who reported greater support for tough-on-crime policies in the earlier crime treatment. Therefore:\n\n Hypothesis 3 - Conditional Effects for Crime Victimization\n H3a: Crime victimization and high fear of crime at the respondent level will increase the allocation of police stations in areas with a high crime rate, compared to areas with a high population in the population map. \n \nHypothesis 4 -  Conditional Effects for Punitive Preferences: Respondents with more punitive preferences will increase the allocation of police stations in areas with a high crime rate, compared to areas with a high population in the population map.\n        \nThe second micro-level predictor of my theory expects redistributive concerns - how much one has to protect and the cost of police protection - to explain greater willingness among wealthier respondents to invest in the police. This effect will appear in both the income and crime map. In the former, wealthier individuals will protect their assets, while in the later, these individuals will use police to target areas with high crime. I am agnostic regarding which effect prediction will be larger. Therefore: \n    \nHypothesis 5 -  Conditional Effects for Income:\nH5a: Wealthier respondents will increase the allocation of police stations in areas with high property prices, compared to areas with a high population in the population map.\n H5b: Wealthier respondents will increase the allocation of police stations in areas with a high crime rate, compared to areas with a high population in the population map.\n \n\nFinally, following the model directly, I also expect income to increase the effects of victimization.     \n    \nHypothesis 6 - Conditional Effects for Victimization and Income Inequality: Victimization  will increase the conditional effects for income\n H6a: Wealthier respondents who were a victim of a crime in the last 12 months will show positive and greater effects for the allocation of stations in high crime and high property price areas.  \n\n## Experiment II: Willingness-to-invest in Police Protection\n \nSee section 6 of the PAP for a full exposition of the hypotheses. \n\nI use a conjoint experiment with paired profiles of police stations to investigate the willingness to pay for protection, as well as perceptions of the effectiveness of the police, conditional on police institution's features. In this design, respondents are simultaneously exposed to two police stations varying on six distinct features, with three levels for each of the features. Political scientists have increasingly employed conjoint analysis because of the simultaneous estimation of the treatment effects allowed by this design, namely identifying which combination of attributes is favored over others. The randomization across the levels of the choices allows for an easy identification of the average effect of each component under a condition of multidimensional choice, which replicates how people usually make political decisions in real life. Each respondent will repeat the task two times.  \n\nThe profile for each police station varies in two main dimensions. First, three features relate to information about crime (robbery and homicide rates) and wealth for the area where each station is located. The goal is to tease out the insurance and redistributive dynamics discussed in the theoretical model. Second, I vary the institutional feature of the stations in three ways: the use of excessive force, the priorities of police allocation, and the degree to which the offices of the station participate in police operations together with the army. \n\nHypothesis 7: The Insurance Effect: Respondents will show a higher willingness to invest in profiles with high levels of crime (features 1 and 2).\n\nHypothesis 8: The Redistributive Effect:\nH8a: Respondents will show a higher willingness to invest in profiles on more expensive neighborhoods (feature 3). %% not sure about this.\nH8b: Respondents will show a higher willingness to invest in profiles located on slums (feature 6).\n\nHypothesis 9: Tough-on-crime on Violent Democracies: Respondents will show higher willingness-to-invest in more punitive profiles (features 4 and 5) when the levels of crime are high (features 1 and 2).\n\n\nHypothesis 10: Conditional Effects for Crime Victimization:\nH10a: Crime victimization and fear of crime will increase willingness to invest in profiles with a high crime rate (features 1 and 2).\nH10b: Crime victimization and fear of crime will increase willingness to invest in profiles that are more militarized and with more punitive practices (features 4 and 5). \nH10C: Crime victimization and high fear of crime will increase willingness to invest in profiles with high redistributive gains (features 3 and 6).\n    \nHypothesis 11: Conditional Effects for Income Inequality:\nH11a: Wealthier respondents will invest more in more punitive police stations (features 4 and 5).\nH11b: Wealthier respondents will invest more in profiles with a high crime rate (features 1 and 2). \nH11c: Wealthier respondents will invest more in profiles with higher redistributive gains (features 3 and 6). \n    \n    \nHypothesis 12: Conditional Effects for Victimization and Income Inequality:\nH12a: Wealthier respondents who reported being a victim of a crime will show a positive, greater effect for investment in more punitive police stations (features 4, 5, 6).\nH12b: H6a: Wealthier respondents who reported being a victim of a crime will show a positive, greater effect for profiles with a high crime rate (features 1, 2).  \nH12c: Wealthier respondents who reported being a victim of a crime will show a positive, greater effect for profiles with higher redistributive gains (feature 3 and 6). \n    \nHypothesis 13: Conditional Effect for Police Violence: Victims of police violence will show a lower willingness to invest in profiles with greater levels of militarization, use of violence, and police allocation in the slums (features 4, 5, and 6).", "q3": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Results\n\nFollowing our preregistered plan, we conducted Study 1 and obtained 601 responses on UTC 18th of March in 2020 using CloudResearch. We excluded 62 participants in accordance with our exclusion criteria, so the final sample was composed of 539 American adults (55.10% female), aged between 19 and 82 years old (M = 38.94, SD = 13.14). The majority of participants was Caucasian (79.22%), followed by African American (6.31%), Hispanic (5.38%), Asian (6.31%), Native American (0.19%), and Multiracial American (2.23%). Half of the participants identified their political orientation as liberal (50.46%) and the rest were either conservative (28.39%) or moderate (21.15%). The final sample size attained 98.8% of statistical power for the moderation effects reported in the original study at a statistical significance level of 0.05 for a two-tailed test. \n\nAs planned, we conducted separate regression analyses in which message endorsement and environment attitudes were predicted by participant\u2019s political orientation, adding temporal comparison as a moderator. The moderating effect of temporal comparison between participant\u2019s political orientation and message endorsement was statistically significant, b = .26, SE = .07, t(534) = 4.03, p &lt; .001, 95% CI [.14, .39]. Simple slope analysis showed that, as predicted, more liberal people preferred the future-focused message to the past-focused message, b = -.20, SE = .05, t(534) = -4.21, p &lt; .001, 95% CI [-.30, -.11]. However, the expected effect of more conservative people preferring the past-focused message to the future-focused message was not supported, b = .06, SE = .04, t(534) = 1.38, p = .168, 95% CI [-.03, .15]. Notably, the moderating effect of temporal comparison between political orientation and pro-environmental attitude was not statistically significant, b = -.04, SE = .05, t(535) = -.89, p = .370, 95% CI [-.13, .05].\n\nThus, our results did not replicate the findings reported in the targeted original study, Baldwin and Lammers (2016, Study 1). Although our replication study had a much larger power than the original study (i.e., 98.8%, N = 539, compared to 72.3% N = 203), it is possible that the results observed in our replication study are false-negative results. To provide further empirical evidence for our non-replication (or the original study), we decided to conduct Study 1 again with another sample comprising distinct participants, following the same procedure as outlined in the preregistration and as used to gather the data briefly described above. \n\nBaldwin, M., &amp; Lammers, J.
