Decisions made by, and for the people are thought to make the citizens likely to willingly comply with the outcome. We study the nuances of this assumption and ask under what conditions democratic decisions are seen as legitimate in the eyes of the people. Specifically, we investigate what mandate citizens award an EU membership referendum in three European non-member and three member countries based on the level of turnout, size of majority, and favorability of the outcome. Arguably, the use of referendums may enhance public support for democracy in a time when \u201ccritical citizens\u201d demand new alternative forms of political participation. The direct link between the citizens' preferences and the decision-outcome is an important property of referendums, and different forms of direct democratic initiatives have grown in popularity in contemporary Europe. Indeed, European integration issues of membership, key policies, endorsement of treaties and constitutional documents are the most voted-on issue in the world. There is thus a need to investigate when people perceive referendum results as legitimate decision outcomes. Utilizing a conjoint experimental design, we proposed to a representative sample of Norwegian citizens an imagined scenario where European Union membership was put out for a referendum. They were given different scenarios, where turnout level, size of majority, and outcome are varied; three critical dimensions that always will be present in any referendum. Do people think that the government should follow any result once the issue is decided on in a referendum, or do they change opinion when learning about the attributes of the specific referendum? The point of departure is the assumption that people think the results of a referendum on EU membership should be followed, regardless of the turnout level, size of majority, and the outcome of the referendum itself. By varying these three attributes of a referendum, the share of citizens that think the result should be followed by the government spanned from virtually everyone to only a quarter of the population. The results also showed an interaction between outcome favorability and majority size: When the majority size was small, the voters who saw an unfavorable outcome were less likely to accept the referendum than those who saw an unfavorable outcome were. Furthermore, the outcome favorability effect was moderated by membership attitudes: Those who were against EU-membership were significantly less likely to approve of a referendum with an unfavorable outcome than the pro-EU voters were. In a second fielding of the experiment, we are currently gathering data from six European countries. The experiment is part of the 2017 EIPS survey wave, which consists of six European academically run panels. The recruitment strategy of the panels ensures that all citizens have a close to equal, non-zero, likelihood of being invited to participate, ensuring high quality samples representative of the populations of the respective countries. We have received the results from Norway, Iceland, Sweden, and The Netherlands. The findings so far reveal similar main effects across these four countries.

Reversely in member countries, pro-EU respondents are significantly more negative to \"No\"-outcome than anti-EU respondents are to a \"Yes\"-outcome (The Netherlands and Norway).

unfavorable referendum outcome as a mandate for making a political decision than are voters who prefer change. 5) There is an interaction effect between outcome favorability and majority size: When the majority size is small, the voters who receive an unfavorable outcome are less likely to consider the referendum as a mandate for making a political decision than those who receive a favorable outcome are. 6) There is an interaction effect between outcome favorability and turnout: When turnout is low, the voters who receive an unfavorable outcome are less likely to consider the referendum

With such an objective, this experiment will test the following hypotheses: 1) Perception of mobility is positively correlated with people's trust in government. 2) Trust in government plays a mediating role determining the perception of mobility; treatment effects on perception of mobility differ by respondents' perception of trustworthiness of the government. 3) Treatments that affect respondents' perception of mobility positively (negatively) leads to higher (lower) trust in government. 4) Lower (higher) trust in government leads to lower (higher) voting participation plan.", "q17": "We will address the hypotheses listed above using a simple experiment where respondents are assigned to one of six groups, resulting from 2 X 3 design.

methodological survey literature (Groves 2006; Massey and Tourangeau 2012; Kulas et al. 2017). Likewise, various invitation forms and strategies (e.g., monetary incentives, advance letters, sponsorship, social proof and telephone or SMS follow-up) have been tested in order to increase response rates (Singer et al. 2000; Hansen and Pedersen 2012; Pedersen and Nielsen 2016). However, less attention has been given to the interaction between response bias and the particular research topics investigated in the surveys. As some topics may correlate heavily with the propensity to participate in surveys, response bias may have large consequences for the conclusions drawn from these surveys. This tendency may be exacerbated by the now common practices of offering incentives or appeal to altruistic motives to increase the response rate (Hansen and Pedersen 2012). A case in point is public service motivation (Perry and Wise 1990). Public service motivation can be described as \u2018an individual\u2019s orientation to delivering services to people with a purpose to do good for others and society\u2019 (Perry and Hondeghem 2008, p.vii) and is typically described as a particular aspect of altruism, which is tied to the delivery of public services. A fundamental expectation in the theory is that public service motivated individuals are attracted by altruistic opportunities but repelled by economic incentives, which can crowd out the intrinsic value of a contribution (Perry & Wise 1990). It is obvious that some of the theoretical antecedents of public service motivation are also antecedents of survey participation \u2013 if not directly, then by extension. Asking a professional to give some time to answering a survey that will contribute to science clearly speaks to altruism, while offering a monetary incentive instead speaks to the opposite: extrinsic motivation (Ryan and Deci 2000). If invitations to participate in research surveys use these quite different appeals they might create a selection process that also ends up affecting public service motivation: participants initially reacting to a monetary incentive may have lower public service motivation, while participants reacting to an altruistic message may have higher public service motivation on average. Ultimately, such biases can threaten the ability to draw conclusions, which are valid for a general population of people. Selection into a survey may be exacerbated further by (planned or unplanned) framing effects within the survey (Chong and Druckman 2007). Such context effects are common in surveys (Schwarz and Strack 1991; Hjortskov 2017), and they may affect the final outcome measures as well. That is, besides the selection effects that may be caused by the method of inviting participants into surveys, framing effects within the survey may obscure the final attitude measure (for example a public service motivation measure) further.

There are around 10,000 physiotherapists registered with the association, and previous research have succeeded in an response rate of about 52-65 %, and if we can obtain similar response rates, we can expect between 5,200 and 6,500 answers. Our power calculations are based on the conservative guess of 3000 answers. The Association of Danish Physiotherapists organizes physiotherapists in both the private and the public sector as well as both employers and employees. Design The design consists of 3 different invitations and 4 different reminders that further seek to frame the public service motivation in an altruistic or self-centered way. Respondents are randomized into one of 12 possible groups receiving 1 one of three invitations and 1 of 3 types of reminders or no reminder. The 3 invitations are of the same length (298-302 words and 1577-1583 signs). All of them inform about the general purpose of the survey, some general information about the survey and the sender of it and ask for the physiotherapists\u2019 participation. Apart from that, the first invitation has an altruistic frame, emphasizing the societal role of physiotherapists and in research that results in new knowledge about what motivates them. The second invitation contains a monetary incentive in the form of a price lottery, where it is possible to win 5 prizes of 3000 kr. (about 400 Euros or 470 American Dollars). The third invitation serves as a control invitation containing extra information about the general contents of the study without stressing any altruistic purposes or giving any incentives. The test of H1 is a simple difference-in-means of these three invitations on the response rate. After a very short introduction in the survey itself, the respondents will be directed through a set of background questions (e.g., gender, age, employment). After these questions, the reminders are introduced. There are 3 different reminders and a group not receiving any reminder. The 3 reminders all seek to frame the public service motivation questions in different ways (Chong and Druckman 2007), whereas the last group just receives the questions without any introduction. The first reminder will frame the public service motivation questions as asking about the societal and political role of the physiotherapists\u2019 work. This reminder will therefore possibly interact with the respondents who were invited into the survey by the altruistic invitation. The second reminder will introduce the public service motivation questions as questions about their own role at their workplace. This reminder is designed to mostly interact with the respondents who had the incentive invitation. The third and last reminder is a combination of the two previous ones, asking the physiotherapists to choose between the framings of the public service motivation questions. The question asks them to choose between answering two different sets of questions: the societal and political role of their work or their own role at their workplace. No matter their choice, they will be asked the same set of public service motivation questions (steered selection (V\u00f6ssing and Weber 2017)). This will give us an estimate of the physiotherapists\u2019 selection into answering different questions about their work given their initial invitation into the survey. Power calculation A power calculation carried out in GPower 3.1 with a minimum detectable effect size of .25 shows that 250 respondents in each group will secure 80 pct. power (difference in independent means t-test assumed). Given our (conservatively) expected sample size of at least 3000 physiotherapists, the maximum number of groups becomes 12 (3000/12 = 250). Recruitment and randomization Recruitment to the online survey happens through The Association of Danish Physiotherapists\u2019 registered e-mail addresses for their members. The randomization is simple random draws. Measurement Public service motivation is measured through a battery of validated items used in Jensen & Andersen (2015). Items reflecting all four conceptual dimensions of PSM \u2013 attraction to policy making, compassion, commitment to public interest, and self-sacrifice \u2013 were included and measured with 5-point Likert-type questions anchored at 1 representing \u2018fully agree\u2019 and 5 representing \u2018fully disagree\u2019. We treat PSM as an aggregate construct composed of all four sub-dimensions (2015, pp.759\u2013760). Manipulation Checks I order to observe whether the different invitation letters succeeded in creating three different selection processes and group compositions a set of manipulation checks are employed. First, public employees have been shown to score higher on public service motivation (Rainey 1983; Kjeldsen and Jacobsen 2013). Therefore, we expect that publicly employed physiotherapists will to a larger degree select into the survey via the altruistic invitation letter, whereas the privately employed physiotherapists will have a larger tendency to select into the survey via the incentive invitation letter. Therefore, one manipulation check is whether sector of employment interacts with the treatments on the propensity to answer the survey (although the result also may have practical relevance). Second, after the outcome measure of public service motivation (and a large set of other, unrelated questions), we ask a set of direct altruism questions about donations to charitable giving and include a possibility to go to a specific charitable foundation\u2019s homepage and donate (we track clicking on the link but not if they actually donate money). Pre-analysis plan The plan of analysis is first to apply the difference-in-means estimator via OLS regression and logistic regression to obtain the average treatment effect of the different invitation letters on the propensity to answer the survey (H1). OLS regression is also used to obtain the effect of the invitation letters on public service motivation (also difference-in-means) (H2a and H2b). H3 and H4 will both be analyzed as mean comparisons between combinations of the different groups (for example the altruistic invitation + altruistic reminder versus the monetary incentive invitation + reminder of own job situation) and interaction terms between invitations and reminders included in the OLS regressions on public service motivation. H5a and H5b will be analyzed with logistic regression with the choice of either the altruistic or the self-centered frame as the dependent variable. Lastly, H6a and H6b will be analyzed with the instrumental variables framework (Wing and Clark 2017). The randomization of the different frames (altruistic, self-centered, choice and none) will be used as an instrument on the choice of frame (which is non-random in nature) to compare the choice groups\u2019 public service motivation with the public service motivation of the non-choice groups. Here, the two-stage least squares linear estimator will be employed. This analysis is also carried out within the corresponding invitation group (H6c). For example, among the participants, who were invited by the altruistic invitation the participants who choose the altruistic frame are compared to the participants who are shown the altruistic frame (without the choice option)."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Denmark"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "3000"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q32": {"extra": [], "value": "D73, C83"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design", "Survey Methodology"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Response Bias as a Consequence of Incentives or Altruism in Invitations to Participate", "q2": "Morten Hjortskov | Christian B\u00f8tcher Jacobsen", "q3": "20171115AA", "q4": "11/15/2017 - 15:51", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to any research activities", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "11/17/17", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "No", "q15": "Response bias has been shown to exist within surveys and as a consequence of non-response to surveys in the methodological survey literature (Groves 2006; Massey and Tourangeau 2012; Kulas et al. 2017).

The test of H1 is a simple difference-in-means of these three invitations on the response rate. After a very short introduction in the survey itself, the respondents will be directed through a set of background questions (e.g., gender, age, employment). After these questions, the reminders are introduced. There are 3 different reminders and a group not receiving any reminder. The 3 reminders all seek to frame the public service motivation questions in different ways (Chong and Druckman 2007), whereas the last group just receives the questions without any introduction. The first reminder will frame the public service motivation questions as asking about the societal and political role of the physiotherapists\u2019 work. This reminder will therefore possibly interact with the respondents who were invited into the survey by the altruistic invitation. The second reminder will introduce the public service motivation questions as questions about their own role at their workplace. This reminder is designed to mostly interact with the respondents who had the incentive invitation. The third and last reminder is a combination of the two previous ones, asking the physiotherapists to choose between the framings of the public service motivation questions. The question asks them to choose between answering two different sets of questions: the societal and political role of their work or their own role at their workplace. No matter their choice, they will be asked the same set of public service motivation questions (steered selection (V\u00f6ssing and Weber 2017)). This will give us an estimate of the physiotherapists\u2019 selection into answering different questions about their work given their initial invitation into the survey. Power calculation A power calculation carried out in GPower 3.1 with a minimum detectable effect size of .25 shows that 250 respondents in each group will secure 80 pct. power (difference in independent means t-test assumed). Given our (conservatively) expected sample size of at least 3000 physiotherapists, the maximum number of groups becomes 12 (3000/12 = 250). Recruitment and randomization Recruitment to the online survey happens through The Association of Danish Physiotherapists\u2019 registered e-mail addresses for their members. The randomization is simple random draws. Measurement Public service motivation is measured through a battery of validated items used in Jensen & Andersen (2015). Items reflecting all four conceptual dimensions of PSM \u2013 attraction to policy making, compassion, commitment to public interest, and self-sacrifice \u2013 were included and measured with 5-point Likert-type questions anchored at 1 representing \u2018fully agree\u2019 and 5 representing \u2018fully disagree\u2019. We treat PSM as an aggregate construct composed of all four sub-dimensions (2015, pp.759\u2013760). Manipulation Checks I order to observe whether the different invitation letters succeeded in creating three different selection processes and group compositions a set of manipulation checks are employed. First, public employees have been shown to score higher on public service motivation (Rainey 1983; Kjeldsen and Jacobsen 2013). Therefore, we expect that publicly employed physiotherapists will to a larger degree select into the survey via the altruistic invitation letter, whereas the privately employed physiotherapists will have a larger tendency to select into the survey via the incentive invitation letter. Therefore, one manipulation check is whether sector of employment interacts with the treatments on the propensity to answer the survey (although the result also may have practical relevance). Second, after the outcome measure of public service motivation (and a large set of other, unrelated questions), we ask a set of direct altruism questions about donations to charitable giving and include a possibility to go to a specific charitable foundation\u2019s homepage and donate (we track clicking on the link but not if they actually donate money). Pre-analysis plan The plan of analysis is first to apply the difference-in-means estimator via OLS regression and logistic regression to obtain the average treatment effect of the different invitation letters on the propensity to answer the survey (H1). OLS regression is also used to obtain the effect of the invitation letters on public service motivation (also difference-in-means) (H2a and H2b). H3 and H4 will both be analyzed as mean comparisons between combinations of the different groups (for example the altruistic invitation + altruistic reminder versus the monetary incentive invitation + reminder of own job situation) and interaction terms between invitations and reminders included in the OLS regressions on public service motivation. H5a and H5b will be analyzed with logistic regression with the choice of either the altruistic or the self-centered frame as the dependent variable. Lastly, H6a and H6b will be analyzed with the instrumental variables framework (Wing and Clark 2017). The randomization of the different frames (altruistic, self-centered, choice and none) will be used as an instrument on the choice of frame (which is non-random in nature) to compare the choice groups\u2019 public service motivation with the public service motivation of the non-choice groups. Here, the two-stage least squares linear estimator will be employed. This analysis is also carried out within the corresponding invitation group (H6c). For example, among the participants, who were invited by the altruistic invitation the participants who choose the altruistic frame are compared to the participants who are shown the altruistic frame (without the choice option).", "q18": "Denmark", "q19": "3000", "q20": "Yes", "q21": "", "q22": "", "q23": "", "q24": "", "q25": "", "q26": "Researchers", "q27": "", "q28": "No", "q29": "", "q30": "", "q31": "", "q32": "D73, C83", "q33": ["Experimental Design", "Survey Methodology"], "q34": [""], "q35": "Agree", "q36": "Agree", "q37": [], "q38": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=mda7y", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "mda7y", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "mda7y", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/d5gfm/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "d5gfm", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ectnk/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "ectnk", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0f/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0f", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/mda7y/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mda7y/"}}], "links": {"first": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json", "last": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "prev": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=374", "next": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=376", "meta": {"total": 5469, "per_page": 10}}}
