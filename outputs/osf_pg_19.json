systematic review and meta-analysis", "description": "This review investigates the effect of resistance training on the acute inflammatory response (immediately pre- compared to post-exercise). The inflammatory cascade is independently associated with the occurrence and progression of insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration and tumour growth. These factors constitute the primary pathophysiology of the most pervasive chronic conditions of the developed world, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Whilst a state of chronic, low-grade inflammation is expected to be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic disease, acute inflammation (pulsatile increases) promotes promotes tissue regeneration and an anti-inflammatory cascade to reduce chronic cytokine elevation. Therefore, the acute inflammatory response may be a primary prevention strategy against chronic diseases with the most wide-spread effects.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-20T04:43:08.041704", "date_modified": "2020-04-20T04:37:02.559353", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["University of Queensland"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "085a919dbc8865fb3f308462bb2a13a211adc9090ce82763559b6cbc9f826847d25551d654722f260b60bf81b83adf7dde45f291e30ece6c563d0ebf4a29cc4eed3ef3c42064bff555a905099eb362f6977ff0ebf075193b615351ecf06494e4667d6b7736f5eb16d14c367a20a99c7fba80c7d17d4e57b2a36504b3bbb72155acb17921cac94f7978a155aa4010343a", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-20T04:43:08.026271", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Open-Ended Registration", "registered_meta": {"summary": {"extra": [], "value": "Please find attached all information relating to this systematic review and meta-analysis, based on the framework provided by the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews.

analyses we conducted that were not pre-registered and b) register new hypotheses and analyses. \n\nFirst, I\u2019ll discuss the pre-registered analyses I conducted, examining four measures of attachment (avoidance with mothers, avoidance with fathers, anxiety with mothers, and anxiety with fathers).  Next, I\u2019ll discuss previously completed analyses that were not pre-registered, examining three indices of attachment (the average of avoidance with mothers and avoidance with fathers, which I will refer to as \u201cavoidance with parents\u201d, the average of anxiety with mothers and anxiety with fathers, which I will refer to as \u201canxiety with parents\u201d, and a general index of security with parents, calculated by averaging avoidance with parents and anxiety with parents, which I will refer to as \u201csecurity with parents\u201d). Next, I\u2019ll discuss a new set of analyses we would like to conduct, with a new set of hypotheses, examining two different indices of attachment (the average of avoidance with mom and anxiety with mom, which I will refer to as \u201csecurity with mom\u201d and the average of avoidance with dad and anxiety with dad, which I will refer to as \u201csecurity with dad\u201d).  Finally, I will discuss future directions for possible exploratory analyses. \n\nSection B: Pre-Registered and Completed Analyses.\n\nAs planned, we began by running the pre-registered path model, including our four attachment predictors of interest (attachment anxiety with mothers, attachment avoidance with mothers, attachment anxiety with fathers, and attachment avoidance with fathers).  When we ran this model, none of our four attachment predictors reached significance.  As this starkly contrasted a body of previous work on the relations between attachment and social information processing (see Dykas &amp; Cassidy, 2011 for a review) we thought about why this may have occurred.  \n\n\tAll the correlations among the four attachment predictors were significant. However, when all the variables were entered into a multiple linear regression model, the VIFs of the attachment predictors did not reach our pre-registered cut-off of 10. Regardless, we were concerned that the attachment predictors were suppressing each other. \n\nSection C: Non Pre-Registered Previously Completed Analyses:\n\nDue to these suspected multicollinearity problems, we decided to create two index variables and use these to test our hypotheses. These two index variables are avoidance with parents (the average of avoidance with mom and avoidance with dad) and anxiety with parents (the average of anxiety with mom and anxiety with dad).  We decided to keep the anxiety and avoidance dimensions separate, as the vast majority of the literature about attachment and negative attributions in adults uses these dimensions as predictors. \n\nIn the following section, I will describe how these new analyses map on to our old hypotheses:\n\nOriginal Hypothesis 1: Adolescents\u2019 attachment avoidance with mothers, avoidance with fathers, anxiety with mothers, and anxiety with fathers will be associated with negative attribution biases \nModified Hypothesis 1: Adolescents\u2019 attachment avoidance with parents, and attachment anxiety with parents (see Section A for how these were calculated) will be associated with negative attribution biases.\n\nOriginal Hypothesis 2: Preferred partner gender will moderate links between attachment avoidance with fathers and attachment anxiety with fathers and attribution biases, such that these associations will be stronger for participants imagining a male future partner.\nModification: We were not able to test this hypothesis, as we collapsed across parent gender.\n\nOriginal Hypothesis 3: Attribution biases will mediate links between attachment anxiety with moms, attachment avoidance with moms, attachment anxiety with dads, attachment avoidance with dads, and negative explicit responses to partner behavior.\nModified Hypothesis 3: Attribution biases will mediate links between attachment anxiety and avoidance with parents (see Section A for how this was calculated), and negative explicit responses to partner behavior.\n\nOriginal Hypothesis 4: Attribution biases will mediate links between attachment anxiety with moms, attachment avoidance with moms, attachment anxiety with dads, attachment avoidance with dads, and negative implicit responses to partner behavior. \nModified Hypothesis 4: Attribution biases will mediate links between attachment anxiety and avoidance with parents (see Section A for how this was calculated), and negative implicit responses to partner behavior. \n\nWhen testing our modified hypotheses, we found that (modified hypothesis 1) avoidance with parents marginally predicted negative attributions and anxiety with parents did not, (modified hypothesis 3) there was a marginal indirect effect of avoidance with parents (but not anxiety) on negative explicit responses through negative attributions, and (modified hypothesis 4) there were no significant or marginally significant indirect effects of anxiety or avoidance on negative implicit responses through negative attributions. \n\nMoving away from our original hypotheses, we also decided to test whether an index of adolescents\u2019 security across parents (the \u201csecurity with parents\u201d index, see section A for how this was calculated) might be influential in predicting negative attributions and implicit and explicit responses through negative attributions. We computed a security across parents score by averaging all four attachment measures.  We found that security with parents significantly predicted negative attributions, and that there was a significant indirect effect of security with parents on explicit responses, through the mechanism of negative attributions. \n\nSection D: Pre-registering new analyses\n\nAfter presenting the work to colleagues and further discussion, we decided that there was value in keeping attachment with mothers and fathers as separate constructs in the model, as previous work has illustrated the ways in which attachment with mothers and fathers affect adolescent well-being differently (e.g., Woodhouse et al., 2009; Woodhouse et al., 2010). We believe that although the adult literature focuses on the two attachment dimensions, the impact of attachment with specific parents could be more influential in adolescence.\n\nFollowing previous research in adults using the ECR (e.g., Fraley &amp; Shaver 1997, Mohr et al., 2005; Woodhouse et al., 2009) we will generate security scores by averaging across anxiety and avoidance. We will do this for security with mothers, and security with fathers. \n\nWe now propose new models to test modified versions of our original hypotheses, and some new hypotheses. Following previous research (Fraley et al., 2011; Woodhouse et al., 2009) I will first test models with mothers and fathers separately, and then test a model with both of them included to see if either has an effect above and beyond the other. \n\nProposed modified hypothesis 1: Security with mothers and fathers will predict negative attributions.\n\nProposed modified hypothesis 2: The link between security with fathers and negative attributions will be moderated by adolescents\u2019 preferred partner\u2019s gender, such that the link will be stronger when the adolescent is picturing a male future partner.\n\nProposed modified hypothesis 3: There will be an indirect effect of security with mothers and security with fathers on explicit responses to partners\u2019 behaviors through the mechanism of negative attributions. \n\nProposed modified hypothesis 4: There will be an indirect effect of security with mothers and security with fathers on implicit responses to partners\u2019 behaviors through the mechanism of negative attributions. \n\nNew hypothesis (hypothesis 5): Security with mothers will explain variance above and beyond security with fathers in predicting negative attributions. \n\nNew hypothesis (hypothesis 6): Security with mothers will be a buffer against the impact of insecurity with fathers on negative attributions. \n\nNew hypothesis (hypotheses 7): For those picturing a male partner only, security with fathers will be a buffer against the impact of insecurity with mom on negative attributions. \n\nModels to test these modified versions of our hypotheses, and our new hypotheses.\n\nModel 1: Pre-registered path analysis with all a-priori covariates, security with mothers, and an interaction term of security with mothers and preferred partner gender as predictors.  This model is to test hypothesis 1.  We do not hypothesize that the interaction will be significant, but we would like to keep it in the model for exploratory purposes.\n\nWe will use the Model Indirect Mplus procedure (Stride et al., 2015) to test the indirect effect of security with mothers on implicit and explicit responses to partners\u2019 behaviors.  This is a test of modified hypotheses 3 and 4.\n\nModel 2: Pre-registered path analysis with all a-priori covariates, security with fathers, and an interaction term of security with fathers and preferred partner gender as predictors.  This model is to test hypotheses 1 and 2.  \n\nWe will use the Model Indirect Mplus procedure (Stride et al., 2015) to test the indirect effect of security with fathers on implicit and explicit responses to partners\u2019 behaviors.  This is to test hypotheses 3 and 4.\n\nModel 3: Pre-registered path analysis with all a-priori covariates, security with fathers, and security with mothers. This model is to test hypothesis 5. \n\nModel 4: We will include an interaction term to model 3 between security with dad and security with mom in predicting negative attributions. This will allow us to test hypothesis 6.  We will also include a three-way interaction term between security with dad, security with mom, and preferred partner gender, to test whether security with fathers will be a buffer against the impact of insecurity with mom on negative attributions for those imagining a male future partner (hypothesis 7).\n\nSection E: Future Directions\n\nPossible future directions include further examining the impact of overall security with parents (average of security with mom and security with dad) on different study variables and examining whether adolescents high on attachment anxiety with mothers are more at risk than other adolescents. \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"summary": "Section A: Introduction\nI\u2019m writing this pre-registration to a) give an update on analyses we conducted that were not pre-registered and b) register new hypotheses and analyses. \n\nFirst, I\u2019ll discuss the pre-registered analyses I conducted, examining four measures of attachment (avoidance with mothers, avoidance with fathers, anxiety with mothers, and anxiety with fathers).

These two index variables are avoidance with parents (the average of avoidance with mom and avoidance with dad) and anxiety with parents (the average of anxiety with mom and anxiety with dad).  We decided to keep the anxiety and avoidance dimensions separate, as the vast majority of the literature about attachment and negative attributions in adults uses these dimensions as predictors. \n\nIn the following section, I will describe how these new analyses map on to our old hypotheses:\n\nOriginal Hypothesis 1: Adolescents\u2019 attachment avoidance with mothers, avoidance with fathers, anxiety with mothers, and anxiety with fathers will be associated with negative attribution biases \nModified Hypothesis 1: Adolescents\u2019 attachment avoidance with parents, and attachment anxiety with parents (see Section A for how these were calculated) will be associated with negative attribution biases.\n\nOriginal Hypothesis 2: Preferred partner gender will moderate links between attachment avoidance with fathers and attachment anxiety with fathers and attribution biases, such that these associations will be stronger for participants imagining a male future partner.\nModification: We were not able to test this hypothesis, as we collapsed across parent gender.\n\nOriginal Hypothesis 3: Attribution biases will mediate links between attachment anxiety with moms, attachment avoidance with moms, attachment anxiety with dads, attachment avoidance with dads, and negative explicit responses to partner behavior.\nModified Hypothesis 3: Attribution biases will mediate links between attachment anxiety and avoidance with parents (see Section A for how this was calculated), and negative explicit responses to partner behavior.\n\nOriginal Hypothesis 4: Attribution biases will mediate links between attachment anxiety with moms, attachment avoidance with moms, attachment anxiety with dads, attachment avoidance with dads, and negative implicit responses to partner behavior. \nModified Hypothesis 4: Attribution biases will mediate links between attachment anxiety and avoidance with parents (see Section A for how this was calculated), and negative implicit responses to partner behavior. \n\nWhen testing our modified hypotheses, we found that (modified hypothesis 1) avoidance with parents marginally predicted negative attributions and anxiety with parents did not, (modified hypothesis 3) there was a marginal indirect effect of avoidance with parents (but not anxiety) on negative explicit responses through negative attributions, and (modified hypothesis 4) there were no significant or marginally significant indirect effects of anxiety or avoidance on negative implicit responses through negative attributions. \n\nMoving away from our original hypotheses, we also decided to test whether an index of adolescents\u2019 security across parents (the \u201csecurity with parents\u201d index, see section A for how this was calculated) might be influential in predicting negative attributions and implicit and explicit responses through negative attributions. We computed a security across parents score by averaging all four attachment measures.  We found that security with parents significantly predicted negative attributions, and that there was a significant indirect effect of security with parents on explicit responses, through the mechanism of negative attributions. \n\nSection D: Pre-registering new analyses\n\nAfter presenting the work to colleagues and further discussion, we decided that there was value in keeping attachment with mothers and fathers as separate constructs in the model, as previous work has illustrated the ways in which attachment with mothers and fathers affect adolescent well-being differently (e.g., Woodhouse et al., 2009; Woodhouse et al., 2010). We believe that although the adult literature focuses on the two attachment dimensions, the impact of attachment with specific parents could be more influential in adolescence.\n\nFollowing previous research in adults using the ECR (e.g., Fraley &amp; Shaver 1997, Mohr et al., 2005; Woodhouse et al., 2009) we will generate security scores by averaging across anxiety and avoidance. We will do this for security with mothers, and security with fathers. \n\nWe now propose new models to test modified versions of our original hypotheses, and some new hypotheses. Following previous research (Fraley et al., 2011; Woodhouse et al., 2009) I will first test models with mothers and fathers separately, and then test a model with both of them included to see if either has an effect above and beyond the other. \n\nProposed modified hypothesis 1: Security with mothers and fathers will predict negative attributions.\n\nProposed modified hypothesis 2: The link between security with fathers and negative attributions will be moderated by adolescents\u2019 preferred partner\u2019s gender, such that the link will be stronger when the adolescent is picturing a male future partner.\n\nProposed modified hypothesis 3: There will be an indirect effect of security with mothers and security with fathers on explicit responses to partners\u2019 behaviors through the mechanism of negative attributions. \n\nProposed modified hypothesis 4: There will be an indirect effect of security with mothers and security with fathers on implicit responses to partners\u2019 behaviors through the mechanism of negative attributions. \n\nNew hypothesis (hypothesis 5): Security with mothers will explain variance above and beyond security with fathers in predicting negative attributions. \n\nNew hypothesis (hypothesis 6): Security with mothers will be a buffer against the impact of insecurity with fathers on negative attributions. \n\nNew hypothesis (hypotheses 7): For those picturing a male partner only, security with fathers will be a buffer against the impact of insecurity with mom on negative attributions. \n\nModels to test these modified versions of our hypotheses, and our new hypotheses.\n\nModel 1: Pre-registered path analysis with all a-priori covariates, security with mothers, and an interaction term of security with mothers and preferred partner gender as predictors.  This model is to test hypothesis 1.  We do not hypothesize that the interaction will be significant, but we would like to keep it in the model for exploratory purposes.\n\nWe will use the Model Indirect Mplus procedure (Stride et al., 2015) to test the indirect effect of security with mothers on implicit and explicit responses to partners\u2019 behaviors.  This is a test of modified hypotheses 3 and 4.\n\nModel 2: Pre-registered path analysis with all a-priori covariates, security with fathers, and an interaction term of security with fathers and preferred partner gender as predictors.  This model is to test hypotheses 1 and 2.  \n\nWe will use the Model Indirect Mplus procedure (Stride et al., 2015) to test the indirect effect of security with fathers on implicit and explicit responses to partners\u2019 behaviors.  This is to test hypotheses 3 and 4.\n\nModel 3: Pre-registered path analysis with all a-priori covariates, security with fathers, and security with mothers. This model is to test hypothesis 5. \n\nModel 4: We will include an interaction term to model 3 between security with dad and security with mom in predicting negative attributions. This will allow us to test hypothesis 6.  We will also include a three-way interaction term between security with dad, security with mom, and preferred partner gender, to test whether security with fathers will be a buffer against the impact of insecurity with mom on negative attributions for those imagining a male future partner (hypothesis 7).\n\nSection E: Future Directions\n\nPossible future directions include further examining the impact of overall security with parents (average of security with mom and security with dad) on different study variables and examining whether adolescents high on attachment anxiety with mothers are more at risk than other adolescents. \n"}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecac48", "text": "Social and Behavioral Sciences"}]]}, "relationships": {"license": {"links": {"related": {"href":
