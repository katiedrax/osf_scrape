The original study aims at finding empirical support for a simple hypothesis. Namely, that, when having to complete different tasks, people prioritize those tasks in which they have more confidence. Experiment 1 focuses on showing that such prioritization happens in situations of retrospective confidence: that is, when reporting tasks already completed.\n\nOn each trial of the experiment, participants see an array of Os and Xs, colored blue or orange. After the stimulus is removed they have to complete two tasks: the color task, consisting in reporting whether there were more orange or blue elements, and the letter task, consisting in reporting whether there were more Os or Xs. They do so by using a response screen. Importantly, participants can choose the order in which to complete the tasks: first the color task and then the letter task, or vice versa. After completing both tasks, participants have to rate their confidence on each of them. Also importantly, on each trial the difficulty of each of the tasks is manipulated independently: this can be hard (60% expected performance) or easy (90% expected performance). This means that we have four types of trials: a) hard color - hard letter; b) hard color - easy letter; c) easy color - hard letter; d) easy color - easy letter.\n\nAll the effects that we will attempt to replicate relate to the prioritization of one task over another. We expect the task that is answered to first to be linked to higher confidence (as evidenced by confidence reports) than the task that is answered to second.\n\nThe specific results we aim at replicating are the following.\n\n1 - Taking, for each participant, the average confidence for first-reported tasks and the average confidence for second-reported tasks, we expect the former to be bigger than the latter, as measured by a paired t-test.\n\n2 - Taking, for each participant, the proportion of trials where the confidence for the first-reported task was bigger than the confidence for the second-reported task, we expect that this proportion will be bigger than 0.5, as assessed by a one-sample, two-sided t-test.\n\n3 - Same as in number 2, but only taking those trials where both tasks have the same difficulty (hard color - hard letter and easy color - easy letter) and where the response for both tasks was correct.\n\n4 - Same as in number 2, but only taking those trials where both tasks have the same difficulty (hard color - hard letter and easy color - easy letter) and where the response for both tasks was an error.\n\nEffects 3 and 4 are crucial, since the corresponding analyses control for difficulty (both tasks have the same) and for performance (both responses were correct (3) or errors (4)).

The review suggests previous studies testing associations show correlations ranging from +.03 to +.81. As is common in psychological science, effect sizes differ greater, likely due to methodological factors.\n\nIt seems that the largest effect sizes are from studies that used neuroimaging to measure positive emotion reactivity. A series of studies examining the association between neuroticism (low well-being) and neural activation of brain pleasure centers in response to a short, positive, film segments resulted in correlations between -.63 and -.81 (Britton, Ho, Taylor, &amp; Liberzon, 2007). A different study testing the association between amygdala neutral reactivity to positive picture stimuli and subjective happiness (high well-being) was +.44 and +.49 (Cunningham &amp; Kirkland, 2013). In another study the correlation from the neutral activation of brain pleasure centers in response to positive picture stimuli with psychological well-being was +.47, while the correlation with cortisol levels was -.32 to -.33 (Heller et al., 2013).\n\nIt seems more moderate effect sizes are from studies that used automatic activity to measure positive emotion reactivity. A study found a +.21 correlation between autonomic reactivity indicated by heart rate variability and affect valence when/after viewing positive picture stimuli (Fujimura and Okanoya, 2012). A study testing the association between autonomic reactivity indicated by skin conductance after seeing positive picture stimuli and avoidant attachment (low well-being) found correlations ranging from -.06 to -.38 (Yee &amp; Shiota, 2015).\n\nEffect sizes from studies that used self-report questionnaires to measure positive emotion reactivity were highly variable, ranging from -.15 in the reverse direction to +.45. A study comparing individuals with major depressive disorder (low well-being) to a control group without any depressive disorder (high well-being), found a standardized mean difference of about +1.0 (r = 1.0 / sqrt( 1.0^2 + 4) = +.45) between self-reported affect valence after seeing positive words generated by the participant in an earlier sentence completion task (Avgusta et al., 2005). In addition, a study found that emotional and physical symptoms (low well-being) were not associated (r = +.03) with self-reported happiness ratings after a positive film clip (Dawkins, Acaster, &amp; Powell, 2007). Yet another study compared individuals with depression disorder (low well-being) to a control group without any depression disorder (high well-being), finding a standardized mean difference of d = (2.48 \u2013 2.91) / ((1.78 + 1.04) / 2) = -.30 (r = -.30 / (sqrt(-.30^2 + 4) = -.15, reverse direction) for happiness in response to a happy film clip, d = (3.53 \u2013 2.93) / ((1.34 + 0.88) / 2) = +.54 (r = +.54 / (sqrt(+.54^2 + 4) = +.26) for pride in response to a pride film clip, and d = (2.79 \u2013 2.39) / ((1.10 + 1.10) / 2) = +.36 (r = +.36 / (sqrt(+.36^2 + 4) = +.18) (Gruber, Oveis, Keltner, &amp; Johnson, 2011). A similar study compared individuals with depression disorder (low well-being) and a control group without any depression disorder (high well-being), finding a standardized mean differences of d = (((6.00 + 5.44) / 2) \u2013 4.76) / ((1.63 + 2.02 + 2.31) / 3) = +.48 (r = .48 / sqrt(.48^2 + 4) = +.23 (Reed, Sayette, &amp; Cohn, 2007).\n\nBritton, J.

Therefore, the statistical power for Hypothesis 1 was evaluated for the central range of zero-order correlations for studies using self-report measures: r = .10, r = .20, r = .30, and r = .40. In addition, minimum and maximum expected sample sizes were evaluated: 500 \u2013 (500 * .33) = 335 and 1000 \u2013 (1000 * .33) = 670. We assume a Type I error rate of .05.\n\nStatistical Power (1 \u2013 \u03b2)\tN = 335\tN = 670\nr = .10\t.45\t.74\nr = .20\t.96\t.99\nr = .30\t.99\t.99\nr = .40\t.99\t.99\n\nRegarding the effect of positive expression recognition on general well-being, standardized effect sizes ranged from .00 to .70. A meta-analysis of 18 studies comparing individuals with internalizing disorders to controls on overall facial expression recognition was d = .35 (r = .35 / sqrt(.35^2 + 4) = .17) for anxiety disorders and d = .58 (r = .58 / sqrt(.58^2 + 4) = .28) (Demenescu et al., 2010). However, the meta-analysis did not separate out analyses by discrete emotions. One study found that dispositional joy was weakly uncorrelated with the tendency to correctly recognize pictures of happy faces (r = (.03 + .10) / 2 = .07) and the tendency to incorrectly say pictures of non-happy faces (e.g., neutral) were happy (r = (.07 + .25) /2 = .16). Another study found that individuals with a depression disorder vs a control group were worse at identifying happy facial expressions (Surguladze et al., 2004). The first set of results refer to pictures of faces flashing on the screen for 0.1 second. For 100% happy facial expressions, the tendency to correctly recognize pictures of happy faces was higher in the control group (d = -.22 - -.53 / ((.49 + .12) / 2) = 1.52; r = 1.52 / sqrt(1.52^2 + 4) = .61). For 50% happy facial expressions, the tendency to incorrectly say pictures of non-happy faces (e.g., neutral) were happy was also high in the control group (d = -.41 - -.91 / ((.53 + .24) / 2) = 1.95; r = 1.95 / sqrt(1.95^2 + 4) = .70). The second set of results refer to pictures of faces staying on the screen for 2 seconds. For 100% happy facial expressions, the tendency to correctly recognize pictures of happy faces was higher in the control group (d = (-.15 - -.33) / ((.49 + .12) / 2) = 0.93; r = 0.93 / sqrt(0.93^2 + 4) = .42). For 50% happy facial expressions, the tendency to incorrectly say pictures of non-happy faces (e.g., neutral) were happy was also high in the control group (d = -.26 - -.55 / ((.49 + .16) / 2) = 1.43; r = 1.43 / sqrt(1.43^2 + 4) = .58).\n\nTwo similar studies found a non-significant difference between a depressed group and control group on happy facial expression recognition, although the effect size point estimate were meaningful: 1 - (d = (92.2- 87.5) / ((13.4 + 8.4) / 2) = .43, r = .43 / sqrt(.43^2 + 4) = .21) (Leppanen et al., 2004); 2 - (d = ((.82 - .80) + (.82 - .78)) / 2) / ((.07 + .07 + .07 + .06) / 4) = .44, r = .44 / sqrt(.44^2 + 4) = .21) (Milders et al., 2010). In addition, one study found no difference between a depressed group and a control group on happiness facial expression recognition. In the first study, for happy faces, % accuracy was 68.7 in each group (d = 68.7 \u2013 68.7 / ((22.4 + 21.6) / 2) = 0.00, r = 0.00) (Csukly et al., 2009). Three older studies did not report enough statistical information to calculate a correlation coefficient. One did not find any significant differences between happiness facial expression recognition for those with high anxiety (low well-being) and those with low anxiety (high well-being) (Surcinelli et al., 2006). The two other study did find significant differences between happiness facial expression recognition for those with high depression (low well-being) and those with low depression (high well-being) (Mikhailova et al., 1996; Rubinow &amp; Post, 1992). \n\nCsukly, G., Czobor, P., Szily, E., Tak\u00e1cs, B., &amp; Simon, L.

The larger effect sizes are likely a result of extreme group designs comparing individuals with a depression diagnosis and those without many symptoms. Since our study is not using an extreme groups design, we would not expect the larger correlations of r = .50 and above. Therefore, the statistical power for Hypothesis 2 was evaluated for the central range of zero-order correlations for studies using self-report measures: r = .10, r = .20, r = .30, and r = .40. In addition, minimum and maximum expected sample sizes were evaluated: 500 \u2013 (500 * .33) = 335 and 1000 \u2013 (1000 * .33) = 670.

The review suggests previous studies testing associations show correlations ranging from +.03 to +.81. As is common in psychological science, effect sizes differ greater, likely due to methodological factors.\n\nIt seems that the largest effect sizes are from studies that used neuroimaging to measure positive emotion reactivity. A series of studies examining the association between neuroticism (low well-being) and neural activation of brain pleasure centers in response to a short, positive, film segments resulted in correlations between -.63 and -.81 (Britton, Ho, Taylor, &amp; Liberzon, 2007). A different study testing the association between amygdala neutral reactivity to positive picture stimuli and subjective happiness (high well-being) was +.44 and +.49 (Cunningham &amp; Kirkland, 2013). In another study the correlation from the neutral activation of brain pleasure centers in response to positive picture stimuli with psychological well-being was +.47, while the correlation with cortisol levels was -.32 to -.33 (Heller et al., 2013).\n\nIt seems more moderate effect sizes are from studies that used automatic activity to measure positive emotion reactivity. A study found a +.21 correlation between autonomic reactivity indicated by heart rate variability and affect valence when/after viewing positive picture stimuli (Fujimura and Okanoya, 2012). A study testing the association between autonomic reactivity indicated by skin conductance after seeing positive picture stimuli and avoidant attachment (low well-being) found correlations ranging from -.06 to -.38 (Yee &amp; Shiota, 2015).\n\nEffect sizes from studies that used self-report questionnaires to measure positive emotion reactivity were highly variable, ranging from -.15 in the reverse direction to +.45. A study comparing individuals with major depressive disorder (low well-being) to a control group without any depressive disorder (high well-being), found a standardized mean difference of about +1.0 (r = 1.0 / sqrt( 1.0^2 + 4) = +.45) between self-reported affect valence after seeing positive words generated by the participant in an earlier sentence completion task (Avgusta et al., 2005). In addition, a study found that emotional and physical symptoms (low well-being) were not associated (r = +.03) with self-reported happiness ratings after a positive film clip (Dawkins, Acaster, &amp; Powell, 2007). Yet another study compared individuals with depression disorder (low well-being) to a control group without any depression disorder (high well-being), finding a standardized mean difference of d = (2.48 \u2013 2.91) / ((1.78 + 1.04) / 2) = -.30 (r = -.30 / (sqrt(-.30^2 + 4) = -.15, reverse direction) for happiness in response to a happy film clip, d = (3.53 \u2013 2.93) / ((1.34 + 0.88) / 2) = +.54 (r = +.54 / (sqrt(+.54^2 + 4) = +.26) for pride in response to a pride film clip, and d = (2.79 \u2013 2.39) / ((1.10 + 1.10) / 2) = +.36 (r = +.36 / (sqrt(+.36^2 + 4) = +.18) (Gruber, Oveis, Keltner, &amp; Johnson, 2011).

Therefore, the statistical power for Hypothesis 1 was evaluated for the central range of zero-order correlations for studies using self-report measures: r = .10, r = .20, r = .30, and r = .40. In addition, minimum and maximum expected sample sizes were evaluated: 500 \u2013 (500 * .33) = 335 and 1000 \u2013 (1000 * .33) = 670. We assume a Type I error rate of .05.\n\nStatistical Power (1 \u2013 \u03b2)\tN = 335\tN = 670\nr = .10\t.45\t.74\nr = .20\t.96\t.99\nr = .30\t.99\t.99\nr = .40\t.99\t.99\n\nRegarding the effect of positive expression recognition on general well-being, standardized effect sizes ranged from .00 to .70. A meta-analysis of 18 studies comparing individuals with internalizing disorders to controls on overall facial expression recognition was d = .35 (r = .35 / sqrt(.35^2 + 4) = .17) for anxiety disorders and d = .58 (r = .58 / sqrt(.58^2 + 4) = .28) (Demenescu et al., 2010). However, the meta-analysis did not separate out analyses by discrete emotions. One study found that dispositional joy was weakly uncorrelated with the tendency to correctly recognize pictures of happy faces (r = (.03 + .10) / 2 = .07) and the tendency to incorrectly say pictures of non-happy faces (e.g., neutral) were happy (r = (.07 + .25) /2 = .16). Another study found that individuals with a depression disorder vs a control group were worse at identifying happy facial expressions (Surguladze et al., 2004). The first set of results refer to pictures of faces flashing on the screen for 0.1 second. For 100% happy facial expressions, the tendency to correctly recognize pictures of happy faces was higher in the control group (d = -.22 - -.53 / ((.49 + .12) / 2) = 1.52; r = 1.52 / sqrt(1.52^2 + 4) = .61). For 50% happy facial expressions, the tendency to incorrectly say pictures of non-happy faces (e.g., neutral) were happy was also high in the control group (d = -.41 - -.91 / ((.53 + .24) / 2) = 1.95; r = 1.95 / sqrt(1.95^2 + 4) = .70). The second set of results refer to pictures of faces staying on the screen for 2 seconds. For 100% happy facial expressions, the tendency to correctly recognize pictures of happy faces was higher in the control group (d = (-.15 - -.33) / ((.49 + .12) / 2) = 0.93; r = 0.93 / sqrt(0.93^2 + 4) = .42). For 50% happy facial expressions, the tendency to incorrectly say pictures of non-happy faces (e.g., neutral) were happy was also high in the control group (d = -.26 - -.55 / ((.49 + .16) / 2) = 1.43; r = 1.43 / sqrt(1.43^2 + 4) = .58).\n\nTwo similar studies found a non-significant difference between a depressed group and control group on happy facial expression recognition, although the effect size point estimate were meaningful: 1 - (d = (92.2- 87.5) / ((13.4 + 8.4) / 2) = .43, r = .43 / sqrt(.43^2 + 4) = .21) (Leppanen et al., 2004); 2 - (d = ((.82 - .80) + (.82 - .78)) / 2) / ((.07 + .07 + .07 + .06) / 4) = .44, r = .44 / sqrt(.44^2 + 4) = .21) (Milders et al., 2010). In addition, one study found no difference between a depressed group and a control group on happiness facial expression recognition. In the first study, for happy faces, % accuracy was 68.7 in each group (d = 68.7 \u2013 68.7 / ((22.4 + 21.6) / 2) = 0.00, r = 0.00) (Csukly et al., 2009). Three older studies did not report enough statistical information to calculate a correlation coefficient. One did not find any significant differences between happiness facial expression recognition for those with high anxiety (low well-being) and those with low anxiety (high well-being) (Surcinelli et al., 2006).

The larger effect sizes are likely a result of extreme group designs comparing individuals with a depression diagnosis and those without many symptoms. Since our study is not using an extreme groups design, we would not expect the larger correlations of r = .50 and above. Therefore, the statistical power for Hypothesis 2 was evaluated for the central range of zero-order correlations for studies using self-report measures: r = .10, r = .20, r = .30, and r = .40. In addition, minimum and maximum expected sample sizes were evaluated: 500 \u2013 (500 * .33) = 335 and 1000 \u2013 (1000 * .33) = 670. We assume a Type I error rate of .05.\n\nStatistical Power (1 \u2013 \u03b2)\tN = 335\tN = 670\nr = .10\t.45\t.74\nr = .20\t.96\t.99\nr = .30\t.99\t.99\nr = .40\t.99\t.99\n\n", "q15": "After one semester/summer of data collection, if we do not have at least 500 participants, we will do another round of data collection the following semester/summer. We will continue data collection each semester/summer until we have at least 500 participants by the end of that semester/summer. Once we have more than 500 participants after the end of a semester/summer, data collection will stop.", "q20": "In addition to the unstandardized regression coefficients computed by the optimization algorithm, an unstandardized indirect effect and total effect will be calculated as post-estimation transformations. Unstandardized indirect effects will equal A-path unstandardized regression coefficient * B-path unstandardized regression coefficient. Unstandardized total effects will equal Unstandardized indirect effect + Cprime-path (i.e., direct effects are equal to Cprime-path unstandardized regression coefficients). The `lavaan` R package allows for bootstrapping on the post-estimation transformations; therefore, the confidence interval of the unstandardized indirect effects and total effects will also be computed via bootstrapping.\n\nStandardized versions of each effect size will also be calculated via post-estimation transformations. The standardized regression coefficients will equal = unstandardized regression coefficient * standard deviation of the predictor / standard deviation of the outcome.

Or is a participant responded to two of the four Subjective Happiness Scale items, their final composite score would still be included. However, if the participant responded to less than 90 of the facial expression stimuli, then their final composite score would be coded as missing. Missing data at the score level will be handled by the FIML estimator within the SEM (see the Statistical Model section).", "q24": "We will explore any differences in effects across the state positive emotions. Although the confirmatory hypothesis will involve averaging all the state positive emotion items, exploratory analyses will test the individual positive emotions in isolation to see if one or two emotions are driving the effect. We will also explore any differences in effects across the videos. Although the confirmatory hypothesis will involve averaging across the two videos, exploratory analyses will test whether effect sizes are larger for one video or another. Exploratory analyses will also test whether particular positive emotions from one video versus the other have differential effects.

The 45*4 = 180 pictures will be randomized to prevent confounding by order effects.

First, a questionnaire created by the study principle investigator. It is similar to the PANAS and includes 15 emotion adjectives as items (8 positive emotion items will be used) and frequency of emotional experience in the past month as 7 ordinal response options. I will refer to this as the trait positive affect questionnaire. Second, the Dispositional Positive Emotions scale which asks about general frequency and intensity of 7 different positive emotions with 7 ordinal response options. \n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "Positive emotion reactivity will be quantified as the difference in state positive emotion from before and after the videos. The 7 response options for state positive emotion will be numerically coded from 0 to 6. Observed scores will be created by averaging the item response codes and then converting them to percentage of maximum possible (POMP) units to enhance interpretation. Final reactivity scores will be residuals from a simple linear regression of state positive emotion before the first video predicting the average of state positive emotion after the first and second video. A residualized difference score rather than a raw difference score will be used because raw difference scores still contain variance from the subtrahend (i.e., state positive emotion before the videos). As a statistical sensitivity check, data analysis will also be conducted using raw difference scores.\n\nPositive expression recognition will be quantified as minus the average percentage of happiness facial expression morph for pictures that the participant rates as pleasant. Each picture is a morph of a different facial expression, including happiness expression and various negative emotion expressions. Each picture has a percentage of happiness expression associated with it. These percentages will be averaged together, for those pictures that the participant rated as pleasant. The minus of the average percentage is used such that higher values correspond to greater positive expression recognition.\n\nItem responses from each questionnaire will be used to create unit-weighted total scores. The response options will be numerically coded from 0 to 6 for the 7 response option questionnaires (Riverside Life Satisfaction Scale, Subjective Happiness Scale, trait positive affect) and 0 to 3 for the 4 response options questionnaires (Center for Epidemiological Study of Depression \u2013 Depressed Affect subscale). Any negatively valanced items will be reverse coded. Total scores will be created by averaging the item response codes and then converted them to percentage of maximum possible (POMP) units to enhance interpretation.\n\nRegarding the Dispositional Positive Emotions scale, because the original scale development paper found a wide range of inter-subscale correlations from r = .05 to r = .75, we will conduct psychometric tests of the questionnaire to determine an appropriate total score (e.g., exclude certain subscales). Specifically, we will use the omega hierarchical reliability coefficient from a bifactor model to make determinations.", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Structural equation modeling (SEM) will be conducted with the `lavaan` R package.

The mediator of trait positive affect will also not have a measurement model and be a singular manifest variable. The outcome of general well-being will have a latent measurement model with life satisfaction, subjective happiness, and depressed mood as three manifest indicators.\n\nA-paths, B-paths, and Cprime-paths will be specified. No covaried errors between the general well-being indicators and the mediator or predictor(s) will be specified.
