For an outline of the background on this project, please see the main pre-registration entitled \u201cThe Influence of Color on Visual Integration.\u201d\n\nAfter conducting the previous experiment (Experiment 1) we observed a significant color matching effect (excluding trials on which participants reported were guesses as specified in the original preregistered study). The proportion of hits for color-matched and color mismatched trials was 0.712 (SD = 0.150) and 0.680 (SD = 0.166), respectively, t(91) = 3.93, p &lt; .001 , dz = 0.409.\n\nTo determine if the color-matching effect would be enhanced by eliminating the sudden onset of the frame (a form), in Experiment 2, the method will be the same except that a grayscale mosaic frame will be present throughout the sequence (beginning with the fixation point).

Thus the frame (the form) will be a fixture in the sequence and participants will report which picture was present when the color appeared.

And we have added the classic Ishihara test plates (Ishihara, 1917), which are mosaics made of irregular shapes of different colors. When viewed with normal color vision, a numeral can be seen in each of the plates.
