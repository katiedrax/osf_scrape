In addition, we will include a short personality questionnaire. We will correlate all the measures with self-reported Rankings across four videogame genres (MOBAs, RTS, Fighting and FPS). We will additionally construct a \"g-factor\" and correlate that with videogame Rank, expecting a positive correlation (reaction times will be negatively correlated). We will also ask whether videogame performance  peaks in one's twenties as predicted and if it is strongly linked to IQ."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Before we start we need to define how performance is measured in  the videogames we are studying. All games have a form of ranking called Matchmaking Rating (MMR) that is primarily based on winning/losing and is numerical. The higher the MMR the better the player is considered at the game (or at least at winning).\n\nRecently videogames have adopted a system where a player's MMR is hidden or is not readily available to the player and it has been replaced by a form of Divisions/Tiers/Medals. These are discrete variables that are not perfectly accurate and they represent an MMR Range that the player belongs to. For instance a player in a fictional videogame coud be Wood Tier,  Division 1 with his MMR lying anywhere in the range of 100 to 400 MMR whereas a player that is Wood Tier, Division 2 (a Rank above) could have his MMR range from 350 to 600. Thus some partial random overlap is expected (at least when it comes to small samples). In larger samples we expect that this random effect will cancel itself out. \n\nHere whenever we refer to Ranks or Performance we refer to each game's in-game Ranking Label (Divisions,Tiers, Medals etc). Dota 2 is an exception, since aside from the Medals (In-game Rank),  a player's MMR  is displayed in the \"Stats\" Tab which we will additionally use.\n\nWe have the following hypotheses:\n\nDirectional :\n\nAll tests that correlate positively with IQ will also correlate positively with rank. Specifically:\n\n\n1) The Matrix Reasoning test will be positively correlated with Rank ( the r might range from 0.2 to 0.4 depending on how range restricted the sample is). (Kokkinakis, Cowling, Drachen &amp; Wade, 2017)\n2) The numerical test will be positively correlated with Rank (Bonny JW, Castaneda, 2016).\n3) The rotational test will be positively correlated with Rank (Adams &amp; Mayer, 2012).\n4) The Figural Analogy Test will be positively correlated with Rank.\n5) The Santa Barbara Solids Test will be positively correlated with Rank.\n6)The modded HMT will be positively correlated.\n\nIn addition : \n\n6)The simple Reaction Time tests will be negatively correlated with Rank (faster people reach higher Ranks).\n\n7) The complex Reaction Time tests will be negatively correlated with Rank (again faster people will reach higher Rank). \n8) When we measure personality with the HEXACO-60, we expect Emotionality a construct which is similar yet not identical to Neuroticism to be negatively correlated with Rank (pilot data).\n9) A g will be constructed with the Intelligence tests (Jensen &amp; Weng, 1994). This will be positively correlated with Rank.\n10) We believe that,if we plot performance against age for all these types of videogames, we will see a peak and then a  decline into old age (Kokkinakis, Cowling, Drachen &amp; Wade, 2017; Tekofsky, 2015; Thompson et al., 2014).\n11) We expect Maximal Rank achieved to follow a similar pattern as Current Rank (the variable mentioned above as \"Rank\").\n\nNon-directional/Other:\n\n12) We will ask participants to estimate their Maximum Rank they could achieve if they dedicated enough time to \"grind games\".

In addition, we will include a short personality questionnaire. We will correlate all the measures with self-reported Rankings across four videogame genres (MOBAs, RTS, Fighting and FPS). We will additionally construct a \"g-factor\" and correlate that with videogame Rank, expecting a positive correlation (reaction times will be negatively correlated). We will also ask whether videogame performance  peaks in one's twenties as predicted and if it is strongly linked to IQ.", "q4": "Before we start we need to define how performance is measured in  the videogames we are studying. All games have a form of ranking called Matchmaking Rating (MMR) that is primarily based on winning/losing and is numerical. The higher the MMR the better the player is considered at the game (or at least at winning).\n\nRecently videogames have adopted a system where a player's MMR is hidden or is not readily available to the player and it has been replaced by a form of Divisions/Tiers/Medals. These are discrete variables that are not perfectly accurate and they represent an MMR Range that the player belongs to. For instance a player in a fictional videogame coud be Wood Tier,  Division 1 with his MMR lying anywhere in the range of 100 to 400 MMR whereas a player that is Wood Tier, Division 2 (a Rank above) could have his MMR range from 350 to 600. Thus some partial random overlap is expected (at least when it comes to small samples). In larger samples we expect that this random effect will cancel itself out. \n\nHere whenever we refer to Ranks or Performance we refer to each game's in-game Ranking Label (Divisions,Tiers, Medals etc). Dota 2 is an exception, since aside from the Medals (In-game Rank),  a player's MMR  is displayed in the \"Stats\" Tab which we will additionally use.\n\nWe have the following hypotheses:\n\nDirectional :\n\nAll tests that correlate positively with IQ will also correlate positively with rank. Specifically:\n\n\n1) The Matrix Reasoning test will be positively correlated with Rank ( the r might range from 0.2 to 0.4 depending on how range restricted the sample is). (Kokkinakis, Cowling, Drachen &amp; Wade, 2017)\n2) The numerical test will be positively correlated with Rank (Bonny JW, Castaneda, 2016).\n3) The rotational test will be positively correlated with Rank (Adams &amp; Mayer, 2012).\n4) The Figural Analogy Test will be positively correlated with Rank.\n5) The Santa Barbara Solids Test will be positively correlated with Rank.\n6)The modded HMT will be positively correlated.\n\nIn addition : \n\n6)The simple Reaction Time tests will be negatively correlated with Rank (faster people reach higher Ranks).\n\n7) The complex Reaction Time tests will be negatively correlated with Rank (again faster people will reach higher Rank). \n8) When we measure personality with the HEXACO-60, we expect Emotionality a construct which is similar yet not identical to Neuroticism to be negatively correlated with Rank (pilot data).\n9) A g will be constructed with the Intelligence tests (Jensen &amp; Weng, 1994). This will be positively correlated with Rank.\n10) We believe that,if we plot performance against age for all these types of videogames, we will see a peak and then a  decline into old age (Kokkinakis, Cowling, Drachen &amp; Wade, 2017; Tekofsky, 2015; Thompson et al., 2014).\n11) We expect Maximal Rank achieved to follow a similar pattern as Current Rank (the variable mentioned above as \"Rank\").\n\nNon-directional/Other:\n\n12) We will ask participants to estimate their Maximum Rank they could achieve if they dedicated enough time to \"grind games\". This is purely exploratory to see if individuals have realistic estimates of their abilities.\n13) A stepwise regression for each individual genre.\n14) Intraindividual variability of Simple and Complex Reaction times.", "q5": "Registration prior to creation of data", "q6": "NA", "q8": "We will not limit our sample size. We are aiming at over 1,000 individuals for each videogame genre.", "q9": "As mentioned above certain correlations are predicted to be quite weak (Simple Reaction times, Emotionality-Rank) thus a large number of individuals are required.\n\nMoreover, we may need a bigger sample due to the possibility of restricted sampling (an overabundance of average to above average individuals). Finally, data collected through this experiment might be used to aid some researchers' thesis chapters so time is relatively limited.\n\n\n\nI could detect an r of 0.05 with 0.05 confidence interval with 1530 according to this paper.\n\nMoinester, M., &amp; Gottfried, R. (2014). Sample size estimation for correlations with pre-specified confidence interval.

We believe that the peak rank will be in one's twenties there will be a steady decline past the age of 30-35. We will run a one-way ANOVA for each individual game (each game should be treated as its own 'ecosystem'/environment).\n\nIf the participant has provided us with both their Age and the time the time they peaked, a similar analysis will be performed. We expect similar results as above. We do expect a smoother decline with aging and rank with what has been previously observed.\n\n\n", "q22": "Due to the sample size we are aiming for p values will be less than .001 . Even though it appears that we are using a multitude of Performance Tests it should be noted that they are intercorrelated (Positive Manifold) and it is customary in the literature to use a large number of tests.  We will be using one tailed tests between any type of Rank and Intelligence since we are expecting a positive relationship as evidenced in the literature (better individuals tend to reach higher ranks). We will be using however a two-tailed tests in all of the exploratory analyses described below (for instance when looking at the difference between Starcraft 2 Races).", "q23": "Full Participant Rejection:\n\nAll-Questionnaires :\n\nWe will additionally remove participants that have continuously pressed the same Response in a row (3,3,3,3,3 etc).
