These signs of inequality are often highly visible to pedestrians going about their daily routine; they include the sight of homeless people in affluent neighborhoods (Sands, 2017), as well as encounters with unattainable, high-status commercial goods in poor neighborhoods. We test how encounters with these kinds of goods, symbols of extreme wealth, affect the willingness of the poor to support redistributive policies. We base our study in South Africa, a country that consistently ranks among the most unequal in the world. Existing experimental research on the psychology of inequality focuses almost exclusively on advanced democracies, such as the United States and Western Europe. South Africa's exceptionally high level of inequality and relatively recent history of legal segregation make it the ideal setting to explore how exposure to economic inequality affects beliefs and behaviors. Extant research shows that reminders of economic inequality can affect political behavior. With a few notable exceptions, the body of experimental research uses survey experiments to assess the impact of information about national and subnational level inequality on various beliefs and attitudes. Such information -- about overall inequality and about one's place in the income distribution -- can seemingly change a wide range of survey responses and laboratory behaviors, including willingness to redistribute (Cote et al., 2015), cooperation (Nishi et al., 2015), support for organized labor (Kane and Newman, 2017), and beliefs about inequality and economic opportunity (Kuziemko et al., 2015; McCall et al., 2017), mobility (Davidai, 2018), and the legitimacy of inequality (Trump, 2017). At the same time, while an informational mechanism may shape people's beliefs and behaviors, there may also be more direct, and perhaps emotional, reactions to experiences of local inequality. For example, Sands (2017) finds that affluent white individuals become less supportive of a redistributive public policy when they encounter visibly poor white men in wealthy neighborhoods. Relatedly, though observational, DeCelles and Norton (2016) find that encounters with inequality -- operationalized as walking past a first class cabin on an airplane -- lead to antisocial behavior.

We expose black South Africans in low socioeconomic status neighbor hoods to symbols of extreme wealth. We randomize the presence of an expensive high status car, as individuals are approached by a petitioner to support a redistributive policy. We then directly measure subjects' willingness to sign a petition in support of a redistributive policy. In the treatment conditions, pedestrians are primed to think about inequality by the nearby presence of a visible symbol of extreme wealth (i.e., an expensive car parked nearby the petitioner).

Further, a placebo condition is employed, in which individuals' signatures are solicited in the same way (with the same treatment/contr ol assignment) for a petition that is entirely orthogonal to issues of inequality or poverty ( shifting away from nuclear energy to renewable energy). The outcome of interest is how individuals' reactions to the petitioner differ under the different experi mental conditions.

The rise of home-grown terrorism (especially affiliated to Al Qaeda and the Islamic State organisation), the so-called foreign fighters (FFs) phenomenon and the resurgence of the far-right have placed a renewed interest on countering and/or preventing violent extremism. An increasing number of States, international organisations and civil society organisations (CSOs) have developed policies that aim at preventing violent extremism (PVE).

America vary widely by state, with more than 6 million citizens denied the right to vote. How do felony disenfranchisement laws affect citizens, beyond the direct effect of these laws on voter turnout and electoral outcomes? A field experiment leverages recent changes in eligibility to vote among a population of citizens with felony convictions. A series of mobilization treatments are embedded into a panel survey conducted before and after the November 2017 Virginia General Election. Subjects include citizens with felony convictions who have completed their probation \u2013 individuals who had their voting rights taken away, but are eligible to have their rights restored by the Governor. The current VA Governor (Terry McAuliffe) restored voting rights to over 168,000 individuals in the last year, but many of them do not know their rights have been restored. Treatments provide varying information about the restoration of rights, as well as varying assistance with voter registration and turnout. The results estimate how an encouragement toward political inclusion affects attitudes like trust in government, political efficacy, political information, and community involvement. A pilot study was conducted among a similar subject pool during the November 2014 General Election in Akron, Ohio. The results from the pilot were promising, but under-powered, prompting the larger-scale follow-up study during the 2017 Virginia General Election.

I also predict that being mobilized to cast a vote will cause subjects to increase their trust and efficacy.

How do felony disenfranchisement laws affect citizens, beyond the direct effect of these laws on voter turnout and electoral outcomes? A field experiment leverages recent changes in eligibility to vote among a population of citizens with felony convictions. A series of mobilization treatments are embedded into a panel survey conducted before and after the November 2017 Virginia General Election. Subjects include citizens with felony convictions who have completed their probation \u2013 individuals who had their voting rights taken away, but are eligible to have their rights restored by the Governor. The current VA Governor (Terry McAuliffe) restored voting rights to over 168,000 individuals in the last year, but many of them do not know their rights have been restored. Treatments provide varying information about the restoration of rights, as well as varying assistance with voter registration and turnout. The results estimate how an encouragement toward political inclusion affects attitudes like trust in government, political efficacy, political information, and community involvement. A pilot study was conducted among a similar subject pool during the November 2014 General Election in Akron, Ohio. The results from the pilot were promising, but under-powered, prompting the larger-scale follow-up study during the 2017 Virginia General Election. This pre-registration and pre-analysis plan is being submitted before the post-treatment survey, when all outcomes will be estimated. No outcomes have been generated or observed at this point in time.", "q16": "Providing citizens with information and assistance with either the restoration of voting rights and/or voter registration and turnout will cause those citizens to be more likely to register and vote, increase their information about their own voting rights, increase approval about allowing ex-offenders to vote, increase their political information, increase extremism, and increase attitudes like political trust and efficacy. I also predict that being mobilized to cast a vote will cause subjects to increase their trust and efficacy. Finally, I predict that the effects of being mobilized will vary based on a subject\u2019s approval of the electoral outcome, with subjects who approve of the outcome more strongly experiencing stronger increases in efficacy and trust.", "q17": "I will estimate the raw difference in voter registration, turnout, information, and reported attitudes like trust and efficacy across treatment groups, comparing a group that received a placebo to groups who received either assistance with the restoration of voting rights, and/or assistance with the restoration of voting rights along with assistance with voter registration and turnout. I will also estimate the effects of being mobilized to vote by using the assistance with registration and turnout as an instrument that uniquely increases turnout without affecting the DV\u2019s of interest. Finally, I estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by interacting turnout with self-reported approval levels of electoral outcomes.

billion children. Urban life may offer many benefits for children such as access to schools, health and sanitation facilities. However, many children still grow up in households that lack access to these and other basic services. As an example, undernutrition is a serious problem in sub-Saharan urban informal settlements (or slums). This paper focuses on Kenya, a country that is in its early stages of urbanization. Today, less than 30% of the population live in urban areas, but the World Bank estimates that by 2050 this proportion will increase to 50%. 60% of the urban population live in slums, and many households do not have access to basic services such as sanitation and clean water. Another important challenge faced by these households is expensive food: households in the slums of Nairobi spend almost 50\\% of their income on food indicating that the families face difficult consumption trade-offs every day. This is reflected in children's nutrition: more than 50% of 3-year old children in urban slums in Kenya are undernourished To study the topic of nutrition in urban slums, we invite married couples to participate in a laboratory experiment. In the first part of the experiment, each spouse makes individual decisions where they choose between money for themselves and nutritious meals for one of their children. In the second part of the experiment, the spouses sit together and make the same decisions but between money for the two of them as a couple and nutritious meals for one of their children. At the end of the experiment, we ask the couples individual questions about income, consumption, time use and social network. In our analysis, we consider individual preferences and bargaining power.

We expect each of these estimates to be similar in magnitude, but for the primary method described above to produce the estimate with the lowest variance. Since the 2017 elections are low-salience elections, and therefore to have relatively low turnout rates, we will estimate the treatment effect as a change in the log-odds of turnout.", "q18": "United
