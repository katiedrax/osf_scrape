Both survey's will be fielded through Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and analysis will be restricted to respondents who live in the United States. Respondents will be randomly assigned to treatment groups, and I will collect demographic information to test balance across treatment and control groups. First survey Experiment: To test whether respondents perceive merit selection as more fair than gubernatorial selection, I describe each method to respondents briefly. Then, I ask respondents which method they think is more fair. To identify whether respondents' beliefs about the fairness of merit selection procedures depend on the term ``merit,'' I give a treatment group the same information and ask the same questions, but I replace the term ``merit selection'' with ``commission assisted selection.'' If responses are the same across treatment groups, then respondents preferences for or against ``merit selection'' are not due to the term ``merit'' in the name. As a manipulation/attention check. Respondents will be asked to select which institutions they were asked to compare from a list. Analysis H1: To test whether respondents believe merit selection procedures are more (or less) fair than gubernatorial selection, I will compare the proportion of respondents who select gubernatorial selection as more fair to the proportion of respondents who select merit selection as more fair. Analysis H1b: To test whether respondents' beliefs about the fairness of merit selection procedures depend on the term \"merit,'' I will compare the proportion of respondents in each treatment group who do not select gubernatorial selection procedures as more fair. If the proportions are the same across groups who saw \"merit selection'' and \"commission assisted selection,'' then the perception of fairness of these selection systems is not due to the label \"merit.'' In contrast, if more respondents perceive \"merit selection'' as fair than those who saw \"commission assisted selection,'' then we can conclude that the label \"merit'' does affect perceptions of fairness. Second Survey Experiment: For the second survey experiment, respondents are randomly assigned to a selection procedure, either gubernatorial selection or merit selection. They will read information about how the selection procedure works. Then, they will be showed information about 7 judges on the court. The number of women on the court will vary across groups. Respondents will be asked -- based on the outcome of selection -- whether they believe the selection process was fair. Those who indicate that the process is unfair will be asked to explain why and they will be asked to indicate who or what they believe is responsible for the unfairness. There are two treatment variables -- the selection procedure and the number of women -- for a total of six treatment groups. For each level of gender diversity, the proportion of respondents who indicate that the process is unfair will be compared across selection institutions. The expectation is that more respondents will perceive the process as fair under merit selection procedures than under gubernatorial selection procedures (H2). In addition, the difference in perceptions of fairness between merit and gubernatorial selection should be greatest at token levels of diversity (H3). Finally, among those who indicate the process appears unfair, under gubernatorial selection procedures, blame should be consolidated on the governor; under merit selection, blame should be split between the governor and the commission (H4). As a manipulation check, respondents will be asked at the end of the survey how many women were on the court. Analysis H2: I will compare the proportion of respondents who indicate \"definitely unfair'' and ``probably unfair'' across institutional treatments at each level of diversity using a simple difference-in-proportions test. The expectation is that respondents in the merit commission treatment group will be less likely to indicate definitely or probably unfair than those in the gubernatorial selection group (H2). Analysis H3: The difference in perceptions of bias between gubernatorial and merit selection should be greatest among respondents who observed one woman on the bench (H3). To test this hypothesis, I will compare the difference in proportions between gubernatorial and merit selection across levels of diversity. Analysis H4: To test whether the presence of multiple actors obscures blame attribution, I will compare the proportion of respondents who blame the governor across both selection institutions. It may be that the governor is blamed for disparate selections regardless of the presence of a selection commission. However, the expectation is that respondents in the merit selection treatment group will split blame between the governor and the merit commission. I will use difference in proportions tests. Because I making multiple comparisons within a sample, I will report the Bonferroni corrected p-values."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "USA"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "First survey: 750; Second survey: 1500"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "IRB00096415"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "5/10/17"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design", "Survey Methodology"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Gender"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e38566657427b01810c2192", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/x69m8/providers/osfstorage/5e38566657427b01810c2192", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/x69m8/providers/osfstorage/5e38566657427b01810c2192", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/x69m8/providers/osfstorage/5e38566657427b01810c2192?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/x69m8/providers/osfstorage/5e38566657427b01810c2192"}, "attributes": {"etag": "948a61fad86572b28946cd183335ef1069c1c84989eaabd9d061a8330e903fc8", "kind": "file", "name": "20171205AB_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e38566657427b01810c2192", "size": 219935, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "74cab2c111567a8cc005877820dde701", "sha256": "28b46af7ea73fc2a8185fe148f5ab660711df85f45e08b942f44d606a213e84a"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 219935, "modified": "2020-02-03T17:20:38.531850+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "x69m8", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20171205AB_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T17:20:38+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "x69m8", "sha256": "28b46af7ea73fc2a8185fe148f5ab660711df85f45e08b942f44d606a213e84a", "viewUrl": "/project/zvw6x/files/osfstorage/5e38566f57427b01670c6987/", "selectedFileName": "20171205AB_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20171205AB_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Institutional Effects on the Perception of Gender Bias in Judicial Selection", "q2": "Nancy B.

Both survey's will be fielded through Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and analysis will be restricted to respondents who live in the United States. Respondents will be randomly assigned to treatment groups, and I will collect demographic information to test balance across treatment and control groups. First survey Experiment: To test whether respondents perceive merit selection as more fair than gubernatorial selection, I describe each method to respondents briefly. Then, I ask respondents which method they think is more fair. To identify whether respondents' beliefs about the fairness of merit selection procedures depend on the term ``merit,'' I give a treatment group the same information and ask the same questions, but I replace the term ``merit selection'' with ``commission assisted selection.'' If responses are the same across treatment groups, then respondents preferences for or against ``merit selection'' are not due to the term ``merit'' in the name. As a manipulation/attention check. Respondents will be asked to select which institutions they were asked to compare from a list.

Toward that end, I focus on building and operationalizing concepts for measuring combatant support with the goal of better understanding what it means for local security providers to be viewed as legitimate by the general public. The empirical cornerstone of this project is an original survey experiment in Baghdad, where I leverage a series of embedded experiments to investigate how variation in external assistance shapes Iraqi attitudes toward local combatants.

On the one hand, I test hypotheses related to the \"buying hearts and minds\" school of counterinsurgency, namely, that security institutions that perform effectively will be perceived of as legitimate by noncombatants. Under this scope of conditions, local combatants that receive external assistance should receive higher levels of public support than their less-effective counterparts. Second, I test hypotheses related to the ethno-sectarian identity of combats and civilians.

Can external statebuilders build the capacity of local security providers without undermining the perceived legitimacy of these groups in the eyes of the civilian population? This projects investigates how foreign security assistance affects civilian attitudes toward local combatants. Specifically, I am interested in how the attributes of the foreign security assistance -- including the identity of the external statebuilder and local client, as well as the specific means of security assistance -- affect public perceptions of legitimacy for local combatants. Toward that end, I focus on building and operationalizing concepts for measuring combatant support with the goal of better understanding what it means for local security providers to be viewed as legitimate by the general public. The empirical cornerstone of this project is an original survey experiment in Baghdad, where I leverage a series of embedded experiments to investigate how variation in external assistance shapes Iraqi attitudes toward local combatants. This pre-analysis plan includes a provisional theory and hypotheses, resign design, and analysis plan for implementing the survey experiment in the field.", "q16": "This project investigates Iraqi civilian attitudes toward local security providers participating in the anti-ISIL coalition. The goal is to understand how security force assistance provided by an external patron affects public perceptions of legitimacy for local combatants. As such, I test a series of hypotheses looking at the relationship between effective security provision and public perceptions of legitimacy. On the one hand, I test hypotheses related to the \"buying hearts and minds\" school of counterinsurgency, namely, that security institutions that perform effectively will be perceived of as legitimate by noncombatants. Under this scope of conditions, local combatants that receive external assistance should receive higher levels of public support than their less-effective counterparts. Second, I test hypotheses related to the ethno-sectarian identity of combats and civilians. Here I predict ethno-sectarian differences between clients and patrons, as well as an actor's past exposure to political violence, will result in lower levels of support for security assistance to out-group combatants.", "q17": "The proposed hypotheses will be tested using a survey with three embedded experiments, including an endorsement experiment, conjoint analysis, and an identity-priming vignettes.

The electri\fcation of villages in rural Uttar Pradesh has proceeded rapidly in recent years, but the level of consumption has remained well below the national average (India Ministry of Power, 2017). One of the largest hurdles to increasing consumption is that, even in electri\fed villages, many households still lack domestic connections.

Our study thus departs from the dominant lines of research on corruption that focus on detection and punishment and instead asks how civic expectations can be realigned to counteract corruption at the local level.

All combination committees will be trained in the procedures that would be required to earn excellence in revenue sharing. Intervention We propose that each combination project management committee (PMC) / community procurement committee (CPC) will be offered the opportunity to earn recognition if they complete a checklist of items during the implementation phase of revenue sharing. The opportunity to earn recognition will be highlighted both during the training on the checklist and at least bi-weekly via reminder messages sent over the Bwindi Information Network. Control To prevent spillover, the control committee will be explicitly told that while no formal recognition will be offered for completing the checklist, it was designed to help manage the process of implementation to ensure revenue sharing projects are delivered as approved. As outcome variables, we will measure four variables (described in greater detail in the pre-analysis plan): number of checklist items completed, proportion of projects completed as approved,

positive recognition for local leaders who forego corruption and work diligently to manage local projects will decrease corruption in a national park revenue-sharing program in western Uganda. We will implement a randomized field experiment and linked ethnographic field study to test whether offering community recognition for the successful planning and implementation of revenue-sharing projects, along with associated radio announcements and public ceremonies that praise good governance, will result in more equitable planning and better delivery of revenue-sharing projects. Our study thus departs from the dominant lines of research on corruption that focus on detection and punishment and instead asks how civic expectations can be realigned to counteract corruption at the local level. We compare outcomes in villages that are made experimentally eligible for positive recognition to those villages that do not have eligibility for recognition.", "q16": "Our hypotheses are: Eligibility for recognition will cause committees to exert more effort and diligence in managing revenue sharing projects.

Eligibility for recognition will change committee members\u2019 norms and beliefs about corruption and mismanagement.

All combination committees will be trained in the procedures that would be required to earn excellence in revenue sharing. Intervention We propose that each combination project management committee (PMC) / community procurement committee (CPC) will be offered the opportunity to earn recognition if they complete a checklist of items during the implementation phase of revenue sharing. The opportunity to earn recognition will be highlighted both during the training on the checklist and at least bi-weekly via reminder messages sent over the Bwindi Information Network. Control To prevent spillover, the control committee will be explicitly told that while no formal recognition will be offered for completing the checklist, it was designed to help manage the process of implementation to ensure revenue sharing projects are delivered as approved. As outcome variables, we will measure four variables (described in greater detail in the pre-analysis plan): number of checklist items completed, proportion of projects completed as approved, punishment in cooperation game (lab-in-field), and cheating in cooperation game (lab-in-field).", "q18": "Uganda", "q19": "58 village committees as of registration; 18 add'l expected", "q20": "Yes",

Two decades of instability and conflict has led to the erosion of the state\u2019s capacity to provide basic services. It has also weakened communities\u2019 ability to be informed, to mobilize for collective action, and to monitor and influence frontline service providers. In Eastern Congo, the local governance system related to service delivery is thus largely unresponsive to the service delivery needs and priorities of the population. It is against this backdrop that in 2007, funded by UK\u2019s DFID, the IRC and CARE International implemented the Tuungane program (\u201cTuungane\u201d means \u201clet\u2019s unite\u201d in Swahili). A first phase was implemented between 2007 and 2012. A second phase took place between 2012 and 2015. In 2015, Tuungane implemented an extension called Tuungane 2+ (or T2+) to ensure sustainability of the second phase. T2+ is implemented in 485 communities in three provinces of Eastern Congo: South Kivu, Haut Katanga and Tanganyika, reaching approximately one million beneficiaries. The components of the T2+ program include (a) capacity building of recently decentralized government units (so-called \u201cETDs\u201d), (b) radio-related activities to support accountability and citizen participation in local governance, (c) a gender pilot aimed to improve women\u2019s possibilities for effectively participating in, and influencing, community decision-making, and (d) grant projects in communities with a grant sizes of $8,990 in the health and education sectors and $2,358 for water and sanitation sectors.

The Tuungane 2+ program takes the form of an experiment.

Enumerators will provide 22 brochures (11 to the user committee, 11 to the service provider) about the results of the Tuungane 2 impact evaluation. In addition, the user committee and service provider are given the task to draft a response to the international development community about the community\u2019s needs and priorities.

As part of this activity, we aim to collect information about the quality of service delivery in the village. Do the user committee and service providers actively undertake activities (e.g. a community meeting) to spread information related to the Tuungane 2 program? Are the brochures spread throughout the village? Will the user committee and service provider work together to draft the response?

For example, a set of enumerators will visit the user committee and service provider related to the sector that received the Tuungane project 10 days before the data collection. Enumerators will provide 22 brochures (11 to the user committee, 11 to the service provider) about the results of the Tuungane 2 impact evaluation. In addition, the user committee and service provider are given the task to draft a response to the international development community about the community\u2019s needs and priorities. We leave the actors free how they want to write this document. We only provide a set of minimal guideline of what should be in the document. Importantly, in order not to raise expectations, we emphasize throughout that there is no future program planned for their village. As part of this activity, we aim to collect information about the quality of service delivery in the village. Do the user committee and service providers actively undertake activities (e.g. a community meeting) to spread information related to the Tuungane 2 program? Are the brochures spread throughout the village? Will the user committee and service provider work together to draft the response? Do the user committee and service providers actively undertake activities (e.g. a community meeting) to learn about the opinion of the villagers? Do villagers meet with the user committee or service providers to present their opinion? Do the needs and priorities mentioned in the document reflect those of the population?", "q18": "The Democratic Republic of Congo", "q19": "339", "q20": "Yes", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "",

that deforestation is responsible for 12% of anthropogenic carbon emissions (van der Werf et al., 2009). As such, reducing deforestation is considered one of the most cost-effective ways of reducing carbon emissions (Stern, 2006). Although the majority of the world\u2019s forest area is administered by governments, a small but growing proportion of forest area is officially designated to be managed by Indigenous People and local communities. In the continent of Africa in particular, the share of forest area that is officially designated as such has increased from 3.9 per cent in 2002 to 5.8 per cent in 2013. These estimates do not include any formally government administered forest area that is de facto managed by local communities or Indigenous People because of weaknesses in enforcement of government legislation. The appeal of community forest management appears widespread, with \u201cnearly every country in the world [\u2026] experimenting with some form of \u2018Community Forestry\u2019\u201d (Edmonds, 2002). At the international level, the REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) aims to avoid deforestation. Communities are envisioned to contribute to measurement of carbon stocks embodied in forests as required by REDD+ Monitoring Reporting and Verification (MRV) (Government of Uganda, 2011; Kenya Forest Serivce, 2010). Deforestation is an important problem in Uganda, with some coining the deforestation rate in Uganda as the \u201chighest in East Africa\u201d (Banana, Bukenya, Arinaitwe, Birabwa, & Ssekindi, 2012). According to data from Global Forest Watch, 38 per cent of the land area in Uganda is covered by forest, and Ugandan forests are under a high risk of deforestation. The annual deforestation rate in Uganda amounted to 5.7% between 2001 and 2014. Deforestation and land use change contribute 37.6 percent to Uganda\u2019s Greenhouse Gas emissions in 2011 (FAO data). Communities in Uganda play an important role both in forest management as well as in deforestation. Communities can (co)manage forests that are collectively privately owned, that are registered as community forests, or that are covered by a Collaborative Forest Management agreement (Government of Uganda, 2003). Correspondingly, one of Uganda\u2019s National Forestry policy objectives linked to REDD+ is to \u201cpromote innovative approaches to community participation in forest management\u201d. However, communities also engage in charcoal production, firewood harvesting, and livestock grazing, which are three out of the seven main drivers of deforestation as identified by Uganda\u2019s REDD+ Readiness Preparation Proposal (Government of Uganda, 2011). The Ugandan REDD+ Readiness Preparation Proposal furthermore envisions that communities could be involved in forest monitoring under REDD+ MRV. It recognizes that communities, with support from NGOs have contributed to high-quality monitoring systems in other countries, such as Nepal.

The ideal design for this study would follow the regression discontinuity approach employed by Hainmueller et al3 and compare differences in birth outcomes after DACA passage for foreign-born women just above/below the birthdate cutoff (June 19, 1981). Nevertheless, power calculations using simulated data indicate that we would be only powered to detect unrealistically large (e.g. 1 standard deviation) with this strategy, in part because of the relatively low uptake of DACA among women who would be classified as DACA recipients.

In this approach, women will be identified as likely eligible or ineligible based on demographic characteristics (e.g. foreign-born, maternal ethnicity, educational characteristics, area of residence), age (i.e. < 31 years of age versus > 31 before June 15, 2012), and payment source listed in the birth record (if available). While the DID design is better powered, it comes with assumptions that trends in outcomes for treatment and control groups would otherwise be similar if it were not for DACA passage/implementation and that DACA implementation would not contribute to changes in the composition of births (e.g. by maternal characteristics) for treatment or control groups. These assumptions may be unrealistic, particularly given that DACA was linked to improved labor market and economic outcomes \u2013 both of which may have influenced fertility.9 To our knowledge, one study has demonstrated reduced fertility among adolescent girls/young women after DACA implementation.9 While the parallel trends assumption cannot be directly tested, we will evaluate whether trends in each of the birth outcomes (listed below) looked similar at 1 and 2 years pre-DACA passage for treatment and control groups using California birth records.
