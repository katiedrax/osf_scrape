Respondents in the treatment group will complete two manipulation-check questions. They will be first asked what the visual stimulus is about. I will consider dropping those respondents who fail to answer this question correctly from analysis. Respondents will then be instructed to recall their experiences of feeling proud of their own nation or an incident that Significant Other nation inflicted harm on their nation. This recalling exercise itself has an effect in stimulating targeted feelings (Landau et al. 2004; Lambert et al. 2010), so this will make respondents\u2019 nationalistic sentiments even more salient, ensuring that the respondents in the treatment groups become sufficiently nationalistic to detect the hypothesized effect.

First, to measure the preference for means, the respondents will be asked their opinion about policy regarding a territorial dispute, whether they think that the government should take a more hawkish approach, a more dovish approach or maintain the status quo. Second, the preference for outcomes will be measured by asking how respondents assess an incomplete foreign policy outcome, a partial seizure of the islands in dispute (satisfaction, 0-10 scale).

Furthermore, respondents are asked about the extent to which their preference might be altered by additional information about the candidates, and about the types of information that would have the greatest influence over their preference.

The first set of questions concerns the relationship between candidate differentiation and voters' receptiveness to information: (1) Are there dimensions of candidate differentiation which will cause voters to ignore further information? (2) What type of information will sway indifferent voters? (3) What is the (observational) relationship between voter indifference and intent to vote? The second set of questions focuses on the mechanisms by which local political support is sustained, specifically in the Burkinabe context. In order to explain the local-level impact of the national-level political transition in Burkina Faso, it is crucial to understand whether voting in local-level elections is partisan or personalistic. We will therefore investigate the following additional questions: (4) In the municipal elections, will voters turn away from local-level supporters of former president Blaise Compaore, even though many established local politicians were and continue to be affiliated with the CDP? (5) Can local-level supporters of former president Blaise Compaore gain from switching parties?

The objective is to shed light on the effects of different forms of candidate differentiation on voter preferences and voter decidedness in the run-up to the transitional municipal elections in Burkina Faso. Survey respondents are asked about their preference between two imaginary mayoral candidates, who are characterized by eight randomly varied attributes, along which the two candidates may or may not differ. Furthermore, respondents are asked about the extent to which their preference might be altered by additional information about the candidates, and about the types of information that would have the greatest influence over their preference. The research design and experimental variations are described in greater detail in the pre-analysis plan.", "q16": "The survey experiment was designed to address two distinct sets of research questions.

(2) What type of information will sway indifferent voters? (3) What is the (observational) relationship between voter indifference and intent to vote? The second set of questions focuses on the mechanisms by which local political support is sustained, specifically in the Burkinabe context. In order to explain the local-level impact of the national-level political transition in Burkina Faso, it is crucial to understand whether voting in local-level elections is partisan or personalistic. We will therefore investigate the following additional questions: (4) In the municipal elections, will voters turn away from local-level supporters of former president Blaise Compaore, even though many established local politicians were and continue to be affiliated with the CDP?
