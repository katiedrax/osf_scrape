behaviors", "description": "The existence of ovulatory cycle shifts in women\u2019s mate preferences has been discussed controversially. There is evidence that naturally cycling women in their fertile phase, compared to their luteal phase, evaluate specific behavioral cues in men as more attractive for sexual relationships. However, recent research has cast doubt on these findings. We addressed this debate in a large, pre-registered within-subject study including salivary hormone measures and luteinizing hormone tests. One-hundred-fifty-seven female participants rated natural videos of 70 men in dyadic intersexual interactions on sexual and long-term attractiveness. Multilevel comparisons across two ovulatory cycles indicated that women\u2019s mate preferences for men\u2019s behaviors did not shift across the cycle, neither for competitive, nor for courtship behavior. Hormone levels and relationship status did not affect these results. Hormonal mechanisms and implications for estrus theories are discussed.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-02-27T17:23:20.327168", "date_modified":

Individuals, with a focus on bone health, lung function and skeletal muscle physiology. A question of advantage or disadvantage?", "description": "In 2015, the IOC allowed Transgender Athletes to compete after 1 year of HRT and without SRS (1). A primary concern is that TW develop permanent physiological features that give them a performance advantage over cis-women. Prior research has focused primarily on observational studies with no or limited evidence of change in body composition (2) and bone (3). There is also a lack of data on MTFT lung function. The aim: track TW individuals during their HRT cycle to quantify changes in body composition, bone health, muscle fibre physiology and lung function to further clarify if TW individuals retain an advantage.\nGlossary of Terms\nIOC: international Olympic Committee\nHRT: Hormone Replacement Therapy\nSRS: Sexual Reassignment Surgery\nTW: Transwomen\n\nReferences\n1.\tJ.

coronavirus COVID-19 spread around the globe, leading to a pandemic which killed thousands of people across countries. Multiple countries implemented unprecedent policies to stop its spread including harsh demands for physical distancing and increased hygienic behaviors. Although COVID-19 was not the first pandemic in human history, it was the first within the digital society and the world health organization (WHO) rapidly warned that the pandemic was accompanied by a large-scale \u2018infodemic\u2019\u2014\u201can over-abundance of information \u2013some accurate and some not \u2013that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance\u201d (Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov), 2020). Concerns were large that citizens confrontation with \u2018polluted\u2019 (Phillips &amp; Milner, forthcomming) misleading and purposefully distorted information in this environment could impair the global fight against the pandemic. \nThe current study addresses this concern. Using the differential susceptibility to media effects model (Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2013) as theoretical framework and a random-quota survey of the German population as data base, we examined the role of socio-demographics, citizens generalized ideological attitudes (right-wing authoritarianism, conspiracy mentality, intolerance for uncertainty, extreme political leanings), their trust in information authorities, intolerance of uncertainty, as well as the influence of their personal involvement and news media use for their emotional response to the situation (corona-related state uncertainty), their exposure to and belief in distorted news about COVID-19 (medical and conspiracy-theoretical falsehoods), and their COVID-19 related behavior. \nParts of the study formed the Master-thesis of the second author (Lara Kuhfeldt), which studied the role of uncertainty for conspiracy theories around the COVID-19 crisis. In consequence, predictions related to intolerance for uncertainty, trust in society and corona-related uncertainty are not entailed in this pre-registration but can be found in the sub-project \"uncertainty and conspiracy theories\".", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-03-27T15:25:41.961596", "date_modified": "2020-03-27T15:29:21.343349", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["alternative news media", "conspiracy mentality", "conspiracy theories", "corona-virus", "covid-19", "disinformation", "Germany", "media trust", "right-wing authoritarianism", "survey"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "425f6e2f0d3fb7c7aef1d3c7a38ad857864320e68f1f82ae7daece635c6ca26a374d42e32a13f9f9ffa4b6fc3605af6c43a5252fa060fb8e33f62b4b044a5f35f07329a3e4218aca3260da8a03ad7d2eb030c1c47a310d35a86b0e70f545219d3f9f9ad24492d4efa9931fd25b8567916c7d8e38400e13054bbf10fa58be529f6e19c1c4f63ae3f841ccfccb27873e9a", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-03-27T15:25:41.924129", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Lena Frischlich"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "The overarching theoretical framework of our model is the differential susceptibility to media effects model (Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2013, p. 226). The DSMM provides a comprehensive formalization for media effects on individual recipients. The DSMM\u2019s basic assumption is that media effects can be understood as a combination of conditional and indirect effects. Conditional effects emerge from three types of so-called susceptibility variables: individual\u2019s disposition (e.g., their attitudes or personality), their developmental state (e.g. whether the recipient is a child), and their social situation. On the one hand, susceptibility variables predict media use. For instance, individuals with a fundamentalist (Bronstein et al. 2019) or conservative disposition engage more actively with distorted news (Guess et al., 2020). On the other hand, susceptibility variables moderate recipients\u2019 responses to media content. For instance, prejudice decreases internal resistance against stereotypical news (Arendt, 2016). Indirect effects are driven by recipients\u2019 responses to media content. The DSMM distinguishes three response types: cognitive (e.g., internal counterarguing), emotional (e.g., anger), and, closely related, \u201cexcitatory\u201d responses (e.g., a faster heartbeat). The survey combines the data collection for different research foci around this general model. We will partially address the different research foci in separate papers.\nResearch focus 1 (R1): Which factors predict alternative and non-traditional news use during the pandemic?\nHypotheses and Research questions for R1: \nH.1.1 Distrust increases the turning towards alternative news sources (Tsfati, 2010; Tsfati &amp; Peri, 2006): \n(a)\tPeople with low levels of trust will use more alternative news websites. \n(b)\tPeople with low levels of trust will use more non-traditional news gateways.\nH.1.2. Conspiracy mentality increases the turning towards alternative news sources with (Castanho Silva et al., 2017)\n(c)\tPeople with high levels of conspiracy mentality will use more alternative news websites. \n(d)\tPeople with high levels of conspiracy mentality will use more non-traditional news gateways.\nH.1.3. RWA increases the turning towards right-wing and foreign-based alternative news sources (Lavine et al., 2005)\nH.1.4. Extreme political leanings increase the turning towards ideology-consistent alternative news sources  (M\u00fcller &amp; Schulz, 2019) \nH.1.5. Extreme political leanings increase the turning towards non-traditional news gateways.\nResearch focus 2 (R2): Which factors predict exposure to distorted news surrounding COVID-19?\nH.2.1. Using non-traditional news gateways is associated with a larger exposure to distorted news about COVID-19 (Guess et al., 2020)\nH.2.2. Using alternative news media is associated with a larger exposure to distorted news about COVID-19.\nResearch focus 3 (R3): Who believes in distorted news about COVID-19?\nRQ 3.1) How credible are distorted as compared to factual news about COVID-19? \nH3.1. People who have seen distorted news before, assign them a higher believability (Pennycook et al., 2017)\nH.3.2 Conspiracy mentality will moderate the relationship between exposure to and belief in distorted news. People scoring higher on conspiracy mentality will belief more in distorted news (Halpern et al., 2019). \nH.3.3 RWA will moderate the relationship between exposure to and belief in distorted news. People scoring higher on RWA will belief more in distorted news (Frischlich et al. under review)\nH3.4 Media trust will moderate the relationship between exposure to and belief in distorted news. People who trust the (mainstream) media belief less in distorted news (Zimmermann &amp; Kohring, 2020). \nResearch focus 4 (R4): Who amplifies distorted news about COVID-19?\nH 4.1. Higher believe in distorted news predicts higher amplification intentions. \nH 4.2 Higher believe in of distorted news predicts more \u2018infodemic\u2019 behavior.  \nH 4.3. Participants report higher amplification intentions for distorted news that match their attitudes. \n1.\tHigher levels of conspiracy mentality predict higher amplifications intentions for distorted news. \n2.\tThis association is stronger for conspiracy-theoretical distorted news compared to distorted news without conspiracy-theoretical elements.  \n3.\tHigher levels of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) predict higher amplification intentions for conspiracy-theoretical distorted news. \n4.\tLower levels of media trust predict higher amplification intentions for distorted news with and without conspiracy theoretical elements.\nH 4.3. Distrustful participants report more pollution behaviors. \n1.\tHigher levels of conspiracy mentality predict more infodemic behaviors.\n2.\tLower levels of trust predict more infodemic behaviors.\nH 4.3. Users of alternative news media report higher amplification intentions for distorted news about COVID-19. \nH 4.3 Users of alternative news media report more \u2018infodemic\u2019 behaviors. \nResearch focus 5: Behavioral consequences of the believe in distorted news about COVID-19.\nH.5.1: Believe in distorted news will be associated negatively with healthy behavior.\nH.5.2: Believe in of distorted news will be associated positively with dysfunctional behavior.\nResearch Focus 6 (R6): Indirect Effects of the Exposure to Distorted News on Behavior\nH 6.1 We expect that the relationships between exposure and healthy behavior will be mediated by the believability of distorted news (indirect effect)\nH 6.2 We expect that the relationships between exposure and dysfunctional behavior will be mediated by the believability of distorted news (indirect effect). \n"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

Multiple answers were possible.\n\u2022\tNon-traditional news gateways: From the Reuters digital news report (Newman et al., 2019): Social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter), other online news. In addition: Self-developed items tackling \u201cInstant messengers (like WhatsApp/Telegram/Facebook Messenger)\u201d, \u201cYouTube\u201d, \u201cPeople I know personally (e.g. friends and family)\u201d, \u201cgroups within social networks\u201d, and \u201cpodcasts\u201d.

As we aimed of balance in terms of political leaning of the outlets, participants reported for six outlets whether they had used them in the last week: Indy media and Junge Welt as left-leaning sources, Politically incorrect news (PI-news), and Junge Freiheit as right-wing leaning sources, Russia today and epoch times as sources with foreign roots. Furthermore, we asked for \u201cother\u201d alternative news sources and participants were able to state that they did not use any \u2018alternative news source\u2019. Multiple answers were possible. \n\u2022\tCovid-19 news. In the next step, we asked participants for their main news source for information about \u201cthe corona-virus\u201d.  The items were largely the same as for news sources, but we added options for \u201calternative news sources (e.g. PI-news, Indymedia, RT)\u201d, \u201cofficial sources (e.g. ministries, the Robert-Koch Institute)\u201d, as well as one attention item \u201cI did not witness news about the corona-virus\u201d, and one miscellaneous option. Here, only one option could be selected. \nTrust\n\u2022\tWe measured trust in the established or \u2018mainstream\u2019 media with three items, (\u201cThe established media report in a balanced manner\u201d, \u201cthe reports of the established media are precise\u201d, \u201cthe established media depict events fully\u201d) created by Bl\u00f6baum (2018) and answered on a 5-point scale (1= \u201cnot applying\u201d, 5 = \u201cfully applying\u201d).\n\u2022\tWe measured trust in the political system with two self-created questions: \u201cHow much do you trust the German government in handling the current situation around the corona-virus?\u201d and \u201chow much do you trust the health-politic of your country to deal with the corona virus SARS-CoV-2?\u201d \u2013 both answered on a 5-point scale (1= \u201cnot at all\u201d, 5 = \u201cvery much\u201d).\nPersonal involvement\n\u2022\tTo account for recipients personal involvement with the corona-pandemic, we asked whether they or a close-other belonged to a risk-group following the guidelines by the German Robert-Koch institute (yes, no, I don\u2019t want to answer), and whether they were in personal contact with the virus by asking them whether they were \u201ctested positively for the virus\u201d, \u201cwere in official quarantine due to the corona-virus\u201d, or \u201cwhether a close other had been tested positively\u201d. Multiple answers were possible. \nUncertainty due to Corona\n\u2022\tWe measured corona-related uncertainty with a single item: \u201cI feel uncertain due to the current situation related to the corona-virus\u201d (1 = \u201cfully disagree\u201d, 5 = \u201cfully agree\u201d). \n\u2003\nResponse to the news headlines\n\u2022\tAfter each headline, participants rated its familiarity, believability and their amplification intentions. All items were answered on 5-point scales (1 = \u201cabsolutely not applying\u201d, 5 = \u201cfully applying\u201d)\n\u2022\tFamiliarity was measured via a single recall statement: \u201cI remember that I have seen this news or have discussed about this news\u201d.\n\u2022\tBelievability was measured with two items: \u201cThis news is credible\u201d and \u201cThis news is certainly true\u201d. \n\u2022\tAmplification intentions were measured with three items: \u201cI would evaluate this news with a \u2018like\u2019\u201d, \u201cI would forward this news\u201d, and \u201cI would like to know more about this news\u201d\nCorona-motivated behavior\n\u2022\tHealthy behavior: Three of the behaviors reflected recommendations by the World-health organization and the German Robert-Koch institute (\u201cI have washed or disinfected my hand and/or objects mor often\u201d, \u201cI have cancelled a meeting with friends at home\u201d, and \u201cI have physically distanced from people, I usually shake hands with or hug\u201d).\n\u2022\tDysfunctional behavior was measured with two items: \u201cI have bought more supplies than usual\u201d, and \u201cI thought to myself: Now more than ever: Better sick now before intensive care units are overburdened\u201d \n\u2022\t\u2018infodemic behavior\u2019: was measured with two items: \u201cI doubted the \u2018mainstream\u2019 media reports\u201d, \u201cI forwarded WhatsApp messages where I did not know the original sender in person\u201d.\nFor all behaviors, participants were asked how often they executed them due to the \u201ccorona-pandemic\u201d (1 = \u201dnever\u201d, 5 = \u201calways\u201d).\n\u2003\nAttitudes\n\u2022\tWe measured RWA with the nine-item scale by Beierlein et al. (2014). \n\u2022\tWe measured Conspiracy mentality with the 5-item scale by Bruder et al. (2013)\nPersonality\n\u2022\tWe measured intolerance for uncertainty with 9-items by Carleton et al. (2007). \nSelf-estimated quality/data retraction option\nTo allow for data retraction, we included a self-estimated quality question. Participants were asked to select between \u201cI have answered the questionnaire as good as possible, although I might have been uncertain once in a while. My data can be used\u201d versus \u201cI answered the questionnaire only for interest, my data should not be used\u201d.

The DSMM provides a comprehensive formalization for media effects on individual recipients. The DSMM\u2019s basic assumption is that media effects can be understood as a combination of conditional and indirect effects. Conditional effects emerge from three types of so-called susceptibility variables: individual\u2019s disposition (e.g., their attitudes or personality), their developmental state (e.g. whether the recipient is a child), and their social situation. On the one hand, susceptibility variables predict media use. For instance, individuals with a fundamentalist (Bronstein et al. 2019) or conservative disposition engage more actively with distorted news (Guess et al., 2020). On the other hand, susceptibility variables moderate recipients\u2019 responses to media content. For instance, prejudice decreases internal resistance against stereotypical news (Arendt, 2016). Indirect effects are driven by recipients\u2019 responses to media content. The DSMM distinguishes three response types: cognitive (e.g., internal counterarguing), emotional (e.g., anger), and, closely related, \u201cexcitatory\u201d responses (e.g., a faster heartbeat). The survey combines the data collection for different research foci around this general model. We will partially address the different research foci in separate papers.\nResearch focus 1 (R1): Which factors predict alternative and non-traditional news use during the pandemic?\nHypotheses and Research questions for R1: \nH.1.1 Distrust increases the turning towards alternative news sources (Tsfati, 2010; Tsfati &amp; Peri, 2006): \n(a)\tPeople with low levels of trust will use more alternative news websites. \n(b)\tPeople with low levels of trust will use more non-traditional news gateways.\nH.1.2. Conspiracy mentality increases the turning towards alternative news sources with (Castanho Silva et al., 2017)\n(c)\tPeople with high levels of conspiracy mentality will use more alternative news websites. \n(d)\tPeople with high levels of conspiracy mentality will use more non-traditional news gateways.\nH.1.3. RWA increases the turning towards right-wing and foreign-based alternative news sources (Lavine et al., 2005)\nH.1.4. Extreme political leanings increase the turning towards ideology-consistent alternative news sources  (M\u00fcller &amp; Schulz, 2019) \nH.1.5. Extreme political leanings increase the turning towards non-traditional news gateways.\nResearch focus 2 (R2): Which factors predict exposure to distorted news surrounding COVID-19?\nH.2.1. Using non-traditional news gateways is associated with a larger exposure to distorted news about COVID-19 (Guess et al., 2020)\nH.2.2. Using alternative news media is associated with a larger exposure to distorted news about COVID-19.\nResearch focus 3 (R3): Who believes in distorted news about COVID-19?\nRQ 3.1) How credible are distorted as compared to factual news about COVID-19? \nH3.1. People who have seen distorted news before, assign them a higher believability (Pennycook et al., 2017)\nH.3.2 Conspiracy mentality will moderate the relationship between exposure to and belief in distorted news. People scoring higher on conspiracy mentality will belief more in distorted news (Halpern et al., 2019). \nH.3.3 RWA will moderate the relationship between exposure to and belief in distorted news. People scoring higher on RWA will belief more in distorted news (Frischlich et al. under review)\nH3.4 Media trust will moderate the relationship between exposure to and belief in distorted news. People who trust the (mainstream) media belief less in distorted news (Zimmermann &amp; Kohring, 2020). \nResearch focus 4 (R4): Who amplifies distorted news about COVID-19?\nH 4.1. Higher believe in distorted news predicts higher amplification intentions. \nH 4.2 Higher believe in of distorted news predicts more \u2018infodemic\u2019 behavior.  \nH 4.3.

As we aimed of balance in terms of political leaning of the outlets, participants reported for six outlets whether they had used them in the last week: Indy media and Junge Welt as left-leaning sources, Politically incorrect news (PI-news), and Junge Freiheit as right-wing leaning sources, Russia today and epoch times as sources with foreign roots.

The items were largely the same as for news sources, but we added options for \u201calternative news sources (e.g. PI-news, Indymedia, RT)\u201d, \u201cofficial sources (e.g. ministries, the Robert-Koch Institute)\u201d, as well as one attention item \u201cI did not witness news about the corona-virus\u201d, and one miscellaneous option. Here, only one option could be selected. \nTrust\n\u2022\tWe measured trust in the established or \u2018mainstream\u2019 media with three items, (\u201cThe established media report in a balanced manner\u201d, \u201cthe reports of the established media are precise\u201d, \u201cthe established media depict events fully\u201d) created by Bl\u00f6baum (2018) and answered on a 5-point scale (1= \u201cnot applying\u201d, 5 = \u201cfully applying\u201d).\n\u2022\tWe measured trust in the political system with two self-created questions: \u201cHow much do you trust the German government in handling the current situation around the corona-virus?\u201d and \u201chow much do you trust the health-politic of your country to deal with the corona virus SARS-CoV-2?\u201d \u2013 both answered on a 5-point scale (1= \u201cnot at all\u201d, 5 = \u201cvery much\u201d).\nPersonal involvement\n\u2022\tTo account for recipients personal involvement with the corona-pandemic, we asked whether they or a close-other belonged to a risk-group following the guidelines by the German Robert-Koch institute (yes, no, I don\u2019t want to answer), and whether they were in personal contact with the virus by asking them whether they were \u201ctested positively for the virus\u201d, \u201cwere in official quarantine due to the corona-virus\u201d, or \u201cwhether a close other had been tested positively\u201d. Multiple answers were possible. \nUncertainty due to Corona\n\u2022\tWe measured corona-related uncertainty with a single item: \u201cI feel uncertain due to the current situation related to the corona-virus\u201d (1 = \u201cfully disagree\u201d, 5 = \u201cfully agree\u201d). \n\u2003\nResponse to the news headlines\n\u2022\tAfter each headline, participants rated its familiarity, believability and their amplification intentions. All items were answered on 5-point scales (1 = \u201cabsolutely not applying\u201d, 5 = \u201cfully applying\u201d)\n\u2022\tFamiliarity was measured via a single recall statement: \u201cI remember that I have seen this news or have discussed about this news\u201d.\n\u2022\tBelievability was measured with two items: \u201cThis news is credible\u201d and \u201cThis news is certainly true\u201d. \n\u2022\tAmplification intentions were measured with three items: \u201cI would evaluate this news with a \u2018like\u2019\u201d, \u201cI would forward this news\u201d, and \u201cI would like to know more about this news\u201d\nCorona-motivated behavior\n\u2022\tHealthy behavior: Three of the behaviors reflected recommendations by the World-health organization and the German Robert-Koch institute (\u201cI have washed or disinfected my hand and/or objects mor often\u201d, \u201cI have cancelled a meeting with friends at home\u201d, and \u201cI have physically distanced from people, I usually shake hands with or hug\u201d).\n\u2022\tDysfunctional behavior was measured with two items: \u201cI have bought more supplies than usual\u201d, and \u201cI thought to myself: Now more than ever: Better sick now before intensive care units are overburdened\u201d \n\u2022\t\u2018infodemic behavior\u2019: was measured with two items: \u201cI doubted the \u2018mainstream\u2019 media reports\u201d, \u201cI forwarded WhatsApp messages where I did not know the original sender in person\u201d.\nFor all behaviors, participants were asked how often they executed them due to the \u201ccorona-pandemic\u201d (1 = \u201dnever\u201d, 5 = \u201calways\u201d).\n\u2003\nAttitudes\n\u2022\tWe measured RWA with the nine-item scale by Beierlein et al. (2014). \n\u2022\tWe measured Conspiracy mentality with the 5-item scale by Bruder et al. (2013)\nPersonality\n\u2022\tWe measured intolerance for uncertainty with 9-items by Carleton et al.

To represent non-traditional news gateways, we will calculate a dummy- variable representing whether participants used any of the non-traditional news sources in the last week. To represent alternative news use, we will calculate a dummy- variable representing whether participants used any of the alternative news (including \u201cother alternative news\u201d) in the last week.

In these analyses, RWA; conspiracy mentality, political extremity and trust will serve as predictors. We will enter all susceptibility variables simultaneously. We will re-run the analysis controlling for socio-demographic variables and overall news use by using a hierarchical approach in which socio-demographic variables are entered in the first block, traditional news gateways in the second, and susceptibility variables in the last block. \n\nResearch focus 2: Exposure to distorted news\nFor testing H.2.1 and H.2.2., we will calculate a linear regression in which recall of distorted news serves as criterion and non-traditional news gateways and alternative news media as predictor. \nWe will re-run the analysis controlling for socio-demographic variables and overall news use by using a hierarchical approach in which socio-demographic variables are entered in the first block, traditional news gateways in the second, and non-traditional news gateways and alternative news in the last block. \n\nResearch focus 3: Believe in of distorted news\nFor exploring differences in distorted as compared to factual news believe and depending on whether the distorted news entailed conspiracy-theoretical elements, we will run a repeated measurement analysis of variance (rANOVA) using headline type (conspirational versus false versus factual) as within-subjects factor. If the main effect of headline type is significant, we will use pairwise t-tests to calculate single comparisons. \nTo test H3.1. we will calculate the correlation between participants recall of distorted news and whether participants believe in them.  \n\nTo test H.3.2 \u2013 H.3.4, we will run a hierarchical regression analysis in which belief in distorted news serves as criterion.

We will rerun the analysis controlling for socio-demographic variables and alternative and non-traditional news gateways in two preceding blocks.\n\nResearch focus 4: Amplification intentions and pollution behavior\nTo test H 4.1 - H. 4.6 we will run three hierarchical linear regression analyses: One using amplification intentions for conspiracy-theoretical distorted news as criterion, one using distorted news without conspiracy elements as criterion, and the last one using polluting behavior as criterion. In all three analyses, the believe in the respective distorted news will be entered in Block 1, conspiracy mentality, authoritarianism and in Block 2, and alternative news media use in Block 3.

We will explore the role of conspirational elements by re-calculating this analysis separating between distorted news with and without conspiracy-theoretical elements. \nAs H3.2 \u2013 H3.4 predicted that the relationship between exposure to distorted news and their believability will be moderated by conspiracy mentality, RWA, and trust, we will calculate moderated mediation models combining the two mediation analyses with these moderators.

This project seeks to test whether the addition of response times and coin flip order will enrich the predictive capacity of the coin flip task at validating whether dishonesty is occurring in the task.  We propose to test this by examining the likelihood of reported coin flips, the likelihood of the actual ordering of reported flips, and the response times of reported flips in a series of lab and online experiments.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-20T12:48:07.956112", "date_modified": "2019-10-21T17:28:57.591279", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "c44aa79980b40d5ced811a495ce30078aa1d79f06a945ee21a2dcf42015a2f067be8fc73f8f869ce8a47ff42845b8fddc7ade9842629c110e5f98c4ff09c56730b97d85325c75f418959007dff2256e1c22c9c68b0eb8b5b180ef2db7ade5a1dacd0fc17deae7af87afc9fcf9f0d15b7c3d000e318b1782ceaa21b899cee640f80eeb6825d820610e1f2a17e71119472", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-20T12:48:07.916625", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "David L.

Because the \"online\" condition of the mTurk sample changes not only the online characteristic of our sample (relative to in-lab at our institution) but also the subject pool (drawing from Amazon's mTurk rather than our institution's experimental economics database), we are adding a Fixed and Variable Pay treatment of the online condition that will draw from our institution's ORSEE-database subject pool.  This is the same subject pool from which we drew our in-lab participants previously.  \nWe hypothesize that the increased \"social distance\" of going from in-lab to online will increase the number of HEADS reported (statistical dishonesty), and we also hypothesize that it will increase the unlikeliness of the coin flip sequence reported\n\nWe will be using same ORSEE subject pool as was used for our original in-lab treatments and, though subjects are not observed during online decisions they are not \"anonymous\" as they are on mTurk because we know their names from the recruitment process (and they know this), and so we are hypothesizing that the increased social distance will increase the incidence of likely dishonest outcome reports.  This is slightly different than our initial hypothesis that the increase in \"anonymity\" would increase dishonesty in coin flip outcomes reported.  The change from in-lab to mTurk increases both social distance and anonymity, we are introducing these two new treatments to more cleanly separate social distance (in-lab to online using same subject pool), from the anonymity (as mTurk also is more anonymous than using subjects from the investigators' experimental subject pool) \n\nBecause our new treatments will add social distance, but not the same level of anonymity as is added with the mTurk treatments, that we hypothesis the same directional outcomes going from in-lab to online lab subject, but an even greater impact going from in-lab to mTurk.  We also predict increased statistical cheating when going from lab-subjects-online to mTurk-online because this adds additional social distance as well as anonymity.\n\nSo, our modified hypotheses (borrowing from the original registration of this study) would be:\nH1: Statistical cheating is more prevalent in the ORSEE-online vs. ORSEE in-lab treatments, and more prevalent in the mTurk (more anonymous) online vs ORSEE-online treatment when variable payments are used (i.e., where temptation to be dishonest exists)\nH2:  Statistical cheating is more prevalent when the marginal incentive to cheat is positive (i.e., with our new treatments we anticipate more statistical cheating in the ORSEE-online-Incentives treatment compared to the ORSEE-online-Fixed payment treatment)\nH3:  Response time will be faster when social distance and anonymity increases (e.g., now this hypothesizes faster RTs in mTurk compared to ORSEE-online subject treatments, but we also hypothesize faster RTs in ORSEE-online treatments compared to ORSEE-in-Lab treatments)\nH4:  Statistically less likely sequences of coin flips will be reported when the incentive to cheat is positive and when social distance and anonymity are increased.
