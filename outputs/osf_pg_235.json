Participants will play a 7 round prisoners dilemma game in partners.\n\nFollowing the 5th round of the game one of the participants in the dyad will be given an anonymous opportunity to help. The specifics of this opportunity vary by condition:\n\nControl Condition: Would you like to pay 3\u00a2 to increase your partners final earnings by 7\u00a2?\n\nInterdependence Condition: Your partner has a 10% chance of surviving into the next round. If your partner survives, you will both continue to the next round. If your partner does not survive, then there will be no more rounds because you will have no one to interact with. Would you like to pay 3\u00a2 to increase your partners chance of survival from 10% to 90%?\n\nWe chose these ratios (3\u00a2 to 7\u00a2 and 3\u00a2 to an 80% increase in survival) to be roughly equivalent in terms of their effects on one\u2019s partner. Because cooperative partners earn 4\u00a2/round, an 80% increased chance of survival results is worth an expected 3.2\u00a2/round, which across two rounds equals 6.4\u00a2 to one\u2019s partner. This is slightly less than the 7\u00a2 to one\u2019s partner in the Control Condition, but that works against our hypothesis because it makes people less likely to give in the Interdependence Condition. \n\nExit Survey: \n\nAt the conclusion of the study all participants will respond to demographic questions and a comprehension check. They will also respond to four Likert scale questions (-3 strongly disagree to +3 strongly agree) to measure their perceived level of interdependence with their partner. \n\nComprehension check: if you were playing one (and only one) round of this game, what option would give you the highest expected payoff?\n\nOnly the partners who did not get an opportunity to help during the game will respond to a hypothetical opportunity to help:\n-\tControl Condition: Imagine you were still playing the game and you had the opportunity to pay 3\u00a2 to increase your partners final earnings by 7\u00a2, would you?\n-\tInterdependence Condition: Imagine you were still playing the game and your partner only had a 10% chance of surviving into the next round, but you could pay 3\u00a2 to give them a 90% chance of surviving.

The specifics of this opportunity vary by condition:\n\nControl Condition: Would you like to pay 3\u00a2 to increase your partners final earnings by 7\u00a2?\n\nInterdependence Condition: Your partner has a 10% chance of surviving into the next round. If your partner survives, you will both continue to the next round. If your partner does not survive, then there will be no more rounds because you will have no one to interact with. Would you like to pay 3\u00a2 to increase your partners chance of survival from 10% to 90%?\n\nWe chose these ratios (3\u00a2 to 7\u00a2 and 3\u00a2 to an 80% increase in survival) to be roughly equivalent in terms of their effects on one\u2019s partner. Because cooperative partners earn 4\u00a2/round, an 80% increased chance of survival results is worth an expected 3.2\u00a2/round, which across two rounds equals 6.4\u00a2 to one\u2019s partner. This is slightly less than the 7\u00a2 to one\u2019s partner in the Control Condition, but that works against our hypothesis because it makes people less likely to give in the Interdependence Condition. \n\nExit Survey: \n\nAt the conclusion of the study all participants will respond to demographic questions and a comprehension check. They will also respond to four Likert scale questions (-3 strongly disagree to +3 strongly agree) to measure their perceived level of interdependence with their partner. \n\nComprehension check: if you were playing one (and only one) round of this game, what option would give you the highest expected payoff?\n\nOnly the partners who did not get an opportunity to help during the game will respond to a hypothetical opportunity to help:\n-\tControl Condition: Imagine you were still playing the game and you had the opportunity to pay 3\u00a2 to increase your partners final earnings by 7\u00a2, would you?\n-\tInterdependence Condition: Imagine you were still playing the game and your partner only had a 10% chance of surviving into the next round, but you could pay 3\u00a2 to give them a 90% chance of surviving. If they survived, you would both continue to the next round. If they did not survive, then there would be no more rounds because you'd have no one to interact with.
