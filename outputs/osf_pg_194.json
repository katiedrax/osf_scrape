Moffitt"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Research in labour economics has shown that there is a positive association between height and wages (see H\u00fcbler 2016 for a review). The two most prominent explanations are related to cognitive ability and non-cognitive/social skills. Persico et al. (2004) argue that the height-wage premium is due to non-cognitive/social skills. They argue that taller children have greater access to clubs or social activities that develop productive human capital, which leads to higher wages. In contrast, Case &amp; Paxson (2008) argue that the height-wage premium arises because height is associated with cognitive ability, which is rewarded in the labour market. Using British datasets (National Child Development Study and the British Cohort Study) they find that height at age 3 (even before schooling has started) is positively associated with cognition, and that controlling for childhood cognition reduces the height-wage premium by about 30-50 percent. \n\nThere are several studies that have estimated associations between height and cognition and non-cognitive skills (Mosca &amp; Wright 2016; Guven &amp; Lee 2013; Magnusson et al. 2006; Maurer 2010; Schick &amp; Steckel 2015). However, it is difficult to estimate the causal effect of height because of confounding by unobserved genetic and early-life environmental factors. The heritability of height is estimated to be about 80% (Visscher et al. 2008), and height is also likely to be influenced early-life factors such as childhood nutrition. If unobserved genetic and early life factors that affect height are also associated with cognitive ability and non-cognitive skills, then associations are biased estimates of the causal relationship. \n\nOnly a few studies that have estimated the causal effect of height on cognitive ability or non-cognitive skills. Von Hinke Kessler Scholder et al. (2013) use Mendelian randomization, where they instrument childhood height in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents &amp; Children with genetic markers that predict height. The linear regression results show that contemporaneous height is associated higher IQ (at age 8), better school performance (at age 14) and lower likelihood of having behavioural problems (at age 13). In contrast, the instrumental variable results show that height is associated with higher IQ for girls (but not boys) and a higher probability of having behavioural problems. They conjecture that height positive effect of height on behavioural problems could be due to differential treatment of children of different stature. Case &amp; Paxson (2010) use within-sibling comparisons to estimate the effect of height on IQ in the National Longitudinal Study 1979 Children and Young Adults. Their within-sibling estimates show that height is associated with better cognitive test scores. The within-sibling estimates were also smaller in absolute magnitude than the corresponding linear regression estimates, indicating that standard associations are upward biased due to confounding from unobserved family level factors.\n\nReferences Cited:\nCase, A., &amp; Paxson, C.

First, we use polygenic scores (PGSs), which are summary measures of an individual\u2019s genetic predisposition for a given trait, to conduct a reduced form analysis of the impact of being genetically predisposed to being tall on the outcomes. As genes are randomly inherited at conception conditional on parental genotype, the height PGS is a more exogenous measures of height than observed height. The reduced form analysis provides a test for the presence of an effect of height, which can be informative as to whether a causal relationship exists. We will perform the following regressions:\n\n1.\tA linear regression of the outcomes on a PGS for height, PGS for educational attainment PGS for behavioral problems, and control variables for demographics, family, neighborhood SES (or neighborhood fixed effects), and principal components of the genetic data to control for population stratification.\n\nThe coefficients on the PGSs from regression (1) will not reflect a pure genetic effect, as it is confounded by family environment. For example, parental genetics will influence the family environment provided to children, which in turn affects child outcomes.

The two most prominent explanations are related to cognitive ability and non-cognitive/social skills. Persico et al. (2004) argue that the height-wage premium is due to non-cognitive/social skills. They argue that taller children have greater access to clubs or social activities that develop productive human capital, which leads to higher wages. In contrast, Case &amp; Paxson (2008) argue that the height-wage premium arises because height is associated with cognitive ability, which is rewarded in the labour market. Using British datasets (National Child Development Study and the British Cohort Study) they find that height at age 3 (even before schooling has started) is positively associated with cognition, and that controlling for childhood cognition reduces the height-wage premium by about 30-50 percent. \n\nThere are several studies that have estimated associations between height and cognition and non-cognitive skills (Mosca &amp; Wright 2016; Guven &amp; Lee 2013; Magnusson et al. 2006; Maurer 2010; Schick &amp; Steckel 2015). However, it is difficult to estimate the causal effect of height because of confounding by unobserved genetic and early-life environmental factors. The heritability of height is estimated to be about 80% (Visscher et al. 2008), and height is also likely to be influenced early-life factors such as childhood nutrition. If unobserved genetic and early life factors that affect height are also associated with cognitive ability and non-cognitive skills, then associations are biased estimates of the causal relationship. \n\nOnly a few studies that have estimated the causal effect of height on cognitive ability or non-cognitive skills. Von Hinke Kessler Scholder et al. (2013) use Mendelian randomization, where they instrument childhood height in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents &amp; Children with genetic markers that predict height. The linear regression results show that contemporaneous height is associated higher IQ (at age 8), better school performance (at age 14) and lower likelihood of having behavioural problems (at age 13). In contrast, the instrumental variable results show that height is associated with higher IQ for girls (but not boys) and a higher probability of having behavioural problems. They conjecture that height positive effect of height on behavioural problems could be due to differential treatment of children of different stature. Case &amp; Paxson (2010) use within-sibling comparisons to estimate the effect of height on IQ in the National Longitudinal Study 1979 Children and Young Adults. Their within-sibling estimates show that height is associated with better cognitive test scores. The within-sibling estimates were also smaller in absolute magnitude than the corresponding linear regression estimates, indicating that standard associations are upward biased due to confounding from unobserved family level factors.\n\nReferences Cited:\nCase, A., &amp; Paxson, C.

As such, diabetes is likely to have complex links to personality, a known predictor of health behaviors and disease response. However, much of the prior work on this topic relies on domain-level personality measures and ignores the distinction between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.  The current study investigates the utility of personality items in predicting diabetes status (Type 1, Type 2 or none) using a subset of data from the SAPA Project. Specifically, we estimate the classification accuracy of items from the SAPA Personality Inventory (SPI-135; Condon, 2018) using various supervised machine learning (ML) techniques and k-fold cross-validation; the model with the lowest training sample error rates is applied to a hold-out testing set.

The 135 items of the SPI are administered in a randomized order using a planned missingness design. After completing as many questions as they would like, participants can go to the next page, where a new series of personality, cognitive ability, and experimental items are presented.

As such, diabetes is likely to have complex links to personality, a known predictor of health behaviors and disease response. However, much of the prior work on this topic relies on domain-level personality measures and ignores the distinction between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.  The current study investigates the utility of personality items in predicting diabetes status (Type 1, Type 2 or none) using a subset of data from the SAPA Project. Specifically, we estimate the classification accuracy of items from the SAPA Personality Inventory (SPI-135; Condon, 2018) using various supervised machine learning (ML) techniques and k-fold cross-validation; the model with the lowest training sample error rates is applied to a hold-out testing set.

A sample size aim of 120 participants + 20% attrition rate will be sought.\n\nEligibility Criteria\nInclusion criteria:\n\u2022\tParent of primary school child, aged 4-11 years old\n\u2022\tLiving in Yorkshire and the Humber\n\u2022\tOwn a smartphone\n\u2022\tHave access to the internet on a smartphone when outside the home\n\u2022\tHave access to the internet inside and outside the home\n\u2022\tAvailable to participate and engage in the study for three consecutive months\n\u2022\tWilling to complete survey questions throughout the duration of the study when prompted \n\u2022\tParent is an active grocery shopper for the household or involved in decisions over children\u2019s food.\nExclusion criteria:\n\u2022\tCurrently using the Change4Life Food Scanner app\n\u2022\tChild has a health condition with special dietary requirements that could confound outcomes\n\nStudy arms:\nIntervention: Those allocated into the intervention arm will receive instructions to download the Food Scanner app onto their smartphone, and will be encouraged to use this app to make smarter choices when grocery shopping. Participants will be presented with a validation question to ensure that they have read the materials. \nControl: Those in the control group will receive no instruction to download any dietary app, and will continue on with their usual practice. \nIndividuals in both arms will be asked to complete regular food diaries and psychosocial measures. As the intervention aims to test the effectiveness of a real-world intervention, and freely available dietary app, researcher involvement, such as prompting of app use, will be minimised, as this may impact the generalisability of results. \n\nData collection methods\nDemographics: At baseline, child characteristics and parent sociodemographic factors will be captured. Child variables include age and gender. Parent characteristics include ethnic background, educational attainment, household income and number of people living in the household. \n\nAnthropometrics: Child and parent height and weight measurements will be self-reported by parents at baseline only.\n\nDietary assessment: Three-day food diaries will be completed (2 weekdays + 1 weekend) in the space of a week, through the use of MyFood24. This will be completed at baseline, 1-month follow up and 3-month follow up.\n\nPsychosocial constructs: A number of psychological predictors of behaviour change will be investigated at baseline and 3-month follow up, mostly which have theoretical underpinnings, and their development has been informed via the available literature (e.g. COM-B model and Theory of Planned Behaviour). Participant knowledge will be investigated by asking participants to rate their own knowledge whilst others test actual knowledge. Health Related Quality of Life measures using the CHU-9D will also be explored.\n\nHealthcare service use: In order to enable a cost-effectiveness analysis, healthcare service use will be asked at baseline and 3-month follow up.\n\nApp engagement and feedback: Those randomised into the intervention arm will be asked additional questions at follow up to gain insight into user perceptions of the Food Scanner app. Behavioural measures, including app engagement, will assess the number of days in which the app was used, the number of items scanned in that time, and the time burden of using the app. \n\nExternal policy influencers: All survey respondents will be asked at 3-month follow up on external policy influencers or campaigns that may have had an impact on their behaviour during the time of the study. This will provide an understanding of how the external policy context currently affects parental feeding practices.\n\nOpen-ended questions\nA number of open-ended questions will form a qualitative aspect of data collection.

These items endeavour to gain a deeper understanding of users\u2019 perceptions of the app and their suggestions for improvements.\n", "uploader": [{"file_id": "5e68d7fb0cd06c009d0034af", "file_name": "Procedure process flowchart.png", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/5acqd/files/osfstorage/5e68d7fb0cd06c009d0034af", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e68d7fb0cd06c009d0034af"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "9a7594edd4c80ed656ee5b0dfce4bff92f9f7c90fafcfcac6fafb0898bcc9b24"}}]}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=5acqd", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5acqd", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5acqd", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/ehwjb/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "ehwjb", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/62hzt/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "62hzt", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/5acqd/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5acqd/"}}], "links": {"first": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json", "last": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "prev": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=193", "next": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=195", "meta": {"total": 5469, "per_page": 10}}}
