Coulson\u2019s (2014) movement span task", "description": "Some researchers have argued that motor working memory is relatively independent from visuospatial working memory and underlies the learning and processing of motor tasks, like gesture comprehension. To allow systematic testing of these claims, Wu and Coulson (2014) proposed a novel measure of motor working memory, the movement span task. Some studies have reported that the movement span task has a high degree of validity. The purpose of the present study was to attempt to replicate Wu and Coulson (2014) in the following ways: 1) the high correlation between movement span and movement recall scores and 2) the lack of correlation between the movement span task on the one hand and visuospatial and verbal working memory on the other.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created":

The simulation iterations is set to 50,000. First perform 20,000 adjustment iterations to eliminate the effect of the initial value. Indirect and direct evidence which from all RCTs are integrated according to the node splitting method. Besides, the Gelman-Rubin statistic will be used to evaluate the convergence of the simulation. The potential scale reduced factor (PSRF) reflects the convergence of the model. A PSRF equals to 100% when a treatment is certain to be the best and 0% of a PSRF indicates a treatment to be the worst. Finally, the figure of ranking probability of all interventions is generated, and local inconsistency are evaluated using the node-splitting method.

One would standardly expect an inverted U-shape relationship in  that people are faster at the low and high ends of any intensity scale (extremity --&gt; confidence --&gt; judgment speed).\u00a0 Though this analysis is mostly for internal validity of the data we are curious whether those curves are distinct for different probes.\u00a0", "sample": "We will recruit 240 people through Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk for a target of 200 valid participants. Due to software limitations, the final number may vary slightly from this target.  We will oversample because we might have up to 20% exclusions. Our recent studies had a lot more \"bad subjects\" (or bots) than in the past, and we may also have to exclude additional people who are outliers in their reaction times.\u00a0 If we have to exclude more than 40 participants according to the exclusion criteria above, we will recruit additional participants so that we have recruited at least 200 valid participants.\u00a0\n\nThe target of 200 is based on the following reasoning. In the original\u00a0studies we had 100-200 participants in each study, and the effect sizes of affect probes vs. moral probes averaged between d\u00a0= 0.18 and d\u00a0= 0.20. The p values were\u00a0all &lt; .001, so we had ample power with this range of samples. This is largely because the inclusion of random effects terms (for subjects and items) reduces\u00a0error variance.  From a conservative perspective (and in line with the simpler analysis approach explained above), we can assume a standard paired t test between relevant probe conditions, for which an effect size of 0.18 would require 190 people to get to power .80 at .05.\u00a0 \u00a0", "analyses": "1. Traditional within-subject analysis with item-averaging: \nWe first identify each person's 3 items assigned to each probe and compute the average response time across the three.  Then we analyze these average RTs for the negative behaviors and their corresponding probes in a one-way w/s ANOVA, with Probe as a four-level factor: BAD, BLAME, ANGRY, UPSET.  We define the primary a priori contrast of Average(BAD, BLAME) vs. Average(ANGRY, UPSET) as the test of the moral vs. affective speed hypothesis.  We also document possible differences between BAD and BLAME and between ANGRY and UPSET.  \n    We then repeat the same analyses for the positive behaviors and their corresponding probes. Once more we conduct a one-way w/s ANOVA, with Probe as a four-level factor: Happy, Surprised, Praise, and Good.  We first test an a priori contrast of Average(Praise, Good) vs. Average(Happy, Surprised) as the test of possible nonaffective vs. affective speed differences.  We also explore differences between Happy and Surprised and between Praise and Good.     \n\n2. Linear mixed-effects models: For the negative behaviors and corresponding probes  we regress the reaction times to each item on the four-level Probe factor, with the same contrasts as specified above, but including random intercepts and slopes for each participant as well as a random intercept for each item.  \n    We then conduct corresponding analyses for the positive behaviors. \n\nBecause reaction times have distributional challenges we will adopt outlier removals (see below) and, if necessary, apply transformations to deal with the familiar right-skewed tail of RTs. We don't expect any of these operations to change the results.   \n", "outliers": "Following Malle &amp; Holbrook (2012) we designate RTs &lt; 400 ms as invalid and remove such item responses.  What counts as outliers at the high end is far more difficult to determine.  From the Cusimano et al. (2017) studies we know that most people respond to the probes in under 4 seconds.  To test for robustness we will compare (a) analyses that exclude responses with RT &gt; 4000 ms to (b) analyses that exclude only extremes (within-person outliers defined as z &gt; 3.0) to (c) analyses that only exclude extreme RTs &gt; 10s, the criterion that Cusimano et al. (2017) used.  We assume that all these analyses will lead to convergent conclusions, as the number of outlier items is typically quite small.  If the results show discrepancies we will also introduce nonparametric analyses.  \n\nIn addition to trial-based exclusions we will exclude participants as follows:\n  \n- AMT ID duplicates. \n- Ones who have a range of 0 or 1 in their moral judgments.\n- Ones for whom we have to discard more than 25% of their trials following the trial-based criteria above.\n- Ones who have more than 2 missing items within their moral judgments.\n- Ones that fail to give meaningful English-language answers to both bot screening questions (see below); we will accept *one* incorrect answer as long as it is meaningful English and likely the result of an honest error; e.g., grandmother instead of grandfather, Saturday rather than Wednesday).\n- Ones that enter something into the text box they are instructed to leave empty.\n\nParticipants start the study with a bot screening in which they need to enter, into free-response text boxes, correct verbal answers to two questions (\"What is the day of the week that is two days after Monday?\" and \"What is another name for someone\u2019s dad\u2019s father?\") and follow instructions to enter nothing into a third text box.", "dependent": "We measure response times to question probes of moral judgments and affective states regarding short behavior descriptions.  Each response is a numeric judgment (on the keys 1,2,3,4,5,6 of a standard keyboard) in answer to a question probe (e.g.,  \"How BAD does this seem to you?\"). ", "conditions": "The design is fully within subject.  The major conditions lie in stimulus variations (12 positive, 12 negative behavior descriptions) and probe variations (affective probes: Happy, Surprised, Angry, Upset; moral judgment probes: Blame, Bad, Praise, Good).  Each probe is paired with three behaviors, whereby Happy, Surprised, Praise, and Good are paired with positive behaviors and Angry, Upset, Blame, and Bad are paired with negative behaviors.  The assignments of behaviors to probes are balanced in multiple forms, and the order of behaviors/probes is pseudo-randomized.    \n\nThe probes are:\nHow BAD does this seem to you?  \nHow GOOD does this seem to you?  \nHow much BLAME does [he/she] seem to deserve?  \nHow much PRAISE does [he/she] seem to deserve?  \nHow ANGRY does this make you?\nHow HAPPY does this make you?\nHow UPSET does this make you?\nHow SURPRISED does this make you?\n   \nOf note is that the positive behaviors and probes serve two functions: First, they ensure that people don't get into a mindset of negative judgments and emotions and begin to response uniformly but rather have to response to the unpredictable occurrence of either good events or bad events and, within each type, to the unpredictable appearance of one of four possible questions.  In addition, we can test whether the hypothesized slowness of negative emotions is unique to moral violations or also holds for positively valenced events (not necessarily moral) and the emotions of happy and surprise.

This led to two problems: First, any variation in how people experience MLEs was disregarded because each event was ascribed one typical profile. It is, for example, often assumed that all marriages are the same instead of considering individual variations in people\u2019s perception of this event. Second, this typical profile was often created by one or few expert raters without examining how it relates to the actual perceptions of people experiencing the MLE. In this study, we will collect ratings of characteristics of MLEs from external (lay-)raters to examine how these external ratings relate to event characteristics as they are perceived by those who actually experienced the MLE.\n\nTo do so, we will compare data on perceived characteristics of MLEs from three sources:\n- Ratings of individual perceptions of event characteristics of MLEs by persons who have actually recently experienced it (henceforth: in situ ratings)\n- Ratings of individual perceptions of event characteristics by persons who have not experienced it (henceforth: individual ex situ ratings)\nInstructions approximately \u201cImagine you would experience the following life event: _______. How would you probably perceive it?\u201d \n- Ratings of typical perceptions of event characteristics by external raters (henceforth: generalized ex situ ratings): \nInstructions approximately \u201cHow do you think young adults experiencing the life event __________ typically perceive it?\u201d \n\n\nThese data will be used to examine the following research questions. \n\n1. Research questions regarding in situ ratings:\n- How are characteristics of MLEs on average perceived in situ?\n- How much do individual in situ perceptions of event characteristics vary within an MLE?\n- Are there differences in the variability of perceptions of event characteristics between MLEs or between event characteristic dimensions?\n\n2. Research questions regarding generalized and individual ex situ ratings:  \n- How are characteristics of MLEs on average perceived ex situ?\n- How much do ex situ raters agree in their ratings of characteristics of MLEs?\n- Are there differences in the cross-rater agreement between MLEs or between event characteristic dimensions? \n\n3. Research questions regarding the relation between the different types of ratings:\n- Are there differences between the means of in situ ratings, individual ex situ ratings, and generalized ex situ ratings of characteristics of MLEs?\n- Are there differences between the variances of in situ ratings, individual ex situ ratings, and generalized ex situ ratings of characteristics of MLEs?", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-08T10:23:14.291387", "date_modified": "2020-02-11T17:18:41.822883", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["event perception", "major life event"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Sarah Kritzler", "Andrew Rakhshani", "Sophia Terwiel", "Ina Fassbender", "Brent Donnellan", "Richard E.

Research questions regarding generalized and individual ex situ ratings:  \n- How are characteristics of MLEs on average perceived ex situ?\nWe will compute and graphically display mean values of generalized and individual ex situ ratings of the life event characteristics of our selected MLEs.\n\n- How much do ex situ raters agree in their ratings of characteristics of MLEs?\nWe will compute and graphically display standard deviations of generalized and individual ex situ ratings of life event characteristics of our selected MLEs.\n \n- Are there differences in the cross-rater agreement between MLEs or between event characteristic dimensions? \nWe will graphically display and descriptively compare standard deviations of generalized and individual ex situ ratings of life event characteristics and of MLEs. \n\n\n3. Research questions regarding the relation between the different types of ratings:\n- Are there differences between the means of in situ ratings, individual ex situ ratings, and generalized ex situ ratings of characteristics of MLEs?\n- Are there differences between the variances of in situ ratings, individual ex situ ratings, and generalized ex situ ratings of characteristics of MLEs?\nWe will graphically display and descriptively compare the means and standard deviations of in situ ratings, individual ex situ ratings, and generalized ex situ ratings of characteristics of our selected MLEs.
