principal-agent conflicts in public management. It aims to test whether citizens can influence policy, not only indirectly through electing politicians, but more directly by providing information to bureaucrats who have discretion over agency or departmental budgets. No comprehensive framework exists yet to understand how bureaucrats respond to citizen information. Gaining a better understanding of the influence of citizen feedback on bureaucrats could help to address undemocratic inequalities caused by bureaucrats delivering services in a discriminating manner (Scott 1997; Theobald & Haider-Markel 2009; Riccucci, Van Ryyzin & Lavena 2014; White, Nathan & Faller 2015). Beyond that, an understanding of the mode and extent to which citizens can influence bureaucratic decision-making can inform literature on public sector performance management. The conception of a citizen as a silent influencer sits squarely between approaches related to New Public Management (NPM) and participatory initiatives. The former locates responsibility to cater to citizen needs with bureaucrats and politicians alone. Bureaucrats are incentivised by politicians to treat citizens like consumers and cater to their needs (Andrews 2011; Hood 2015). Participatory initiatives, on the other hand, stress the need for citizens to actively call for and coproduce what they want the public sector to provide (O\u2019Dwyer 2005; Ryfe 2005; Fung 2006; Chadwick 2011; Street, Duszynski, Krawczyck & Braunack-Mayer 2014; Voorberg, Bekkers & Tummers 2015).This study is agnostic to the theoretical advantages of either approach.

It aims to test the impact of citizen feedback on bureaucratic decision-making. Participants are assigned a role in a strict hierarchy which determines their power over resource allocation: they have powers and face constraints akin to that of a politician, bureaucrat or citizen. Resources can be used to benefit all participants or they can benefit some individuals or their own political causes over others, akin to pork barrel politics (Lancaster 1986). Bureaucrats have opportunity for slack, spending resources on themselves rather than projects (see Wyckoff, 1990, Cyert & March 1963 and O\u2019Toole & Meier 2010 for more in-depth definitions). The aim is to test (i) whether participant behaviours follow patterns that are expected from the given incentive structures and (ii) whether these patterns can be altered through the introduction of feedback mechanisms between participants. The main interest lies in assessing whether introducing feedback from citizens to bureaucrats alters allocation decisions in a manner that differs significantly from allocation decisions made under existing forms of influence between politicians, citizens and bureaucrats, i.e. elections and public monitoring mechanisms. After the first stage which imposes no additional conditions and decisions are opaque , transparency is introduced (; all participants know how much the others allocated to the different causes. The third stage introduces elections . The fourth public performance frameworks; the politician can provide feedback to the bureaucrat . The last stage introduces citizen feedback for bureaucrats . Structures of the study are designed so that two participants face simplified but similar powers over budgets and constraints as politicians. The governing politician can outsource decision-making by allocating budgets to bureaucracies, they can directly invest in causes that benefit the population as a whole or they can keep resources for their own political purposes. The opposition politician has to wait for an opportunity to be elected to receive powers over state resource allocation. The incentive framework within which they can take this decisions is manipulated during the study. Another role approximates the resource allocation framework of a bureaucrat. Bureaucrats receive a budget per period by the politician. With that budget they can then decide whether to allocate it to projects that broadly benefit the public or on the voter base of the politician, the citizen player. They can also keep some money to themselves (\u2018slack\u2019). The last role mimics that of the citizen. They can influence resource allocation through the election of politicians. To test the malleability of behavioural outcomes the study uses a 3x5 mixed factorial design. Each participant is exposed to five stages of treatment. These stages allow to distinguish between effects introduced by transparency, elections, feedback given by politicians to bureaucrats and feedback given by citizens to bureaucrats. The within-subject design controls for individual differences on metrics such as generosity or authority worship. In addition, all participants are randomly allocated to one of three treatment conditions. They either receive nominal feedback , which assigns broad categories to performance (\u201cexceed\u201d, \u201cmeet expectations\u201d, \u201cmust improve\u201d). This type of feedback is modelled on performance ratings used for civil servants in the UK which was introduced in 2012/13. The second group receives specific feedback , which details where allocations should be increased and where allocations should be decreased. The third group receives a prompt to form an action plan for allocating money in the next spending period in addition to specific feedback .

And while empirical research on the political and economic rivers of credit supply since the Great Recession has accumulated knowledge about the incentives that policymakers face to increase credit flows to society, the empirical evidence on the demand-side effects of credit expansions is sparse. Hence, we know little about how citizens react to better, more affordable access to credit, and most of the existing research implicitly assumes that myopic voters simply accept credit as a substitute for traditional welfare policies.

And while empirical research on the political and economic rivers of credit supply since the Great Recession has accumulated knowledge about the incentives that policymakers face to increase credit flows to society, the empirical evidence on the demand-side effects of credit expansions is sparse. Hence, we know little about how citizens react to better, more affordable access to credit, and most of the existing research implicitly assumes that myopic voters simply accept credit as a substitute for traditional welfare policies.

In other words, the difference in support for the most and least generous levels of unemployment support should be smallest when credit card loans are most affordable. (The interaction is positive because of the way in which the questions are asked; increasing interest rates for credit card loans correspond to less affordable credit). Hypothesis 2: Housing loans and unemployment support: We expect a positive interaction between housing loans and unemployment support, all else constant. In other words, the difference in support for the most and least generous levels of unemployment support should be smallest when housing loans are cheapest. Hypothesis 3: Credit card loans and basic social security for low-income families: we do not expect to find a statistically significant interaction effect for credit card loans and basic social security for low-income families, as this type of credit cannot be a permanent substitute for low income. Finding a positive interaction effect, would go counter to our theoretical expectations.

is expected to bring various positive effects, such as greater accountability, increased trust and less corruption (Meijer 2014). One important potential mechanism to force governments to become more transparent is requesting information through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and the number of FOI laws implemented worldwide is has increased greatly (e.g. Relly and Sabharwal 2009). But how effective is such a mechanism? In a recent field experiment with local governments, Worthy, John and Vannoni found that indeed FOI requests are more effective than simple asks. FOI requests are more effective in encouraging bodies to do more than the law asks (concordance) than encouraging more minimal levels of legal cooperation (compliance). The experiment was conducted on a sample of 4300 parish councils (the lowest local level in the United Kingdom). Parish councils were requested for information for the organizational chart of the parish council. Furthermore, authorities were asked to go \u2018beyond\u2019 what is legally required and publish the information publically, to assess whether FOI can help lead to greater pro-active openness. The first aim is to replicate the Worthy et al. experiment in the Netherlands, for three reasons. First, initial findings may have occurred simply by chance and replications may serve as a way to decrease \u201cfalse positives\u201d (Ioannidis 2005). Secondly, replication in the social sciences is needed to further determine contextual conditions of the effect (Jilke et al. 2016). Thus to assess the external validity and boundary conditions of Worthy et al.\u2019s findings it is important to investigate FOI in a different context. The Netherlands has a much longer tradition with FOI legislation (1980 in the Netherlands vs 2005 in the UK) and supposedly a less adversarial media culture. Will the findings on the effectiveness of FOI in the original experiment also hold in this different context? Third and finally, the Netherlands has seen very little FOI research and is as such an interesting case to investigate. The second aim is to push the boundaries of our knowledges on whether FOI can create effective transparency by request politically sensitive information. Where the original experiment \u2018just\u2019 asked for somewhat mundane information, an organizational chart, true transparency goes beyond that and becomes relevant when a topic is matter politically."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypothesis 1: Local authorities will be more responsive to an FOI request than to an informal ask.

One important potential mechanism to force governments to become more transparent is requesting information through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and the number of FOI laws implemented worldwide is has increased greatly (e.g. Relly and Sabharwal 2009). But how effective is such a mechanism? In a recent field experiment with local governments, Worthy, John and Vannoni found that indeed FOI requests are more effective than simple asks. FOI requests are more effective in encouraging bodies to do more than the law asks (concordance) than encouraging more minimal levels of legal cooperation (compliance). The experiment was conducted on a sample of 4300 parish councils (the lowest local level in the United Kingdom). Parish councils were requested for information for the organizational chart of the parish council. Furthermore, authorities were asked to go \u2018beyond\u2019 what is legally required and publish the information publically, to assess whether FOI can help lead to greater pro-active openness. The first aim is to replicate the Worthy et al. experiment in the Netherlands, for three reasons. First, initial findings may have occurred simply by chance and replications may serve as a way to decrease \u201cfalse positives\u201d (Ioannidis 2005). Secondly, replication in the social sciences is needed to further determine contextual conditions of the effect (Jilke et al. 2016). Thus to assess the external validity and boundary conditions of Worthy et al.\u2019s findings it is important to investigate FOI in a different context. The Netherlands has a much longer tradition with FOI legislation (1980 in the Netherlands vs 2005 in the UK) and supposedly a less adversarial media culture. Will the findings on the effectiveness of FOI in the original experiment also hold in this different context? Third and finally, the Netherlands has seen very little FOI research and is as such an interesting case to investigate. The second aim is to push the boundaries of our knowledges on whether FOI can create effective transparency by request politically sensitive information. Where the original experiment \u2018just\u2019 asked for somewhat mundane information, an organizational chart, true transparency goes beyond that and becomes relevant when a topic is matter politically.", "q16": "Hypothesis 1: Local authorities will be more responsive to an FOI request than to an informal ask.

moral evaluations of clientelism depend on the characteristics of the exchange as well as on citizen characteristics. These contributions provide important new insights and underscore the relevance of pushing further our understanding of citizens evaluations of clientelism. What is missing thus far from the literature is a) a more complete view of how citizens evaluate the variety of empirically existing forms of clientelism, b) what factors drive their evaluation, and c) how they evaluate the role of clients and patrons in the exchange. In addition, it is not clear whether normative judgements of clientelism elaborated in the Western literature on the topic are shared by local communities. This project seeks to make four contributions that revolve around the following research questions: 1) How do citizens evaluate different forms of clientelism? 2) Who do citizens hold responsible for the exchange? Does this vary across types of clientelism? 3) What factors drive their evaluation? What is the role of a) value of the goods, b) scarcity of the goods, c) inequality of the relationship, d) size of the beneficiary group, and e) adherence to rules in driving the evaluation? 4) Are there differences in how political scientists and Tunisian and South African respondents evaluate clientelism? We explore these research questions with a conjoint experiment in South Africa and Tunisia, as well as with a sample of political scientists working on normative political theory and on the comparative politics of developing countries."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Our hypotheses are based on a framework that emerges from an extensive coding of clientelistic exchanges described in the ethnographic literature. Pellicer et al. (2018) identify two core dimensions that define clientelistic exchanges, \u201cvertical\u201d and \u201chorizontal\u201d that each highlight different problematic aspects of clientelism. The vertical dimension contains three potentially problematic aspects. More vertical exchanges usually involve more valuable goods from the patron and client\u2019s side. Second, more vertical exchanges involve more subordination. And third, more valuable goods from the patron\u2019s side might involve goods that are more scarce. All these aspects could form the basis of negative evaluations of clientelism (H2-H4). The second dimension addresses the extent to which private or public goods are being exchanged. At one extreme, only particularistic goods are being exchanged and, at the other, public goods. There are two aspects of this dimension that might contribute to the evaluation. The first is the size of the beneficiary group of citizen demands that ranges from individual/ family to community (as in collective clientelism) to national (as in programmatic politics). The second is whether the distribution of goods is ad hoc or whether a community gets goods because of official allocation rules. In general, exchanges involving public goods that benefit all citizens and public good allocation based on transparent rules are judged normatively better (H5 and H6). Our first hypothesis concerns the rank-ordering of types of exchanges: H1: Traditional clientelism (valuable goods are exchanged, patron goods are scarce, and the relationship is unequal) < vote-buying (opposite characteristics) < collective clientelism < programmatic politics Our second set of hypotheses concern the evaluation of particular dimensions of exchanges H2: The more valuable the goods that are exchanged, the more negative is the evaluation of the exchange H3: The more unequal the relation, the more negative is the evaluation of the exchange H4: Exchanges in which patrons provide scarce goods are judged more negatively H5: Individual exchanges are evaluated more negatively than collective exchanges H6: Exchanges based on rules are evaluated more positively than those based on ad hoc decisions by patrons"}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "We will test these hypotheses with two conjoint experiments, one tapping into the vertical dimension, and the second tapping into the horizontal dimension. In the first experiment we manipulate three different key aspects of the exchange: 1.) the value of the goods exchanged, 2.) the scarcity of the good, and 3.) the power relation between patron and client. The value of the exchanged goods varies on three levels (small/medium/large) the other dimensions (scarcity and power relation) vary on two levels (abundant/scarce and equal/unequal). Thus, overall twelve different exchanges are created. Each of these exchanges is illustrated with a drawing to communicate the core aspects to the respondents. The second experiment is designed to measure citizens\u2019 evaluation of the \u201chorizontal dimension\u201d of clientelism. Thus, the exchanges vary in the level of 1) the size of the beneficiary group (individual vs. collective) and 2) the extent to which they are rule based (whether it\u2019s about getting something ad hoc or by changing policies).

These contributions provide important new insights and underscore the relevance of pushing further our understanding of citizens evaluations of clientelism. What is missing thus far from the literature is a) a more complete view of how citizens evaluate the variety of empirically existing forms of clientelism, b) what factors drive their evaluation, and c) how they evaluate the role of clients and patrons in the exchange. In addition, it is not clear whether normative judgements of clientelism elaborated in the Western literature on the topic are shared by local communities. This project seeks to make four contributions that revolve around the following research questions: 1) How do citizens evaluate different forms of clientelism? 2) Who do citizens hold responsible for the exchange? Does this vary across types of clientelism? 3) What factors drive their evaluation? What is the role of a) value of the goods, b) scarcity of the goods, c) inequality of the relationship, d) size of the beneficiary group, and e) adherence to rules in driving the evaluation? 4) Are there differences in how political scientists and Tunisian and South African respondents evaluate clientelism? We explore these research questions with a conjoint experiment in South Africa and Tunisia, as well as with a sample of political scientists working on normative political theory and on the comparative politics of developing countries.", "q16": "Our hypotheses are based on a framework that emerges from an extensive coding of clientelistic exchanges described in the ethnographic literature. Pellicer et al. (2018) identify two core dimensions that define clientelistic exchanges, \u201cvertical\u201d and \u201chorizontal\u201d that each highlight different problematic aspects of clientelism. The vertical dimension contains three potentially problematic aspects. More vertical exchanges usually involve more valuable goods from the patron and client\u2019s side. Second, more vertical exchanges involve more subordination. And third, more valuable goods from the patron\u2019s side might involve goods that are more scarce. All these aspects could form the basis of negative evaluations of clientelism (H2-H4). The second dimension addresses the extent to which private or public goods are being exchanged. At one extreme, only particularistic goods are being exchanged and, at the other, public goods. There are two aspects of this dimension that might contribute to the evaluation. The first is the size of the beneficiary group of citizen demands that ranges from individual/ family to community (as in collective clientelism) to national (as in programmatic politics). The second is whether the distribution of goods is ad hoc or whether a community gets goods because of official allocation rules. In general, exchanges involving public goods that benefit all citizens and public good allocation based on transparent rules are judged normatively better (H5 and H6). Our first hypothesis concerns the rank-ordering of types of exchanges: H1: Traditional clientelism (valuable goods are exchanged, patron goods are scarce, and the relationship is unequal) < vote-buying (opposite characteristics) < collective clientelism < programmatic politics Our second set of hypotheses concern the evaluation of particular dimensions of exchanges H2: The more valuable the goods that are exchanged, the more negative is the evaluation of the exchange H3: The more unequal the relation, the more negative is the evaluation of the exchange H4: Exchanges in which patrons provide scarce goods are judged more negatively H5: Individual exchanges are evaluated more negatively than collective exchanges H6: Exchanges based on rules are evaluated more positively than those based on ad hoc decisions by patrons", "q17": "We will test these hypotheses with two conjoint experiments, one tapping into the vertical dimension, and the second tapping into the horizontal dimension. In the first experiment we manipulate three different key aspects of the exchange: 1.) the value of the goods exchanged, 2.) the scarcity of the good, and 3.) the power relation between patron and client. The value of the exchanged goods varies on three levels (small/medium/large) the other dimensions (scarcity and power relation) vary on two levels (abundant/scarce and equal/unequal). Thus, overall twelve different exchanges are created. Each of these exchanges is illustrated with a drawing to communicate the core aspects to the respondents. The second experiment is designed to measure citizens\u2019 evaluation of the \u201chorizontal dimension\u201d of clientelism. Thus, the exchanges vary in the level of 1) the size of the beneficiary group (individual vs. collective) and 2) the extent to which they are rule based (whether it\u2019s about getting something ad hoc or by changing policies). Each of these exchanges is illustrated with a drawing to communicate the core aspects of the exchange to the respondents (see PAP for the illustrations that respondents will see). Respondents will evaluate a total of six exchanges, four from the vertical, and two from the horizontal dimension.
