Most learning from play studies involve children passively engaging with others\u2019 pretense, and most research on learning from gesture does not involve play. Therefore, we will compare children\u2019s gesture across different levels of embodiment while engaged in fictional play: fully embodied, partial embodiment, and no embodiment. While there is strong evidence that suggests gesture helps children\u2019s learning (see Beilock &amp; Goldin-Meadow, 2010; Cameron &amp; Xu, 2011; Cook, Mitchell, &amp; Goldin-Meadow, 2008; Cutica, Ian\u00ec, &amp; Bucciarelli, 2014; Goldin-Meadow et al., 2012), the effects of children\u2019s gesture in play contexts has not yet been examined. Additionally, the effects that different types of gestures (i.e., full-bodied versus hands only, or deictic gestures versus metaphoric gestures) have on learning during pretense has not yet been demonstrated. We will examine how children\u2019s gesture usage in embodied play contexts impacts their learning of facts during the play scenarios.  \n\nUse of existing data: The existing data have been analyzed for learning outcome differences between the three different embodiment conditions (fully embodied/costume, partially embodied/puppet, and no embodiment/video watching/story listening), but the data have yet to be coded for gesture usage. Research assistants will be coding the videos and are not familiar with the current study design or hypotheses. Additionally, a small subset of the data will be used to train research assistants how to code the videos and to reach coding reliability. This subset used for research assistant training will not be used in the final analysis. \n\nBlinding: Research assistants who ran the study were unaware of the hypotheses, and research assistants who will code the videos will remain unaware of the hypotheses. \n\nRandomization: This study uses data from three previously conducted studies (Thompson &amp; Goldstein, 2019; Goldstein, Thompson &amp; Kanumuru, under review). Each study randomly assigned participants by age to predetermined groups. \n\nData Collection Procedures: Participants were recruited from a mid-Atlantic suburban area surrounding a major metropolitan city. Participants were recruited through advertisements posted on Facebook, Twitter, and the lab website, through local parent group organizations, and through partnerships with local pre-schools. \n\nStatistical Inference Criteria: We will use the standard p&lt;0.05 criteria for determining if the ANOVAs and the post-hoc tests art statically significant. We will use Tukey\u2019s HSD tests for multiple comparisons procedures. We will use the standard p&lt;0.05 criteria for determining if the regression analysis is statistically significant."}, "sample": {"extra": [], "value": "The sample sizes listed below indicate participants who we intend to include in the analysis.

We have already collected some data but explain in Question 8 why readers may consider this a valid pre-registration nevertheless.", "name": "Learning from Passive and Active Pretense: The Role of Gesture and Affect", "other": "Brief rationale for study: Children\u2019s gesture during embodied learning paradigms has not been studied in play contexts. Most learning from play studies involve children passively engaging with others\u2019 pretense, and most research on learning from gesture does not involve play. Therefore, we will compare children\u2019s gesture across different levels of embodiment while engaged in fictional play: fully embodied, partial embodiment, and no embodiment. While there is strong evidence that suggests gesture helps children\u2019s learning (see Beilock &amp; Goldin-Meadow, 2010; Cameron &amp; Xu, 2011; Cook, Mitchell, &amp; Goldin-Meadow, 2008; Cutica, Ian\u00ec, &amp; Bucciarelli, 2014; Goldin-Meadow et al., 2012), the effects of children\u2019s gesture in play contexts has not yet been examined. Additionally, the effects that different types of gestures (i.e., full-bodied versus hands only, or deictic gestures versus metaphoric gestures) have on learning during pretense has not yet been demonstrated. We will examine how children\u2019s gesture usage in embodied play contexts impacts their learning of facts during the play scenarios.  \n\nUse of existing data: The existing data have been analyzed for learning outcome differences between the three different embodiment conditions (fully embodied/costume, partially embodied/puppet, and no embodiment/video watching/story listening), but the data have yet to be coded for gesture usage. Research assistants will be coding the videos and are not familiar with the current study design or hypotheses. Additionally, a small subset of the data will be used to train research assistants how to code the videos and to reach coding reliability. This subset used for research assistant training will not be used in the final analysis. \n\nBlinding: Research assistants who ran the study were unaware of the hypotheses, and research assistants who will code the videos will remain unaware of the hypotheses. \n\nRandomization: This study uses data from three previously conducted studies (Thompson &amp; Goldstein, 2019; Goldstein, Thompson &amp; Kanumuru, under review). Each study randomly assigned participants by age to predetermined groups. \n\nData Collection Procedures: Participants were recruited from a mid-Atlantic suburban area surrounding a major metropolitan city. Participants were recruited through advertisements posted on Facebook, Twitter, and the lab website, through local parent group organizations, and through partnerships with local pre-schools. \n\nStatistical Inference Criteria: We will use the standard p&lt;0.05 criteria for determining if the ANOVAs and the post-hoc tests art statically significant. We will use Tukey\u2019s HSD tests for multiple comparisons procedures. We will use the standard p&lt;0.05 criteria for determining if the regression analysis is statistically significant.", "sample": "The sample sizes listed below indicate participants who we intend to include in the analysis.
