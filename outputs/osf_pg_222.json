Data was acquired from participants across two study periods, of approximately two months each \u2013 in early 2018 (study 1) as well as late 2018 (study 2). This analysis project will estimate the effects of the California wildfires that occurred during study 2 (fall of 2018) on a variety of outcomes for these employees, as data was collected at a California Bay Area site. We will use an interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) to estimate the effects of the wildfires on our participants. The process outlined may be repeated for application to other event types present in the data. Data have been collected, but no ITSA have yet been conducted.
