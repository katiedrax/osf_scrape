They take this as evidence for a top-down effect of linguistic knowledge on perceptual processing.

Patients must be at least 18 years old. Studies must report either a quality of life outcome, physical or cognitive functional outcome either during hospital stay, at discharge or post discharge. Studies including both in- and out-of hospital cardiac arrests will be considered for inclusion if data from the IHCA sub population could be extracted and computed separately. Included studies must have all or a majority of data collected after 1995 because this is when defibrillation was first recommended for ventricular fibrillation. We will limit language of publication to English and French. We will include both observational cohort and interventional study designs. Interventional studies must evaluate treatments post arrest (hypothermia or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation etc.) \n\nExclusion criteria: Studies including only out of hospital cardiac arrest patients and those conducted on pediatric populations. Studies that did not report quality of life outcomes such as functional status were excluded. Reviews, case reports, and case series were also excluded.\n\nData Abstraction \nTwo reviewers will independently abstract data in duplicate. We will abstract the following data elements from each study: 1) Study characteristics: Year of publication, years of data collection, country, setting and hospital type, study design 2) Population characteristics: age, sex, admission diagnosis, comorbidity measures, baseline QoL and function 3) Arrest characteristics: initial shockable rhythm, witness arrested or found pulseless. \n\nWe will use a two-stage review process by two independent reviewers, managed with Covidence\u00ae. Stage 1 will be screening abstracts and titles for eligibility. In stage 2, we will screen the full journal articles identified as potentially eligible in Stage 1.

Studies including both in- and out-of hospital cardiac arrests will be considered for inclusion if data from the IHCA sub population could be extracted and computed separately. Included studies must have all or a majority of data collected after 1995 because this is when defibrillation was first recommended for ventricular fibrillation. We will limit language of publication to English and French. We will include both observational cohort and interventional study designs. Interventional studies must evaluate treatments post arrest (hypothermia or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation etc.) \n\nExclusion criteria: Studies including only out of hospital cardiac arrest patients and those conducted on pediatric populations. Studies that did not report quality of life outcomes such as functional status were excluded. Reviews, case reports, and case series were also excluded.\n\nData Abstraction \nTwo reviewers will independently abstract data in duplicate. We will abstract the following data elements from each study: 1) Study characteristics: Year of publication, years of data collection, country, setting and hospital type, study design 2) Population characteristics: age, sex, admission diagnosis, comorbidity measures, baseline QoL and function 3) Arrest characteristics: initial shockable rhythm, witness arrested or found pulseless. \n\nWe will use a two-stage review process by two independent reviewers, managed with Covidence\u00ae. Stage 1 will be screening abstracts and titles for eligibility. In stage 2, we will screen the full journal articles identified as potentially eligible in Stage 1.

true and false intentions", "description": "This is the second study in a series of studies exploring whether differences in Episodic Future Thought ability (EFT; i.e., the ability to mentally visualise future events) affects the ability to lie about intentions. In study 1, we used 4 EFT tasks to examine which EFT measure best correlated with lying ability. The correlation between the 4 tasks was lower than we would have expected if the tasks were all measuring EFT. We therefore speculated that the 4 measures might be measuring some other aspect of the EFT tasks (e.g. talkativeness), rather than EFT itself. To test this, we intend to replicate our previous study, but ask participants to report the EFT via sketches as well as verbally. That way, if the verbal EFT task is predictive of lying in sketches, we will then know the task is measuring more than talkativeness.   \nThis study consists of 3 parts. Part A of the study consists of 2 tasks: a lying about intentions task and an episodic details task. Participants will then take part in the same lying about intentions experiment as study 1, which is largely based on Granhag and Knieps (2011). Participants will be asked to plan a mock criminal event (placing a memory stick containing illegal material on a specific shelf in the physics section of the university library) and plan a cover story to tell the interviewer in case they are intercepted.  Participants will also be asked to plan one of five randomly selected innocent tasks, such as buying two gifts for a friend from a local shop.  Just before the participant leaves the building, they will be intercepted by an interviewer and taken to a nearby room for questioning. The interviewer will be blind to which tasks are actually part of the study and the participant\u2019s task is to deceive the interviewer successfully. The interviewer will first ask the participant about their intentions, followed by questions about any mental image that was activated during the planning of their task. Finally, participants will be asked to sketch a picture of their most dominant mental image of what it will be like when they complete their task. Participants will then return to the original room and complete a detailed post-interview questionnaire beginning with questions directly related to EFT, followed by questions adapted from the Memory Characteristics Questionnaire (MCQ, Johnson, Foley, Suengas &amp; Raye, 1988) relating to the phenomenological characteristics of their most dominant mental image including perceptual details.\nTo assess participant\u2019s EFT ability, participants will complete an episodic details task adapted from D\u2019Argembeau, Ortoleva, Jumentier and Van der Linden\u2019s (2010) study. The episodic details task requires participants to imagine a possible situation that they may encounter in the future (\u2018imagine something you will do on your next holiday\u2019). Participants will be told to describe the specific event as if they were physically present in the situation including as many details as possible. Participants will then respond to a series of questions adapted from the MCQ (Johnson et al, 1988) indicating their phenomenological experience of the task.  In the previous study (study 1), this EFT task was the most predictive measure of the amount of details and number of words participants used, when describing their true and deceptive intention. Participants will also complete the revised Hexaco Personality Inventory (Ashton &amp; Lee, 2009) in which they will rate 60 statements about themselves from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). This questionnaire measures six broad personality factors: Honesty-humility, emotionality, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience.\nParticipants will then take part in the same \u2018intent to deceive\u2019 experiment as study 1, which is largely based on Granhag and Knieps (2011).

Perceptual details given in the verbal and self-report of the episodic details task will correlate. Self-reports of the mental image formed in the episodic details task will also correlate with self-reports of the truthful and deceptive mental images.\n\nPersonality\nIndividuals who scored higher on extraversion will use more words when describing their truthful and deceptive tasks and mental images.\n\nInteractions\nThe previous study found main effects of veracity and EFT and a partial interaction effect. Those with higher EFT ability were rated as more believable when they were lying (but not when they were telling the truth) vs. those with lower EFT ability. Those with higher EFT ability also had their stories rated as more plausible when they were lying vs. those with lower EFT ability. We predict a similar interaction in this study: the differences in truthful and deceptive accounts (as measured by level of detail and word count) will be smaller for individuals with higher EFT ability vs. those with lower EFT ability. We are however, unsure whether this is a modality specific interaction. We hypothesise that there may be a 3-way interaction effect between veracity, modality (sketching/speaking) and EFT. Those with higher EFT ability may have their deceptive verbal (but not their deceptive sketches) rated as more truthful than those with lower EFT ability. Those with higher EFT ability may have their deceptive sketches judged as more concrete versus those with lower EFT ability.\n\n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Participants will then return to the original room and complete a detailed post-interview questionnaire beginning with questions directly related to EFT, followed by questions relating to the phenomenological characteristics of EFT.\n\nIn part B of this study, we will ask a separate group of participants to rate the veracity of the verbal descriptions of the truthful and deceptive tasks provided in part A. Participants will also rate their confidence in their veracity judgements as well as the plausibility of the story.\n\nIn part C of this study, we will ask participants to rate the veracity of the sketches collected part A. We will also ask them to rate the abstractness of the sketches. This task is a replication of Calderon, Giolla, Ask and Granhag, (2018). Calderon et al. found that participants judged drawings of false intentions as more abstract than true intentions drawings.\n", "q4": "Main effect hypotheses\n\nVeracity\nParticipants will give more details in their truthful interview/sketch/self-report than in their deception interview/sketch/self-report. Truthful mental image sketches will be judged as more concrete and deceptive mental image sketches as more abstract.\n\nEFT ability \nIndividuals with higher episodic future thought ability will give more details in their interviews/sketches than those with lower EFT ability. \n\nModality Sketching/Speaking/Self report\nParticipants will give more details in their verbal accounts than their sketches. Perceptual details given in the verbal and self-report of the episodic details task will correlate. Self-reports of the mental image formed in the episodic details task will also correlate with self-reports of the truthful and deceptive mental images.\n\nPersonality\nIndividuals who scored higher on extraversion will use more words when describing their truthful and deceptive tasks and mental images.\n\nInteractions\nThe previous study found main effects of veracity and EFT and a partial interaction effect. Those with higher EFT ability were rated as more believable when they were lying (but not when they were telling the truth) vs. those with lower EFT ability. Those with higher EFT ability also had their stories rated as more plausible when they were lying vs. those with lower EFT ability. We predict a similar interaction in this study: the differences in truthful and deceptive accounts (as measured by level of detail and word count) will be smaller for individuals with higher EFT ability vs. those with lower EFT ability. We are however, unsure whether this is a modality specific interaction. We hypothesise that there may be a 3-way interaction effect between veracity, modality (sketching/speaking) and EFT. Those with higher EFT ability may have their deceptive verbal (but not their deceptive sketches) rated as more truthful than those with lower EFT ability. Those with higher EFT ability may have their deceptive sketches judged as more concrete versus those with lower EFT ability.\n\n", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

We will test for significance using the p-values from this mediation model.", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=53ymu", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "53ymu", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "53ymu", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/7atwq/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "7atwq", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mhe5q/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "mhe5q", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/53ymu/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/53ymu/"}}], "links": {"first": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json", "last": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "prev": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=40", "next": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=42", "meta": {"total": 5469, "per_page": 10}}}
