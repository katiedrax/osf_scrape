An example item is \u201cwhether or not someone did something disgusting.\u201d Responses will range from 1 (not at all relevant) to 6 (extremely relevant).\n\nDisapproval of gay marriage will be assessed by the following 6 items: \u201cGay marriage threatens the meaning of the traditional family,\u201d \u201cGay marriage weakens the morals of society,\u201d \u201cI morally disapprove of gay marriage,\u201d \u201cGay marriage should be illegal,\u201d \u201cMarriage should only occur between a man and a woman,\u201d and \u201cGay marriage is simply wrong.\u201d Responses will range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).\n\nDisapproval of casual sex will be assessed by the following 5 items: \u201cCasual sex weakens the morals of society,\u201d \u201cI morally disapprove of casual sex,\u201d \u201cCasual sex threatens the meaning of proper relationships,\u201d \u201cSex should only occur between partners who are exclusively committed to each other long-term,\u201d and  \u201cCasual sex is simply wrong.\u201d Responses will range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).\n\nDisapproval of anal sex will be assessed by the following 5 items: \u201cI morally disapprove of anal sex,\u201d \u201cAnal sex weakens the morals of society,\u201d \u201cAnal sex threatens the meaning of proper sexual relationships,\u201d \u201cAnal sex is simply wrong,\u201d and  \u201cAnal sex should be discouraged.\u201d Responses will range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).\n\nMediator variables include disgust toward each of the 3 sex-related acts listed above: gay marriage, casual sex, and anal sex.

The full methods for our previous study are available here (https://osf.io/hx5ca). Briefly, we reviewed each journal for the level of adherence to the minimum transparency research standards using the COS scorecard. This includes eight transparency standards in the TOP guidelines (https://cos.io/top/) as well as three additional items (TOP signatory, registered reports, open science badges). A total score out of 29 is determined by combining the COS score total (the combined score of each of the 8 transparency standards (scored between 0 to 24) with the scores for the three additional items - TOP signatory (0 = no, 1 = yes), registered reports (0 = no, 2 = yes) and open science badges (0 = no, 2 = yes). Separately, we also assessed each journal for their adherence to four of the standards found in the ICMJE disclosure form for conflicts of interest (COI), scoring a total out of four.\n\nThe findings of our audit were:\n1. The highest scoring journals were Cell, Nature Medicine, Nature Neuroscience and Neuron, all with a COS score of 14 (out of 29). The lowest scoring journal was the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, with a COS score of 0. The median COS score was 6.5 (IQR 2-13) \n2. The COS TOP standard that consistently scored lowest across the included journals were analysis plan preregistration and replication. The COS TOP standard that consistently scored highest across the included journals was data transparency.\n3. The majority (17/20) of journals stated all four ICMJE requirements for disclosure of interests, the exceptions being Cell (3 out of 4), Journal of Clinical Oncology (3 out of 4) and Neuron (3 out of 4).\n\nOverall, there appears a disappointing lack of engagement with open and transparent research practices in the highest-ranked medical and health journals. Our findings replicate those of another study that performed a similar audit of journals specialising in pain research (Cashin et al., 2020). The natural question to ask is how do we encourage journals to improve this situation? Indeed, Cashin and colleagues called for future research assessing interventions to facilitate uptake of better transparency and open science practices. \n\nWe, therefore, set about to investigate the possible impact of a simple intervention on positive changes of the medical and health journals we audited in our first study.

We will do this by comparing change/re-audit scores in those journals randomly assigned to LTE-2 (intervention) with those randomly assigned to LTE-1. We will determine the acceptance rate for LTEs by totalling the number of journals who accept the letter and divide this by the total number of journals included in this analysis (n=20).
