The individual contemplating the discussion is referred to as the ego while the potential discussion partner is referred to as the alter. Conflict-ridden political discussions have the potential to threaten people's need for social harmony, worldview certainty/consistency, and positive self-image. Consequently, anticipating conflict in a political discussions should heighten anxiety and lead the ego to avoid political discussions with the alter.\n\nH1: People will feel more anxious about the idea of bringing up political topics in discussions when disagreement is anticipated compared to when agreement is anticipated because they hope to minimize the psychological and social costs of conflict.\n\nH2: People will avoid political topics in discussions more when disagreement is anticipated compared to when agreement is anticipated because they hope to minimize the psychological and social costs of conflict.\n\nIf social considerations are driving the avoidance response, we would expect to see the strength of relationship moderate the amount of anxiety felt and willingness to discuss politics when political disagreement is anticipated. Relationship costs and the threat of political conflict are expected to be greater when pre-existing relationship ties are weaker because there is no existing condition of intimacy and trust in these casual/distant relationships to minimize the social costs of political disagreement.\n\nH3: People are expected to feel more anxiety about the idea of bringing up politics when the discussion alter in the dyad has a casual relationship with the ego compared to a situation where the ego is contemplating a discussion with a significant alter.\n\nH4: People are expected to avoid political conflict more when the discussion alter in the dyad has a casual relationship with the ego compared to a situation where the ego is contemplating a discussion with a significant alter.\n\nWhile political conflict may threaten relational goals, conflict is also expected to be psychologically threatening. Exposure to views and opinions that are incongruent with a person's worldview may threaten their fundamental need for consistency. Disagreement may also threaten people's need for a positive self-image. According to the self-affirmation theory, defensive responses arise when a person's sense of being ``adaptively and morally adequate'' is compromised. Therefore, Steele (1988) argues the effects of threat to the self-concept can be countered by administering metaphorical booster shots for the ``self-integrity'' (Steele 1988, 262). This is done by giving a people an opportunity to reflect on a personally important value that is unrelated and prior to the threat topic. Individuals who affirm personally important values before exposure to threat are more secure in self-worth and less likely to engage in dissonance reduction strategies. We expect the self-concept reframing produced by self-affirmation will minimize the threat of political conflict and lead people to feel less anxiety about and more open to discussing political topics even when the discussion may threaten their worldview.\n\nH5: Self-affirmation will reduce the amount of anxiety felt about discussing politics under conditions of high ego-threat that is expected to occur when political disagreement is anticipated.\n\nH6: Self-affirmation will reduce avoidance of political topics in conversations under conditions of high ego-threat that is expected to occur when political disagreement is anticipated.\n\nWhile social and relationship reasons may contribute to an individual's response to anticipated disagreement in a discussion, we do not expect relationship strength to moderate the effect of self-affirmation political conflict avoidance in discussions. Self-affirmation tasks are predicted to reduce ego-defense strategies by manipulating self-concept, not perceptions of social or relationship threat. Incongruent information should be equally threatening to the need for self-consistency and self-enhancement irrespective of the social relation of the source in a discussion. Self-affirmation is predicted to reduce the psychological self-concept discomfort of unwelcome and inconsistent information by securing self-worth and reducing the need to avoid political disagreement. Therefore, we expect the effect of the self-affirmation treatment to be substantively similar when people are considering political discussions with someone who has strong or weak relationship ties with them.\n\nH7: The effects of self-affirmation on anxiety about political discussion are expected to be similar irrespective of strength of relationship ties because affirmation is predicted to manipulate the level of identity/ego-threat, not social threat.\n\nH8: The effects of self-affirmation on political conflict avoidance are expected to be similar irrespective of strength of relationship ties because affirmation is predicted to manipulate the level of identity/ego-threat, not social threat.\n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Periodically throughout the task we asked participants to indicate whether their thoughts were currently freely-moving or not. Finally, O\u2019Neill et al. (2019) suggested that the constraint dimension might, in some way, be related to the concept of a \u201c\ufb02ow state\u201d (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Nakamura &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2014) or \u201cdeep effortless concentration\u201d (Marty-Dugas &amp; Smilek, 2019).
