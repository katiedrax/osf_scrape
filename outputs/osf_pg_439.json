Parent-child dyads completed a 2.5-hour lab visit wherein cardiac (electrocardiogram, ECG; impedance cardiogram, IC) and neural (electroencephalogram, EEG) measures were collected in parents and children throughout a variety of tasks. Approximately one hour after arriving at the lab, parents and children were seated next to each other and completed a 5-minute resting assessment of ECG and IC. Towards the end of the lab visit, children and their parent were again seated at a table together to complete a challenging puzzle task for 5 minutes, while ECG and IC were continuously recorded. A \u201cmoose\u201d made of 11 Duplo blocks was set on the table in front of the child, and the child was given a set of the same 11 blocks, not yet constructed, and instructed to build a replica of the moose. Parents were instructed to verbally assist their child in completing the moose but were explicitly told to not touch the Duplo blocks.

Autonomic function will be indexed via HRV (for PNS) and PEP (for SNS) scores obtained from ECG and IC signals during a 5-minute resting baseline task and during a subsequent 5-minute challenge task (see Brief Overview above for description of lab visit). For HRV, a frequency range of .15-.40 Hz will be used to quantify variability of heart rate in the respiration range for adults. Both HRV and PEP will be processed in 30-second epochs during each of the 5-minute tasks. Baseline HRV and PEP will be calculated as the average across all 30-second epochs during the 5-minute baseline task. Change scores of HRV and PEP, used as predictors in level one of the multilevel models, will be calculated for each 30-second epoch as HRV or PEP activity in that epoch subtracted by the baseline value for that measure.\n\nThe main deviation from the previous study by Giuliano et al. (2015) is that parenting quality will be assessed using a different observational coding scheme. For this study, we will be using a lab-developed coding scheme tailored to preschooler-caregiver interactions based on the model proposed by Stansbury and Sigman (2000). This model features specific codes for how parents scaffold children\u2019s self-regulation regarding objects and emotions, which is especially relevant to this task. Parenting behaviors are operationalized from this coding scheme along dimensions of: negative emotion reactions, positive emotion reactions, escape or avoidance, expressive encouragement, controlling, distraction, collaborative problem solving, task strategizing, task directed, and reframing. Each of the 10 dimensions of parenting will be coded in 30 second epochs for the entirety of the challenge task and later averaged to yield task averages of parenting. Summary scores across all dimensions will be calculated as the overall measure of Parenting Quality.

The data to be analyzed were previously collected during the Fall semesters of 2014, 2015, and 2016. Parent-child dyads completed a 2.5-hour lab visit wherein cardiac (electrocardiogram, ECG; impedance cardiogram, IC) and neural (electroencephalogram, EEG) measures were collected in parents and children throughout a variety of tasks. Approximately one hour after arriving at the lab, parents and children were seated next to each other and completed a 5-minute resting assessment of ECG and IC. Towards the end of the lab visit, children and their parent were again seated at a table together to complete a challenging puzzle task for 5 minutes, while ECG and IC were continuously recorded. A \u201cmoose\u201d made of 11 Duplo blocks was set on the table in front of the child, and the child was given a set of the same 11 blocks, not yet constructed, and instructed to build a replica of the moose. Parents were instructed to verbally assist their child in completing the moose but were explicitly told to not touch the Duplo blocks. After 5 minutes, a research assistant entered the room and ended the task. Shortly afterwards, parents and children remained seated and completed a 5-minute resting assessment of ECG and IC before leaving the laboratory.", "q4": "We expect to replicate the finding that parents with low parenting quality assessments during a challenging puzzle task with their child will concurrently show diminished reactivity of high-frequency variability in heart rate at the respiration range, or heart rate variability (HRV), indexing less dynamic parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity.

We predict that individuals with low SNS activity, at rest or during the task, will show a greater dynamic range of HRV reactivity to the task.

Autonomic function will be indexed via HRV (for PNS) and PEP (for SNS) scores obtained from ECG and IC signals during a 5-minute resting baseline task and during a subsequent 5-minute challenge task (see Brief Overview above for description of lab visit). For HRV, a frequency range of .15-.40 Hz will be used to quantify variability of heart rate in the respiration range for adults. Both HRV and PEP will be processed in 30-second epochs during each of the 5-minute tasks. Baseline HRV and PEP will be calculated as the average across all 30-second epochs during the 5-minute baseline task. Change scores of HRV and PEP, used as predictors in level one of the multilevel models, will be calculated for each 30-second epoch as HRV or PEP activity in that epoch subtracted by the baseline value for that measure.\n\nThe main deviation from the previous study by Giuliano et al. (2015) is that parenting quality will be assessed using a different observational coding scheme. For this study, we will be using a lab-developed coding scheme tailored to preschooler-caregiver interactions based on the model proposed by Stansbury and Sigman (2000). This model features specific codes for how parents scaffold children\u2019s self-regulation regarding objects and emotions, which is especially relevant to this task. Parenting behaviors are operationalized from this coding scheme along dimensions of: negative emotion reactions, positive emotion reactions, escape or avoidance, expressive encouragement, controlling, distraction, collaborative problem solving, task strategizing, task directed, and reframing.
