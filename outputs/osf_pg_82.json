identify five essential \"foundations\" of human morality.  MFT also suggests that liberals have a narrower morality by attending to only the \"individualizing foundations\" (harm and fairness), contrasted to the broader morality of conservatives, who attend more to the \"binding\" foundations (authority, loyalty, and purity).  The present project suggests, instead, that MFT misses fundamental value tradeoffs made by liberals and conservatives by defining morality, or moral values, too narrowly.  To challenge MFT, I select from the broader framework of Schwartz Value Theory, abstracting four values (obedience, status, universalism, and self-direction) from the Schwartz value circumplex.  To enable a direct comparison with the five foundations of MFT, I \u201ctranslate\u201d these four values into the exact operational language of MFT (i.e., using scale items assessing moral relevancy and moral judgment).  In Study 1, multidimensional scaling of these nine moral constructs (5 foundations + 4 values; n=129) produced a moral circumplex consistent with SVT.  The pattern suggests MFT\u2019s individualizing and binding foundations capture only two narrow slices of the broader moral circumplex.   Further, the predicted trade-offs emerge (e.g., obedience and universalism occupy opposing sides of the circumplex and correlate negatively).  Further, the broader model improves prediction of ideological commitments (e.g., low universalism and low self-direction improve prediction of economic conservatism).  \n\nThe Study 2 proposed here will extend Study 1 findings.  Specifically, I seek to develop a fifth SVT value to improve the prediction of conservatism, namely \"security.\"  I also add a validated measure of social and economic conservatism to better compare predictive validity of the MFT and SVT models.  In general, I hope to replicate the basic multidimensional scaling outcome from Study 1 to demonstrate that MVT identifies only a subset of a broader set of moral concerns.  In addition, I hope to compare the ability of the two models to predict overall ideological orientation and position on specific political issues (e.g., abortion and gun control).", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-08T14:54:20.529939", "date_modified": "2020-04-08T14:50:04.499271", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["conservatism", "ideology", "Moral Foundations Theory", "morality", "Schwartz Value Theory", "values"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "6d528edbbbeda227ffd38f54879d0f63aa6c436d6660c9bf2f919125432c727895586dd74a9d254462e15a610a9259bf9fdb1f45b3e5713ab8973060f8c2faa1e08b87ce909f44cdf497ba2ec9e2c2c9233d2eab9077f1e768342b35824821d70c250aea74cbb996773c713fabe12a8abb62e1e294a0f45cd2d54bd90faa7ba44f11005966e39f2d6d26196646d6f1f0", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-08T14:54:20.501568", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Jeff Sinn"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "See attachment under design plan"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

I them select 3 of the former and 3 of the latter with the highest inter-item correlation values to comprise 6 item measures of each value, for 24 items total.

Epidemiological studies have reported that 20% of people over 20 years old suffer from rotator cuff tears, while 25% of people over 50 years old suffer from rotator cuff tears, which is the main cause of shoulder joint pain and dysfunction and greatly affects patients\u2019 work efficiency and quality of life. An epidemiological study in the United States reports that 4.5 million people are hospitalized every year for Rotator cuff tears. The rotator cuff is composed of supraspinatus muscle, infraspinatus muscle, subscapularis muscle and teres minor muscle. It starts from the shoulder rib and attaches around the humeral head, forming a sleeve like structure at the anatomical neck of the humeral head. The function of the rotator cuff is to support and stabilize the shoulder and humeral joint, maintain the sealing function of the shoulder joint cavity, maintain the synovial fluid to nourish the articular cartilage, and prevent the secondary osteoarthritis. The treatment principle of rotator cuff tears is to reduce pain and improve the function of shoulder joint. The most common actions taken at present to relieve the symptoms of rotator cuff tears include steroid injections, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physical therapy, exercise therapy, manual therapy, ultrasound therapy and acupuncture. In practice, people with rotator cuff tears seldom receive a single intervention in isolation. Acupuncture and manual therapy usually delivered together as components of a physical therapy intervention, are commonly used in the management of rotator cuff tears. Acupuncture is commonly used for musculoskeletal disorders, and it has been suggested as a meaningful nonsurgical intervention for managing shoulder pain and dysfunction. Manual therapy is also commonly used in the management of rotator cuff tears. Manual therapy includes any clinician-applied movement of the joints and other structures, for example mobilization (of which several types exist) or manipulation. The aims of both types of interventions are to improve function, promote healing, increase joint range, strengthen weakened muscles and correct imbalance in the stabilizing function of the rotator cuff. The mechanism of acupuncture treatment has not been fully elucidated. Some studies have pointed out that the mechanism of acupuncture and moxibustion treatment may be related to the local effect, which refers to the release of neuropeptide and other substances by stimulating the sensory nerve endings of skin and muscle tissue. The research shows that acupuncture can promote the release of \u03b2-endorphin and increase the concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine in brain tissue, so as to reduce the sensitivity of tissue to pain and improve joint activity. Manual therapy can stimulate peripheral mechanoreceptors and inhibit nociceptors to reducing pain, and can enhance exchange between synovial \ufb02uid and cartilage matrix to increasing joint mobility. Previous systematic reviews have not assessed acupuncture and manual therapy for rotator cuff tears together. Consequently, we decided to conduct a systematic review based on the best currently available evidence and methodology to evaluate whether acupuncture and manual therapy is effect and safety for pain and function of rotator cuff tears.

Epidemiological studies have reported that 20% of people over 20 years old suffer from rotator cuff tears, while 25% of people over 50 years old suffer from rotator cuff tears, which is the main cause of shoulder joint pain and dysfunction and greatly affects patients\u2019 work efficiency and quality of life. An epidemiological study in the United States reports that 4.5 million people are hospitalized every year for Rotator cuff tears. The rotator cuff is composed of supraspinatus muscle, infraspinatus muscle, subscapularis muscle and teres minor muscle. It starts from the shoulder rib and attaches around the humeral head, forming a sleeve like structure at the anatomical neck of the humeral head. The function of the rotator cuff is to support and stabilize the shoulder and humeral joint, maintain the sealing function of the shoulder joint cavity, maintain the synovial fluid to nourish the articular cartilage, and prevent the secondary osteoarthritis. The treatment principle of rotator cuff tears is to reduce pain and improve the function of shoulder joint. The most common actions taken at present to relieve the symptoms of rotator cuff tears include steroid injections, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physical therapy, exercise therapy, manual therapy, ultrasound therapy and acupuncture. In practice, people with rotator cuff tears seldom receive a single intervention in isolation. Acupuncture and manual therapy usually delivered together as components of a physical therapy intervention, are commonly used in the management of rotator cuff tears. Acupuncture is commonly used for musculoskeletal disorders, and it has been suggested as a meaningful nonsurgical intervention for managing shoulder pain and dysfunction. Manual therapy is also commonly used in the management of rotator cuff tears. Manual therapy includes any clinician-applied movement of the joints and other structures, for example mobilization (of which several types exist) or manipulation. The aims of both types of interventions are to improve function, promote healing, increase joint range, strengthen weakened muscles and correct imbalance in the stabilizing function of the rotator cuff.
