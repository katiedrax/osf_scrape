of two treatments about the relationship between trade and security. One treatment indicates that trade can increase the risk of war, so it is best to trade with friendly states, but not threatening states. The other treatment indicates that trade decreases the risk of war and trade with all states (friendly and threatening) should have positive security effects. Both treatments state that bilateral trade is economically beneficial for both trading partners. Additional analyses examine how treatments interact with geographic and personal proximity to the conflict and ethnolinguistic identity to affect different levels of support for trade between Russia and Ukraine. This study will provide insight into how citizens respond to expert opinion and how the public responds to conflict and trade and the relationship between the two."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypotheses: This research examines how Ukrainian attitudes about trade with Russia and the EU are affected by beliefs about the security consequences of trade. Given the context of Ukraine and the differences across the country, we include ethnolinguistic, regional, and personal proximity to conflict in subgroup analyses and as control variables. H1. We expect that respondents will indicate greater agreement that trade with Russia will improve the political and economic situation in Ukraine in the treatment group that receives information about the positive security effects of trade than in either the control group or the group that is primed with negative security effects of trade. Similarly, respondents who are primed with a treatment about the negative security effects of trade will indicate lower agreement with statements that trade with Russia will improve conditions in Ukraine, relative to the control group or those that receive primes about the positive security effects of trade. H2: The effects of the treatments (positive for reduced risk and negative for increased risk) will be strongest for effects on the political situation (i.e., treatments will produce differences from the control to greater extent or with less variance). We expect that the treatments will have more muted effects on beliefs about the economic effects of trade (sociotropic may also be stronger than personal, but we do not have a clear hypothesis about this). The treatments state that trade is economically beneficial, but if that statement is coupled with an increased security risk, the effect may be null or it may be negative (but smaller than the effect of the treatment on the political situation). If the decreased security risk treatment is received, it may increase assessment of the positive economic effects of trade with Russia or it may be null for economic effects. H3. We anticipate that the effects of the trade-increases-security-risk treatment on attitudes about trade with the EU will be opposite of those for trade with Russia (they will increase agreement that trade with the EU is good for Ukraine). The trade-decreases-security-risk treatment may or may not change beliefs about the positive effects of trade between the EU and Ukraine (since the EU is less likely to be viewed as a security threat in the control group)\u2014so this effect may be null or positive. Again, we anticipate strongest effects of the treatments on the question about the political situation, with more muted effects on questions about economic circumstances. \u2022 Ethnolinguistic Differences H4. Given Ukraine\u2019s unique context and ethnolinguistic divide, we anticipate that those whose identities are more Ukrainian will have a different baseline belief about the beneficial effects of trade with Russia (and the EU) than those whose identities (nationality or language) are more Russian. Specifically, we expect Ukrainian speakers to have lower baseline agreement on whether trade with Russia is going to improve any of the outcomes. Similarly, we anticipate Ukrainians to have higher baseline agreement that trade with the EU is going to help (across all three outcomes). Because identical treatments are given to both language groups, pooling them may artificially inflate the estimate of the variance in the responses. We, therefore, will control for ethnolinguistic identity in some models of regression analysis and will also conduct sub-group analyses for the two main ethnolinguistic groups (Ukrainian Ukrainians and Russian Ukrainians). \u2022 Regional Differences H5. We anticipate that there are likely to be regional differences in the size of the effect since a treatment about the security effects of trade may differ based on geographic proximity to the conflict. While we anticipate that the effects stated above (H1 and H2) will hold in the national sample, we will analyze macro-regional subgroups (using macro regions as defined by KIIS). Prior trade relations with trade partners and varying levels of security threats associated with geographic proximity to conflict will be associated with the regions. Specifically, if proximity to the conflict matters, we anticipate that those in the East and South will be more sensitive to the primes (larger effects but in the same direction) than those in the Center or West, but that across regions means for the same experimental group will probably not significantly differ from each other (except possibly due to ethnolinguistic composition). If ethnolinguistic composition or importance of trade with Russia in the regional economy matters more, the effects of the increased-security-risk treatment in South and East may be less negative than in the Center and West. We, therefore, will control for regions in some models of regression analysis and will also conduct sub-group analyses for each region. \u2022 Personal proximity to conflict H6. In addition to geographic distance as captured in our regional control and subgroup analysis, we anticipate that the treatments may have different effects (particularly the strength of the effects) when conditioned on the level of personal proximity to conflict. Specifically, the survey measures if respondents personally know someone who has been wounded or killed or has been forced to leave their homes due to the conflict. We plan to use controls for this level of personal exposure in some models of regression analysis Quantities of interest: Level of agreement (10-pt scale) for each statement. 1 representing \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d, 5 representing \u201cneither agree nor disagree,\u201d and 10 representing \u201cstrongly agree.\u201d"}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "H1-H3. As the survey experiment includes three groups and outcomes are measured with a 10-point agreement scale, OLS regression will be used to analyze difference in mean level of agreement between control groups and increased risk and decreased risk treatment groups. We will check whether there is a need to cluster the standard errors by province, as each province\u2019s economy has a differing level of trade dependence on Russia and a different exposure to risk from the war. Moreover, we will analyze the questions separately, as well as analyze the questions as an index (for Russia and the EU separately). H4. In addition to controlling for which language is spoken in some models in the OLS analysis, we will run a subgroup analysis by ethnolinguistic group, with the goal of understanding whether the magnitude of the treatment effect varies by categories of an ethnolinguistic subgroup. H5. In addition to controlling for which region the respondent resides in in some models in the OLS analysis, we will conduct a subgroup analysis based on macro-region (4 macro-regions as defined by KIIS: West, Center, East, and South). H6. We will include personal proximity to the conflict as a control variable in some models of the OLS analysis. H1-H6.

The other treatment indicates that trade decreases the risk of war and trade with all states (friendly and threatening) should have positive security effects. Both treatments state that bilateral trade is economically beneficial for both trading partners. Additional analyses examine how treatments interact with geographic and personal proximity to the conflict and ethnolinguistic identity to affect different levels of support for trade between Russia and Ukraine. This study will provide insight into how citizens respond to expert opinion and how the public responds to conflict and trade and the relationship between the two.", "q16": "Hypotheses: This research examines how Ukrainian attitudes about trade with Russia and the EU are affected by beliefs about the security consequences of trade. Given the context of Ukraine and the differences across the country, we include ethnolinguistic, regional, and personal proximity to conflict in subgroup analyses and as control variables. H1. We expect that respondents will indicate greater agreement that trade with Russia will improve the political and economic situation in Ukraine in the treatment group that receives information about the positive security effects of trade than in either the control group or the group that is primed with negative security effects of trade. Similarly, respondents who are primed with a treatment about the negative security effects of trade will indicate lower agreement with statements that trade with Russia will improve conditions in Ukraine, relative to the control group or those that receive primes about the positive security effects of trade. H2: The effects of the treatments (positive for reduced risk and negative for increased risk) will be strongest for effects on the political situation (i.e., treatments will produce differences from the control to greater extent or with less variance). We expect that the treatments will have more muted effects on beliefs about the economic effects of trade (sociotropic may also be stronger than personal, but we do not have a clear hypothesis about this). The treatments state that trade is economically beneficial, but if that statement is coupled with an increased security risk, the effect may be null or it may be negative (but smaller than the effect of the treatment on the political situation). If the decreased security risk treatment is received, it may increase assessment of the positive economic effects of trade with Russia or it may be null for economic effects. H3. We anticipate that the effects of the trade-increases-security-risk treatment on attitudes about trade with the EU will be opposite of those for trade with Russia (they will increase agreement that trade with the EU is good for Ukraine). The trade-decreases-security-risk treatment may or may not change beliefs about the positive effects of trade between the EU and Ukraine (since the EU is less likely to be viewed as a security threat in the control group)\u2014so this effect may be null or positive. Again, we anticipate strongest effects of the treatments on the question about the political situation, with more muted effects on questions about economic circumstances. \u2022 Ethnolinguistic Differences H4. Given Ukraine\u2019s unique context and ethnolinguistic divide, we anticipate that those whose identities are more Ukrainian will have a different baseline belief about the beneficial effects of trade with Russia (and the EU) than those whose identities (nationality or language) are more Russian. Specifically, we expect Ukrainian speakers to have lower baseline agreement on whether trade with Russia is going to improve any of the outcomes. Similarly, we anticipate Ukrainians to have higher baseline agreement that trade with the EU is going to help (across all three outcomes). Because identical treatments are given to both language groups, pooling them may artificially inflate the estimate of the variance in the responses. We, therefore, will control for ethnolinguistic identity in some models of regression analysis and will also conduct sub-group analyses for the two main ethnolinguistic groups (Ukrainian Ukrainians and Russian Ukrainians). \u2022 Regional Differences H5. We anticipate that there are likely to be regional differences in the size of the effect since a treatment about the security effects of trade may differ based on geographic proximity to the conflict. While we anticipate that the effects stated above (H1 and H2) will hold in the national sample, we will analyze macro-regional subgroups (using macro regions as defined by KIIS). Prior trade relations with trade partners and varying levels of security threats associated with geographic proximity to conflict will be associated with the regions. Specifically, if proximity to the conflict matters, we anticipate that those in the East and South will be more sensitive to the primes (larger effects but in the same direction) than those in the Center or West, but that across regions means for the same experimental group will probably not significantly differ from each other (except possibly due to ethnolinguistic composition). If ethnolinguistic composition or importance of trade with Russia in the regional economy matters more, the effects of the increased-security-risk treatment in South and East may be less negative than in the Center and West. We, therefore, will control for regions in some models of regression analysis and will also conduct sub-group analyses for each region. \u2022 Personal proximity to conflict H6. In addition to geographic distance as captured in our regional control and subgroup analysis, we anticipate that the treatments may have different effects (particularly the strength of the effects) when conditioned on the level of personal proximity to conflict. Specifically, the survey measures if respondents personally know someone who has been wounded or killed or has been forced to leave their homes due to the conflict. We plan to use controls for this level of personal exposure in some models of regression analysis Quantities of interest: Level of agreement (10-pt scale) for each statement. 1 representing \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d, 5 representing \u201cneither agree nor disagree,\u201d and 10 representing \u201cstrongly agree.\u201d", "q17": "H1-H3. As the survey experiment includes three groups and outcomes are measured with a 10-point agreement scale, OLS regression will be used to analyze difference in mean level of agreement between control groups and increased risk and decreased risk treatment groups. We will check whether there is a need to cluster the standard errors by province, as each province\u2019s economy has a differing level of trade dependence on Russia and a different exposure to risk from the war. Moreover, we will analyze the questions separately, as well as analyze the questions as an index (for Russia and the EU separately). H4. In addition to controlling for which language is spoken in some models in the OLS analysis, we will run a subgroup analysis by ethnolinguistic group, with the goal of understanding whether the magnitude of the treatment effect varies by categories of an ethnolinguistic subgroup. H5. In addition to controlling for which region the respondent resides in in some models in the OLS analysis, we will conduct a subgroup analysis based on macro-region (4 macro-regions as defined by KIIS: West, Center, East, and South). H6. We will include personal proximity to the conflict as a control variable in some models of the OLS analysis. H1-H6. We will first run an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis, in which we analyze all participants who were randomized in the study according to the treatment groups to which they were originally assigned, regardless of how well they understood the treatment.

We conduct a randomized field experiment, contacting 2,934 college admissions offices, testing for bureaucratic discrimination against ex- felons. A college degree is increasingly important in the labor market, and is an important compo- nent of successful societal re-entry. Low education levels contribute to reduced mobility and for formerly incarcerated persons, and the \u2019mark of a criminal record\u2019 can be an enduring stigma that makes it harder to access social goods and services, whether through direct exclusion or through bureaucratic neglect. Our experiment measures bureaucratic discrimination against ex-felons by sending e-mails to 2,934 college admissions offices. The e-mails inquire as to the requirements for application and admission. We test whether an individual\u2019s criminal record and race reduces the likelihood of getting an e-mail response from an admissions bureaucrat. We further test whether this potential bias is mitigated if the e-mail is sent on behalf of the applicant but from an advocate from the applicant\u2019s professional network \u2013 specifically a former teacher of theirs.

Our primary outcome of interest is the rate of response for different treatment conditions. Going beyond response rates, we also measure differences in the friendliness, thoroughness, and accuracy of responses. Generally speaking, we hypothesize that admissions office bureaucrats will be less likely to respond to an e-mail inquiring about admissions if the potential applicant is identified as having spent time in prison, all else held equal. When they do respond, we expect that their responses will be less friendly, thorough, and accurate when the potential applicant is an ex-felon. We further hypothesize that admissions office bureaucrats will be less likely to respond to e-mails where the potential applicant has a putatively Black name compared to a putatively White name. When they do respond, we expect that their responses will be less friendly, thorough, and accurate when the potential applicant has a putatively Black name.

Lastly, we expect that admissions bureaucrats will be less likely to respond to e-mails from a teacher who has a putatively Black name than a putatively White name. In addition to our main hypotheses, we will examine interaction effects between our treatments. In general, we anticipate that response bias against ex-felons will be exacerbated when the potential applicant has a putatively Black name compared to a putatively White name. We further predict that the positive effects of the advocate treatment will be mitigated when the advocate has a putatively Black name compared to when the advocate has a putatively White name. In addition, we hypothesize that the added positive effect of the advocate will be most acute when the potential applicant is Black and the advocate is White, as this provides a signal that can cut through potential racial bias."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "In our study, we send e-mails to college admissions bureaucrats, inquiring about eligibility for admissions.

However, earlier stages along the education- employment chain are substantively understudied. We conduct a randomized field experiment, contacting 2,934 college admissions offices, testing for bureaucratic discrimination against ex- felons. A college degree is increasingly important in the labor market, and is an important compo- nent of successful societal re-entry. Low education levels contribute to reduced mobility and for formerly incarcerated persons, and the \u2019mark of a criminal record\u2019 can be an enduring stigma that makes it harder to access social goods and services, whether through direct exclusion or through bureaucratic neglect. Our experiment measures bureaucratic discrimination against ex-felons by sending e-mails to 2,934 college admissions offices. The e-mails inquire as to the requirements for application and admission. We test whether an individual\u2019s criminal record and race reduces the likelihood of getting an e-mail response from an admissions bureaucrat. We further test whether this potential bias is mitigated if the e-mail is sent on behalf of the applicant but from an advocate from the applicant\u2019s professional network \u2013 specifically a former teacher of theirs. This component of the design tests one of the mechanisms by which marginalized populations can better extract information from a biased bureaucracy. Additionally, we test whether the race of the advocate affects response bias.", "q16": "In our study, we send e-mails to college admissions bureaucrats, inquiring about eligibility for admissions. Our primary outcome of interest is the rate of response for different treatment conditions. Going beyond response rates, we also measure differences in the friendliness, thoroughness, and accuracy of responses. Generally speaking, we hypothesize that admissions office bureaucrats will be less likely to respond to an e-mail inquiring about admissions if the potential applicant is identified as having spent time in prison, all else held equal. When they do respond, we expect that their responses will be less friendly, thorough, and accurate when the potential applicant is an ex-felon. We further hypothesize that admissions office bureaucrats will be less likely to respond to e-mails where the potential applicant has a putatively Black name compared to a putatively White name. When they do respond, we expect that their responses will be less friendly, thorough, and accurate when the potential applicant has a putatively Black name. We also hypothesize that bureaucrats will be more likely to respond to e-mails if the e-mail is sent by a former teacher of the potential applicant, rather than directly by the applicant himself. When they do respond, we expect that their responses will be more friendly, thorough, and accurate when the e-mail is sent by the teacher. Lastly, we expect that admissions bureaucrats will be less likely to respond to e-mails from a teacher who has a putatively Black name than a putatively White name. In addition to our main hypotheses, we will examine interaction effects between our treatments. In general, we anticipate that response bias against ex-felons will be exacerbated when the potential applicant has a putatively Black name compared to a putatively White name. We further predict that the positive effects of the advocate treatment will be mitigated when the advocate has a putatively Black name compared to when the advocate has a putatively White name. In addition, we hypothesize that the added positive effect of the advocate will be most acute when the potential applicant is Black and the advocate is White, as this provides a signal that can cut through potential racial bias.", "q17": "In our study, we send e-mails to college admissions bureaucrats, inquiring about eligibility for admissions. We randomize 4 things in the experiment. First, we randomize whether the e-mail is sent from the potential applicant directly, or from an advocate\u2013 in this case a person identified as a former teacher of the applicant. Second, we randomize whether the applicant in question (either the sender, or the person the advocate refers to) is an ex-felon. This treatment tests for bias against ex-felons in these bureaucracies. Third, we randomize whether the applicant in question has a putatively White or a putatively Black name. This treatment tests for bias based on the race of the applicant. Lastly, for e-mails that are randomized into the advocate treatment, we randomize whether the advocate has a putatively White or putatively Black name, testing whether the race of the advocate contributes to or ameliorates bias.

security, as informal microentrepreneurs typically do not make any social security contributions. The Brazilian Government has made efforts to address informality among the country's microentrepreneurs. Since 2009, self-employed and micro-entrepreneurs, who hire up to one employee are allowed to register as an \"individual microentrepreneur\" (Microempreendedor Individual or MEI). The MEI program incentives formalization through a combination of 1) subsidized contribution to social security, 2) the exemption from income taxes and 3) a simple and reduced monthly flat rate payment in lieu of other business taxes. Despite the unique set-up of this formalization program, formalization of microentrepreneurs in poorer socio-demographic areas is still low. The study evaluates a series of interventions that facilitates the take-up of the formalization program and encourages payment of monthly contributions by microentrepreneurs in Rio das Pedras, Rio de Janeiro. These interventions are aimed at evaluating the relative effectiveness of information campaigns, reminders, interaction through social networks and perception of political endorsement of the formalization program. The main treatment arm of this field experiment is part of the Metaketa II initiative, which focuses on formalization and tax compliance and requires teams working on related projects in different sites to harmonize their interventions and implement them in a similar timeframe. In our setting, microentrepreneurs are assigned to a one-to-one information session in combination with free technical help to formalize the business. For more information see the Metaketa II: Taxation PAP, ID 20171010AA. Additionally, to the main treatment arm our study conists of two secondary treatment arms. One evaluates the effects of low-cost interventions: i) social media (Whatsapp groups) and ii) reminders (via SMS). Another treatment arm manipulates political endorsement of the formalization program by a politician (former president of Brazil, Lula).

microentrepreneurs typically do not make any social security contributions. The Brazilian Government has made efforts to address informality among the country's microentrepreneurs. Since 2009, self-employed and micro-entrepreneurs, who hire up to one employee are allowed to register as an \"individual microentrepreneur\" (Microempreendedor Individual or MEI). The MEI program incentives formalization through a combination of 1) subsidized contribution to social security, 2) the exemption from income taxes and 3) a simple and reduced monthly flat rate payment in lieu of other business taxes. Despite the unique set-up of this formalization program, formalization of microentrepreneurs in poorer socio-demographic areas is still low. The study evaluates a series of interventions that facilitates the take-up of the formalization program and encourages payment of monthly contributions by microentrepreneurs in Rio das Pedras, Rio de Janeiro. These interventions are aimed at evaluating the relative effectiveness of information campaigns, reminders, interaction through social networks and perception of political endorsement of the formalization program. The main treatment arm of this field experiment is part of the Metaketa II initiative, which focuses on formalization and tax compliance and requires teams working on related projects in different sites to harmonize their interventions and implement them in a similar timeframe. In our setting, microentrepreneurs are assigned to a one-to-one information session in combination with free technical help to formalize the business. For more information see the Metaketa II: Taxation PAP, ID 20171010AA. Additionally, to the main treatment arm our study conists of two secondary treatment arms. One evaluates the effects of low-cost interventions: i) social media (Whatsapp groups) and ii) reminders (via SMS). Another treatment arm manipulates political endorsement of the formalization program by a politician (former president of Brazil, Lula). For further details, see the full version of the PAP below.", "q16": "The outcomes of interest follow the Metaketa II: Taxation PAP (ID 20171010AA) and encompass Formalization, Access to public services, Tax compliance, Tax morale, Risks of non-compliance and Civic and Political Participation. The hypotheses comprise the main effects of the treatment arms as well as the interaction between information sessions and social media/reminder interactions. \u00b7 Information sessions in combination with free technical help increase citizen\u2019s formalization of their relationship with the government \u00b7 Text message reminders magnify the effect of the provision of information on formalization and business tax compliance. \u00b7 Social media interactions with other entrepreneurs increase formalization and business tax compliance. \u00b7 Social media interactions with other entrepreneurs magnify the effect of one-on-one informational campaigns on formalization and business tax compliance. \u00b7 Information that a program is endorsed by/associated with president Lula should increase take-up more than simply providing information about the program among those that ex-ante hold positive views about the endorser. Similar hypotheses will be tested for the other dependent variables. For further details, see the full version of the PAP", "q17": "All treatment conditions will be block randomized in a field experiment. Variables of interest will be collected on baseline and follow-up surveys as well as from secondary data sources (registry of formal microentrepreneurs and tax compliance records).

increase efficiency and effectiveness of service and infrastructure provision as well as land-use planning, support to agriculture and education. Yet, in the existing cases, reforms changing rural government models to increase the efficiency in the provision and management of infrastructural services either amalgamate smaller rural governments into larger regional agencies or transfer decision-making power from central agencies to small rural administrations. Yet, Local Administration Reform (Law No. 6360) that the Turkish government introduced in 2012 followed neither of the above-stated paths. The reform changed the rural governance system in 30 out of 81 governorates of the country by shifting the responsibility and resources for management of rural infrastructure from regional agencies specialized in rural services to metropolitan municipalities specialized in provision of services to urban areas. Villages lost their autonomous administrations and became, de jure, urban neighborhood units, even though they de facto remained rural. The governorates were assigned to the reform in a discretionary manner (based on the total population of the governorate, not population density) which means rural regions were assigned to reform or no-reform governorates in an \u201cas-if random\u201d manner. Taking the opportunity of this \u201cquasi-experiment,\u201d we will have a chance to compare regions that are affected by the reform and regions that are not affected by the reform and explore how the reform changed agricultural production and population trends. Specifically, we aim to find answers to the following questions: What happens when the villages are run by governance institutions that have been governing urban regions? Can urban institutions adjust their delivery structure and priorities fast enough to answer the needs, for example, agriculture-related demands, of rural communities? Or do they harm rural sectors by approaching governance of rural areas with an urban logic?"}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypothesis 1: Governance of rural infrastructure provision by institutions with urban bias leads to decrease in agricultural production. Therefore, we will observe a disproportionate decrease in agricultural production in treatment group villages. Hypothesis 1a: This decrease emerges due to lack of sufficient and/or appropriate provision and management of services in villages. We expect that this causal mechanism will be more predominant for villages that are further away from the urban center of the governorate. Hypothesis 1b: This decrease emerges due to land management decisions of metropolitan municipalities, which turn agricultural lands to commercial or residential zones. We expect that this causal mechanism will be more predominant for villages that are closer to the urban center of the governorate. Hypothesis 2: Population in villages that are governed under the new system will decrease faster as opposed to the villages that are governed under the old regional governance system. This effect will occur because agricultural production in villages under the new governance will decrease disproportionately which will then lead to faster migration of the younger generations. Hypothesis 3: The electoral support for the party in government will increase more in the villages within the scope of the reform as opposed to the villages that stayed under the previous regional governance system in the first elections after the reform passed but before implemented, due to the increased expectations from the new governance system. Hypothesis 4: The electoral support for the party in government will decrease more in the villages within the scope of the reform as opposed to the villages that stayed under the previous regional governance system in the second, third and fourth elections after the reform passed, due to the negative consequences of the reform on agricultural production and village economy."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "Our analyses will draw on a difference-in-difference design.

We interact Tt and Dit to produce the coefficient \u03b8, which is the average treatment effect (ATE) of the treatment on outcomes over time. Xit is a vector of control variables that are employed to minimize variance and capture minor over-time imbalances. Zdt is also a vector of control variables at the district level. In some of the designs where village-level data is not available, Y_itand D_itwill be replaced by district-level variables, Y_dtand D_dt. Villages cannot be treated as independent as they are clustered within districts, the first unit above villages in the administrative hierarchy, even after the government reform.

Yet, in the existing cases, reforms changing rural government models to increase the efficiency in the provision and management of infrastructural services either amalgamate smaller rural governments into larger regional agencies or transfer decision-making power from central agencies to small rural administrations. Yet, Local Administration Reform (Law No. 6360) that the Turkish government introduced in 2012 followed neither of the above-stated paths. The reform changed the rural governance system in 30 out of 81 governorates of the country by shifting the responsibility and resources for management of rural infrastructure from regional agencies specialized in rural services to metropolitan municipalities specialized in provision of services to urban areas. Villages lost their autonomous administrations and became, de jure, urban neighborhood units, even though they de facto remained rural. The governorates were assigned to the reform in a discretionary manner (based on the total population of the governorate, not population density) which means rural regions were assigned to reform or no-reform governorates in an \u201cas-if random\u201d manner. Taking the opportunity of this \u201cquasi-experiment,\u201d we will have a chance to compare regions that are affected by the reform and regions that are not affected by the reform and explore how the reform changed agricultural production and population trends. Specifically, we aim to find answers to the following questions: What happens when the villages are run by governance institutions that have been governing urban regions? Can urban institutions adjust their delivery structure and priorities fast enough to answer the needs, for example, agriculture-related demands, of rural communities? Or do they harm rural sectors by approaching governance of rural areas with an urban logic?", "q16": "Hypothesis 1: Governance of rural infrastructure provision by institutions with urban bias leads to decrease in agricultural production. Therefore, we will observe a disproportionate decrease in agricultural production in treatment group villages. Hypothesis 1a: This decrease emerges due to lack of sufficient and/or appropriate provision and management of services in villages. We expect that this causal mechanism will be more predominant for villages that are further away from the urban center of the governorate. Hypothesis 1b: This decrease emerges due to land management decisions of metropolitan municipalities, which turn agricultural lands to commercial or residential zones. We expect that this causal mechanism will be more predominant for villages that are closer to the urban center of the governorate. Hypothesis 2: Population in villages that are governed under the new system will decrease faster as opposed to the villages that are governed under the old regional governance system. This effect will occur because agricultural production in villages under the new governance will decrease disproportionately which will then lead to faster migration of the younger generations. Hypothesis 3: The electoral support for the party in government will increase more in the villages within the scope of the reform as opposed to the villages that stayed under the previous regional governance system in the first elections after the reform passed but before implemented, due to the increased expectations from the new governance system. Hypothesis 4: The electoral support for the party in government will decrease more in the villages within the scope of the reform as opposed to the villages that stayed under the previous regional governance system in the second, third and fourth elections after the reform passed, due to the negative consequences of the reform on agricultural production and village economy.", "q17": "Our analyses will draw on a difference-in-difference design. We will check the robustness of our findings by replicating our analysis with samples selected by alternative population bandwidths and selection criteria. To examine the effect of the Local Government Reform on villages\u2019 economy, out-migration, and political preferences, we employ a difference-in-differences estimator using the following specification: \u3016Y_it=\u03b1+\u3016\u03b2T\u3017_t+\u03b3D_it+\u03b8T_t D_it+\u03b4X_it+\u03d1Z_dt+\u3016\u03b5_it\u3017_^ \u3017_ In the above formula, Yit is the outcome variable in village i at time t. Tt is a dummy time variable that equals 1 for post-treatment periods and 0 for pre-treatment periods. Dit is the treatment variable that equals 1 for treatment villages and 0 for control villages. We interact Tt and Dit to produce the coefficient \u03b8, which is the average treatment effect (ATE) of the treatment on outcomes over time. Xit is a vector of control variables that are employed to minimize variance and capture minor over-time imbalances. Zdt is also a vector of control variables at the district level. In some of the designs where village-level data is not available, Y_itand D_itwill be replaced by district-level variables, Y_dtand D_dt. Villages cannot be treated as independent as they are clustered within districts, the first unit above villages in the administrative hierarchy, even after the government reform. We will therefore cluster standard errors at the district level. We will also control for the within-year correlation in the standard errors across units which will limit biases caused by the correlation of errors within a year.", "q18": "Turkey", "q19": "Approximately 12,100 villages in 335 districts.", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "", "q23": "", "q24": "", "q25": "", "q26": "Other (describe in text box below)", "q27": "This is a quasi-experimental study.

an important phenotypic quality that people use to evaluate subjects throughout their daily lives (Hochschild and Weaver 2007). Previous research has shown that the darker a person\u2019s skin tone the more punitive one is in sentencing (e.g., Dixon and Maddox 2005), the more disapproving one is of political candidates (e.g., Caruso, Mead, and Balceits 2009; Kemmelmeier and Chavez 2014), and the more associations people make to negative attributes (e.g., Uzogara, Abdou, and Jackson 2014; Smith-McLallen, Johnson, Dovidio, and Pearson 2006). Importantly, studies show that manipulating Barack Obama\u2019s skin tone directly relates to people\u2019s evaluations of his performance (Kemmelmeier and Chavez 2014). The current research project seeks to evaluate the \u201cCheeto effect.\u201d Donald Trump is a polarizing figure in the American political system, and he has often been referred to by progressives as \u201cPresident Cheeto.\u201d We seek to understand whether varying Donald Trump\u2019s skin tone similarly changes the way people evaluate his performance. Consistent with previous research, we also seek to examine whether these effects differ by one\u2019s partisanship (Caruso et al. 2009). To evaluate this question, we will perform a survey experiment. Subjects will be randomized into a treatment group or two control groups. The treatment group will be asked to evaluate the performance of Donald Trump while an altered image of the President is shown. This altered image will enhance the orange tones of Trump\u2019s skin. One control group will be asked to evaluate the performance of Donald Trump while exposed to an unaltered image of Trump, and the other control group will be asked to evaluate the President without any image at all.

Previous research has shown that the darker a person\u2019s skin tone the more punitive one is in sentencing (e.g., Dixon and Maddox 2005), the more disapproving one is of political candidates (e.g., Caruso, Mead, and Balceits 2009; Kemmelmeier and Chavez 2014), and the more associations people make to negative attributes (e.g., Uzogara, Abdou, and Jackson 2014; Smith-McLallen, Johnson, Dovidio, and Pearson 2006). Importantly, studies show that manipulating Barack Obama\u2019s skin tone directly relates to people\u2019s evaluations of his performance (Kemmelmeier and Chavez 2014). The current research project seeks to evaluate the \u201cCheeto effect.\u201d Donald Trump is a polarizing figure in the American political system, and he has often been referred to by progressives as \u201cPresident Cheeto.\u201d We seek to understand whether varying Donald Trump\u2019s skin tone similarly changes the way people evaluate his performance. Consistent with previous research, we also seek to examine whether these effects differ by one\u2019s partisanship (Caruso et al. 2009). To evaluate this question, we will perform a survey experiment. Subjects will be randomized into a treatment group or two control groups. The treatment group will be asked to evaluate the performance of Donald Trump while an altered image of the President is shown. This altered image will enhance the orange tones of Trump\u2019s skin. One control group will be asked to evaluate the performance of Donald Trump while exposed to an unaltered image of Trump, and the other control group will be asked to evaluate the President without any image at all.

Both stories based on real news reports, however we changed the names, and places. We suppose that the total treatment effect is the difference of the second treatment group and the control group; and the net effect of risk perception is the difference between the first and second treatment group. Moreover we distinguish anti-government and pro-government sympathizers. We expect that in the group of citizens with pro-government (anti-government) attitudes, information on current risks of participation in anti-government protests decreases (increases) the stated risk perception, and increases (decreases) willingness to participate in political protests. We define the two aforementioned groups using two question butteries: 1) We will dichotomize the answers with the following question: \"If you think about the period since Viktor Orban has been elected in 2010, what would you say, how satisfied are you with the achievements of the government?\" Dissatisfied scores (1 to 3) are coded as dissatisfied, anti-government attitude, and satisfied (5 to 7) are coded as satisfied, pro-government attitude. We compare these two groups (satisfied, pro-government and dissatisfied, anti-government groups) 2) Partisan identity scale items developed by Leonie Huddy and her colleagues (Huddy, Bankert and Davis: Expressive Versus Instrumental Partisanship in Multiparty European Systems 2018; Bankert, A., Huddy, L., & Rosema, M. Measuring partisanship as a social identity in multi-party systems, 2017) We use a battery of risk perception indicators comprises 4 items. Finally, we measure willingness to participate in political demonstrations with the question: Would you or would you not to protest against a government action you strongly opposed?
