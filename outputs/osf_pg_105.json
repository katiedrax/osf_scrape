how schools in New York have closed during Spring 2020, we have decided to move this project to our lab's online data collection platform, PANDA (Princeton and NYU Discoveries in Action), and have, therefore, made minor changes to the script to accommodate this change. \n\nWe recruit participants for this online platform, PANDA, in a multitude of ways, including but not limited to community outreach events, social media advertising, posts on Prolific, and volunteer sign-ups at our current data collection sites. For this particular study, we will only recruit participants with children between the ages of 9-10 years and 13-16 years. Parents of eligible children will be contacted via email through their PANDA account, and they will be offered the opportunity to log on and participate. Children and parents will then follow an IRB-approved consent and assent procedure. We will record the study session using participants\u2019 webcams. The study will be presented as short videos and verbally-narrated questions, which children will respond to by clicking on the designated \u201cbuttons\u201d to indicate their response. If children are unable to maneuver the mouse and click on the buttons themselves, parents will be encouraged to do the clicking for children (without altering their children\u2019s responses or providing feedback in any way). However, given the age range of participants for this study, we believe that most child participants will be able to indicate responses independently. At the end of the study session, parents and children will be thanked for their participation, and parents will be given the opportunity to upload their webcam video to PANDA, where only authorized PANDA researchers may access it. Parents will also be given the option to provide consent for their data and study video to be uploaded to the Databrary database. As compensation for participation, families will receive an Amazon gift card valued at $10.\n\nTo be included, families will need to have uploaded a video successfully in which parent consent and child assent can be confirmed. All videos will also be checked to make sure a visible child is participating in order to be included. Previous work on the PANDA platform has identified extremely low rates of parent or sibling interference (less than 1% of trials), and excluding such trials had no consequence for the overall pattern of findings (Leshin, Leslie, &amp; Rhodes, 2020). Therefore, we will randomly select 20% of the participant videos to be coded by a trained researcher in order to estimate the interference rate. If it is within the bounds of the interference level found in previous work, we will conclude that the interference level is negligible and highly unlikely to influence the study patterns and therefore retain all trials for analyses. However, if the interference rate in the subset of coded videos is more than the rate estimated from previous work, we will then code every video trial-by-trial for instances of parental interference (with 20% also checked by a reliability coder), and we will exclude any trials where the parent or a sibling interferes such that there is a question of whether the answer reflects the child\u2019s response. If more than 25% of a child\u2019s responses are excluded because of this reason, the participant\u2019s data will be dropped from analyses.\n\nPlease refer to the attached documents \"Rarity (Elementary) - PANDA Script.docx\" and \"Rarity_Elementary_PANDA.qsf\" for the updated script and Qualtrics survey for the elementary-age participants. Our target age range for this part of the study will still be 9-to-10-year-old children. Our target sample size is still 128 children, with 64 children (32 boys and 32 girls) in each condition. However, given that we want to ensure that the survey is available to participants for a set period of time, we will close the survey at the end of the weekend in which we reach our target sample size. Therefore, there might be a few additional participants. We will include all participants that have completed the study in our analyses. \n\nWe currently already have 51 elementary-age children's data collected from a New York public elementary school. We will aim to recruit the remaining 77 elementary-age children from PANDA. We have not downloaded, observed, or analyzed any of the collected 51 children's data. We will include the source of recruitment (school or PANDA) as an additional covariate in all of our statistical models to detect any potential response differences among the elementary school participants and PANDA participants.\n\nIn addition, we will also be running this study with 128 13-to-16-year-old adolescents. We have adapted the specific science questions and format to be age-appropriate, but the variables and analyses are identical to the study for elementary-age participants. Please refer to the attached documents \"Rarity (Adolescents) - PANDA Script.docx\" and \"Rarity_Adolescents_PANDA.qsf\" for the script and Qualtrics survey for the adolescent participants. Again, our target sample size is also 128 participants, with 64 participants (32 male and 32 female) in each condition. However, given that we want to ensure that the survey is available to participants for a set period of time, we will close the survey at the end of the weekend in which we reach our target sample size. Therefore, there might be a few additional participants. We will include all participants that have completed the study in our analyses.\n\nBecause of this change in our recruitment method, we also want to provide parents with additional information about the science questions we ask in the study, in case they want to provide further guidance and discussion for their children. Therefore, for both participant groups, we include in the survey a document for parents that includes a complete list of the science concepts, questions, answers, and explanations for all five science questions that participants might have encountered. Please refer to the documents \"Science Questions_Elementary School.pdf\" and \"Science Questions_Adolescents.pdf\" for the questions, answers, and explanations for the elementary-age participants and adolescent participants, respectively."}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Rarity (Adolescents) - PANDA Script.docx"}, "nodeId": "w8c5s", "sha256": "fd3e327951efd3d6670a54c328cb1b31169a93a0de0d44c22cc6b41c23f1d595", "viewUrl": "/project/w8c5s/files/osfstorage/5e7e38a6c3f8d3012ff9e92b", "selectedFileName": "Rarity (Adolescents) - PANDA Script.docx"}, {"data": {"name": "Science Questions_Elementary School.pdf"}, "nodeId": "w8c5s", "sha256": "2dd210aeab7f7e26b0ab6ba8184e5bb319702955e743c8f675a07cd1275abe97", "viewUrl": "/project/w8c5s/files/osfstorage/5e7e38e2c3f8d30118fa5949", "selectedFileName": "Science Questions_Elementary School.pdf"}, {"data": {"name": "Rarity_Elementary_PANDA.qsf"}, "nodeId": "w8c5s", "sha256": "d00d59d23679613fda1421cd2b1c09c5283eb82fd213f53427d84ccfa306c67e", "viewUrl": "/project/w8c5s/files/osfstorage/5e878bd8430166000ca04520", "selectedFileName": "Rarity_Elementary_PANDA.qsf"}, {"data": {"name": "Rarity_Adolescents_PANDA.qsf"}, "nodeId": "w8c5s", "sha256": "6dfe3d53ee4b1795dc630c8bdf077ba44f857c603f9050d3e7daea591458750f", "viewUrl": "/project/w8c5s/files/osfstorage/5e878be3430166000ba049f7", "selectedFileName": "Rarity_Adolescents_PANDA.qsf"}, {"data": {"name": "Rarity (Elementary) - PANDA Script.docx"}, "nodeId": "w8c5s", "sha256": "57b70d11bea1cce0239b27c6d56d0821c4b33052333ef248df984d79ae737984", "viewUrl": "/project/w8c5s/files/osfstorage/5e878c25f13535000bd53152", "selectedFileName": "Rarity (Elementary) - PANDA Script.docx"}, {"data": {"name": "Science Questions_Adolescents.pdf"}, "nodeId": "w8c5s", "sha256": "78d2a22b985530b051786b4d3c24f93b0b4a1813c3e95b14f0b68b5d13e57e02", "viewUrl": "/project/w8c5s/files/osfstorage/5e7e38d07190ce011c93e5cd", "selectedFileName": "Science Questions_Adolescents.pdf"}], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"summary": "This is to provide an update and modification to the previous preregistration.\n\nDue to how schools in New York have closed during Spring 2020, we have decided to move this project to our lab's online data collection platform, PANDA (Princeton and NYU Discoveries in Action), and have, therefore, made minor changes to the script to accommodate this change. \n\nWe recruit participants for this online platform, PANDA, in a multitude of ways, including but not limited to community outreach events, social media advertising, posts on Prolific, and volunteer sign-ups at our current data collection sites.

immigrants. Among other measures, these policies limited immigrants\u2019 access to public services, such as healthcare, and called for more stringent enforcement by local and state police in identifying and detaining undocumented immigrants. While there have been several studies about the impact of these policies on the health of immigrants and ethnic minorities, they are mainly correlational and highly contextual. In this study, we propose to examine the causal effect of state-level immigration policies on the mental health and health behavior of immigrants. We hypothesize that proposing and implementing anti-immigrant policies will worsen the mental health of immigrants and ethnic minorities. We also expect that this effect will be conditioned by the salience of the issue within a given state; the more aware people are of the anti-immigrant policies, the more likely they are to have worse mental health outcomes. To establish the causal effect of immigration policies on the mental health of immigrants and ethnic minorities, we plan to use a difference-in-differences approach. In this study, we hope to examine whether there is a causal relationship between discussing, proposing, and implementing anti-immigrant policies in states and the mental health of immigrants and ethnic minorities. We will combine data on the mental health and health behavior of individuals and their demographic information from the United States National Health Interview Survey with data we have coded on the salience of immigration issues in each state, the proposal of restrictive immigration legislation in state legislatures, and the implementation of such legislation."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Our primary outcome is on the mental health of immigrants.

For each group of outcomes, we will examine the outcomes individually as well as build an index for these outcomes. The indices will include the following: mental health (all respondents), mental health (children), other health outcomes (adults), other health outcomes (children), behavioral outcomes (adults), utilization of health facilities (adults), utilization of health facilities (children).

In other models, we also code proposed as 1 following the time the law was proposed until the end of our data (so it is not coded as 0 after it is overturned). Also, we run other models replacing Proposed with each of the following: signed and implemented. Treated indicates whether the individual is belongs to a treated group (such as an ethnic minority). Salience indicates whether immigration is a highly salient issue, based on the newspaper reports that we coded.

In this study, we hope to examine whether there is a causal relationship between discussing, proposing, and implementing anti-immigrant policies in states and the mental health of immigrants and ethnic minorities.

paranoia and referential thinking", "description": "Patients with schizophrenia show impaired episodic and recognition memory (Aleman et al., 1999), but the mechanisms by which such impairments may participate in the formation or maintenance of psychotic symptoms such as delusions remain unclear. The ability to detect novel stimuli relies on one\u2019s capacity to hold and contrast items and events in memory. Detecting novelty in one\u2019s environment is a key process in flexible learning and belief updating; decreased sensitivity to novel information may interfere with one\u2019s ability to form new associations. Past research has shown abnormalities in novelty detection among individuals with schizophrenia (Schott et al., 2015; Weiss et al., 2004; Weiss et al., 2008) and, more specifically, susceptibility to and/or overconfidence in \u201cfalse memories\u201d (i.e., a false positive on a memory task, often using lures that are semantically related to targets as in a Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm; Evans et al., 2019; Bhat et al., 2010; Moritz et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2007). However, neither the processes that support these aberrancies nor the broader implications for delusional belief have been fully explored. To this end, the present study aims to investigate how delusion-prone individuals experience novel stimuli and how the detection of novelty may be impaired due to over-reliance on non-contextually-specific familiarity cues.\n\nIn the absence of clear episodic recollections, low-level \u201cfluency\u201d heuristics may guide memory judgements. Past research has probed this phenomenon via \u201cRemember-Know\u201d paradigms, which have provided evidence that individuals with schizophrenia are particularly reliant on familiarity assessments as a basis for retrieval (e.g., Achim &amp; Lepage, 2005; Erp et al., 2008; Libby et al., 2013). Over-reliance on familiarity-based heuristics makes it difficult to tag particular instances of a stimulus to a particular learning context and could thereby contribute to undue salience of stimuli incidental to the current context \u2013 a phenomenon thought to participate in delusions such as paranoia and referential thinking (Kapur, 2003), possibly through its contribution to the precision of prediction errors (Diaconescu et al., 2019; Fletcher &amp; Frith, 2009). Furthermore, cognitive models of delusional belief put forward a bias towards \u201cliberal acceptance\u201d as a key contributor to the formation of fixed false belief, drawing from evidence that delusional individuals tend to employ liberal decision thresholds, collecting less evidence before arriving at a highly confident conclusion (Moritz et al., 2008). In the context of a recognition memory paradigm, task-irrelevant familiarity information may thus be sufficient to surmount delusional individuals\u2019 already-liberal \u201cold/new\u201d decision thresholds (also supported by Erp et al., 2008), manifesting in an impaired ability to detect stimuli that are contextually, but not absolutely, novel. If individuals high in delusionality are reliant on such fluency cues in recognition memory, one would expect memory performance to be impaired for familiar stimuli but relatively more intact for stimuli to which they have had no prior exposure. In other words, delusional or delusion-prone individuals would be predicted to show a greater propensity to report false alarms (i.e., mistaking a \u201cnew\u201d stimulus for an \u201cold\u201d stimulus) in the context of stimuli that are encountered with high frequency (i.e., multiple contexts) in everyday life relative to stimuli to that are unfamiliar. In conjunction with delusional individuals\u2019 tendency to report high confidence in errors (see Balzan et al., 2016 for a recent review), such an effect may manifest as overconfident failures in novelty detection that are particularly pronounced among familiar stimuli.\n\nTo explore these predictions, the present study seeks to determine whether over-reliance on fluency-based mechanisms during retrieval is associated with higher levels of delusion-proneness in the general population by testing whether the relationship between delusionality and memory deficits is more pronounced in the context of familiar stimuli (i.e., real words) relative to unfamiliar stimuli (i.e., pseudo words). More specifically, this study seeks to replicate and extend preliminary findings that point to an association between paranoia and deficits in novelty detection specifically in the context of familiar stimuli by a) replicating findings in a larger sample and b) testing this effect in individuals who endorse ideas of reference as well as paranoia. Characterizing this phenomenon may help to answer broader questions regarding the circumstances under which new information \u2013 which, in the real world, can come in the form of novel evidence that disconfirms strongly held beliefs \u2013 may fail to be detected by delusional individuals and how this may relate to experiences of aberrant salience.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-03T17:21:24.522615", "date_modified": "2020-04-03T16:44:11.668361", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["Delusion", "Ideas of reference", "Novelty detection", "Paranoia", "Recognition memory"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "06b43f463a5cdae6fc6df045e0c5c1c38834c8bc7bdc92fb0fd963cba92792d37819f492083048b64068d55433f4d35acdce87c4b8ced652d7cf37bfb5fda7bb0d5b3b3b6ef49a5db51a9a8815185e1da1fe2861879860ee9ecaf180a60f78a329fdb0a8c75d77488a7d07c9df90849cdf550df96caa08919a15917d0675166341bd6e0308274351f4a97eb5f0e710ac", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-03T17:21:24.502225", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "William Nichols Koller"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "1.\tResponse Type: High-delusionality individuals will make a greater proportion of false alarms relative to low-delusionality individuals on real-word trials relative to pseudo-word trials.\n2.\tConfidence: High-delusionality individuals will report higher confidence on errors (i.e., false alarms and misses) than low-delusionality individuals on both real- and pseudo-word trials.\n3.\tMeta-d\u2019: High-delusionality individuals will show lower meta-d\u2019 (a measure of the extent to which one\u2019s confidence ratings are predictive of one\u2019s actual success) relative to low-delusionality individuals on real-word trials relative to pseudo-word trials."}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.
