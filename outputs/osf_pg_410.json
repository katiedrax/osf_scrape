In economics the use of field experiments have contributed to solving the problem of causal inference when other methods have failed to give a reliable measure of discrimination. The method has been successful in detecting ethnic and racial discrimination in different markets. However, there has been little investigation into the underlying mechanisms through which discrimination occur (Riach and Rich, 2002: 481; Bertrand and Duflo, 2016: 7\u20138). At the same time studies investigating discrimination done by public administrators has been sparse (Grohs et al., 2016; Butler and Broockman, 2011). There are no such studies in Denmark as far as the author is aware. The debate on ethnic discrimination in the school system has recently gained attention in Danish media. The most notable example is the case of Langk\u00e6r Gymnasium (upper secondary school) where the administration decided to divide students into classes according to their ethnic origin. This caused a lot of uproar and the school was accused of discriminatory behaviour (Tv2, 2016; Politiken, 2016). With this masters thesis I incorporate theories from social psychology and investigate ethnic discrimination on access to public and private primary schools in Denmark. Experience from psychology suggests that minimal conditions for group thinking are sufficient for out-group discrimination. In the ethnocentric view, a positive identification with ones own group often makes evaluation of out-groups negative and can lead to discrimination by simple group identification (Turner et al., 1979: 187\u2013191; Kam and Kinder, 2012: 335). Whereas theories like statistical discrimination and taste-based discrimination suggest that discrimination is a result of outcome rationality, theories in psychology suggest a more none-conscious act of discrimination \u2013 often called implicit bias (Bertrand and Duflo, 2016: 6\u20138). Statistical discrimination suggests that discrimination is a function of incomplete information about the subject. This leads to group-estimates that guide the decision maker when there is no other information available (Guryan and Charles, 2013: 418; Pager and Shepherd, 2008: 193). Taste-based discrimination suggests that discrimination is a function of xenophobic attitudes against members of a group (i.e. ethnic group). This xenophobic attitude is often seen as a predisposition, and so taste-based discrimination lags an explanation of the origin of xenophobic attitudes. However recent literature in political behaviour has shown that attitudes against immigrants often arise as a function of context, i.e. contact with and casual observation of immigrants (Hjorth, 2016; Dinesen and S\u00f8nderskov, 2015; Enos, 2014). The two contesting theories in this area are conflict theory and contact theory, which roughly predict opposite effects of inter-group contact. I test the different hypothesis derived from theory in a correspondence test, where information about pupil\u2019s skills and perceived ethnic origin (Middle Eastern and Danish) is manipulated in an e-mail sent to primary school administrations. The e-mail contains a brief message asking for relocation of the child to the contacted school and where information about the school can be found. A series of background data are merged onto the experimental data for further hypothesis testing beyond the manipulated variables. The experiment uses deception in the sense that the e-mail contains a false identity. Due to the use of deception the study faces an ethical problematic. Therefore, the field experiment is designed carefully by weighing the costs and benefits of conducting the experiment. The principles guiding the design follows Riach and Rich (2004) where they discuss and outline what one should consider in a design to justify the use of deception (Riach and Rich, 2004)."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypothesis and testing: H1: Primary schools on average discriminate against parents/children with Middle Eastern ethnicity in the e-mail correspondence between parents and the school.

The design of the field experiment follows a 2x2 treatment where the first manipulated variable is perceived ethnicity, signalled through the use of ethnic names. The recent refugee crisis in Europe has focused attention especially on the situation in Syria. However for more than a decade, migration in Denmark has mainly been from Middle Eastern countries (reference) and so salience in the debate about immigrants is likely skewed towards people from this area of the world. This is arguably a salient issue among many Danes and has most likely been a factor in changing the political landscape and support for the Danish Peoples Party (right wing nationalist party). Therefore the design uses Middle Eastern names to signal ethnic origin other than Danish. This means that discrimination is a measure of the differential treatment between the group of names of Danish ethnic origin and names of Middle Eastern origin. The second manipulated variable is a measure of the pupil\u2019s skills as perceived by the primary school they are moving from. This treatment is signalled through a short text where the parent contacting explains that the child is doing well in tests according to the teachers at the current school. The text is followed by an explanation of why the parent wants to move the child anyway. The control for this variable is a simple exclusion of any information of the child\u2019s skills. Discrimination is measured as a differential treatment. This includes content analysed e-mail reply from the primary schools and the reply time. The content analysed variables will be inspired by Grohs et al. (2016) and are as follows: Completeness: The informational content. Are the two questions requested in the e-mail answered or not? NOTE: The full codebook and numeric scores have not yet been established. Service orientation: Includes the thoroughness and degree of friendly tone in the response. Further provided information beyond the requested content. NOTE: The full codebook and numeric scores have not yet been established. For further information see Grohs et al. (2016). Additionally the name of the replier is coded into ethnic origin where Danish origin and Middle Eastern origin are the two main categories used. This is used to operationalize the intra/inter-group variable assuming that the name can be used as a proxy for ethnicity. Testing of hypothesis: H1: is tested by comparing average outcome scores for e-mails sent from Middle Eastern names and Danish names. H2: is tested by comparing average outcomes of intra-group e-mail correspondences with intergroup correspondences. The group relations are operationalized as match of group between parent ethnicity and school administrator\u2019s ethnicity, specifically the person replying. H3: is tested using a proxy for xenophobic tendencies in the geographic area of the school location. This proxy is assumed to measure the likelihood of the school staff or boards having xenophobic tendencies. For similar use of proxy see (Hainmueller and Hangartner, 2013). The variable is interacted with ethnicity to see whether areas with higher xenophobic tendencies have a higher degree of discrimination. H4: is tested experimentally by manipulating the content of the email in the correspondence (se previous description). Ethnicity and information about the child\u2019s skills are interacted to see whether the effect of ethnicity is lower among children with good skills compared to children without information about skills. H5: is tested using a lagged pre-treatment variable on growth in enrolment share of other ethnic background than Danish into the school. The variable is interacted with ethnicity to see whether the effect of ethnicity is higher among schools having experienced relatively high growth compared to low growth. H6: is tested using a proxy variable measuring the probability of personal contact with pupils of other ethnic background than Danish. Since the e-mail is directed at the administration of the school it is likely that they will not have the same rate of contact with the pupils as the teachers of the school. However assuming a constant rate of personal contact across schools the probability can be measured in terms of ethnic diversity, as the total share of other ethnic background than Danish.
