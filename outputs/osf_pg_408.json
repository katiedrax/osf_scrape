This study will first test how powerful national flags are in affecting survey respondents' self-reported identity, national pride/patriotism, and sense of whether their country's national identity is best thought of as civic based or ethnic based. Two treatment effects will be used -- one which tests overt national symbols (via a direct picture of the national flag) and one which tests the effects of less obvious exposure (with the flag in the background of an ordinary street scene). These will be compared to a control group that sees the same street scene with no flags. Using a commercial survey firm, I will first conduct the survey among a nationally representative online sample in the United States of approximately 1000 people, and then will test a translated version of the survey in China and/or Taiwan in the second round.", "q16": "I hypothesize that respondents who view overt national imagery (Treatment A, with flags) will report their national identity is more salient and powerful than respondents who view covert national imagery (Treatment B), who will in turn report more salient national identity than the control group. Similarly, I hypothesize that respondents primed with Treatment A will report a stronger sense of ethnic, rather than civic, identity than those primed with Treatment B and the control group. Finally, I hypothesize that respondents in the American South (and eventually South China as well) will report stronger regional or state identity than respondents in other parts of the country, holding other factors constant.", "q17": "Respondents will be divided into three groups -- Treatment A, Treatment B, and Control -- before answering four survey questions and four demographic control questions. Treatment A will be an overt national flag, Treatment B will be an ordinary street scene with a small background flag, and the Control group will receive the same street scene but with no flag. After priming with these treatments, respondents will take a simple four question survey that asks about their level of pride in their national identity and whether they think their country is based on a more inclusive, civic-based nationality or a more exclusive, ethic-based nationality.", "q18": "United States of America, China, Taiwan", "q19": "Approximately 1000 (in each country)", "q20":

found a robust correlation between Protestantism and democratization (e.g., Tusalem, 2009). One prominent explanation for this link are Protestant missionaries. They are argued to foster democratization by spurring, i.a., religious liberties, education, and voluntarism (Woodberry, 2012). Most existing empirical accounts are based on historic data adopting cross-country designs. Yet, we lack contemporary evidence how Protestant missionaries affect democratization at the local level. Such fine-grained evidence would offer a unique way to corroborate the hypothesized causal relationship and to explore potential mechanisms. The present research project seeks to fill this gap. Focusing on South Sudan, I explore to what degree local Protestant missionaries affect democratization in the villages of Eastern Equatoria. Based on Robert Dahl\u2019s seminal work (1989), I stipulate that democratic governance relies on three crucial ingredients: popular sovereignty, political equality, and majority rule (Krouse, 1982, 442).

One prominent explanation for this link are Protestant missionaries. They are argued to foster democratization by spurring, i.a., religious liberties, education, and voluntarism (Woodberry, 2012). Most existing empirical accounts are based on historic data adopting cross-country designs. Yet, we lack contemporary evidence how Protestant missionaries affect democratization at the local level. Such fine-grained evidence would offer a unique way to corroborate the hypothesized causal relationship and to explore potential mechanisms. The present research project seeks to fill this gap.
