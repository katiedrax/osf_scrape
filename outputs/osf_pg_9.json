Personality and Situational Factors on the Maintenance of Habitual Behaviors", "description": "The COVID-19 outbreak and associated policies meant to reduce the spread of the virus have imposed many changes to the lives of people living in the United States. On top of working or attending classes from home, many families are now dealing with uncertain job prospects or limited income, reduced work or school hours, limited or unavailable childcare during the day, and limited access to food or healthcare items. At the same time, when living in cities where lockdown or stay-at-home orders are in place, many people have unlimited access to food, smoking, drinking, television and mobile devices. This suggests that the conditions imposed by the outbreak are affecting many health-promoting and health-damaging behaviors, including eating, sleep, substance use, and screen time. Our goal is to uncover (1) what types of lifestyle challenges people have been facing during their adaptation to the COVID-19 outbreak, and (2) the extent to which personality (e.g., self-control) and situational factors (i.e., local policies and lock down orders) predict the development of new habits, and changes in health behaviors, such as smoking, drinking, using social media, exercising, sleeping, and eating healthily.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-21T16:45:33.219984", "date_modified": "2020-04-21T16:28:13.385151", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["habits", "self-control", "self-regulation"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Andrade", "Hoyle"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "6524ef82f457d25ad82bd69bd9666268198b37bab9f5a811a9d281f049b5b9f535444e937722ce87fb6d42653bd4d7d0deb3650073739579451ba11cbe1da1e5d11dafc8a2c0c8f38ba1907f17f3c82228807aa2bf2ec9bb61ba259b463edf624fea181600773cda5a4a257014241121f8d09c0a2204e70871c64bf65d9849f00f4274305c54deb2cc7d92b1881223cf", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-21T16:45:33.191431", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Fernanda Chardulo Dias De Andrade, Hoyle Lab"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "As policies aimed at containing the spread of the coronavirus have been put in place, contextual factors have changed and people are being faced with unusual circumstances that have eliminated their usual cues, requiring the exercise of self-control to maintain their usual behaviors.

We will restrict our search to papers published in English. \n\nCondition being studied: Infectious diseases.\n\nTarget population: 1) Healthy children and adults treated with spinal manipulation or mobilization to prevent the development of infectious diseases. 2) Children and adults with infectious diseases treated with spinal manipulation or mobilization.\n\nInterventions: Spinal manipulation includes techniques incorporating a high-velocity, low amplitude impulse or thrust applied at or near the end of a joint\u2019s passive range of motion.1 Spinal mobilization includes techniques incorporating a low-velocity and varying amplitude oscillatory movement within a joint\u2019s passive range of motion.1,2 Spinal manipulation and mobilization involve manual and mechanically-assisted procedures.3\n\nComparators/controls: Placebo, sham manual therapies, wait listing, usual care, no interventions, medication and other therapies.\n\nTypes of study to be included:  We will include cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the prevention and/or management of infection or infectious disease, or changes in the level or concentration of immunological biomarkers, in children and adults (both healthy and symptomatic) who received spinal manipulation or mobilization. \n\nTypes of study not considered: We will exclude case reports, case series, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, qualitative studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, guidelines, guideline statements, letters, editorials, commentaries, unpublished manuscripts, dissertations, government reports, books and book chapters, conference proceedings, meeting abstracts, study protocols, lectures and addresses, consensus development statements, cadaveric, and laboratory or animal studies.\n\nOutcomes: We will investigate both clinical outcomes and immunological biomarkers. Clinical outcomes include: incidence of infection or infectious disease, or changes in disease-specific outcomes. An immunological biomarker is a \u201ccharacteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention.\u201d4 For this review, we are interested in the following immunological biomarkers: interleukins (IL-1\u03b2, IL- 2, IL- 6, IL- 10, interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL 1RA), tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1), interferon (IFN\u03b3),  chemotactic cytokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4); other indicators of inflammatory response (e.g. soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors 1 and 2  (sTNFR)), neuropeptides  (e.g. substance P), C-reactive protein, and immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgE).\n\nStudy selection: A trained investigator will conduct all of the screening for eligible articles using standardized pilot-test forms with detailed instructions. Prior to title and abstract screening, we will validate the quality of screening. Ten percent of all eligible articles will be randomly selected and the titles and abstracts of these articles will be screened independently by a second experienced investigator. A 95% level of agreement is required between two reviewers before moving to full screening of titles and abstracts. Disagreements between the two reviewers will be resolved by reaching consensus through discussion or by a third reviewer if needed. Once the 95% agreement is achieved, one reviewer will complete screening of titles and abstracts and full texts. \n\nRisk of bias assessment: One reviewer will independently assess risk of bias of included studies using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria for RCTs and cohort studies.5,6 \n\nWe will include a quality control step in the critical appraisal of studies. The reviewer who assesses the risk of bias of the studies will present a summary of the critically appraised papers to experienced methodologists who will validate the outcome of the appraisals. Studies will be rated as high quality, acceptable, low quality or unacceptable.  We will restrict our synthesis to studies that were judged to be of high and acceptable quality. \n\nData extraction: On reviewer will extract data from low risk of bias studies to build evidence stables stratified by research objective. Data extraction will be validated by one of three reviewers. We will collect information regarding study characteristics, (i.e. author name, year of publication, study design, sample size, length of follow up), participant characteristics (i.e., age, indications for treatment or condition treated, and location), intervention characteristics (i.e., description of interventions and comparison groups), and outcome data (i.e., incidence of infection or infectious disease, disease-specific outcomes, changes in immunological biomarkers).\n\nEvidence Synthesis and Statistical Analysis: We will synthesize the evidence of low risk of bias studies according to the Synthesis without Meta-Analysis (SWiM) Guideline.7 When data are available, we will compute the incidence (and 95% confidence intervals (CI)) of infection or infectious disease from RCTs and cohort studies. Incidence will be measured by calculating the number of new cases of infection or infectious disease in a group divided by the total number of participants in the same group.8 Confidence intervals will be calculated using incidence of infection or infectious disease in each group, total number of participants in each group, and \u03b1 = 0.05.\n\nDissemination plan: The College of Chiropractors of British Columbia will use this review to inform regulatory policy decisions regarding the use of spinal manipulation and mobilization to impact immune function.  The results of the rapid review will be published in the peer-reviewed literature.\n\nKeywords: Spinal manipulation, spinal mobilization, immunity, infectious disease \n\nReferences\n\n1.\tRubinstein SM, Terwee CB, Assendelft WJ, et al.

Information Retrieval (Perolehan Informasi) merupakan suatu pencarian informasi(biasanya berupa dokumen) yang didasarkan pada suatu query (inputan user) yang diharapkan dapat memenuhi keinginan user dari dokumen yang ada. Dua aspek penting dalam konsep Information Retrieval yang diterapkan dalam sebuah perancangan mesin pencari yaitu repesentasi dari informasi dan pengukuran yang akan mengukur nilai kesamaan antara dua obyek. Informasi yang dapat direpresentasikan menjadi sebuah obyek yang direpresentasikan dalam berbagai bentuk dan model (heterogeneous). Keadaan ini mengakibatkan bahwa pencarian untuk suatu obyek informasi yang diinginkan akan dapat dipetakan kepada beberapa obyek informati yang dinilai relevan. Relevansi dua informasi di-ukur dari keberadaan kata kunci (keyword) dan bobotnya. Konsekuensi logis atas keadaan ini adalah bahwa dalam melakukan pencarian obyek yang diinginkan, ditemukan terdapat ketidakpastian (uncertainly) terhadap penggunaan keyword pada query oleh pengguna dengan keberadaan keyword pada dokumen. Pada penelitian ini akan difokuskan pada studi efektifitas vektor model dengan menggunakan algoritma steming poter untuk membentuk kata-kata menjadi sebuah kata baku  \nserta pembobotan frekuwensi term untuk menentukan tingkat kepentingan setiap indeks term dalam sebuah dokumen dan fungsi kesamaan cosine dalam mengukur kemiripan queri dengan dokumen. Hasil pengujian nilai kualitas rata-rata precesion dan recall bahwa untuk semua bentuk query pencarian dokumen  mempunyai nilai precesion 100% artinya baik pencarian berdasarkan bentuk query isi, judul dan dokumen mempunyai precesion yang baik sedangkan hasil pengujian recall menunjukkan hasil yang berbeda, dimana pencarian berdasarkan bentuk queri isi dokumen menempati recall tertinggi sebesar 90%, sedangkan pencarian berdasarkan bentuk queri judul dokumen dengan nilai recall 70% dan pencarian berdasarkan bentuk query dokumen menempati posisi terendah dengan recall 33%.",

Additionally, if both main and subgroup-analysis will be presented in meta-analysis paper, we will select both. Notably, we will select a meta-analysis paper including the largest number of RCTs if more than one article reported same outcome of interest in the same population, intervention, and control.\nFor re-analysis of summary effect size for each psychological health outcome, we will further extract useful data from individual RCTs of each association, including geographic location of the study, type of metric (standardized mean difference, mean difference, Cohen\u2019s d, and/or Hedge\u2019s g) and its specific value along with the corresponding confidence interval, and the number of cases/participant, as well as the mean age of participants, whether the outcome was assessed at endpoint or at follow-up. For each individual RCT, we will also assign the mindfulness intervention either to \u201cwarp\u201d or \u201cweft\u201d group, as recently proposed.\n\nFor each meta-analysis, we will estimate the summary effect size and its 95% CI through random-effects models. We will also estimate the prediction interval and its 95% CI, which further accounts for between-study effects, and estimates the certainty of the association if a new study addresses that same association. For the largest dataset of each meta-analysis, we will calculate the SE of the effect size. If the SE is less than 0.1 then the 95% CI would be lower than 0.20 (which is less than the magnitude of a small effect size). We will calculate between-study heterogeneity using the I-squared metric, with I-Squared of 50% and 75% that represents high and very high heterogeneity, respectively.  \n\nFinally, we applied the Ioannidis\u2019 excess of significance test. In brief, this test evaluates whether the number of studies with nominally significant results (i.e. with p&lt;0.05) among those included in a meta-analysis is too large based on the power that these data sets have to detect effects at \u03b1=0.05. The power estimate for each data set was calculated. The sum of the power estimates of each study provides the expected (E) number of data sets with nominal statistical significance.

Additionally, if both main and subgroup-analysis will be presented in meta-analysis paper, we will select both. Notably, we will select a meta-analysis paper including the largest number of RCTs if more than one article reported same outcome of interest in the same population, intervention, and control.\nFor re-analysis of summary effect size for each psychological health outcome, we will further extract useful data from individual RCTs of each association, including geographic location of the study, type of metric (standardized mean difference, mean difference, Cohen\u2019s d, and/or Hedge\u2019s g) and its specific value along with the corresponding confidence interval, and the number of cases/participant, as well as the mean age of participants, whether the outcome was assessed at endpoint or at follow-up. For each individual RCT, we will also assign the mindfulness intervention either to \u201cwarp\u201d or \u201cweft\u201d group, as recently proposed.\n\nFor each meta-analysis, we will estimate the summary effect size and its 95% CI through random-effects models. We will also estimate the prediction interval and its 95% CI, which further accounts for between-study effects, and estimates the certainty of the association if a new study addresses that same association. For the largest dataset of each meta-analysis, we will calculate the SE of the effect size. If the SE is less than 0.1 then the 95% CI would be lower than 0.20 (which is less than the magnitude of a small effect size). We will calculate between-study heterogeneity using the I-squared metric, with I-Squared of 50% and 75% that represents high and very high heterogeneity, respectively.  \n\nFinally, we applied the Ioannidis\u2019 excess of significance test. In brief, this test evaluates whether the number of studies with nominally significant results (i.e. with p&lt;0.05) among those included in a meta-analysis is too large based on the power that these data sets have to detect effects at \u03b1=0.05.

Anti-knife crime campaigns frequently highlight the risks associated with such behaviour, specifically that people are more likely to be seriously injured or killed themselves if they carry a knife.\n\nIn line with Terror Management Theory, mortality salience research has indicated that if one\u2019s mortality is made salient, one is more likely to engage in behaviours to protect oneself and preserve self-esteem. Highlighting the possibility of death due to carrying a knife may actually accentuate positive views around knife carrying as individuals feel the need to protect themselves. Yet, these views may be negated when mortality salience is primed with responsibility. Encouraging individuals to think about the effects of knife carrying on others (primed responsibility), rather than the effect on themselves, may reverse the effects of mortality salience. If primed responsibility leads to less positive views about carrying a knife, police and anti-knife carrying organisations may be able to design more successful communication strategies, which has implications for policy makers.\n\nThis study is being run during unprecedented times, when the country is amid the covid-19 crisis, making mortality more salient than usual for some.
