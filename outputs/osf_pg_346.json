In spite of these strong opinions there is widespread public ignorance about courts and the fundamental role that courts in in the rule of law (e.g. Van de Walle 2009; Hough and Park 2001). The obvious way to end ignorance is to provide people with more information to increase knowledge and eventually legitimacy. There is correlational evidence that more knowledge about courts coincides with confidence in courts at the state level (Benesh 2006) and the Supreme Court (Gibson and Caldeira 1998). This has led researchers to the conclude that \u2018to know the Court is to love it\u2019. But does increased knowledge about the justice system actually cause more support for the judiciary? And what kind of knowledge? The number of rigorous experiments to investigate these questions has been limited. Furthermore, older experiments have shown that deliberative polling (Roberts and Stalans 2000), or booklets (Mirrlees-Black, 2002) slightly improve attitudes towards criminal courts. However, these experiments are based on self-selected participants and not on random, representative, sample from the population. This limits the external validity of the these experiments. In this paper we address this dearth in the literature as follows. First, we use a survey-based experiment in a randomly drawn, representative, sample from the population of the Netherlands. Second, we use a longitudinal experimental design with measures of objective knowledge and perceived legitimacy at three moments in time. This allows us to probe long term effects, so not only the effect right after the experiment. Furthermore, we can obtain a longitudinal dataset by fielding a survey at three points in time: we use a pre-test survey (T1) to measure of legitimacy and knowledge three months prior to the experimental treatment. This way we employ a within-subject design while limiting the risk of test-effects. At T2 a survey experiment is conducted and subsequently knowledge and legitimacy are measured.

In spite of these strong opinions there is widespread public ignorance about courts and the fundamental role that courts in in the rule of law (e.g. Van de Walle 2009; Hough and Park 2001). The obvious way to end ignorance is to provide people with more information to increase knowledge and eventually legitimacy. There is correlational evidence that more knowledge about courts coincides with confidence in courts at the state level (Benesh 2006) and the Supreme Court (Gibson and Caldeira 1998). This has led researchers to the conclude that \u2018to know the Court is to love it\u2019. But does increased knowledge about the justice system actually cause more support for the judiciary? And what kind of knowledge? The number of rigorous experiments to investigate these questions has been limited. Furthermore, older experiments have shown that deliberative polling (Roberts and Stalans 2000), or booklets (Mirrlees-Black, 2002) slightly improve attitudes towards criminal courts. However, these experiments are based on self-selected participants and not on random, representative, sample from the population. This limits the external validity of the these experiments. In this paper we address this dearth in the literature as follows. First, we use a survey-based experiment in a randomly drawn, representative, sample from the population of the Netherlands. Second, we use a longitudinal experimental design with measures of objective knowledge and perceived legitimacy at three moments in time. This allows us to probe long term effects, so not only the effect right after the experiment. Furthermore, we can obtain a longitudinal dataset by fielding a survey at three points in time: we use a pre-test survey (T1) to measure of legitimacy and knowledge three months prior to the experimental treatment. This way we employ a within-subject design while limiting the risk of test-effects. At T2 a survey experiment is conducted and subsequently knowledge and legitimacy are measured. A post-test survey (T3) one month after the experiment will be used to establish if the potential effect is durable.", "q16": "H1) Providing information about the justice system leads to higher levels of objective knowledge about the justice system.

We want to extend this research tradition with a study set in a post-communist Central and Eastern European context of the Czech Republic where there is a fragmented party system, low levels of party identification, and volatile voting behavior. Apart from political parties, we also test the role of immigration attitudes on affective polarization, another a potentially divisive and polarizing factors identified in a previous experimental study (http://egap.org/registration/5779). The proposed study intends to test the effects of partisanship and issue position on social trust in a modified trust game (Westwood et al. 2018). Our approach innovates the game design, enabling trust game in a multipartism without limiting the number of parties included in the experiment to the major parties in the system. Such practice has been usual in previous research which applied trust game as a measure of partisan trust in multiparitsms (Carlin and Love 2018; Martini and Torcal 2019; Westwood et al. 2018).This way, we can capture the complex nature of party based polarization in a fragmented multiparty system."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "If partisanship works as a socially polarizing factor with the potential of reducing social trust, then we assume that: H1a. Player 2 being a supporter of the same party as Player 1 increases the amount of money allocated to Player 2 by Player 1 in a trust game, all else equal. H1b. Player 2 being a supporter of the Player 1\u00b4s least preferred party decreases the amount of money allocated to Player 2 by Player 1 in a trust game, all else equal. H1c. Player 2 being a supporter of any other party (apart from Player 1\u00b4s most and least preferred party) changes the amount of money allocated to Player 2 by Player 1 in a trust game depending on the level of sympathy Player 1 feels towards Player 2\u00b4s preferred party, all else equal. If attitudes towards immigration work as a polarizing force with the potential to reduce social trust across citizens with opposing attitudes: H2a. Player 2 having the same attitude on immigration as Player 1 increases the amount of money allocated to Player 2 by Player 1 in a trust game, all else equal. H2b. Player 2 having the opposite attitude towards immigration than Player 1 decreases the amount of money allocated to Player 2 by Player 1 in a trust game, all else equal. Social identity theory (Tajfel and Turner 1979) suggests that ingroup favoritism and outgroup aversion may originate from a mere division of individuals into groups. If the above mentioned effects are at work due to the nature of partisan bias or bias against opposing immigration attitudes then the effects should be larger than effects of membership in a random non-political group. Therefore we expect that H3a.

H3b.

In the trust game, all subjects will be assigned the role of Player 1. They will be given a 100 CZK endowment and asked about how much money they would allocate to a randomly chosen Player 2. Subjects will play repeated trust game, each round will be played with a different (fictious) Player 2. Subjects will have one piece of information about each Player 2. Fitst two rounds will not be experimental per se. In the first round subject will allocate money to a completely anonymous Player 2. The next eight rounds will be experimental. Subjects will decide about the amount of money to be sent to Players 2 characterized by information: - Party preference (subject\u00b4s most preferred party, subject\u00b4s least preferred party, or any other randomly generated party) - Attitude towards immigration (pro-immigration attitude, neutral attitude, ani-immigration attitude) - Membership in one of two artificially created groups of respondents based on colors, all (blue group or green group) The hypotheses will be analyzed in regression models enabling clustered standard errors.

The experiment builds on the game-based experimental research on affective polarization set in the context of Western Europe, Latin America and the USA (Carlin and Love 2018; Iyengar and Westwood 2015; Martini and Torcal 2019; Westwood et al. 2018). We want to extend this research tradition with a study set in a post-communist Central and Eastern European context of the Czech Republic where there is a fragmented party system, low levels of party identification, and volatile voting behavior. Apart from political parties, we also test the role of immigration attitudes on affective polarization, another a potentially divisive and polarizing factors identified in a previous experimental study (http://egap.org/registration/5779). The proposed study intends to test the effects of partisanship and issue position on social trust in a modified trust game (Westwood et al. 2018). Our approach innovates the game design, enabling trust game in a multipartism without limiting the number of parties included in the experiment to the major parties in the system. Such practice has been usual in previous research which applied trust game as a measure of partisan trust in multiparitsms (Carlin and Love 2018; Martini and Torcal 2019; Westwood et al. 2018).This way, we can capture the complex nature of party based polarization in a fragmented multiparty system.", "q16": "If partisanship works as a socially polarizing factor with the potential of reducing social trust, then we assume that: H1a. Player 2 being a supporter of the same party as Player 1 increases the amount of money allocated to Player 2 by Player 1 in a trust game, all else equal. H1b. Player 2 being a supporter of the Player 1\u00b4s least preferred party decreases the amount of money allocated to Player 2 by Player 1 in a trust game, all else equal. H1c. Player 2 being a supporter of any other party (apart from Player 1\u00b4s most and least preferred party) changes the amount of money allocated to Player 2 by Player 1 in a trust game depending on the level of sympathy Player 1 feels towards Player 2\u00b4s preferred party, all else equal. If attitudes towards immigration work as a polarizing force with the potential to reduce social trust across citizens with opposing attitudes: H2a. Player 2 having the same attitude on immigration as Player 1 increases the amount of money allocated to Player 2 by Player 1 in a trust game, all else equal. H2b. Player 2 having the opposite attitude towards immigration than Player 1 decreases the amount of money allocated to Player 2 by Player 1 in a trust game, all else equal. Social identity theory (Tajfel and Turner 1979) suggests that ingroup favoritism and outgroup aversion may originate from a mere division of individuals into groups. If the above mentioned effects are at work due to the nature of partisan bias or bias against opposing immigration attitudes then the effects should be larger than effects of membership in a random non-political group. Therefore we expect that H3a. Player 2 being a member of a same random nonpolitical group as Player 1 will not have effect on the amount of money allocated to Player2 by Player 1 in a trust game compared to congruence in party preference or congruence in attitude towards immigration. H3b. Player 2 being a member of a different random nonpolitical group as Player 1 will not have effect on the amount of money allocated to Player 2 by Player one in a trust game compared to Payer 2\u00b4s preference of Player 1\u00b4s least preferred political party or having opposing attitude towards immigration then Player 1.", "q17": "The study is based on an experimental survey implementing a multiple round of modified trust game (as in Iyengar and Westwood 2015; Westwood et al. 2018). The study will be conducted on a nonprobability sample representative on age, gender, education, type of settlement, and region. The data will be collected by a research company (Focus). In the trust game, all subjects will be assigned the role of Player 1. They will be given a 100 CZK endowment and asked about how much money they would allocate to a randomly chosen Player 2. Subjects will play repeated trust game, each round will be played with a different (fictious) Player 2. Subjects will have one piece of information about each Player 2. Fitst two rounds will not be experimental per se. In the first round subject will allocate money to a completely anonymous Player 2. The next eight rounds will be experimental. Subjects will decide about the amount of money to be sent to Players 2 characterized by information: - Party preference (subject\u00b4s most preferred party, subject\u00b4s least preferred party, or any other randomly generated party) - Attitude towards immigration (pro-immigration attitude, neutral attitude, ani-immigration attitude) - Membership in one of two artificially created groups of respondents based on colors, all (blue group or green group) The hypotheses will be analyzed in regression models enabling clustered standard errors.

demands on leaders. There are many reasons to expect citizens\u2019 ownership over government revenues to vary even conditional on revenue source, and these differences may help to explain when citizens will punish poor performance. We argue that citizens with high psychological ownership over the government budget will have higher expectations for how much they should benefit from government spending. Poor government performance generates negative emotions in citizens with high expectations, and these negative emotions are then alleviated through sanctioning those responsible. Psychological ownership therefore increases the expressive benefits citizens receive from punishment, making them more willing to pay to punish. We also argue that psychological ownership is malleable, and that as a result it is possible to increase citizens\u2019 sense of ownership over windfall revenues. Lab experiments, conducted by the authors in Uganda, provide encouraging evidence in favor of the ownership hypothesis, and suggesting that it might be possible to manipulate ownership over windfall revenues and, through higher ownership, increase accountability pressures for aid and oil, more work needs to be done. Lab experiments are conducted in a very abstract setting, and it is not clear whether the same dynamics will hold outside of the lab. This research design lays out a plan to test the ownership mechanism outside of the lab, focusing on whether it is possible to increase citizens\u2019 willingness to take costly political actions by increasing their ownership over windfall revenues. This experiment will be carried out using a large sample of Ugandans in 2018."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Our pre-analysis plan lays out three tiers of hypotheses. The most critical hypothesis is that our ownership treatments, which are designed to encourage subjects to think of non-tax revenues as their own personal revenue, will induce both higher levels of ownership and a greater willingness to take costly political action. We also have a set of information treatments that we expect to have positive, but smaller, effects on both ownership and willingness to take costly political actions."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "We have 7 treatments: pure control, aid information, oil information, tax information, aid ownership, and tax ownership. Respondents are randomly assigned to one of the treatments; after the treatment prompt is given during the survey, all respondents are asked a set of outcome questions in which they have the opportunity to take one or more costly political actions (such as sending a message to a government official, or sending an SMS in order to get more information). We then estimate the effects of the treatments on the outcomes, as well as three potential mechanisms: ownership, information, and corruption. All comparisons will be done using OLS with and without block and enumerator fixed effects.

There are many reasons to expect citizens\u2019 ownership over government revenues to vary even conditional on revenue source, and these differences may help to explain when citizens will punish poor performance. We argue that citizens with high psychological ownership over the government budget will have higher expectations for how much they should benefit from government spending. Poor government performance generates negative emotions in citizens with high expectations, and these negative emotions are then alleviated through sanctioning those responsible. Psychological ownership therefore increases the expressive benefits citizens receive from punishment, making them more willing to pay to punish. We also argue that psychological ownership is malleable, and that as a result it is possible to increase citizens\u2019 sense of ownership over windfall revenues. Lab experiments, conducted by the authors in Uganda, provide encouraging evidence in favor of the ownership hypothesis, and suggesting that it might be possible to manipulate ownership over windfall revenues and, through higher ownership, increase accountability pressures for aid and oil, more work needs to be done. Lab experiments are conducted in a very abstract setting, and it is not clear whether the same dynamics will hold outside of the lab. This research design lays out a plan to test the ownership mechanism outside of the lab, focusing on whether it is possible to increase citizens\u2019 willingness to take costly political actions by increasing their ownership over windfall revenues. This experiment will be carried out using a large sample of Ugandans in 2018.", "q16": "Our pre-analysis plan lays out three tiers of hypotheses. The most critical hypothesis is that our ownership treatments, which are designed to encourage subjects to think of non-tax revenues as their own personal revenue, will induce both higher levels of ownership and a greater willingness to take costly political action. We also have a set of information treatments that we expect to have positive, but smaller, effects on both ownership and willingness to take costly political actions.", "q17": "We have 7 treatments: pure control, aid information, oil information, tax information, aid ownership, and tax ownership. Respondents are randomly assigned to one of the treatments; after the treatment prompt is given during the survey, all respondents are asked a set of outcome questions in which they have the opportunity to take one or more costly political actions (such as sending a message to a government official, or sending an SMS in order to get more information). We then estimate the effects of the treatments on the outcomes, as well as three potential mechanisms: ownership, information, and corruption. All comparisons will be done using OLS with and without block and enumerator fixed effects.
