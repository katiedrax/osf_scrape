Gustafsson, Torun Lindholm, Fredrik J\u00f6nsson"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Eyewitness testimonies are often critical in crime investigations and ensuing trials (Wells et al., 2006). However, eyewitness evidence is also found to be unreliable, as some witnesses lie (see DePaulo et al., 2003; Sporer and Schwandt, 2006; Vrij et al., 2017), and perhaps more commonly, provide honest but erroneous accounts. Indeed, the hazard of eyewitness evidence becomes quite clear as it is estimated that more than 70% of overturned wrongful convictions involved eyewitness misidentifications (innocenceproject.org; see also Garrett, 2011). \n\nWhile eyewitness reports may be problematic, it is important to highlight that incorrect testimonies may not necessarily be detrimental. The negative consequences that may follow from an incorrect memory recall can be avoided if the error is detected. It is therefore crucial for fact finders to obtain the skill to separate correct from incorrect testimonies. Research shows that there is room for improvement of this skill (e.g. Ball &amp; O'Callaghan, 2001; Clark-Foos, Brewer &amp; Marsh, 2015; Johnson &amp; Suengas, 1989; Lindholm 2005; 2008a; 2008b; Schooler, Gerhard &amp; Loftus, 1986). \n\nRecently, we put forth evidence for a new method to judge eyewitness evidence (Lindholm, J\u00f6nsson &amp; Tullio-Liuzza, 2018; Gustafsson, Lindholm &amp; J\u00f6nsson, 2019). This method is based on a witness\u2019 verbal and paraverbal expressions of effort when attempting to remember the event. In our studies, witnesses showed indications of effort, like pausing and using interjections such as \u201ceh\u201d, \u201cuh\u201d, more often when the details they recalled were incorrect rather than correct. \n\nThe current study is a follow-up to a previous experiment where we investigated whether this new method could be incorporated into fact finders\u2019 judgments, in order to improve their skill in judging the accuracy of eyewitness testimonies. The results of this previous experiment showed no significant effect of participants having been informed about the relation between retrieval effort and memory accuracy (i.e., effort-instruction) on accuracy judgments of eyewitness testimonies, as compared to when they had not been informed. One potential explanation for this finding is that participants may have only partially relied on this information, and combined it with their own cues to memory accuracy. We explored this idea by examining whether judgment performance would improve if statements were judged for accuracy by exclusively using the two effort cues hedges and pauses. Hence, we scored all witness statements with hedges or pauses as incorrect, and statement without these cues as correct.  Support for this idea was found by comparing participants\u2019 judgments to an \u201cideal effort observer\u201d that coded accuracy of statements completely based on the effort instruction. Using this strict criterion resulted in better judgment accuracy compared to participants in the experimental group. This indicates that it might be possible to improve judgments if the participants exclusively base their judgments on these two cues. In the current study will use instructions where we strongly emphasize that participants in the experimental group should only rely on the two suggested cues.\n\nFurthermore, in the current study, participants will judge one of three different eyewitness testimonies. These testimonies have been chosen to represent three different effort-accuracy ratios. That is, one testimony has a large negative effort-accuracy ratio, with few effort cues in correct statements and many effort cues in incorrect statements. Another testimony has a medium negative effort-accuracy ratio, and the final testimony has a small positive effort-accuracy ratio (i.e. more effort in correct statements than incorrect statements.

stutter", "description": "A broad range of physiological and behavioral research has demonstrated that people who stutter (PWS) have deficits in the ability to process auditory feedback and utilize it in the regulation of speech motor control. Atypical features of central neurophysiology include diminished grey matter development and integrity of white matter tracts between key auditory processing and premotor areas involved in speech planning and production (Beal 2015; Kell et al. 2009; Chang et al. 2008; Watkins et al. 2008; Chang et al. 2018; Neef et al. 2015). Characteristic modulation of auditory cortical activity immediately prior to speech production is also absent in PWS (Daliri &amp; Max 2015a, 2015b; Daliri &amp; Max 2018), which may reflect inefficient priming of sensory cortices necessary to detect unexpected feedback errors in the upcoming utterance (Eliades &amp; Wang 2008; Eliades &amp; Tsunada 2018). Indeed, there is a wide range of evidence showing that PWS have reduced adaptive speech responses to predictable auditory feedback perturbations (Daliri et al. 2018 [adults only]; Daliri &amp; Max 2018), as well as diminished online responses to unexpected single-trial perturbations (Cai et al. 2012; Loucks et al. 2012). Thus, the dysregulated cortical network connectivity in PWS appears to manifest as a specific deficit in auditory feedback processing for the regulation of ongoing speech motor control.\nConversely, less is known about the ability of PWS to process somatosensory feedback in the regulation of orofacial movement control. In people who do not stutter (PWNS), the role of somatosensation has been demonstrated through jaw and orofacial kinematic responses to both predictable (Nasir &amp; Ostry 2006; Tremblay et al. 2003; 2008; Lametti et al. 2012; Feng et al. 2011) and unexpected online (Abbs &amp; Gracco 1984, Folins &amp; Abbs 1975; Tiede et al. 2006) physical perturbations to the articulators during speech and non-speech movements. However, the profile of these responses in PWS is unknown. Clearly there are structural abnormalities in the neural connections between auditory processing and speech motor cortical areas in PWS, but there are also specific abnormalities within (pre-)motor areas which may limit integration of other sensory signals for speech motor control too (for reviews see Neef 2015; Chang 2018). Given that PWS also show atypical movement characteristics during basic non-speech movement control (Daliri, Propenko, Flanagan &amp; Max 2015; Forster &amp; Webster 2001; Max, Caruso &amp; Gracco 2003), it may be that they experience generalized sensory processing difficulties which affect multiple sensory domains and effector systems. Alternatively, it could be that somatic sensorimotor processing is relatively intact for PWS and that stuttering arises from problems specific to auditory-motor integration or a conflict between somatosensory and auditory processing during speech motor control.\nAs such, this project broadly aims to investigate how PWS differ from neurotypical controls in their ability to integrate somatosensory feedback in the regulation of mandibular speech and non-speech movement control.\n", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-01-10T19:01:55.576956", "date_modified": "2020-01-10T18:40:34.068877", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": null, "analytics_key": "1334a9e6130cf6dfc6ba112fc49bf168831f9ef912cd4608e6bfa74f82eb479127545ddc902c916193ab3a01735a570aa5a4e8f42d583c3ea77234cec7d0e41c5163b0319527aa1099fbfcfa23cc61363b2d98e592c434e81face438d304e40bed57854a6120bdde1cb641e8d08771dab39de5b0e2db56d9405952ddfc549b10540518949a924a2cb2ef682ef6a25b1d", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-01-10T19:01:55.557629", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Preregistration Template from AsPredicted.org", "registered_meta": {"data": {"extra": [], "value": "No, no data have been collected for this study yet."}, "name": {"extra": [], "value": "Speech motor adaptation to mandibular force-field perturbations in adults who stutter."}, "other": {"extra": [], "value": "Acoustic speech data will also be recorded for each participant, which will allow us to analyze any potential modifications of acoustic speech output during the different stages of the experiment that may have additionally contributed to the observed adaptation effects on jaw trajectories.
