The World Health Organisation (WHO) has recommended specific behavioural practices to limit the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. People are encouraged to protect themselves by washing their hands regularly with soap and water; and avoiding touching their face, including eyes, nose or mouth. This is to avoid infection through transfer of the virus from contaminated surfaces to the face or mouth by touching. The key question in health behaviour research is how to predict and modify the adoption and maintenance of these hand hygiene behaviours. Although intention to engage in these behaviours may by high among the general population, especially given the heightened threat of infection from this novel virus, previous research has demonstrated that individuals do not always enact their intentions. The present research aims to use a theory-based intervention to promote effective adoption and maintenance of hand hygiene behaviours to prevent the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\nThe study will adopt an implementation imagery intervention strategy to promote hand hygiene behaviour in the context of face touching, as recommended by the WHO for preventing pathogen transmission. The intervention will be based on two commonly used social psychological models that propose the determinants of social and health behaviours; the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991) and Health Action Process Approach (HAPA; Schwarzer, 2008; Schwarzer &amp; Hamilton, 2020). The models will inform the intervention content and to explain the mechanisms behind the proposed effects. The present study builds on our previous research that supports the predictions of the TPB and HAPA in the context of health behaviours, including hand hygiene behaviour (Reyes Fern\u00e1ndez, Knoll, Hamilton, &amp; Schwarzer, 2016; Zhang, Fang, Zhang, Hagger, &amp; Hamilton, 2020). This research has identified key potentially modifiable determinants of health behaviour that can be targeted in interventions. The intervention will combine strategies that are closely matched with the determinants in the motivational phases of the TPB and volitional phases of the HAPA, including persuasive communication, implementation intentions, and mental imagery. \nThe implementation imagery method used in this study was developed by the research team and has been successfully applied in several studies to date (e.g., Hamilton, Keech, Peden, &amp; Hagger, 2019; Hamilton, Keech, Peden, &amp; Hagger, under review; Keech, Hamilton, &amp; Hagger, in press). The intervention will be evaluated in an online randomised-controlled trial. The intervention will be embedded in an online survey which will be administered to a sample of the general population. The intervention will provide participants with information followed by a series of self-enacted exercises in which they are promoted to adopt the theory-based strategies likely to change their behaviour (e.g., actively making plans to enact the behaviour, and imagining the specific steps required to attain the goal, and mentally rehearsing the feelings that a person has when they have succeeded in performing an intended behaviour). The aim is to test the efficacy of a brief, potentially cost effective, theory-based intervention that involves minimal direct contact between participant and practitioner, and will use resources that can easily be implemented in real-world settings.\nThe intervention will target change in two specific hand hygiene behaviours: (1) avoidance of face touching whenever one is outside of the house (i.e., \u2018face-touching avoidance\u2019); and (2) washing hands every time before touching one\u2019s face (i.e., \u2018handwashing before face-touching\u2019). The rationale for targeting these behaviours is that individuals touch many surfaces with their hands in the course of daily living, particularly when outside the house, which leaves them at risk of touching surfaces that harbour the virus.

Narrative synthesis methodology will be used to organise, comprehensively assess and synthesise the findings from included studies (Ryan, 2013). The qualitative systematic review will follow the framework outlined in the Economic Social Research Council\u2019s (ESRC) guidance for narrative synthesis (Popay et al., 2006), and involves the following steps:\n1.\tIdentifying the review focus, searching for and mapping the available evidence\n2.\tSpecifying the review question\n3.\tIdentifying studies to include in the review\n4.\tData extraction and study quality appraisal\n5.\tSynthesis\n6.\tReporting the results of the review and dissemination\nThe scoping review will adhere to the PRISMA statement, with the PRISMA checklist used as a reporting guide (Moher et al., 2009), in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) systematic review standards.   \n\nStage 1: Identify the review focus, searching for and mapping the available evidence\nThe focus of this review is the conceptualization of self-awareness in adults with acquired brain injury. Preliminary mapping of available evidence included completion of a Medline and CINAHL database search on theoretical models and conceptual frameworks of self-awareness. This search yielded a small number of papers that include theoretical frameworks and models of self-awareness. Generally these provided descriptive summaries of concepts and definitions, and some provided case examples of application of self-awareness models or frameworks in clinical practice. The volume of papers identified as being relevant to this topic through this preliminary mapping exercise was 11 papers. The search strategy required refinement, as there were some relevant and important frameworks known to the researchers that were not yielded in this preliminary search. \n\nStage 2: Specifying the review question\nIn the second stage, the review question was specified as: What are the definitions, theoretical models, and frameworks of self-awareness in adults with acquired brain injury, and how is self-awareness conceptualised within those models? \nThe purpose of the qualitative systematic review is to identify how self-awareness is conceptualised in the brain injury rehabilitation literature, with the following objectives:\n1.\tTo review definitions of self-awareness\n2.\tTo identify theoretical models and conceptual frameworks for self-awareness\n3.\tTo synthesise the concepts identified in the conceptual frameworks and models\n\nStage 3: Identifying studies to include in the review\nIn the third stage, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for papers was identified as:\nINCLUSION CRITERIA:\nTypes of participants: \n-\tAdults (i.e. aged 18yrs+) with acquired brain injury including traumatic brain injury, stroke, hypoxic injury, and other non-progressive neurological insults.\nConcept: \n-\tStudies that report on theoretical models and conceptual frameworks for self-awareness for the brain injury population. For this study, a theoretical model or conceptual framework is defined as a conceptual definition or description of a theory. \nContext: \n-\tAcquired brain injury rehabilitation in any practice setting (i.e. hospital or community settings)\n\nTypes of studies: \n-\tAny existing literature that articulates an original comprehensive definition and/or theoretical model or conceptual framework related to self-awareness in adults with acquired brain injury (i.e. this includes published studies, book chapters and theses)\n-\tPublished in English\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA: \nTypes of participants: \n-\tPaediatric populations (i.e. &lt;18 years)\n\nConcept: \n-\tStudies that do not report a theoretical model or comprehensive definition of self-awareness\n-\tDefinitions of self-awareness that are not provided in the context of a theoretical model or conceptual framework\n-\tFrameworks that consist of a list of concepts that are not integrated or linked in a proposed way\n-\tModels that represent statistical models rather than theoretical models  \n\nContext: \n-\tProgressive neurological conditions including dementia\n-\tMental health conditions\n\nTypes of studies: \n-\tNon-English language papers\n-\tPapers summarising previously reported models\n-\tBroader models of brain functioning and cognitive functions that do not focus primarily on self-awareness (i.e., models/frameworks where self-awareness is not the primary concept or papers describing self-awareness as a sub-component of a broader model of brain function). \nSEARCH STRATEGY: \n-\tA full search using identified keywords and index terms will be completed across five databases, including Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO and the Cochrane database. \n-\tThe reference lists of articles will be searched for additional studies/papers. \n-\tPersonal reference lists from authors will also be included. \nStudy selection: \n-\tSelection will be performed based on inclusion criteria specified in this protocol. \n-\tResults of searches will be imported into Covidence and duplicates removed.\n-\tTwo reviewers will screen titles and abstracts of all identified items, remove any further duplicate and irrelevant items, following PRISMA guidelines.  The full text will be reviewed if the relevance of the paper is uncertain from the abstract or title. \n-\tFull text review will be conducted by two reviewers to generate a final set of papers for inclusion in the review.\n-\tAny disagreements between reviewers will be solved by consensus or by the decision of a third reviewer.\n\n\nStage 4: Data extraction and study quality appraisal\nThe following data will be extracted from the included papers (see Appendix 2 for charting table):\na. Author(s)\nb. Year of publication\nc. Origin/country of origin (i.e. where the paper was published or conducted)\nd. Aims/purpose\ne. Proposed population for application\nf.

Strengths and limitations of the framework/model\n\nStage 5: The synthesis\nNarrative synthesis methodology will be applied in accordance with the ESRC guidance for narrative synthesis (Popay et al., 2006) that involves consideration of the following elements: \n-\tDeveloping a preliminary synthesis of findings\n-\tExploring relationships in the data\n-\tAssessing the robustness of the synthesis \n\nStage 6: Reporting the results of the review and dissemination\nKey elements of existing conceptualisations of self-awareness will be extracted and presented, highlighting commonalities and differences between theoretical models. Implications for the development of self-awareness measures and recommendations for interventions will be discussed. The systematic review will be written up for publication in a peer-reviewed brain injury rehabilitation journal.\n\n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Qualitative systematic review protocol - OSF registration 07.04.2020.docx"}, "nodeId": "3tvue", "sha256": "bdf65be38439ec6dd4002af6571ecf87841980d2f7101f50a1bb8c7fdc2c8111", "viewUrl": "/project/qvahw/files/osfstorage/5e9789abf1353504e0d59e90/", "selectedFileName": "Qualitative systematic review protocol - OSF registration 07.04.2020.docx"}], "value": ""}}}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": "N/A"}, "q8": {"extra": [], "value": "Registration prior to creation of data"}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": "N/A"}, "q10": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "INCLUSION CRITERIA:\nTypes of participants: \n-\tAdults (i.e. aged 18yrs+) with acquired brain injury including traumatic brain injury, stroke, hypoxic injury, and other non-progressive neurological insults.\nConcept: \n-\tStudies that report on theoretical models and conceptual frameworks for self-awareness for the brain injury population.

It is known that study methods are frequently not described in adequate detail and that results are presented ambiguously or selectively. To overcome these problems, reporting guidelines (e.g. CONSORT, PRISMA, STARD and STROBE statements) have been developed to increase the transparency of research. While recent evidence suggested that these guidelines are frequently used inappropriately in studies published in the major medical journals, the extent and appropriateness of use in physical therapy research has not been systematically evaluated.

Clinical practice and public health policy decisions should be based on high-quality research findings[1]. The purpose of a research report (e.g. a scientific article) is to communicate the design, execution, and findings of a study with precision and accuracy[2]; this is relevant for several stakeholder groups, including researchers, clinicians, systematic reviewers and patients[3]. Research reports should include all relevant information about methods and results to be useful to all these categories of potential readers. Additionally, accurate reporting of a study is essential to judge its validity and the clinical applicability of its findings[1]. \n\nProblems about reporting of a scientific study can affect research in different ways. For example, it is known that study methods are frequently not described in adequate detail and that results are presented ambiguously, incompletely or selectively[3]. The consequence is that many reports cannot be used for replication studies, or they are even harmful, as well as a waste of resources[4]. To overcome these problems, reporting guidelines (RGs) have been developed to support authors in reporting research methods and results. These are typically presented as checklists or flow diagrams that lay out the core reporting criteria required to provide a clear representation of each part of a study report (abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion and conclusion)[5]. RGs specify a minimum set of information needed for a clear and complete account of what was done and what was found during a research study, particularly reflecting aspects that might have introduced bias into the research[1]. Nevertheless, it is important to distinguish RGs from critical appraisal tools as the objective of RGs is not to focus on the assessment of internal validity of a study. In fact, RGs provide guidance for writing an accurate research report, whereas critical appraisal tools (e.g. the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 for randomized controlled trials[6]) are used to evaluate the methodological quality and/or risk of bias of a study.\n\nRGs have been developed for a lot of different types of studies. For example, the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT Statement) is for randomized controlled trials[7, 8], the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement is for systematic reviews[9], the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement is for observational designs[10], and the Standards for the Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) Statement is for diagnostic accuracy studies[11, 12]. Many studies have confirmed that the use of RGs can improve the completeness and transparency of publications in different medical research areas[13, 14]. However, Caulley et al., in a recent cross-sectional survey[15], found that RGs of health research studies published in the major medical journals are frequently used inappropriately; for example, some authors use the RGs as a tool to guide the design and research methodology rather than an instrument to write the research report.\n\nResearch on physical therapy (PT) is a growing field in health sciences[16]. In 2014, twenty-eight rehabilitation journals have simultaneously published an editorial to highlight the need of using RGs to ensure the quality of PT and rehabilitation research[5]. Chan and colleagues concluded the editorial hoping \u201c\u2026that simultaneous implementation of this new reporting requirement will send a strong message to all disability and rehabilitation researchers about the need to adhere to the highest standards when performing and disseminating research.\u201d However, up to now, the extent and appropriateness of use of RGs in the PT field has not been systematically evaluated.\n\n\nObjectives\n\nThe primary objective of this meta-research study is to evaluate the frequency of using RGs and their appropriate use in PT published research.\n\nThe secondary objective of this cross-sectional analysis is to investigate the context and circumstances of using RGs by exploring the influence of year of publication and the using distribution in main field of PT (e.g. musculoskeletal, neurological, pediatrics, pelvic-floor dysfunction, and pulmonary).\n\n\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS\n\nA cross-sectional analysis was designed in a random sample of 200 studies published in the last ten years (2010-2019) in the five generic rehabilitation journals with the highest 5-year impact factor (5-year IF) according to 2018 InCites Journal Citation Report[17]. Generic rehabilitation journals have a broad scope and can publish article in any field of PT research. The five selected journals were:\n\n\u2022\tJournal of Physiotherapy (5-year IF=6.380)\n\u2022\tArchives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (5-year IF=3.618)\n\u2022\tPhysical Therapy (5-year IF=3.599)\n\u2022\tClinical Rehabilitation (5-year IF=3.196)\n\u2022\tPhysiotherapy (5-year IF=3.103)\n\n\nStudy selection criteria\nResearch reports published in the last ten years as full-text scientific articles in the aforementioned journals will be included. Articles will have to be identified in the title or in the abstract by authors as:\n\n- Randomised controlled trial (RCT);\n- Systematic review, with or without meta-analysis; \n- Diagnostic accuracy study (defined also cross-sectional diagnostic study); \n- Observational study (cohort, case-control and cross-sectional ones). \n\nUnidentified reports will be labelled in one of these four categories in line with the methodology used in the study, according to the following reporting guidelines:\n- CONSORT for RCTs[7, 8]; \n- PRISMA for systematic reviews[9];\n- STARD for diagnostic studies[11, 12];\n- STROBE statements and their extension for observational studies[10].\n\n\n\nSTUDY SELECTION PROCESS\n\nAn experienced librarian helped in developing the search strategy for this study. Journal tags for the five journals will be identified in Medline and a detailed search strategy will be created to find all relevant studies published in the last ten years in this database (See Table 1). \nTitles and abstracts of articles published in the years ranging from 2010 to 2019 will be screened for eligibility. Two reviewers will run the search strategy and will select all relevant articles based on title/abstract, independently. Any disagreements about inclusion of a citing article will be resolved by a third reviewer. Subsequently, the study sample of 200 hits will be selected using a computerized random sequence generator[18]. Randomization will be stratified for publication date to include an equal number of studies from 2010 to 2014 (n=100) and from 2015 to 2019 (n=100). \nData collection and extraction\nEndnote[19] will be used to collect and manage the study sample. Data extraction will be performed by two reviewers, independently; a third researcher will solve disagreements. A data extraction form will be used by two reviewers and the following data will be extracted:\n\n- First author and year of publication;\n- Journal;\n- Study type (i.e. RCT, systematic review, diagnostic study, observational study);\n- PT research field (e.g. musculoskeletal, neurological, pediatrics, pelvic-floor disfunction, cardio-pulmonary, other)\n- Authors\u2019 declaration of using a RG (yes/no and which one);\n- The appropriate use of RG (yes/no). \n\nClassification will be based on direct interpretation from the text of stated use of reporting guidelines and, when available, supplementary materials stating use of reporting guideline checklists. Use RGs as a guide to report details of the study design and results (that is, what was done and what was found) will categorize as \u201cappropriate\u201d use. Examples of appropriate use of these reporting guidelines are provided in Table 2.\n\nDATA ANALYSIS\n\nThe primary analysis will address:\n\n- Crude prevalence estimates with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)[20] of articles that use a RG\n\n - Crude prevalence estimates presented alongside their 95% CI of appropriateness of use of RGs.\n\nSecondary analysis:\n\n- The impact of time elapsed since publication of the articles and use of RGs will be evaluated. A logistic regression analysis will be performed to assess the relationship between the use of RGs and the year of publication, with use of RG (yes/no) as dependent variable and publication year (2010-2019) as independent variable. \n\n- We will perform in addition two subgroup analysis:\n1)Articles will be classified according to the PT research field: musculoskeletal, neurological, pediatrics, pelvic-floor disfunction, cardio-pulmonary, or other. Prevalence estimates (presented alongside 95% CIs) of articles that use a RG and their appropriateness will be calculated for each subgroup. \n2)Article will be classified according to study design: RCT, systematic review, diagnostic test accuracy, observational. We will calculate prevalence estimates (alongiside 95% CIs) of articles that use a reporting guideline and the appropriateness will be estimated for each of these groups. \n\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION\n\nSeveral studies have shown the positive influence of RGs on the completeness of research reporting[21]. The adherence to these guidelines can result in a published article that contains precise information and that can better allow readers to make informed judgments.  By increasing the likelihood that critical information is included in the submitted manuscript, the work of editors and external reviewers can also become more efficient[2].\nSince the publication of the multi-journal editorial of Chan and colleagues[5], no study investigated the use and the appropriateness of RGs in PT research. \nTherefore, this study will add relevant knowledge that may contribute to improve further the value of rehabilitation research. \nThis study will also align with the mission statement of the EQUATOR (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency of health Research) Network[22], an international collaboration aiming to enhance the reliability of medical research literature by promoting transparent, accurate reporting of research studies. . A manuscript with results will be prepared and submitted for journal publication upon project completion. The findings of the study will be disseminated at a relevant (inter)national conference.  The results of this research will be published in a relevant journal in the rehabilitation category, which has peer review and qualifies physical therapy research and practice. All results of this meta-research study will also be announced at (inter)national scientific events in the area of rehabilitation and research method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n1.\tSimera I, Altman DG.

However, Caulley et al., in a recent cross-sectional survey[15], found that RGs of health research studies published in the major medical journals are frequently used inappropriately; for example, some authors use the RGs as a tool to guide the design and research methodology rather than an instrument to write the research report.\n\nResearch on physical therapy (PT) is a growing field in health sciences[16]. In 2014, twenty-eight rehabilitation journals have simultaneously published an editorial to highlight the need of using RGs to ensure the quality of PT and rehabilitation research[5]. Chan and colleagues concluded the editorial hoping \u201c\u2026that simultaneous implementation of this new reporting requirement will send a strong message to all disability and rehabilitation researchers about the need to adhere to the highest standards when performing and disseminating research.\u201d However, up to now, the extent and appropriateness of use of RGs in the PT field has not been systematically evaluated.\n\n\nObjectives\n\nThe primary objective of this meta-research study is to evaluate the frequency of using RGs and their appropriate use in PT published research.\n\nThe secondary objective of this cross-sectional analysis is to investigate the context and circumstances of using RGs by exploring the influence of year of publication and the using distribution in main field of PT (e.g. musculoskeletal, neurological, pediatrics, pelvic-floor dysfunction, and pulmonary).\n\n\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS\n\nA cross-sectional analysis was designed in a random sample of 200 studies published in the last ten years (2010-2019) in the five generic rehabilitation journals with the highest 5-year impact factor (5-year IF) according to 2018 InCites Journal Citation Report[17]. Generic rehabilitation journals have a broad scope and can publish article in any field of PT research. The five selected journals were:\n\n\u2022\tJournal of Physiotherapy (5-year IF=6.380)\n\u2022\tArchives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (5-year IF=3.618)\n\u2022\tPhysical Therapy (5-year IF=3.599)\n\u2022\tClinical Rehabilitation (5-year IF=3.196)\n\u2022\tPhysiotherapy (5-year IF=3.103)\n\n\nStudy selection criteria\nResearch reports published in the last ten years as full-text scientific articles in the aforementioned journals will be included. Articles will have to be identified in the title or in the abstract by authors as:\n\n- Randomised controlled trial (RCT);\n- Systematic review, with or without meta-analysis; \n- Diagnostic accuracy study (defined also cross-sectional diagnostic study); \n- Observational study (cohort, case-control and cross-sectional ones). \n\nUnidentified reports will be labelled in one of these four categories in line with the methodology used in the study, according to the following reporting guidelines:\n- CONSORT for RCTs[7, 8]; \n- PRISMA for systematic reviews[9];\n- STARD for diagnostic studies[11, 12];\n- STROBE statements and their extension for observational studies[10].\n\n\n\nSTUDY SELECTION PROCESS\n\nAn experienced librarian helped in developing the search strategy for this study. Journal tags for the five journals will be identified in Medline and a detailed search strategy will be created to find all relevant studies published in the last ten years in this database (See Table 1). \nTitles and abstracts of articles published in the years ranging from 2010 to 2019 will be screened for eligibility. Two reviewers will run the search strategy and will select all relevant articles based on title/abstract, independently. Any disagreements about inclusion of a citing article will be resolved by a third reviewer. Subsequently, the study sample of 200 hits will be selected using a computerized random sequence generator[18]. Randomization will be stratified for publication date to include an equal number of studies from 2010 to 2014 (n=100) and from 2015 to 2019 (n=100). \nData collection and extraction\nEndnote[19] will be used to collect and manage the study sample. Data extraction will be performed by two reviewers, independently; a third researcher will solve disagreements. A data extraction form will be used by two reviewers and the following data will be extracted:\n\n- First author and year of publication;\n- Journal;\n- Study type (i.e. RCT, systematic review, diagnostic study, observational study);\n- PT research field (e.g. musculoskeletal, neurological, pediatrics, pelvic-floor disfunction, cardio-pulmonary, other)\n- Authors\u2019 declaration of using a RG (yes/no and which one);\n- The appropriate use of RG (yes/no). \n\nClassification will be based on direct interpretation from the text of stated use of reporting guidelines and, when available, supplementary materials stating use of reporting guideline checklists. Use RGs as a guide to report details of the study design and results (that is, what was done and what was found) will categorize as \u201cappropriate\u201d use. Examples of appropriate use of these reporting guidelines are provided in Table 2.\n\nDATA ANALYSIS\n\nThe primary analysis will address:\n\n- Crude prevalence estimates with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)[20] of articles that use a RG\n\n - Crude prevalence estimates presented alongside their 95% CI of appropriateness of use of RGs.\n\nSecondary analysis:\n\n- The impact of time elapsed since publication of the articles and use of RGs will be evaluated. A logistic regression analysis will be performed to assess the relationship between the use of RGs and the year of publication, with use of RG (yes/no) as dependent variable and publication year (2010-2019) as independent variable. \n\n- We will perform in addition two subgroup analysis:\n1)Articles will be classified according to the PT research field: musculoskeletal, neurological, pediatrics, pelvic-floor disfunction, cardio-pulmonary, or other. Prevalence estimates (presented alongside 95% CIs) of articles that use a RG and their appropriateness will be calculated for each subgroup. \n2)Article will be classified according to study design: RCT, systematic review, diagnostic test accuracy, observational. We will calculate prevalence estimates (alongiside 95% CIs) of articles that use a reporting guideline and the appropriateness will be estimated for each of these groups. \n\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION\n\nSeveral studies have shown the positive influence of RGs on the completeness of research reporting[21]. The adherence to these guidelines can result in a published article that contains precise information and that can better allow readers to make informed judgments.  By increasing the likelihood that critical information is included in the submitted manuscript, the work of editors and external reviewers can also become more efficient[2].\nSince the publication of the multi-journal editorial of Chan and colleagues[5], no study investigated the use and the appropriateness of RGs in PT research. \nTherefore, this study will add relevant knowledge that may contribute to improve further the value of rehabilitation research. \nThis study will also align with the mission statement of the EQUATOR (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency of health Research) Network[22], an international collaboration aiming to enhance the reliability of medical research literature by promoting transparent, accurate reporting of research studies. . A manuscript with results will be prepared and submitted for journal publication upon project completion. The findings of the study will be disseminated at a relevant (inter)national conference.  The results of this research will be published in a relevant journal in the rehabilitation category, which has peer review and qualifies physical therapy research and practice. All results of this meta-research study will also be announced at (inter)national scientific events in the area of rehabilitation and research method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n1.\tSimera I, Altman DG.

Sharing data and analysis code makes it easier for other researchers to re-use or check published research. These benefits will only emerge if researchers can reproduce the analysis reported in published articles, and if data is annotated well enough so that it is clear what all variables mean. Because most researchers have not been trained in computational reproducibility, it is important to evaluate current practices to identify practices that can be improved. We examined data and code sharing, as well as computational reproducibility of the main results, without contacting the original authors, for Registered Reports published in the in psychological literature between 2014 and 2018. Of the 62 articles that met our inclusion criteria, data was available for 40 articles, and analysis scripts for 37 articles. For the 35 articles that shared both data and code and performed analyses in SPSS, R, Python, MATLAB, or JASP, we could run the scripts for 31 articles, and reproduce the main results for 20 articles. Although the articles that shared both data and code (35 out of 62, or 56%) and articles that could be computationally reproduced (20 out of 35, or 57%) was relatively high compared to other studies, there is clear room for improvement. We provide practical recommendations based on our observations, and link to examples of good research practices in the papers we reproduced.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "",
