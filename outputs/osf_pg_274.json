Jan Schaltegger"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Language has long been assumed to be arbitrary (de Saussure, 1959). Ongoing research draws a different picture. There is an increasing number of studies that show nonarbitrary features of language, e.g. sound symbolism. Sound symbolism is the correspondence between the sound and the meaning of a word (Monaghan, Mattock &amp; Walker, 2012). Examples for this phenomenon are: English words beginning with /gl/ are often associated with \u201cvision\u201d and \u201clight\u201d (e.g., \u201cglimmer,\u201d \u201cglisten,\u201d \u201cglitter,\u201d \u201cgleam,\u201d \u201cglow,\u201d \u201cglint\u201d; Aryani, Jacobs &amp; Conrad, 2013), or german words beginning with kno/kn\u00f6 are associated with small, round objects (e.g. \u201cKn\u00f6chel\u201d, \u201cKn\u00f6del\u201d, \u201cKnopf\u201d; Aryani, Jacobs &amp; Conrad, 2013). These examples are language-specific, but there is evidence that there are some universal sound symbolic associations. Imai, Kita, Naguma &amp; Okada (2008) found that adults can guess antonym translations of possible japanese words. English and Japanese adults made similar judgements what the word could mean. Nygaard, Cook and Nami (2009) used Japanese words to measure sound symbolism. In the learning phase, they presented the participants either correct translations, antonym translations, or unrelated translations of Japanese words. In the test phase, the participants heard the words again and should pick the learned translation. When the participants heard the correct translation, they were faster in picking the learned translation than when they heard the antonym or the unrelated translation. There is another phenomenon, called Bouba-Kiki. In this sound to shape matching task, adult participants map the sound \u201cbouba\u201d to round shapes and the sound \u201ckiki\u201d to angular shapes (K\u00f6hler, 1929; Ramachandran &amp; Hubbard, 2001). This preference is found in several cultures (Chen, Huang, Woods, &amp; Spence, 2016), even in cultures not having much contact to western culture nor attending any school system (Bremner et al. 2013). Bremner et al. (2013) researched the Bouba-Kiki phenomenon in Himba people and found that 28 out of 34 participants matched bouba to a round shape and 28 out of 34 participants matched kiki to the angular shape. Not only adults, but as well children as young as 11 months are sensitive to sound-shape correspondences. Laing (2017) presented 10/11 months old children 2 pictures on a screen, one was the matching image to a sound and one was a distractor. She differed the sounds between conventional words (e.g. duck, dog) or onomatopoeic words (e.g. quaak, wouff) and measured on an eye tracker, how long the children looked at the matching image. Laing (2017) compared the time looking to the matching image and the distractor image. She found that the proportion children looked at the matching image when she presented the onomatopoeic word was higher than it was when she presented the conventional word. Another study researching the Bouba-Kiki phenomenon in 11 months old children found an increased N400 response in mismatch conditions \u2013 when bouba is matched to angular shapes \u2013 than in match conditions \u2013 when bouba is matched to round shapes (Asano et al. 2016). This suggests that the association of bouba to angular shapes is more difficult to learn than the association of bouba to round shapes. There are other studies that researched the Bouba-Kiki phenomenon in children. Yoshida (2012) found the bouba-kiki effect in 30 months old children, and Tzeng, Nygaard and Namy (2017) found the effect in 3, 5 and 7-year-old children. Fort et al. (2018) did a meta-analysis on the bouba-kiki phenomenon in children. They found that children are sensitive to sound symbolic matches. In their meta-analysis, the effect was stronger for round shapes than for angular shapes, and the effect was stronger for older children than for younger children. Another study from Perry, Perlman and Lupvan (2015) asked parents to judge, which words their children learn with which age. Then they asked another sample of adults how sound symbolic these words were. Perry et al. (2015) found out that sound symbolic words tend to be learned earlier, leading to the suggestion that sound symbolism helps children to learn language. Imai and Kita (2014) propose the sound symbolic bootstrapping hypothesis. According to it, sound symbolism helps children to learn language. They make 5 claims how sound symbolism helps children to learn language:\nThe first claim says that children are sensitive to sound symbolism through the ability to map and integrate multi-modal input. This means that children can integrate several aspects of the same word, e.g. the sound and the meaning of the word at the same time. The 2nd claim Imai &amp; Kita (2014) make is that children are sensitive to a wider range of sound symbolic cues than adults, and this sensitivity decreases and gets language specific as children learn more words in their native language. This claim leads to the next one, that sound symbolism helps infants in the early stage of word learning to recognize that speech sounds refer to specific entities in the world. The 4th claim tells that sound symbolism helps infants to associate speech sounds to the specific referent. In doing so, children can establish a lexical representation of this association. The last claim Imai &amp; Kita make is that sound symbolism helps toddlers to identify the specific referent of a word in a complex scene. Could it be that bilingual children don\u2019t lose the broad sensitivity to sound symbolism, as Imai &amp; Kita (2014) propose in their 2nd claim, or that bilingual children lose this broad sensitivity later in life because they know less words compared to monolingual children with the same age?\nThere are few studies researching sound symbolism in bilingual children. A study of Pejovic and Molnar (2017) compared Spanish/Basque bilingual with Spanish monolingual children in their ability to match bouba to round shapes and kiki to angular shapes. They found no difference in 12 months old children. This makes sense, because neither of these children have more linguistic experience. In the age of 6-8 years, Chow and Ciaramitaro (2019) found in the Bouba-Kiki task, that there is an effect of the number of protrusions with the letter a. When bilingual children were excluded, the effect of 7 protrusions with the letter a was smaller, suggesting that bilingual children are still more sensitive to sound symbolism than monolingual children. Thom and Sandhofer (2013) did a sound label task with 18/24 months old children. They presented the children novel objects. In the training phase, they first placed a novel object in front of the child and it was able to play with the object. After some playing time, the experimenter labeled the object with a pseudo word (e.g. whoosh). After labeling the novel object the experimenter put it away and put a known object in front of the child to play with. After some playing time, the experimenter took the known object away and presented a second novel object the child was able to play with. Then, the experimenter took the object and showed it to the child in a similar way than the first object, but the experimenter didn\u2019t label the object. After, the experimenter put the 2nd novel object away and presented a known object the child could play with. This testing phase was repeated twice. After the 2nd time, the experimenter put 3 novel objects in front of the child to play with. One was the familiar labeled, one the familiar unlabeled and one an unfamiliar novel object. After some playing time the experimenter asked the child to hand over the labeled object (can you give me the whoosh?). Thom &amp; Sandhofer (2013) found out that older bilingual children performed the same as younger children, but monolingual older children performed worse than the other groups.\nA possible explanation for this finding is that the sensitivity to sound symbolism decreases with the amount of words children know, as proposed by Imai &amp; Kita (2014). There is some evidence that bilingual children are more sensitive to sound symbolism than monolingual children, but there are few studies researching this. It is as well not clear whether bilingual children lose the broad sensitivity to sound symbolism or whether they lose it later than monolingual children. So, my research question is the following: Are bilingual children more sensitive to sound symbolism than monolingual children are? There are effects for 24 Months old children, but no study compared monolinguals and bilinguals by the age of 36 months. In my study, I research the difference of monolingual and bilingual children in their sensitivity to sound symbolic cues in language. When I find a higher sensitivity of bilingual vs monolingual 36 months old children to sound symbolism, this supports the sound symbolic bootstrapping hypothesis, namely that bilingual children don\u2019t lose the broad sensitivity to sound symbolism as they know less words in one language. When I find the same sensitivity to sound symbolism of bilingual vs. monolingual children to sound symbolism, this would not support the sound symbolic bootstrapping hypothesis, or it would mean that bilingual children caught up with their vocabulary size and don\u2019t use more sound symbolic cues for language learning than monolingual children."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "1.\tBilingual 36 months old children can learn sound symbolic words better in a sound label task than monolingual children.

Monolingual children should perform better in the kiki-subtask because of their increased language proficiency and because the sensitivity to this phenomen increases with language proficiency (Fort et al. 2018). Monolingual and bilingual children should perform the same in the bouba-subtask, because the bouba-subtask is easier and is learned earlier (Fort et al. 2018)\n4.\tMonolingual and bilingual 36 months old children perform the same in all three tasks.

I give the parent(s) the language exposure questionnaire to fill out during the testing of their child. To get the child interested, I tell a story of an alien, which needs to land on earth because its space ship is broken. For the Alien being able to communicate, both the monolingual and bilingual children hear words in Swiss German and need to show the alien the correct object (this is the Bilex in swiss german). Then, I inform the child that the alien landed at the other side of the world. It needs again the help of the child to understand the language spoken there. Then the child does the guess translation task. After this task, I tell the child that the Alien brought some things with it and wants to show them to the child. The Alien labels the objects (sound label task) and asks for one of the shown objects. After finishing this task, I tell the child that the alien gave me a recording of things it needs to repair its ship, but I have no clue what the Alien means.

Then, I show them the novel object and label it 3 times with a Japanese adjective (e.g. omoi; engl. heavy). After labelling it I take it away and present the children a known object with which they can play for 15 seconds. After that, I put the known object away and show the children another novel object with the opposite characteristic (e.g. heavy vs. light). They can play again with it for 15 seconds and after I take it in my hand and show it to them. I do the exact same thing as with the labelled object, but I don\u2019t label it. I say for example: this is like this, this is cool, \u2026 After, I put it away and present the children again a familiar object they can play with for 15 seconds. This is the training phase. After the training phase, I show the children 3 objects. Two of them they are familiar with, and one they are not familiar with. The one they are not familiar with is in the middle of the two extremes (e.g. between heavy and light). After 30 seconds of playing with the objects, I ask the children: can you give me the one that is \u201comoi\u201d? There are match trials, where the translation of the labeled word is correct, and there are non-match trials, where I label the antonym (e.g. object: soft, label: hard). I do 4 of these trials per child (trial number 1-4), two match and two mismatch trials and with that I measure whether children can learn new sound symbolic foreign words. The coding is as follows: When children give me the labelled object, they receive 2 points, when they give me the unlabeled known object or the unknown object they receive 0 points.\n2.\tBouba-Kiki task: Children see each time 2 different figures (De Carolis et al., 2016) in 1 color (this varies between blue, green and red). Then they hear a sound and I ask them to press on the figure they think matches better. I present them 4 different bouba type sounds (bamu, bouba, goga, mabuma) and 4 different kiki-type sounds (kuhtej, kejkee, teetay, tuhkeetee) (sounds from Tzeng, Nygard &amp; Nami, 2017). I present each sound twice, once by a female voice and once by a male voice.  This results in 16 trials per child (trial number 1-16). With this task I measure the ability of children to match pseudowords and shapes. I score this task as follows: For chosing the round shape when children heard a bouba-type sound, they receive 1 point, and for choosing the angular shape when hearing a bouba-type sound they receive 0 points. For choosing the angular shape when presenting a kiki-type sound, children receive 1 point and for choosing the round shape when presenting a kiki-type sounds they receive 0 points.\n3.\tGuess translation task: I present the children 10 (trial number 1-10) slides, where on each slide are 6 different images. The three images on the left side belong to a category and the three images of the right side belong to a category. On each slide I play a sound from a foreign language suiting to one of the 2 categories and ask the children which category the children think the word suits. The sounds are from the languages Ewe, Japanese, Korean, Siwu and Semai (Dingemanse et al. 2016). I created 34 categories in advance and validated these categories by adults to get the 20 easiest recognizable categories. With the guess translations task, I measure the sensitivity of children to detect sound symbolic cues from other languages. I hypothesize that bilingual children perform better in this task than monolingual children. I code this task as follows: For choosing the correct category, children get 1 point and for choosing the incorrect category children receive 0 points.\n4.\tBilex: The Bilex contains 48 trials on 12 different picture cards. Each card shows 6 objects, having 4 targets and 2 distractors. These distractors have an age of acquisition between 3.8 and 6.5 years. Each picture card is shown 4 times, and every time one of the 4 targets is labeled. Every time the same picture card is shown, the 6 objects on it change their position. There are as well 2 different orders of trials, one Swiss German order and 1 other language order, that the children cannot learn the order because they do this task twice in my study. With the Bilex, I control for the vocabulary size in children. For coding the bilex, the child gets 1 point for picking the target object and 0 points for picking any of the other 5 objects.\n5.\tQuestionnaire for onomatopoeia. In this questionnaire, the parents of the children are asked about the amount of onomatopoeic words children use in their language. The questionnaire contains the following questions: How does your child label this animal/object? Then, they see an image of an animal/object and are asked to type in the animal/object name and the respective sound. When they are bilingual, they should fill in both names and both sounds, when they are monolingual they should only type in the Swiss German name and sound. Next to these four text fields there are four additional textfields where the parents can fill in the amount of time their child uses this expression. Taken together, these four textfields need to sum up to 100. With this task, I control for the use of onomatopoeic words in the language of children. I calculate the average of onomatopoeic words the children use in %.\n6.\tNumber of languages children learn, scored as language group 1 or 2 (1 = monolingual, 2 = bilingual)\n7.\tParental highest education of father and mother.

How many spiky compared to round object does your child see at average?\n9.\tLanguage exposure questionnaire: When the parents are in the lab, they are asked to fill out a questionnaire.

Examples for this phenomenon are: English words beginning with /gl/ are often associated with \u201cvision\u201d and \u201clight\u201d (e.g., \u201cglimmer,\u201d \u201cglisten,\u201d \u201cglitter,\u201d \u201cgleam,\u201d \u201cglow,\u201d \u201cglint\u201d; Aryani, Jacobs &amp; Conrad, 2013), or german words beginning with kno/kn\u00f6 are associated with small, round objects (e.g. \u201cKn\u00f6chel\u201d, \u201cKn\u00f6del\u201d, \u201cKnopf\u201d; Aryani, Jacobs &amp; Conrad, 2013). These examples are language-specific, but there is evidence that there are some universal sound symbolic associations. Imai, Kita, Naguma &amp; Okada (2008) found that adults can guess antonym translations of possible japanese words. English and Japanese adults made similar judgements what the word could mean. Nygaard, Cook and Nami (2009) used Japanese words to measure sound symbolism. In the learning phase, they presented the participants either correct translations, antonym translations, or unrelated translations of Japanese words. In the test phase, the participants heard the words again and should pick the learned translation. When the participants heard the correct translation, they were faster in picking the learned translation than when they heard the antonym or the unrelated translation. There is another phenomenon, called Bouba-Kiki. In this sound to shape matching task, adult participants map the sound \u201cbouba\u201d to round shapes and the sound \u201ckiki\u201d to angular shapes (K\u00f6hler, 1929; Ramachandran &amp; Hubbard, 2001). This preference is found in several cultures (Chen, Huang, Woods, &amp; Spence, 2016), even in cultures not having much contact to western culture nor attending any school system (Bremner et al. 2013). Bremner et al. (2013) researched the Bouba-Kiki phenomenon in Himba people and found that 28 out of 34 participants matched bouba to a round shape and 28 out of 34 participants matched kiki to the angular shape. Not only adults, but as well children as young as 11 months are sensitive to sound-shape correspondences. Laing (2017) presented 10/11 months old children 2 pictures on a screen, one was the matching image to a sound and one was a distractor. She differed the sounds between conventional words (e.g. duck, dog) or onomatopoeic words (e.g. quaak, wouff) and measured on an eye tracker, how long the children looked at the matching image. Laing (2017) compared the time looking to the matching image and the distractor image. She found that the proportion children looked at the matching image when she presented the onomatopoeic word was higher than it was when she presented the conventional word. Another study researching the Bouba-Kiki phenomenon in 11 months old children found an increased N400 response in mismatch conditions \u2013 when bouba is matched to angular shapes \u2013 than in match conditions \u2013 when bouba is matched to round shapes (Asano et al. 2016). This suggests that the association of bouba to angular shapes is more difficult to learn than the association of bouba to round shapes. There are other studies that researched the Bouba-Kiki phenomenon in children. Yoshida (2012) found the bouba-kiki effect in 30 months old children, and Tzeng, Nygaard and Namy (2017) found the effect in 3, 5 and 7-year-old children. Fort et al. (2018) did a meta-analysis on the bouba-kiki phenomenon in children. They found that children are sensitive to sound symbolic matches. In their meta-analysis, the effect was stronger for round shapes than for angular shapes, and the effect was stronger for older children than for younger children. Another study from Perry, Perlman and Lupvan (2015) asked parents to judge, which words their children learn with which age. Then they asked another sample of adults how sound symbolic these words were. Perry et al. (2015) found out that sound symbolic words tend to be learned earlier, leading to the suggestion that sound symbolism helps children to learn language. Imai and Kita (2014) propose the sound symbolic bootstrapping hypothesis. According to it, sound symbolism helps children to learn language. They make 5 claims how sound symbolism helps children to learn language:\nThe first claim says that children are sensitive to sound symbolism through the ability to map and integrate multi-modal input. This means that children can integrate several aspects of the same word, e.g. the sound and the meaning of the word at the same time. The 2nd claim Imai &amp; Kita (2014) make is that children are sensitive to a wider range of sound symbolic cues than adults, and this sensitivity decreases and gets language specific as children learn more words in their native language. This claim leads to the next one, that sound symbolism helps infants in the early stage of word learning to recognize that speech sounds refer to specific entities in the world. The 4th claim tells that sound symbolism helps infants to associate speech sounds to the specific referent. In doing so, children can establish a lexical representation of this association. The last claim Imai &amp; Kita make is that sound symbolism helps toddlers to identify the specific referent of a word in a complex scene. Could it be that bilingual children don\u2019t lose the broad sensitivity to sound symbolism, as Imai &amp; Kita (2014) propose in their 2nd claim, or that bilingual children lose this broad sensitivity later in life because they know less words compared to monolingual children with the same age?\nThere are few studies researching sound symbolism in bilingual children. A study of Pejovic and Molnar (2017) compared Spanish/Basque bilingual with Spanish monolingual children in their ability to match bouba to round shapes and kiki to angular shapes. They found no difference in 12 months old children. This makes sense, because neither of these children have more linguistic experience. In the age of 6-8 years, Chow and Ciaramitaro (2019) found in the Bouba-Kiki task, that there is an effect of the number of protrusions with the letter a. When bilingual children were excluded, the effect of 7 protrusions with the letter a was smaller, suggesting that bilingual children are still more sensitive to sound symbolism than monolingual children. Thom and Sandhofer (2013) did a sound label task with 18/24 months old children. They presented the children novel objects. In the training phase, they first placed a novel object in front of the child and it was able to play with the object. After some playing time, the experimenter labeled the object with a pseudo word (e.g. whoosh). After labeling the novel object the experimenter put it away and put a known object in front of the child to play with. After some playing time, the experimenter took the known object away and presented a second novel object the child was able to play with. Then, the experimenter took the object and showed it to the child in a similar way than the first object, but the experimenter didn\u2019t label the object. After, the experimenter put the 2nd novel object away and presented a known object the child could play with. This testing phase was repeated twice. After the 2nd time, the experimenter put 3 novel objects in front of the child to play with. One was the familiar labeled, one the familiar unlabeled and one an unfamiliar novel object. After some playing time the experimenter asked the child to hand over the labeled object (can you give me the whoosh?). Thom &amp; Sandhofer (2013) found out that older bilingual children performed the same as younger children, but monolingual older children performed worse than the other groups.\nA possible explanation for this finding is that the sensitivity to sound symbolism decreases with the amount of words children know, as proposed by Imai &amp; Kita (2014). There is some evidence that bilingual children are more sensitive to sound symbolism than monolingual children, but there are few studies researching this. It is as well not clear whether bilingual children lose the broad sensitivity to sound symbolism or whether they lose it later than monolingual children. So, my research question is the following: Are bilingual children more sensitive to sound symbolism than monolingual children are? There are effects for 24 Months old children, but no study compared monolinguals and bilinguals by the age of 36 months. In my study, I research the difference of monolingual and bilingual children in their sensitivity to sound symbolic cues in language. When I find a higher sensitivity of bilingual vs monolingual 36 months old children to sound symbolism, this supports the sound symbolic bootstrapping hypothesis, namely that bilingual children don\u2019t lose the broad sensitivity to sound symbolism as they know less words in one language. When I find the same sensitivity to sound symbolism of bilingual vs. monolingual children to sound symbolism, this would not support the sound symbolic bootstrapping hypothesis, or it would mean that bilingual children caught up with their vocabulary size and don\u2019t use more sound symbolic cues for language learning than monolingual children.", "q4": "1.\tBilingual 36 months old children can learn sound symbolic words better in a sound label task than monolingual children. Bilingual children should perform better because they know less words in one language (Bialystok, Luk, Peets, &amp; Yang, 2009) and still use sound symbolic cues to learn new words (Perry et al., 2015). With this task I measure children\u2019s ability to learn new sound symbolic words.\n2.\tBilingual 36 months old children can match sound symbolic words from Ewe, Japanese, Korean, Siwu and Semai to images better than monolingual children. Bilingual children should perform better because they know less words in one language (Bialystok et al., 2009) and still use sound symbolic cues to learn new words (Perry et al., 2015). With this task I measure the sensitivity of children to detect sound symbolic cues from foreign languages.\n3.\tMonolingual 36 months old children show greater accuracy in the bouba-kiki phenomenon than monolingual children in the kiki-subtask,and monolingual and bilingual children perform the same in the bouba-subtask. Monolingual children should perform better in the kiki-subtask because of their increased language proficiency and because the sensitivity to this phenomen increases with language proficiency (Fort et al. 2018). Monolingual and bilingual children should perform the same in the bouba-subtask, because the bouba-subtask is easier and is learned earlier (Fort et al. 2018)\n4.\tMonolingual and bilingual 36 months old children perform the same in all three tasks.

They receive the questionnaire for onomatopoeic words and exposure to round/spiky objects sent by e-mail to fill out before the appointment in the lab. When they arrive in the lab, I play with the child that it gets to know me and I instruct the parent(s) what is going to happen the next hour. I give the parent(s) the language exposure questionnaire to fill out during the testing of their child. To get the child interested, I tell a story of an alien, which needs to land on earth because its space ship is broken. For the Alien being able to communicate, both the monolingual and bilingual children hear words in Swiss German and need to show the alien the correct object (this is the Bilex in swiss german). Then, I inform the child that the alien landed at the other side of the world. It needs again the help of the child to understand the language spoken there. Then the child does the guess translation task. After this task, I tell the child that the Alien brought some things with it and wants to show them to the child. The Alien labels the objects (sound label task) and asks for one of the shown objects. After finishing this task, I tell the child that the alien gave me a recording of things it needs to repair its ship, but I have no clue what the Alien means. The child needs to help me, which object of the two it needs (bouba-kiki task).

Then, I show them the novel object and label it 3 times with a Japanese adjective (e.g. omoi; engl. heavy). After labelling it I take it away and present the children a known object with which they can play for 15 seconds. After that, I put the known object away and show the children another novel object with the opposite characteristic (e.g. heavy vs. light). They can play again with it for 15 seconds and after I take it in my hand and show it to them. I do the exact same thing as with the labelled object, but I don\u2019t label it. I say for example: this is like this, this is cool, \u2026 After, I put it away and present the children again a familiar object they can play with for 15 seconds. This is the training phase. After the training phase, I show the children 3 objects. Two of them they are familiar with, and one they are not familiar with. The one they are not familiar with is in the middle of the two extremes (e.g. between heavy and light). After 30 seconds of playing with the objects, I ask the children: can you give me the one that is \u201comoi\u201d? There are match trials, where the translation of the labeled word is correct, and there are non-match trials, where I label the antonym (e.g. object: soft, label: hard). I do 4 of these trials per child (trial number 1-4), two match and two mismatch trials and with that I measure whether children can learn new sound symbolic foreign words. The coding is as follows: When children give me the labelled object, they receive 2 points, when they give me the unlabeled known object or the unknown object they receive 0 points.\n2.\tBouba-Kiki task: Children see each time 2 different figures (De Carolis et al., 2016) in 1 color (this varies between blue, green and red). Then they hear a sound and I ask them to press on the figure they think matches better. I present them 4 different bouba type sounds (bamu, bouba, goga, mabuma) and 4 different kiki-type sounds (kuhtej, kejkee, teetay, tuhkeetee) (sounds from Tzeng, Nygard &amp; Nami, 2017). I present each sound twice, once by a female voice and once by a male voice.  This results in 16 trials per child (trial number 1-16). With this task I measure the ability of children to match pseudowords and shapes. I score this task as follows: For chosing the round shape when children heard a bouba-type sound, they receive 1 point, and for choosing the angular shape when hearing a bouba-type sound they receive 0 points. For choosing the angular shape when presenting a kiki-type sound, children receive 1 point and for choosing the round shape when presenting a kiki-type sounds they receive 0 points.\n3.\tGuess translation task: I present the children 10 (trial number 1-10) slides, where on each slide are 6 different images. The three images on the left side belong to a category and the three images of the right side belong to a category. On each slide I play a sound from a foreign language suiting to one of the 2 categories and ask the children which category the children think the word suits. The sounds are from the languages Ewe, Japanese, Korean, Siwu and Semai (Dingemanse et al. 2016). I created 34 categories in advance and validated these categories by adults to get the 20 easiest recognizable categories. With the guess translations task, I measure the sensitivity of children to detect sound symbolic cues from other languages. I hypothesize that bilingual children perform better in this task than monolingual children. I code this task as follows: For choosing the correct category, children get 1 point and for choosing the incorrect category children receive 0 points.\n4.\tBilex: The Bilex contains 48 trials on 12 different picture cards. Each card shows 6 objects, having 4 targets and 2 distractors. These distractors have an age of acquisition between 3.8 and 6.5 years. Each picture card is shown 4 times, and every time one of the 4 targets is labeled. Every time the same picture card is shown, the 6 objects on it change their position. There are as well 2 different orders of trials, one Swiss German order and 1 other language order, that the children cannot learn the order because they do this task twice in my study. With the Bilex, I control for the vocabulary size in children. For coding the bilex, the child gets 1 point for picking the target object and 0 points for picking any of the other 5 objects.\n5.\tQuestionnaire for onomatopoeia. In this questionnaire, the parents of the children are asked about the amount of onomatopoeic words children use in their language. The questionnaire contains the following questions: How does your child label this animal/object? Then, they see an image of an animal/object and are asked to type in the animal/object name and the respective sound. When they are bilingual, they should fill in both names and both sounds, when they are monolingual they should only type in the Swiss German name and sound. Next to these four text fields there are four additional textfields where the parents can fill in the amount of time their child uses this expression. Taken together, these four textfields need to sum up to 100. With this task, I control for the use of onomatopoeic words in the language of children. I calculate the average of onomatopoeic words the children use in %.\n6.\tNumber of languages children learn, scored as language group 1 or 2 (1 = monolingual, 2 = bilingual)\n7.\tParental highest education of father and mother.

The questions are the following: How many round objects are there in your household (very few, a few, middle, many, a lot of)? How many spiky objects are there in your household (very few, a few, middle, many, a lot of)? How many spiky compared to round object does your child see at average?\n9.\tLanguage exposure questionnaire: When the parents are in the lab, they are asked to fill out a questionnaire. In this questionnaire, they will write down every caregiver of their child, which language this caregiver talks and how much time the caregiver spends with the child during the week.

explore how different forms of presenting information (described or experienced information) to decision makers affect their confidence in choice and confidence in the realiability/trustworthiness of the information.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDecision makers use estimates of the reliability of the information they encounter to make a decision under uncertainty (Aitchison et al. 2015). For example, a manager will wait until the information she consults is deemed sufficiently reliable and trustworthy to make an important strategic decision. These perceptions of the reliability of the information they use can be communicated to third parties to reflect confidence in their beliefs or opinions, which can be useful in group discussions or leadership roles. \nThe information used by decision makers to make a choice can typically be accessed in two broad ways: either it is access through their own experience (a sample of previously encountered choices) or through convenient descriptions of the probabilities and outcomes of the choice problem.\nIn this study, we ask whether the source of information (experience or convenient descriptions) affects decision makers\u2019 confidence level.

Yet, these changes in confidence have not been compared to other ways of learning about a task (e.g. descriptions of risky choices).
