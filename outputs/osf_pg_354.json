Instead, they are significantly more likely to oppose free trade agreements and immigration, even when controlling for standard explanations for these attitudes. The survey experiments outlined in the document seek to understand if and how information affects blame attribution and preferences toward government policies that aim at responding to globalization and automation-related labor market shocks.

Instead, they are significantly more likely to oppose free trade agreements and immigration, even when controlling for standard explanations for these attitudes.

This set-up generates a conjoint experiment embedded in a two-by-two treatment design (see attachment): \u00a0 Table 1: 2x2 treatment design embedded in the introductory text preceding the conjoint table \u00a0 \u00a0 Immigration Taxation/Spending No party discipline prime Parliament voted on a bill that would affect the levels of immigration. People have different opinions about what their Member of Parliament should do Parliament voted on a bill that would affect the levels of taxes and government spending. People have different opinions about what their Member of Parliament should do Party discipline prime Parliament voted on a bill that would affect the levels of immigration. People have different opinions about what their Member of Parliament should do, but usually MPs support the position of their party Parliament voted on a bill that would affect the levels of taxes and government spending. People have different opinions about what their Member of Parliament should do, but usually MPs support the position of their party \u00a0 Outcome measures are a feeling thermometer score (0-100) for each MP and vote choice between MP1 and MP2. Outcome measures are elicited after each of the six vignettes shown to each respondent.\u00a0", "q16": "Literature finds a preference for MPs who dissents against their party in legislative votes. We test three mechanism that explain such behavior by voters: H1: Voters appreciate rebellious activity when it suits public opinion. H2: Voters prefer rebellious MPs when their activity conforms with their constituents\u2019 preferences. H3: Voters value rebellious MPs because they push diverging ideas for the benefit of the party and not just help the party leadership to achieve its goals. We further will also evaluate existing claims in the literature about the moderating effect of various variables on voters\u2019 preference for a rebellious MP. - Whether the MP was pivotal in the legislative vote case presented to respondents - Whether the MP deviates in his/her position towards the center or the extreme - Whether the MP\u2019s vote was congruent or opposed to UKIPs\u2019 announced preference", "q17": "Estimating the effect of candidates' attributes such as rebellious activity on vote choice, we estimate the relative importance of one attribute assigned to the candidates over others.

Similarly, to assess H2, we compare the AMCE of rebellious activity on vote preference and feeling thermometer scores when the opinion of MP\u2019s constituent aligns with the MP\u2019s vote to when it does not.

The location is the CoreCivic\u2019s Northeast Ohio Correctional Center in Youngstown, Ohio. Through our partnership with IIA, we are randomly assigning subjects to two groups: 1) those receiving pro-bono legal assistance with their parole application; and. 2) those without legal assistance in applying for parole. IIA attorneys present potential subjects with a consent form explaining the nature of the research project.^1 IIA passes the individual\u2019s name and case number to researchers who use a random number generator to determine group assignment. A random number generator, with 50/50 odds, assigns the individual to one of two groups: Group 1: The individual receives a pro-bono attorney to assist the asylee with a parole application. Group 2: The individual is assigned to the non-attorney group and receives a $40 commissary card. The commissary card can be used to make phone calls, which can help the applicant collect evidence for a parole petition. Group 2 is also provided a list of local immigration legal-aid groups. Due to recent changes in federal policy, ICE is required by law to issue a parole determination for everyone, even if they specifically do not put forward a formal petition. We have access to the determinations through the IIA attorneys for Group 1 and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for Group 2. Exactly 30 days after we have reached our targeted in-take (30 signed consent forms for both groups) we will begin our follow-up check-ins for Group 2, which allows us to determine if any of these individuals obtained legal aid aside from IIA (potential crossover influence).^2 It is also at this time we will intend to FOIA ICE for the 30 Group 2 determinations.^3 Researchers use the notification documents to create our two outcome measures and compare parole determinations and the time it took to receive them across the two levels. The results, we believe, will demonstrate that receiving legal assistance will increase the likelihood of 1) a successful parole application; and, 2) reducing the time for ICE to issue the determination. Because the ICE parole determination contains an \u201cissued\u201d date and we know exactly when each subject was originally detained at Youngstown by our initial meeting and consent form, we will know exactly the number of days the individual waited for a parole determination from ICE (our second dependent variable). We will begin contacting individuals for the in-depth semi-structured interviews 30 days after our targeted in-take goal. We intend to conduct 20 interviews with subjects (10 for each group) and interviews with the legal staff at IIA. Our inquiry into the effects of representation goes beyond focusing solely on the effect it exerts on the outcome of the parole hearings. These interviews provide a holistic understanding of how representation provides immigrants with agency to exercise their rights and alleviates marginalization within legal proceedings.

Additionally, the interviews provide a way to explore best practices for immigrant-serving nonprofits from both the perspective of the organizational representative and the client.

Once all interviews have been completed and transcribed, we will use a theoretical thematic analysis that focuses on detecting trends across interviews.

Please note that we have divergent hypotheses based on two underlying mechanisms we consider: backfire and trusting: - Those who are exposed to propaganda from public media are more or less likely to worsen their attitudes towards media and the government than those in the control group. - Those who are exposed to propaganda from left-leaning private media are more or less likely to worsen their attitudes towards the media and the government than those in the control group. - Those who are exposed to propaganda from right-leaning private media are more or less likely to hold similar attitudes towards the media and the government as those in the control group. - The above-mentioned treatment effects are larger for those whose perception about each media matches the societal perception than those whose view does not match. - Those who are high in social dominance orientation may tend to endorse propaganda and they are thus more likely to experience the trusting mechanism than those who are low in social dominance orientation."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "To test the hypotheses, we conduct a survey in Japan in August 2019. We employ a vignette experiment in which we randomize two components: 1) propaganda and 2) types of media. As for dependent variables, we consider three sets of variables: 1) evaluation of the government and its policies; 2) evaluation of media; and 3) behavioral questions.

Since there is an overlap of class and race in Mexico, with darker-skinned voters overrepresented at lower socioeconomic positions, when the ideological agendas of parties cater to certain social classes and further the assortment of class and parties, indirectly they enhance the sorting of skin-tones and parties.

In-group identification bias: skin tone can be a cue for in-group identification. Hence, we expect people to perceive alike-looking candidates as more representative of their social group. Therefore, if skin colors are important cues in the Mexican contest, we expect that people will prefer closer-looking candidates. 3. Ideological bias: race not being a salient dimension in Mexican political agenda, we have no reason to believe that ideology per se accounts for differences in support derived from treatment. 4. In-group ideological awakening: Our main hypothesis is that in-group bias is moderated by ideology. Since there is an overlap of class and race in Mexico, with darker-skinned voters overrepresented at lower socioeconomic positions, when the ideological agendas of parties cater to certain social classes and further the assortment of class and parties, indirectly they enhance the sorting of skin-tones and parties. Thus, we expect voters to have heterogeneous skin color-based preferences that is conditional on their ideological inclinations and is rooted in their race identity.", "q17": "Our experiment relies on survey-data on political preferences of Twitter users, as well as many relevant covariates. In particular, we ask about participants\u2019 attitude towards the candidates for Mexico City Mayor and to rank them according to certain attributes. Having randomized our treatment -a lighter/darker picture of one of the candidates-, we can compare the average answers between treatments to measure whether changing skin color of candidates modifies people\u2019s opinions in the ways described in the hypothesis section.", "q18": "Mexico", "q19": "approx. 2000", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "IRB-FY2018-1867 (NYU) #10631
