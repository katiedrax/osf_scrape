Discrepancies between low- and high-SES families in the quantity of language input may be as high as 30 million word tokens heard by a child over the first three years of life (Hart &amp; Risley, 1995). Such diminished quantity of speech heard by children directly impedes their early language development (Hart &amp; Risley, 1995) and has lasting consequences for their subsequent school outcomes (Hart &amp; Risley, 2003). However, since many Polish toddlers spend most of their waking time outside of home, in kindergartens or day cares, it is difficult to extract the influence of family SES on their development. Such opportunity came with the spread of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the general lockdown in Poland, which forced all the children to stay at home with the parents. In the present study we investigate home activities and parental interactions with 8-36 month-old infants and toddlers in families with various SES background. We compare children\u2019s early vocabulary knowledge at the beginning of lockdown and after the kindergartens are re-opened.

The control conditions involve giving no additional information to participants."}, "hypothesis": {"extra": [], "value": "The study examines whether a group self-affirmation manipulation could mitigate the tendency for high identifiers to backlash against alcohol norm information that suggests low alcohol consumption is the ingroup norm. Self-affirmation theory suggests that one way to reduce resistance to information that threatens a valued aspect of the self is to affirm an alternative aspect of the self (Sherman &amp; Cohen, 2002, 2006). When the self has been affirmed in this manner, people have been found to be more receptive to challenging information (Sherman et al., 2000), and to more readily adapt their beliefs and behaviour. Group self-affirmation refers to this process as it occurs for social identities (Badea, Binning, Verlhiac, &amp; Sherman, 2018; Ehrlich &amp; Gramzow, 2015; Sherman, Kinias, Major, Kim, &amp; Prenovost, 2007): group members should be less resistant to information that challenges a valued aspect of ingroup identity when their social identity has been affirmed (an idea similar to social creativity as an identity management strategy; Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979). While the relevance of self-affirmation to alcohol interventions has been established (see Ehret, LaBrie, Santerre, &amp; Sherman, 2015, for a review), the evidence thus far has focused on individual-level identities. This leaves open the question of whether group self-affirmation can reduce resistance to group-focused alcohol interventions such as social marketing approaches that seek to correct descriptive group norms about alcohol consumption.\n\nTo test this, the study will have a 2 X 2 between-participants design in which ingroup alcohol norm information (low or control) and group self affirmation (affirmed/ethical identity vs control) are orthogonally manipulated. The main questionnaire will measure their reported typical and intended alcohol consumption. In a follow-up questionnaire administered seven days later, we will measure through self report their actual alcohol consumption behaviour in the seven days since the main part of the study. In line with previous studies that have tested the social identity model of resistance to norm information, we also included participants\u2019 ingroup identification, individual-level attitude to heavy alcohol consumption, and typical weekly alcohol consumption in the model tested in each study.\n\nIn terms of hypotheses, we expect that the effect of norm information on intended and actual consumption will depend on the group affirmation manipulation, ingroup identification, and typical alcohol consumption/attitude towards alcohol consumption.\nSpecifically, when ingroup identification is high and typical consumption is high, the effect of the norm information manipulation will be different depending on the self-affirmation condition. In the control self-affirmation condition, we expect to see resistance to the norm information in terms of no, or even a reversed effect of the norm information (i.e., higher intentions and consumption reported in the low norm condition compared to the control). In contrast, we expect intentions and consumption to align more with the norm information in the group self-affirmation condition (i.e., lower intentions and consumption in the low norm condition compared to the control condition). We also intend to test this hypothesis in an alternative model with attitude towards alcohol substituted in for typical consumption, with a similar predicted pattern.\n"}, "study_type": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment"}, "study_type_other": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"data": "No, no data have been collected for this study yet.", "name": "Does group self-affirmation reduce high-identifiers\u2019 resistance to alcohol norm information?", "other": "", "sample": "The primary determinant of sample size will be resources in terms of time and available incentives.

Do you think this was a typical week for you? \nYes/No; \nIf you answered no to the previous question, did you consume more or less units than you would in a typical week?\nYes/No\n", "conditions": "Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the four conditions. The study has a 2 (alcohol/drinking norm: low vs control ) X 2(group self-affirmation: ethical identity vs control) between-participants design. The control conditions involve giving no additional information to participants.", "hypothesis": "The study examines whether a group self-affirmation manipulation could mitigate the tendency for high identifiers to backlash against alcohol norm information that suggests low alcohol consumption is the ingroup norm. Self-affirmation theory suggests that one way to reduce resistance to information that threatens a valued aspect of the self is to affirm an alternative aspect of the self (Sherman &amp; Cohen, 2002, 2006). When the self has been affirmed in this manner, people have been found to be more receptive to challenging information (Sherman et al., 2000), and to more readily adapt their beliefs and behaviour. Group self-affirmation refers to this process as it occurs for social identities (Badea, Binning, Verlhiac, &amp; Sherman, 2018; Ehrlich &amp; Gramzow, 2015; Sherman, Kinias, Major, Kim, &amp; Prenovost, 2007): group members should be less resistant to information that challenges a valued aspect of ingroup identity when their social identity has been affirmed (an idea similar to social creativity as an identity management strategy; Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979). While the relevance of self-affirmation to alcohol interventions has been established (see Ehret, LaBrie, Santerre, &amp; Sherman, 2015, for a review), the evidence thus far has focused on individual-level identities. This leaves open the question of whether group self-affirmation can reduce resistance to group-focused alcohol interventions such as social marketing approaches that seek to correct descriptive group norms about alcohol consumption.\n\nTo test this, the study will have a 2 X 2 between-participants design in which ingroup alcohol norm information (low or control) and group self affirmation (affirmed/ethical identity vs control) are orthogonally manipulated. The main questionnaire will measure their reported typical and intended alcohol consumption. In a follow-up questionnaire administered seven days later, we will measure through self report their actual alcohol consumption behaviour in the seven days since the main part of the study. In line with previous studies that have tested the social identity model of resistance to norm information, we also included participants\u2019 ingroup identification, individual-level attitude to heavy alcohol consumption, and typical weekly alcohol consumption in the model tested in each study.\n\nIn terms of hypotheses, we expect that the effect of norm information on intended and actual consumption will depend on the group affirmation manipulation, ingroup identification, and typical alcohol consumption/attitude towards alcohol consumption.\nSpecifically, when ingroup identification is high and typical consumption is high, the effect of the norm information manipulation will be different depending on the self-affirmation condition. In the control self-affirmation condition, we expect to see resistance to the norm information in terms of no, or even a reversed effect of the norm information (i.e., higher intentions and consumption reported in the low norm condition compared to the control). In contrast, we expect intentions and consumption to align more with the norm information in the group self-affirmation condition (i.e., lower intentions and consumption in the low norm condition compared to the control condition). We also intend to test this hypothesis in an alternative model with attitude towards alcohol substituted in for typical consumption, with a similar predicted pattern.\n", "study_type": "Experiment"},

A rising prevalence of depression and anxiety among adolescents in the U.S., with approximately 22% with severe impairments (Bose, 2017; NIMH, 2019), has evoked growing concerns around causes for this rise, especially considering the digital age. Adolescents are the largest adopters of technology, with approximately 95% having access to a mobile device, 71% using one or more social media platforms, and 45% claiming to be online \u201calmost constantly\u201d (Pew Research Center, 2018). While many studies have shown associations between screen time and poor mental health outcomes (K\u0131rcaburun et al., 2018; Lemola et al., 2015; McBride, 2017; Sampasa-Kanyinga &amp; Lewis, 2015; Stiglic &amp; Viner, 2019; Twenge &amp; Campbell, 2018; Twenge et al., 2018), recent reviews of the literature show mixed and inconsistencies in these findings (Best et al., 2014; Odgers, 2018; Rideout, 2018; Sarmiento et al., 2018; Wartella et al., 2016). \n\nA recent rigorous analysis of large-scale datasets by Orben and Przybylski (2019) revealed associations between screen time and wellbeing in adolescents suggesting small effects sizes which can be comparable to many other possible and unrelated correlates to mental health outcomes in adolescents. This posits a greater consideration that must be made in statistical inferences in efforts to address the complex nature in the rise of internalizing behaviors such as depressive and anxiety symptoms in youth. \n\nMany established lines of research investigating predictors, beyond individual factors such as screen time (Odgers, 2018) and cognitive functioning (Shortt &amp; Spence, 2006), to poor mental health outcomes in adolescents include family (Sander &amp; McCarty, 2005) and peer factors (Garland &amp; Fitzgerald, 1998; MacPhee &amp; Andrews, 2006), school functioning (Juvonen et al., 2000; Fr\u00f6jd et al., 2008), neighborhood (Aneshensel &amp; Sucoff, 1996) and community factors (Huynh &amp; Fuligni, 2010). This multi-level perspective echoes the social ecological framework (Bronfenbrenner &amp; Morris, 2006; Stokols, 2018), which recognizes the interplay of the various ecologies, proximal and distal to the individual, on mental health during this developmental period. The objective of this study is to investigate the social ecological factors associated with adolescent mental health in the digital age. Using a multimodal baseline dataset from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (Volkow et al., 2017), we will be able to characterize correlates to mental health outcomes of a diverse U.S. adolescent cohort, inclusive of the various ecological factors. The aims of this study are threefold: (1) to evaluate the associations between screen time and internalizing behaviors, (2) to evaluate the associations between multi-level ecological factors previously identified as risk factors for increases in internalizing behaviors among adolescents, and (3) explore differences in these associations stratified by socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-10T19:50:49.064437", "date_modified": "2020-04-10T19:29:18.196967", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["Adolescent Mental Health", "Digital Age", "Social Ecological Model"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["J.
