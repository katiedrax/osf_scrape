Hypotheses are presented for both alternatives. If both are true and cancel each other out, then no differences will be observed. \n\nVS may be more like VM (it includes an interviewer\u2019s moving face and speech) or more like TS (it is automated and self-administered). It could also fall in between or even lead to less satisficing than both if it has the best combination of VM-like and TS-like features. \nHypotheses are presented for all these alternatives.\n\nHypotheses 1.1: Satisficing in VM vs. TS\n\nH1.1.1 If respondents are more engaged and motivated by interacting with a live human in VM than they are in TS, then they should satisfice less--produce more precise (fewer rounded) answers to numerical questions and differentiate answers to battery questions more (straightline less)--in VM than in TS.  This would be consistent with evidence of less satisficing in face to face than TS interviews (Heerwegh et al., 2005).\n\nH1.1.2 If respondents feel time pressure to respond quickly from interacting with a live human in VM, then they should satisfice more--produce less precise (more rounded) answers to numerical questions and less differentiated answers to battery questions (more straightlining)--in VM than in TS. \n\nHypotheses 1.2:  Satisficing in VS relative to VM and TS\n\nVS is a hybrid mode with content that is ephemeral though replayable (interviewer\u2019s face and voice, question content) and persistent (textual response options that appear after initial question reading finishes). Depending on whether participants experience VS more like VM (even though VM is not replayable) or more like TS (even though TS has only persistent content), different outcomes are plausible. \n\nH1.2.1 If recorded video of an interviewer provides as much social presence (and as much time pressure) as a live video-mediated interview, then the effects of VS on satisficing (whichever direction they end up going) should be the same (relative to TS) as of VM.\nH1.2.2 If recorded video of an interviewer provides as little social presence (and as little time pressure) as a purely textual self-administered interview, then the effects of VS on satisficing (whichever direction they end up going) should be the same (relative to VM) as of TS.\n\nH1.2.3 If recorded video of an interviewer provides an intermediate level of social presence with an interviewer (less than live video, but more than textual self-administration), then the effects of VS on satisficing (whichever direction they end up going) should fall in between those of VM and TS.\n\nH1.2.4 If recorded video of an interviewer provides the benefits of social presence without the time pressure of human interviewing, then VS will have less satisficing than both VM and TS (regardless of how VM and TS compare).\n\nH1.3 Satisficing in VM vs. TS for older vs. younger participants\n\nMode effects on satisficing (whatever they turn out to be) could differ for older participants than for younger, if, for example, older participants find video connection particularly engaging or particularly off-putting, or if they feel conversational time pressure more or less acutely than younger participants. The fact that older participants have been shown to satisfice less (straightline and speed) than younger participants in TS surveys (Zhang &amp; Conrad, 2014) may suggest a general tendency to satisfice less (which would then be evident in less satisficing across all modes in this study), or it may be mode-specific.\n\nThe following hypotheses propose that there will be an interaction of age (&gt;= 65 years vs. &lt; 65 years) with the observed mode effects. Because the available sample of participants in our study is likely to be particularly familiar with online technologies and surveys (because of their prior participation in research recruited online), we do not focus on hypotheses based on generational differences in technology adoption.\n\nWhether these effects emerge depends on the proportion of participants in each subgroup who are affected in a particular direction. So we will see interactions with age if more or fewer older participants are affected in particular ways.\n\nThe following patterns are plausible based on previous literature on aging and self-reports (e.g., observations in Schwarz, Park, Knauper, &amp; Sudman, 1999) or on the research team\u2019s observations of technology usage:\n\nH1.3.1 Whatever the direction of VM-TS differences observed in the full sample, the effects will be more extreme for older respondents than for younger.  If VM leads to less satisficing than TS (because VM promotes greater engagement), the effect could be greater for older participants whom interviewers can support (as opposed to TS)--slowing down the interview if a participant has trouble understanding or speaking louder if a participant has trouble hearing, clarifying the task, encouraging conscientious responding, etc.  If VM leads to more satisficing than TS (because VM exacerbates time pressure to respond), the effect could be greater for older participants; they could feel the time pressure particularly acutely because they worry that they may be responding slower than others, or they might feel potential aging stigma from responding slowly. In either case, the prediction is that the VM-TS difference will be greater for older than younger respondents.\n\nH1.3.2 Whatever the direction of VM-TS differences observed in the full sample, the effects will be less extreme for older respondents than for younger. If VM leads to less satisficing than TS (because VM promotes greater engagement), the effect could be smaller for older participants because VM is less compelling and socially present for them than face to face contact, compared with younger participants who may be more comfortable with videomedated interaction.  If VM leads to more satisficing than TS (because VM exacerbates time pressure to respond), the effect could be smaller for older participants if they do not care as much about looking conversationally competent or speedy as younger participants, or if they do not recognize that they are slower. In either case, the prediction is that the VM-TS difference will be smaller for older than younger respondents.\n\nH1.3.3 If live interviewing differently affects older and younger respondents\u2019 satisficing (e.g., live interviewing benefits older respondents\u2019 engagement and motivation but the time pressure harms younger respondents\u2019 thoughtfulness--or, alternatively, time pressure harms older respondents\u2019 thoughtfulness but the engagement benefits younger respondents), then the pattern of differences between VM and TS will reverse for older vs. younger respondents.\n\nHypotheses 1.4:  Satisficing in VS relative to VM and TS for older and younger respondents\nVS is a hybrid mode with content that is ephemeral though replayable (interviewer\u2019s face and voice, question content) and persistent (textual response options that appear after initial question reading finishes). Depending on how these different aspects of the mode affect older vs. younger participants, different outcomes are plausible. \n\nH1.4.1 Whatever the direction of VM/VS-TS differences observed in the full sample, the effects will be more extreme for older respondents than for younger.  If VM and VS lead to less satisficing than TS in the full sample (because VM and VS both promote greater engagement), the effect could be greater for older participants because the VM and VS moving, speaking interviewer encourages their conscientious responding more than for younger respondents.  If VM and VS lead to more satisficing than TS in the full sample (because the moving, speaking interviewer exacerbates time pressure to respond), the effect could be greater for older participants; they could feel the time pressure particularly acutely because they worry that they may be responding slower than others, or they might feel potential aging stigma from responding slowly. In either case, the prediction is that the VM/VS-TS difference will be greater for older than younger respondents.\n\nH1.4.2 Whatever the direction of VM/VS-TS differences observed in the full sample, the effects will be less extreme for older respondents than for younger.  If VM and VS lead to less satisficing than TS in the full sample (because VM and VS both promote greater engagement), the effect could be smaller for older participants because they find both VM and VS less compelling and socially present for them than face to face contact, compared with younger participants who may be more comfortable with videomedated interaction and watching (and responding to) videos.  If VM and VS lead to more satisficing than TS in the full sample  (because the moving, speaking interviewer exacerbates time pressure to respond), the effect could be smaller for older participants (despite the on-screen persistence of the VS response options); they could feel the time pressure particularly acutely because they worry that they may be responding slower than others, or they might feel potential aging stigma from responding slowly. In either case, the prediction is that the VM/VS-TS difference will be smaller for older than younger respondents.\n\nMany (in fact, a combinatorial explosion) of other plausible patterns of how mode interacts with age group in predicting satisficing could potentially be enumerated. There are multiple ways in which older and younger participants\u2019 patterns of satisficing could reverse--either for one mode, two modes, or all three modes. Our analyses will explore what emerges; given how much is unknown about the basic patterns to be observed irrespective of age we will treat these analyses as exploratory. Given that speeding is also an indicator of satisficing, we will also be exploring age differences in speeding within mode.    \n\nHypotheses 2:  Disclosure \n\nLike face to face interviewing, VM interviewing is synchronous and likely involves greater social presence with an interviewer than TS.  \n\nHypothesis 2.1: Disclosure in VM vs. TS\n\nIf VM interviewing affects disclosure in the same way as face to face interviewing, participants should disclose more sensitive information in TS than VM interviews. \n\nHypotheses 2.2: Disclosure in VS relative to VM and TS\n\nThere are multiple logical possibilities of how levels of disclosure differ across these three modes (beyond the null hypothesis that they are all the same). The following are plausible relations based on prior evidence and theorizing.\n\nH2.2.1  If the moving face in VS (even though it is not live) creates as much social presence as in VM, there should be just as little disclosure in VS as VM, and more disclosure in TS: VM=VS TS and VM (whatever their relationship).\n\nH2.2.5  If VS brings the worst of both VM and TS modes--the social presence of a recorded interviewer inhibits disclosure and there is no rapport (as with a live interviewer) that could promote honest responding, then participants should disclose least in VS relative to TS and VM:  VS &lt; TS and VM (whatever their relationship).  \n\nH2.3: Disclosure in VM vs. TS for older vs. younger participants\n\nH2.3.1 If older participants are more skeptical or mistrusting of video-mediated interaction than younger participants, then VM-TS differences observed in the full sample will be more extreme for older participants than for younger--that is, older participants will disclose even less in VM (relative to TS) than will younger participants. \n\nH2.3.2 If older participants are more reassured by the social contact in video-mediated interaction than younger participants (and those more comfortable disclosing sensitive information), then VM-TS differences observed in the full sample will be less extreme for older respondents than for younger. \n\nHypotheses 2.4: Disclosure in the three modes for older vs. younger participants\nMany (in fact, a combinatorial explosion) plausible patterns of how mode interacts with age group in predicting disclosure could potentially be enumerated. Older participants\u2019 disclosure could be more affected by one or more of these modes than younger participants\u2019, it could be less affected, or the patterns could reverse. Our analyses will explore what emerges; given how much is unknown about the basic patterns to be observed irrespective of age we will treat these analyses as exploratory. \n\nHypotheses 2.5: Type of question sensitivity, mode, and disclosure\n\nItems used to test disclosure in this study were selected to allow comparison of types of question sensitivity that have not previously been distinguished. One new distinction (building on Feuer, Fail, &amp; Schober 2019) is between the sensitivity of the question itself (the topic) and the sensitivity of particular response options (not all answers are sensitive). A second new distinction concerns the likely prevalence of sensitive behaviors for a particular item; if the prevalence of sensitive behaviors is low, then few enough people have the potential to be affected in their disclosure by the interview mode that a mode effect on disclosure is unlikely (essentially a floor effect). But if a high proportion of participants have engaged in a sensitive behavior, the opportunity for a mode effect to emerge is greater. Items in the current study were rated by 100 online panelists to determine the sensitivity of each topic and response option, and likely prevalence of particular responses was calibrated from response distributions in the most recent available published reports of answers to these questions.\n\nUsing this method, in principle \u201csensitive items\u201d can be categorized as one of three types: (HH) Highly sensitive topic with likely high prevalence of sensitive answers, (HL) Highly sensitive topic with likely low prevalence of sensitive answers, or (LH) Low sensitivity topic with likely high prevalence of sensitive answers. The current study selected HH and LH items to test the following hypotheses. (For HH items, &gt; 40% of panelists had judged that most people would be somewhat or very uncomfortable to be asked the question; for LH items, &lt; 20% of panelists had judged that most people would be somewhat or very uncomfortable to be asked the question. All these items had high likely prevalence of sensitive answers, but they varied in their extremity).  \n\nThe factors tested in these hypotheses are independent (rated topic sensitivity, rated response sensitivity, and prior likelihood of a response based on published prevalence are three independent predictors of a particular response option being selected) but they could potentially interact in leading to mode effects. \n\nHypothesis 2.5.1 If topic sensitivity (independent of response sensitivity) is what leads to mode differences (the default assumption in most studies), then mode differences in disclosure (as tested in Hypotheses 2.1 and 2.2) will be greater for HH than LH items. \n\nHypothesis 2.5.2  If sensitivity of a reported behavior (rather than the usually assumed  topic sensitivity) is what leads to mode differences, then mode differences in disclosure (as tested in Hypotheses 2.1 and 2.2) will be greater for responses rated as more sensitive.\n\nHypothesis 2.5.3 If frequency of sensitive behaviors (rather than simply topic sensitivity) is what leads to mode differences in disclosure, then mode differences in disclosure (as tested in Hypotheses 2.1 and 2.2) should be greater for behaviors with greater prevalence (as reported in published studies)--independent of topic sensitivity. \n\nAdditional analyses will explore whether effects of type of question sensitivity differ for older vs. younger participants.\nHypotheses 3: Respondent subjective experience\n\nRespondents\u2019 subjective experience is measured by debriefing questions asked after the main interview. Additional exploratory analyses based on the debriefing questions will be carried out to test, for example, whether any mode differences in respondents\u2019 satisficing or levels of disclosure are associated with different levels of reported satisfaction or privacy in the interviews, or with reported technical difficulties.\n\nHypotheses 3.1: Satisfaction \n\nHypothesis 3.1.1: Satisfaction in VM vs. TS\n\nH3.1.1.1 If respondents are more engaged and motivated by interacting with a live human in VM than they are in TS, then they should report greater satisfaction in VM than TS interviews. \nH3.1.1.2 If respondents feel interacting with a live human in VM is more intrusive or burdensome than self-administering TS, then they should report less satisfaction in VM than TS interviews. \n\nHypothesis 3.1.2: Satisfaction in VS relative to VM and TS\n\nDepending on whether participants experience VS more like VM or more like TS, different outcomes are plausible. \n\nH3.1.2.1 If recorded video of an interviewer provides as much social presence as a live video-mediated interview, then the effects of VS on satisfaction (whichever direction they end up going) should be the same (relative to TS) as of VM.\n\nH3.1.2.2 If recorded video of an interviewer provides as little social presence as a purely textual self-administered interview, then the effects of VS on satisfaction (whichever direction they end up going) should be the same (relative to VM) as of TS.\n\nH3.1.2.3 If recorded video of an interviewer provides an intermediate level of social presence with an interviewer (less than live video, but more than textual self-administration), then the effects of VS on satisfaction (whichever direction they end up going) should fall in between those of VM and TS.\n\nH3.1.2.4 If recorded video of an interviewer provides the benefits of social presence without the intrusiveness of human interviewing, then VS will lead to greater satisfaction than both VM and TS (regardless of how VM and TS compare).\n\nH3.1.2.5 If recorded video of an interviewer is as intrusive as a human interviewer without the motivating engagement of the interviewer and without the privacy of self-administration, then VS will lead to less satisfaction than both VM and TS (regardless of how VM and TS compare).\n\nHypotheses 3.1.3 Satisfaction in VM vs. TS for older vs. younger respondents\n\nH3.1.3.1 Whatever the direction of VM-TS differences observed in the full sample, the effects will be more extreme for older respondents than for younger.  If VM leads to greater satisfaction than TS (because VM promotes greater engagement), the effect could be greater for older participants who particularly prefer the \u201chuman touch.\u201d  If VM leads to less satisfaction than TS (because VM feels more pressured or more technologically challenging), the effect could be greater for older participants. In either case, the prediction is that the VM-TS difference will be greater for older than younger respondents.\n\nH3.1.3.2 Whatever the direction of VM-TS differences observed in the full sample, the effects will be less extreme for older respondents than for younger.  If VM leads to less satisfaction than TS (because VM feels more pressured or more technologically challenging), the effect could be smaller for older participants who feel technologically challenged in any online survey--even with TS.  If VM leads to more satisfaction than TS (because VM promotes greater engagement), the effect could be smaller for older participants for whom VM\u2019s technological challenges outweigh social benefits. In either case, the prediction is that the VM-TS difference will be smaller for older than younger respondents.\n\nH3.1.3.3 If live interviewing differently affects older and younger respondents\u2019 satisfaction (e.g., live interviewing makes older respondents feel more motivated and engaged but feels intrusive to younger respondents, or live interviewing feels burdensome for older respondents but easy and pleasant for younger respondents), then the pattern of differences between VM and TS will go in opposite directions for older vs. younger respondents.\n\nHypotheses 3.1.4:  Satisfaction in VS relative to VM and TS for older and younger respondents\n\nH3.1.4.1 Whatever the direction of VM/VS-TS differences in satisfaction observed in the full sample, the effects will be more extreme for older respondents than for younger.  If VM and VS lead to greater satisfaction than TS in the full sample (because VM and VS both promote greater engagement), the effect could be greater for older participants because the VM and VS moving, speaking interviewer is more engaging and motivating for them than for younger respondents.  If VM and VS lead to less satisfaction than TS in the full sample (because the moving, speaking interviewer feels intrusive or exacerbates time pressure to respond, or the video technology is more challenging to navigate), the effect could be greater for older participants. In either case, the prediction is that the VM/VS-TS difference will be greater for older than younger respondents.\n\nH3.1.4.2 Whatever the direction of VM/VS-TS differences observed in the full sample, the effects will be less extreme for older respondents than for younger.  If VM and VS lead to greater satisfaction than TS in the full sample (because VM and VS both promote greater engagement), the effect could be smaller for older participants because they find both VM and VS less compelling and socially present for them than face to face contact, compared with younger participants who may be more comfortable with videomedated interaction and watching (and responding to) videos.  If VM and VS lead to less satisfaction than TS in the full sample  (because the moving, speaking interviewer exacerbates time pressure to respond or because the video technology is challenging), the effect could be smaller for older participants for whom the social benefits of video connection mitigate the downsides. In either case, the prediction is that the VM/VS-TS difference will be smaller for older than younger respondents.\n\nMany (in fact, a combinatorial explosion) of other plausible patterns of how mode interacts with age group in predicting satisfaction could potentially be enumerated. There are multiple ways in which older and younger participants\u2019 patterns of satisfaction could reverse--either for one mode, two modes, or all three modes. Our analyses will explore what emerges; given how much is unknown about the basic patterns to be observed irrespective of age we will treat these analyses as exploratory.  \n\nHypotheses 3.2  Comfort and personal connection\n\nH3.2.1 Comfort and personal connection in VM vs. VS\n\nH3.2.1.1 If respondents are more engaged and motivated by interacting with a live human in VM than they are viewing a recorded interviewer in VS, then they should report greater comfort and personal connection with the interviewer in VM than VS interviews. \n\nH3.2.1.2 If respondents feel interacting with a live human in VM is more intrusive or burdensome than viewing a recorded interviewer in VS, then they should report less comfort and personal connection with the interviewer in VM than VS interviews. \n\nH3.2.2 Comfort and personal connection in VM vs. VS for older and younger participants\n\nH3.2.2.1 Whatever the direction of VM-VS differences observed in the full sample, the effects will be more extreme for older respondents than for younger.  If VM leads to greater comfort and personal connection than VS (because VM promotes greater engagement), the effect could be greater for older participants who particularly prefer the \u201chuman touch.\u201d  If VM leads to less comfort and personal connection than VS (because VM feels more pressured or more technologically challenging), the effect could be greater for older participants. In either case, the prediction is that the VM-VS difference will be greater for older than younger respondents.\n\nH3.2.2.2 Whatever the direction of VM-VS differences observed in the full sample, the effects will be less extreme for older respondents than for younger.  If VM leads to less comfort and personal connection than VS (because VM feels more pressured or more technologically challenging), the effect could be smaller for older participants who feel technologically challenged in any online survey--even with VS.  If VM leads to more comfort and personal connection than VS (because VM promotes greater engagement), the effect could be smaller for older participants for whom VM\u2019s technological challenges outweigh social benefits. In either case, the prediction is that the VM-VS difference will be smaller for older than younger respondents.\n\nH3.2.2.3 If live interviewing differently affects older and younger respondents\u2019 comfort and personal connection  (e.g., live interviewing makes older respondents feel more motivated and engaged but feels intrusive to younger respondents, or live interviewing feels burdensome for older respondents but easy and pleasant for younger respondents), then the pattern of differences between VM and VS will go in opposite directions for older vs. younger respondents.\n\nHypothesis 3.3: Subjective honesty\n\nHypothesis 3.3.1: Subjective honesty in VM vs. TS\n\nIf VM interviewing affects disclosure in the same way as face to face interviewing, participants should report having been more honest in VM than TS interviews. (Reports of subjective honesty may or may not align completely with levels of disclosure). \nHypothesis 3.3.2: Subjective honesty in VS relative to VM and TS\nThere are multiple logical possibilities of how subjective honesty differs across these three modes (beyond the null hypothesis that they are all the same). The following are plausible relations based on prior evidence and theorizing.\n\nH3.3.2.1  If the moving face in VS (even though it is not live) creates as much social presence as in VM, participants should report having been as little honest in VS as VM, and more honest in TS: VM=VS TS and VM (whatever their relationship).\n\nH3.3.2.5  If VS brings the worst of both VM and TS modes--the social presence of a recorded interviewer inhibits disclosure and there is no rapport (as with a live interviewer) that could promote honest responding, then participants should report having been least honest in VS relative to TS and VM:  VS &lt; TS and VM (whatever their relationship).  \n\nHypothesis 3.3.3: Subjective honesty in the different modes for older vs. younger respondents\n\nMany (in fact, a combinatorial explosion) of plausible patterns of how mode interacts with age group in predicting subjective honesty could potentially be enumerated. Older participants\u2019 subjective honesty could be more affected by one or more of these modes than younger participants\u2019, it could be less affected, or the patterns could reverse. Our analyses will explore what emerges; given how much is unknown about the basic patterns to be observed irrespective of age we will treat these analyses as exploratory.  \n\nHypothesis 3.4: Subjective privacy compared to face to face interview\n\nHypothesis 3.4.1: Subjective privacy in VM vs. TS\n\nBecause VM interviews involve a live human interviewer, participants should report that VM interviews feel less private (relative to face to face interviews) than TS interviews. \nHypothesis 3.4.2: Subjective privacy in VS relative to VM and TS\n\nH3.4.2.1  If the moving face in VS (even though it is not live) creates as much social presence as in VM, participants should report that (relative to face to face) VS feels as public (non-private) as VM, and less private that TS : VM=VS= VS  &gt; TS.\n\nH3.5.3 If the fact that in VS interviews nearby others cannot hear the responses determines how participants feel about how nearby others affected answers, then participants in VS interviews will report having been affected by nearby others less than in VM interviews, and potentially as little as in TS interviews:  VM &gt; VS &gt;= TS.\n\nHypotheses 3.6: Perceived question sensitivity\n\nH3.6.1: Perceived question sensitivity in VM vs. TS\n\nBecause VM interviews involve a live potentially judgmental human interviewer, participants should report that questions in VM interviews felt more sensitive than questions in TS interviews. \n\nH3.6.2: Perceived question sensitivity in VS relative to VM and TS\n\nH3.6.2.1 If the interviewer\u2019s moving face and audible questions reading is what affects participants\u2019 feelings about the questions\u2019 sensitivity, then participants in VS interviews will rate the questions as more sensitive than participants in TS interviews do, and potentially as much as in VM: VM &gt;= VS  &gt; TS.\n\nH3.6.2.2 If the self-administration of responses in VS interviews is what affects participants' feelings about the questions\u2019 sensitivity, then participants in VS interviews will rate the questions as less sensitive than participants in VM interviews do, and potentially as non-sensitive as in TS interviews:  VM &gt; VS &gt;= TS.\n\nHypotheses 4:  Interviewer effects in VM and VS\n\nWhen interviewers are involved in data collection, survey responses collected by the same interviewer may be correlated, due to observable interviewer characteristics and interviewer actions during the data collection. This results in variance of estimates between interviewers, which is an undesirable byproduct of the data collection process. These within-interviewer correlations (i.e., between-interviewer variance components) inflate the variances of descriptive survey estimates. \n\nThe design of the study allows focused testing of hypotheses about interviewer effects across modes because the VS interviews use recordings of the very same interviewers who administer the VM interviews. Differences in interviewer effects across modes thus can\u2019t be because the VM and VS interviewers differ in their characteristics or (broadly) behaviors (although VM interviewers can adjust and tailor their behaviors for particular respondents, while VS recordings are identical in every administration).\n\nH4.1 Because interviewer behavior (question reading, nonverbal reactions that might convey judgment) can vary more in VM than VS, individual interviewers will affect response distributions and the measures of data quality tested in Hypotheses 1 and 2 more in VM than VS. (Average ICC--that is, summarized over questions--will be higher in VM than VS).\n\nH4.2 Because VM interviewers can adjust their style, speed and responsivity to individual respondent needs (increasing within-interviewer variability relative to the fixed behaviors interviewers display in VS), individual interviewers will affect response distributions and the measures of data quality tested in Hypotheses 1 and 2 more in VS than in VM.  That is, differences between interviewers may be amplified in VS because exactly the same differences between interviewers occur in all interviews and thus cannot be mitigated.\n"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

This included selecting two different kinds of sensitive questions that allow us to compare whether the effects on disclosure are the same for both kinds of questions, and using three different batteries of questions that allow us to test whether mode affects straightlining similarly for multiple batteries."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": "Assignment to Mode:\n\nPotential respondents recruited from the CloudResearch online panel were randomized to one of three modes (VM, VS or TS) blocked by age, gender, race, and education (see Sample Size description). Due to the expected difference in response rates by mode (we expect VM to have the lowest response rate), panel members were randomly assigned to VM at a higher rate (VM:VS:TS = 60:20:20). Once VS and TS were completed, all remaining potential respondents were assigned to VM. This randomization was done by CloudResearch (TurkPrime) prior to the respondents answering any survey questions.\n\nParticipants recruited through MICHR were assigned to experimental conditions strategically (not randomly), filling the demographic quotas that the CloudResearch VM recruitment had not filled, and adding additional participants to the VS and TS conditions so that both CloudResearch and MICHR recruitment sources would be represented in all conditions in the final data set. Because demographic balance in VS and TS was good coming out of CloudResearch we will randomly assign remaining MICHR cases (determined by remaining budget) to VS and TS. \n\nParticipants recruited via ABS were randomized to one of the three modes (VM, VS, or TS). Due to the expected difference in response rates by mode (we expect VM to have the lowest response rate), twice as many addresses were sent invitations to participate in VM than were sent invitations to participate in VS and TS (VM:VS:TS = 50:25:25). \n\nAssignment to Interviewer:\n\nIn VS, respondents were randomly assigned to recorded video interviewers using blocking by interviewer. Interviewer names were repeatedly randomized in sets of 10 (the number of interviewers selected at the beginning of the project) and the interviewer assignment was made by pulling the next name in the table. Each respondent is assigned to one recorded interviewer.\n\nFully random assignment of respondents to interviewers in VM proved not to be feasible logistically because of limitations from interviewer schedules; completing the cases in the VM condition required relaxing the constraint of random assignment to allow respondents to select interview times from the full set of available interviewer slots rather than from the interviewer to whom they had been assigned under the initial randomization scheme. Any resulting socio-demographic imbalances of respondents across interviewers will be accounted for analytically as outlined in the Analysis Plan section. Where appropriate, all analyses will directly address clustering by interviewers.\n\nFor CloudResearch respondents assigned to VM in the first three replicates (see Data Collection Procedures), random assignment to interviewer was also done using blocking by interviewer. When respondents scheduled an interview appointment, they only saw the availability of the interviewer to whom they were assigned, thus limiting the windows in which they could schedule appointments. For additional respondents assigned to VM to be recruited by CloudResearch, a strategic (non-random) approach to interviewer assignment will be adopted so as to minimize socio-demographic imbalances of respondents across interviewers in the final data set.   \n\nMICHR participants were offered all available interview times from all interviewers, but at the time of scheduling they were blind to which time slots belonged to which interviewers. To balance distribution of respondents to interviewers, quotas were implemented that routed respondents of certain demographic backgrounds (information obtained from the screener) only to groups of interviewers from whom these respondent attributes were underrepresented. These participants were also blind to the identities of interviewers in those groups until after scheduling their appointments. \n"}, "q8": {"extra": [], "value": "Registration prior to creation of data"}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": "As of the moment of preregistration, much of the TS and VS data collection has been completed.

Not all of the measures will be computed at all three levels. Table 2 in the attached document (preregistration_tables.docx) summarizes which measures are computed at these levels. \n\nThe description of the variables measured will be organized by the hypotheses they will be used to test in the following sections. \n\nHypothesis 1: Satisficing\n\nOutcome measures: Straightlining, rounding and speeding\n\na. Straightlining\n\nWhen respondents straightline, they select the same response for multiple questions that use the same response scale in a row (e.g., selecting \u201cStrongly agree\u201d for five questions in a row). In general, variation in responses to questions with the same response scale is considered evidence of more conscientious responding and better data quality.\nThis study uses three batteries of questions to allow measurement of straightlining, on the topics of diet, materialism, and sports. In each battery the response options are the same for each item. For example, in the diet battery the items are these:  \n\nNow we'd like to ask you some questions specific to your diet. How much do you favor or oppose engaging in...\nAvoiding \"fast food\"?\nMaintaining a healthy diet?\nMonitoring cholesterol levels closely?\nEmphasizing the taste of food rather than its nutritional value?\nPaying close attention to the nutritional information on food packaging?\nLimiting the amount of red meat in your diet?\nBalancing one's diet across the key food groups?\n\nFor all items the response options are: Strongly agree, somewhat agree, neither agree nor disagree, somewhat disagree, or strongly disagree.\n\nThe diet battery (7 questions) and the sports battery (4 questions) include items keyed in the opposite direction (reverse wording), while items in the materialism battery (6 questions) are all worded in the same direction.\n\nStraightlining will be measured in the following ways, reflecting more and less stringent definitions:  \n\nStraightlining: A respondent is considered to have straightlined if they chose the same response for all items in a battery. This is a binary variable, where 1 indicates the presence of straightlining and 0 indicates the absence of straightlining. This is measured at the item battery level. \n\nNear straightlining: A respondent is considered to have straightlined if they chose the same response for all but one item in any one of the three batteries. (For this measure we do not distinguish between batteries with and without reverse wording, although straightlining may reflect different underlying processes for these two types of batteries).   This is a binary variable, where 1 indicates the presence of near straightlining and 0 indicates the absence of near straightlining.\n\nOverall straightlining: In how many of the three batteries did straightlining happen? This is an ordered categorical variable which can take a value of 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nOverall near straightlining : In how many of the three batteries did near straightlining happen? This is an ordered categorical variable which can take a value of 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nb. Rounding\n\nThis study includes 7 non-sensitive open numerical questions that allow measurement of rounding. Rounding will be measured in two ways.\nRounding to the nearest 5: A respondent is considered to have rounded if their answer is divisible by 5 (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.). \n\nRounding to the nearest 10: A respondent is considered to have rounded if their answer is divisible by 10 (e.g., 10, 20, 30, etc.). \n\nIn both cases an indicator of rounding will be created for each question, where 1 means \u2018rounding\u2019 and 0 means \u2018no rounding\u2019. Rounding will be assessed in two ways:\n\nPercentage of rounded responses: For each respondent, the percentage of responses out of the 7 that are rounded (either to the nearest 5 or the nearest 10).  \n\nItem-level analyses: for each of the 7 items, the percentage of respondents rounding. \n\nc. Speeding\n\nSpeeding (answering faster than conscientious responding allows) will be measured in two ways.\nTotal completion time for the main interview \nItem-level completion time (directly available in VS and TS, and inferrable in VM from interviewer response entry time).\n\nHypothesis 2. Disclosure \n\nThe survey includes 12 questions that allow measurement of levels of disclosure. For these questions disclosure will be measured in several different ways, at several different levels.\n\nDisclosure: Respondent level\nPercentage of the 12 items for which a sensitive response option was selected.  Responses are classified as sensitive based on panelist ratings of the extent to which each response option is considered sensitive. An indicator of disclosure will be created where \u201c1\u201d indicates the respondent chose a sensitive response option and \u201c0\u201d indicates that the respondent did not. (The exact cutoff for assigning each response as sensitive or not will be determined based on the response distributions observed; previous efforts using this approach have observed that selecting a cutoff of 40% or 50% of panelists having judged a response option as sensitive maximizes the possible comparison options, but this will have to be determined empirically from the current data set. Starting cutoff values will be set at 50% (a response will be considered sensitive if &gt;50% of panelists judged that most poeple would be somewhat or very uncomfortable to give the response); if a different cutoff strategy is needed to more clearly discriminate across conditions given the distribution of responses in our data set, we will report the reasoning for changing to that cutoff.   \nAverage level of sensitivity of responses across all 12 questions. Sensitivity ratings from the online panel will be used to quantify the sensitivity of each response.\nAttached as an Appendix B  to this document is a list of the questions and the associated sensitive response options. \n\nDisclosure: Item level\nPercentage of respondents who selected a sensitive response for each item. \nResponses will be classified as sensitive or not based on the response sensitivity cutoff used in the respondent-level measure. For this level of analysis, we will append the item characteristic (i.e. HH, or LH) as a covariate. \nAverage level of sensitivity of responses for each item. Sensitivity ratings from the online panel will be used to quantify the sensitivity of each response.\n\nDisclosure: Response level\nThis is measured by the selection of the response option for each item. It is a binary indicator of 1 \u2013 selected, and 0 \u2013 not selected. \n\nThe sensitivity ratings will be appended to this pre-registration in Appendix B. Measures of the prevalence of every response to every item intended to measure disclosure is also provided in Appendix B. The data structure for disclosure at the respondent level, item level and response option level is described in Table 4 in the attached preregistration_tables.docx\n\nHypotheses 3: Respondent subjective experience\n\nOutcome measures: Satisfaction, comfort, personal connection, subjective honesty, \nsubjective privacy, effect of nearby others, perceived question sensitivity.\n\nThe questions measuring these subjective experiences are included in Appendix A. \n\nSatisfaction: Percentage of respondents who report each of five levels of satisfaction with the interview on the 5-point scale (\u201cNot at all satisfied\u201d to \u201cVery satisfied\u201d).\n\nComfort: Percentage of respondents who report each of five levels of having been comfortable with the interviewer on the 5-point scale from \u201cNot at all comfortable\u201d to \u201cVery comfortable (measurable in VM and VS, but not TS)\n\nPersonal connection:  Percentage of respondents who report each of five levels of having been personally connected with the interviewer on the 5-point scale from \u201cDistant\u201d to \u201cClose\u201d (measurable in VM and VS, but not TS)\n\nSubjective honesty: Percentage of respondents who report each of four levels of having been able to answer the questions honestly, on a four point scale of \u201cAlways\u201d, \u201cMost of the time\u201d, \u201cSome of the time\u201d, or \u201cNever.\u201d\n\nSubjective privacy: Percentage of respondents who report each of three levels of whether the interview felt more private, the same, or less private than being asked the questions face to face.  \n\nEffect of nearby others: Percentage of respondents who report each of three levels of whether anyone nearby affected the way they answered the questions, with three possible responses:  \u201cNo, the people nearby did not affect my answers\u201d, \u201cYes, the people nearby affected my answers\u201d, \u201cNo one was around\u201d.\n\nPerceived question sensitivity: Percentage of respondents who report each of five levels of how sensitive they felt the survey questions were, on a  5-point scale from \u201cNot at all sensitive\u201d to \u201cVery sensitive.\u201d\n\nInterviewer effects\n\nWe will be using all the items in the main survey as outcome variables for our analyses of interviewer effects. Please refer to the attached Appendix A for the items. \nInterviewer-level covariates: Interviewer age, interviewer experience, interviewer race/ethnicity, interviewer gender.\n\nRespondent-level covariates: Respondent age, respondent gender, respondent race/ethnicity, respondent education level.\n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "preregistration_tables.docx"}, "nodeId": "2vmx4", "sha256": "848f2ea79ceedf3d5783d7f40c6b912b4b0e83ff934a275e55bb6539c064637d", "viewUrl": "/project/9jusx/files/osfstorage/5e8d48e3f135350172d5cbb9/", "selectedFileName": "preregistration_tables.docx"}, {"data": {"name": "osf_Appendix_B.pdf"}, "nodeId": "2vmx4", "sha256": "4ab98a99e8f38a33a7bbb72d54bdb7d7c5fd83001c9df13726581036ce18cc31", "viewUrl": "/project/9jusx/files/osfstorage/5e8d48e3f135350172d5cbb7/", "selectedFileName": "osf_Appendix_B.pdf"}, {"data": {"name": "osf_Appendix_A.pdf"}, "nodeId": "2vmx4", "sha256": "92201fea06fb123e68ffc7ced90769fc0ea9985d8c51f2e0f36b9ee4fec09f62", "viewUrl": "/project/9jusx/files/osfstorage/5e8d48e2f135350172d5cbb5/", "selectedFileName": "osf_Appendix_A.pdf"}], "value": ""}}}, "q16": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q17": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "For all the following analyses, interactions between the sample source and sociodemographic variables will be tested. If there are no significant interaction effects, sample source will not be included in subsequent models. Descriptive statistics will be computed for each of the outcomes by mode. \n\nHypotheses 1: Satisficing \n\nThe analyses for this outcome will be at the respondent level, where each row corresponds to a different respondent. \n\nAs there are three measures for satisficing, we will be fitting separate models for each outcome. For Hypothesis 1.3 and 1.4, we will add the interaction term of Mode*Age.\n\nStraightlining\n\nAs there are four ways we are defining straightlining from three batteries, we have battery-specific straightling measures and overall straightlining measures:\n\nBattery specific straightling: straightlining (battery 1), near straightlining (battery 1), straightlining (battery 2), near straightlining (battery 2), straightlining (battery 3), near straightlining (battery 3)\nOverall straightlining:  Overall straightlining, overall near straightlining \nWe will fit a separate generalized linear model for each battery specific straightlining measure with a binary logit link to the outcome. As a respondent either straightlines or does not straightline, the outcome is a binary measure. For all the models, we will control for age and education, as these have been demonstrated to be  associated with satisficing (less conscientious responding). We will also control for response time and any other demographic variables that prove to differ across the experimental groups. Mode is a predictor variable. To test VS and VM vs. TS, TS will initially be set as the reference category.  \nAs for overall straightlining, the same modelling method will be used, but with a cumulative logit link.\n\nRounding\n\nThere are two measures for rounding, one at the respondent level and the other at the item level.\n\nFor respondent level rounding, we will fit a logistic regression on the proportion of rounding out of 7 items, and with mode as a predictor variable. A similar modelling approach as was used for straightlining will be used for rounding (i.e. we will control for age and education, response time and any other demographic variables that prove to differ across the experimental groups).\n\nAnalysis for item level rounding will require a data-set at the item level, where each row in the data-set corresponds to a different item. This can be analyzed in three different ways:\nFitting a single logistic regression model where the outcome is presence of rounding, using item ID and mode as predictors, controlling for age, education, response time and any other demographic variables that differ across experimental groups.\n\nFitting a single logistic regression model where the outcome is presence of rounding, using mode as predictors and item id as a random effect, controlling for age, education, response time and any other demographic variables that differ across experimental groups \nFitting separate logistic regression models where the outcome is the presence of rounding for that specific item using mode as predictors, controlling for age, education, response time and any other demographic variables that differ across experimental groups.\n\nSpeeding\n\nAnalyses this outcome is at the respondent level and item level. Due to the differences in the administration of each mode (i.e., VM = interviewer administered with the interviewer keying in the respondent\u2019s answer, VS = self-administered but respondent has to watch the videos before being able to select the answers, TS = self-administered and likely the fastest because respondent\u2019s speed of completion is only restricted by their reading speed), the speed of completion will be difficult to compare across modes, therefore this is limited to analyses within the mode itself.\n\nThe analyses here will be done at two levels: respondent level and item level:\nAt the respondent level: To test the association between age and speeding, we will fit separate linear regression models for each mode, using the respondents\u2019 total completion time as the outcome, controlling for other demographic variables. \n\nAt the item level: To test the association between age and speeding for specific items, we will need an item-level data structure where each row corresponds to a specific item. The outcome is the time taken to respond to the item (the time the response was recorded - the time the previous response was recorded). We will fit a linear mixed model where the outcome is time taken to respond to the question, with Respondent ID (and in the case of VM, Interviewer ID as well) as a random intercept, with age as a predictor variable, controlling for other demographic variables. \n\nHypotheses 2: Disclosure \n\nThe outcomes of interest for disclosure are at three levels: respondent level, item level, and response level: \n\nThere are two measures for disclosure at the respondent level: 1. the proportion of items where the respondent chose the sensitive responses in 12 sensitive items, 2. The average level of sensitivity of responses chosen by the respondent.\nFor the first outcome at the respondent level, we will fit a logistic regression model, and with mode as a predictor variable. A similar modelling approach as was used for straightlining will be used for disclosure (i.e. we will control for age and education, response time and any other demographic variables that prove to differ across the experimental groups).\nFor the second outcome at the respondent level, we will fit a linear regression model, and with mode as a predictor variable. A similar modelling approach as was used for straightlining will be used for disclosure (i.e. we will control for age and education, response time and any other demographic variables that prove to differ across the experimental groups).\n\nAt the item level, the outcome is the selection of the answer (binary) for a specific item. \nFor this outcome, we will fit a generalized linear mixed model with logit link for the outcome, and respondent ID as the random intercept. On top of mode, we will also include the topic sensitivity as predictors (i.e. HH, LH) and an interaction term of topic sensitivity with mode. If the selection of sensitive responses is associated with topic sensitivity, there will be a difference between HH and LH, and if this effect is greater in a specific mode, we will see a significant interaction effect. \n\nAt the response level, the outcome for disclosure is a binary outcome for selection of the response. In order to analyze this, we will need a response level data structure, where each row corresponds to a different response to each item. For example, if an item (e.g. \u201cHave you ever smoked?\u201d) has two responses (e.g. \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d), the responses \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d will each have their own row in the data, and a column that indicates whether that response was selected or not selected.  \n\nFor this outcome, we will fit a generalized linear mixed model with logit link for the outcome, and item ID nested within respondent ID as the random intercept. On top of mode, we will include measures of rated sensitivity of the response option and the prevalence of the selection of the response option as predictors.  \n\nFor all the above analyses, we will test the interaction of mode with age. \n\nHypotheses 3: Respondent subjective experience\n\nAll the outcome measures are at the respondent level. The analysis plan for each respondent subjective experience is as follows:\n\nSatisfaction: Percentage of respondents who report each of five levels of satisfaction with the interview on the 5-point scale (\u201cNot at all satisfied\u201d to \u201cVery satisfied\u201d).\n\nFor this outcome, we will fit a generalized linear model with a cumulative logit link, and with mode as a predictor variable. A similar modelling approach as was used for straightlining will be used for disclosure (i.e. we will control for age and education, response time and any other demographic variables that prove to differ across the experimental groups).\nComfort: Percentage of respondents who report each of five levels of having been comfortable with the interviewer on the 5-point scale from \u201cNot at all comfortable\u201d to \u201cVery comfortable (measurable in VM and VS, but not TS)\n\nPersonal connection:  Percentage of respondents who report each of five levels of having been personally connected with the interviewer on the 5-point scale from \u201cDistant\u201d to \u201cClose\u201d (measurable in VM and VS, but not TS)\n\nFor outcomes b, and c, we will fit a generalized linear model with a cumulative logit link, and with mode as a predictor variable. A similar modelling approach as above, but as these questions are not asked in TS, these will only be fit on the data from the VS and VM mode. \nSubjective honesty: Percentage of respondents who report each of four levels of having been able to answer the questions honestly, on a four point scale of \u201cAlways\u201d, \u201cMost of the time\u201d, \u201cSome of the time\u201d, or \u201cNever.\u201d\n\nFor this outcome, we will fit a generalized linear model with a cumulative logit link, and with mode as a predictor variable. A similar modelling approach as was used for straightlining will be used for disclosure (i.e. we will control for age and education, response time and any other demographic variables that prove to differ across the experimental groups).\nSubjective privacy: Percentage of respondents who report each of three levels of whether the interview felt more private, the same, or less private than being asked the questions face to face.  \n\nEffect of nearby others: Percentage of respondents who report each of three levels of whether anyone nearby affected the way they answered the questions, with three possible responses:  \u201cNo, the people nearby did not affect my answers\u201d, \u201cYes, the people nearby affected my answers\u201d, \u201cNo one was around\u201d.\n\nFor outcome e and f, we will fit multinomial regression models for each outcome, again with mode as a predictor variable, and using the same control variables as above. \n\nPerceived question sensitivity: Percentage of respondents who report each of five levels of how sensitive they felt the survey questions were, on a  5-point scale from \u201cNot at all sensitive\u201d to \u201cVery sensitive.\u201d\n\nFor outcome e, we will fit a generalized linear model with a cumulative logit link, and with mode as a predictor variable. A similar modelling approach as (a) above will be used. \nFor all the above analyses, we will test the interaction of mode with age. \n\nHypotheses 4:  Interviewer effects in VM and VS\n\nFor our analyses of interviewer effects, we will fit generalized linear mixed models with each of the main survey items as an outcome variable. We will use a different link function depending on the survey item. For example, for ordered categorical variables such as frequency response options (\u201cat least once a week,\u201d \u201calmost every week,\u201d \u201cabout once a month,\u201d \u201cseldom,\u201d \u201cnever\u201d) we may use a cumulative logit link; for open numeric responses, we will use an identity link. \n\nTo examine the interviewer effects on each of these outcomes by mode, we will fit a mixed model to the combined data from both the VM and VS modes (see table below). We will use an estimation approach that allows the variance of the random interviewer effects to be included in these models to vary depending on the mode, and we will allow observations coming from the same interviewer in general to be correlated (since each interviewer is working in both modes). For each of the survey outcomes, we will fit a model with the respondent-level covariates and the interviewer-level covariates, and estimate the unexplained variance between interviewers in the survey responses. We will test the null hypothesis that the variance components from the two modes are equal using a likelihood ratio test (where the null hypothesis will correspond to a model that does *not* allow the variance components to vary across the modes). We hypothesize that the interviewer variance components will tend to be larger for the VM condition, but if they are not, this is a positive result given the benefits associated with this condition.\n\nAfter fitting the model that includes the fixed effects of respondent and interviewer-level covariates, empirical best linear unbiased predictors (EBLUPs) of the random interviewer effects in the model will be computed for VM and VS separately. We will examine the correlation of the EBLUPs of the interviewers in VS with the EBLUPs of the interviewers in VM for each outcome. If there is a positive correlation, then we can conclude that regardless of the mode (VM or VS), there are similar effects of the interviewers regardless of the live interviewing or the video recording. If there is flat or negative correlation, then there is a difference between VM and VS in the effects that a given interviewer has, and this will merit additional analysis to understand why the same interviewer is having different effects in the two conditions.\n\nAn example of the combined data set that will be prepared for these analyses appears in Table 3 (preregistration_tables.docx)\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q21": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "As we have no prediction for gender, race/ethnicity and education on the mode differences in satisficing and disclosure, these will be exploratory. \n\nWe will also examine interviewer effects with regards to satisficing and disclosure. \n\nAdditional exploratory analyses\n\nAE1: Interview completion\n\nVM interviews may lead to lower rates of completion (once an interview starts) because of technical difficulties, but the fact that a live interviewer is there may lead to higher rates of completion. TS interviews may be easier and quicker to finish, but they may be easier to break off because they lack the social pressure or obligation that an interviewer brings. VS interviews may have the best of both worlds (a motivating engaging interviewer and the privacy of self-administration) or the worst of both worlds (the intrusiveness of an interviewer, albeit recorded, and the ease of breaking off from self administration).\n\nAE2: Recency effects\n\nRecency effects (greater likelihood of selecting response options for a particular question that are presented later, i.e, more recently, tend to be observed more frequently among older participants (Kn\u00e4uper 1991). Because the response options in VM are presented synchronously and sequentially, with no reviewable record of them for the respondents, it is likely that they will be observed more often in VM than in VS or TS. Mode-specific recency effects could be particularly evident in older participants. The VS mode may reduce recency effects because the response options are presented visually after being read by the recorded interviewers. "}, "q23": {"extra": [], "value": "References\n\nKnauper, B.

Hypotheses are presented for both alternatives. If both are true and cancel each other out, then no differences will be observed. \n\nVS may be more like VM (it includes an interviewer\u2019s moving face and speech) or more like TS (it is automated and self-administered). It could also fall in between or even lead to less satisficing than both if it has the best combination of VM-like and TS-like features. \nHypotheses are presented for all these alternatives.\n\nHypotheses 1.1: Satisficing in VM vs. TS\n\nH1.1.1 If respondents are more engaged and motivated by interacting with a live human in VM than they are in TS, then they should satisfice less--produce more precise (fewer rounded) answers to numerical questions and differentiate answers to battery questions more (straightline less)--in VM than in TS.  This would be consistent with evidence of less satisficing in face to face than TS interviews (Heerwegh et al., 2005).\n\nH1.1.2 If respondents feel time pressure to respond quickly from interacting with a live human in VM, then they should satisfice more--produce less precise (more rounded) answers to numerical questions and less differentiated answers to battery questions (more straightlining)--in VM than in TS. \n\nHypotheses 1.2:  Satisficing in VS relative to VM and TS\n\nVS is a hybrid mode with content that is ephemeral though replayable (interviewer\u2019s face and voice, question content) and persistent (textual response options that appear after initial question reading finishes). Depending on whether participants experience VS more like VM (even though VM is not replayable) or more like TS (even though TS has only persistent content), different outcomes are plausible. \n\nH1.2.1 If recorded video of an interviewer provides as much social presence (and as much time pressure) as a live video-mediated interview, then the effects of VS on satisficing (whichever direction they end up going) should be the same (relative to TS) as of VM.\nH1.2.2 If recorded video of an interviewer provides as little social presence (and as little time pressure) as a purely textual self-administered interview, then the effects of VS on satisficing (whichever direction they end up going) should be the same (relative to VM) as of TS.\n\nH1.2.3 If recorded video of an interviewer provides an intermediate level of social presence with an interviewer (less than live video, but more than textual self-administration), then the effects of VS on satisficing (whichever direction they end up going) should fall in between those of VM and TS.\n\nH1.2.4 If recorded video of an interviewer provides the benefits of social presence without the time pressure of human interviewing, then VS will have less satisficing than both VM and TS (regardless of how VM and TS compare).\n\nH1.3 Satisficing in VM vs. TS for older vs. younger participants\n\nMode effects on satisficing (whatever they turn out to be) could differ for older participants than for younger, if, for example, older participants find video connection particularly engaging or particularly off-putting, or if they feel conversational time pressure more or less acutely than younger participants. The fact that older participants have been shown to satisfice less (straightline and speed) than younger participants in TS surveys (Zhang &amp; Conrad, 2014) may suggest a general tendency to satisfice less (which would then be evident in less satisficing across all modes in this study), or it may be mode-specific.\n\nThe following hypotheses propose that there will be an interaction of age (&gt;= 65 years vs. &lt; 65 years) with the observed mode effects. Because the available sample of participants in our study is likely to be particularly familiar with online technologies and surveys (because of their prior participation in research recruited online), we do not focus on hypotheses based on generational differences in technology adoption.\n\nWhether these effects emerge depends on the proportion of participants in each subgroup who are affected in a particular direction. So we will see interactions with age if more or fewer older participants are affected in particular ways.\n\nThe following patterns are plausible based on previous literature on aging and self-reports (e.g., observations in Schwarz, Park, Knauper, &amp; Sudman, 1999) or on the research team\u2019s observations of technology usage:\n\nH1.3.1 Whatever the direction of VM-TS differences observed in the full sample, the effects will be more extreme for older respondents than for younger.  If VM leads to less satisficing than TS (because VM promotes greater engagement), the effect could be greater for older participants whom interviewers can support (as opposed to TS)--slowing down the interview if a participant has trouble understanding or speaking louder if a participant has trouble hearing, clarifying the task, encouraging conscientious responding, etc.  If VM leads to more satisficing than TS (because VM exacerbates time pressure to respond), the effect could be greater for older participants; they could feel the time pressure particularly acutely because they worry that they may be responding slower than others, or they might feel potential aging stigma from responding slowly. In either case, the prediction is that the VM-TS difference will be greater for older than younger respondents.\n\nH1.3.2 Whatever the direction of VM-TS differences observed in the full sample, the effects will be less extreme for older respondents than for younger. If VM leads to less satisficing than TS (because VM promotes greater engagement), the effect could be smaller for older participants because VM is less compelling and socially present for them than face to face contact, compared with younger participants who may be more comfortable with videomedated interaction.  If VM leads to more satisficing than TS (because VM exacerbates time pressure to respond), the effect could be smaller for older participants if they do not care as much about looking conversationally competent or speedy as younger participants, or if they do not recognize that they are slower. In either case, the prediction is that the VM-TS difference will be smaller for older than younger respondents.\n\nH1.3.3 If live interviewing differently affects older and younger respondents\u2019 satisficing (e.g., live interviewing benefits older respondents\u2019 engagement and motivation but the time pressure harms younger respondents\u2019 thoughtfulness--or, alternatively, time pressure harms older respondents\u2019 thoughtfulness but the engagement benefits younger respondents), then the pattern of differences between VM and TS will reverse for older vs. younger respondents.\n\nHypotheses 1.4:  Satisficing in VS relative to VM and TS for older and younger respondents\nVS is a hybrid mode with content that is ephemeral though replayable (interviewer\u2019s face and voice, question content) and persistent (textual response options that appear after initial question reading finishes). Depending on how these different aspects of the mode affect older vs. younger participants, different outcomes are plausible. \n\nH1.4.1 Whatever the direction of VM/VS-TS differences observed in the full sample, the effects will be more extreme for older respondents than for younger.  If VM and VS lead to less satisficing than TS in the full sample (because VM and VS both promote greater engagement), the effect could be greater for older participants because the VM and VS moving, speaking interviewer encourages their conscientious responding more than for younger respondents.  If VM and VS lead to more satisficing than TS in the full sample (because the moving, speaking interviewer exacerbates time pressure to respond), the effect could be greater for older participants; they could feel the time pressure particularly acutely because they worry that they may be responding slower than others, or they might feel potential aging stigma from responding slowly. In either case, the prediction is that the VM/VS-TS difference will be greater for older than younger respondents.\n\nH1.4.2 Whatever the direction of VM/VS-TS differences observed in the full sample, the effects will be less extreme for older respondents than for younger.  If VM and VS lead to less satisficing than TS in the full sample (because VM and VS both promote greater engagement), the effect could be smaller for older participants because they find both VM and VS less compelling and socially present for them than face to face contact, compared with younger participants who may be more comfortable with videomedated interaction and watching (and responding to) videos.  If VM and VS lead to more satisficing than TS in the full sample  (because the moving, speaking interviewer exacerbates time pressure to respond), the effect could be smaller for older participants (despite the on-screen persistence of the VS response options); they could feel the time pressure particularly acutely because they worry that they may be responding slower than others, or they might feel potential aging stigma from responding slowly. In either case, the prediction is that the VM/VS-TS difference will be smaller for older than younger respondents.\n\nMany (in fact, a combinatorial explosion) of other plausible patterns of how mode interacts with age group in predicting satisficing could potentially be enumerated. There are multiple ways in which older and younger participants\u2019 patterns of satisficing could reverse--either for one mode, two modes, or all three modes. Our analyses will explore what emerges; given how much is unknown about the basic patterns to be observed irrespective of age we will treat these analyses as exploratory. Given that speeding is also an indicator of satisficing, we will also be exploring age differences in speeding within mode.    \n\nHypotheses 2:  Disclosure \n\nLike face to face interviewing, VM interviewing is synchronous and likely involves greater social presence with an interviewer than TS.  \n\nHypothesis 2.1: Disclosure in VM vs. TS\n\nIf VM interviewing affects disclosure in the same way as face to face interviewing, participants should disclose more sensitive information in TS than VM interviews. \n\nHypotheses 2.2: Disclosure in VS relative to VM and TS\n\nThere are multiple logical possibilities of how levels of disclosure differ across these three modes (beyond the null hypothesis that they are all the same). The following are plausible relations based on prior evidence and theorizing.\n\nH2.2.1  If the moving face in VS (even though it is not live) creates as much social presence as in VM, there should be just as little disclosure in VS as VM, and more disclosure in TS: VM=VS TS and VM (whatever their relationship).\n\nH2.2.5  If VS brings the worst of both VM and TS modes--the social presence of a recorded interviewer inhibits disclosure and there is no rapport (as with a live interviewer) that could promote honest responding, then participants should disclose least in VS relative to TS and VM:  VS &lt; TS and VM (whatever their relationship).  \n\nH2.3: Disclosure in VM vs. TS for older vs. younger participants\n\nH2.3.1 If older participants are more skeptical or mistrusting of video-mediated interaction than younger participants, then VM-TS differences observed in the full sample will be more extreme for older participants than for younger--that is, older participants will disclose even less in VM (relative to TS) than will younger participants. \n\nH2.3.2 If older participants are more reassured by the social contact in video-mediated interaction than younger participants (and those more comfortable disclosing sensitive information), then VM-TS differences observed in the full sample will be less extreme for older respondents than for younger. \n\nHypotheses 2.4: Disclosure in the three modes for older vs. younger participants\nMany (in fact, a combinatorial explosion) plausible patterns of how mode interacts with age group in predicting disclosure could potentially be enumerated. Older participants\u2019 disclosure could be more affected by one or more of these modes than younger participants\u2019, it could be less affected, or the patterns could reverse. Our analyses will explore what emerges; given how much is unknown about the basic patterns to be observed irrespective of age we will treat these analyses as exploratory. \n\nHypotheses 2.5: Type of question sensitivity, mode, and disclosure\n\nItems used to test disclosure in this study were selected to allow comparison of types of question sensitivity that have not previously been distinguished. One new distinction (building on Feuer, Fail, &amp; Schober 2019) is between the sensitivity of the question itself (the topic) and the sensitivity of particular response options (not all answers are sensitive). A second new distinction concerns the likely prevalence of sensitive behaviors for a particular item; if the prevalence of sensitive behaviors is low, then few enough people have the potential to be affected in their disclosure by the interview mode that a mode effect on disclosure is unlikely (essentially a floor effect). But if a high proportion of participants have engaged in a sensitive behavior, the opportunity for a mode effect to emerge is greater. Items in the current study were rated by 100 online panelists to determine the sensitivity of each topic and response option, and likely prevalence of particular responses was calibrated from response distributions in the most recent available published reports of answers to these questions.\n\nUsing this method, in principle \u201csensitive items\u201d can be categorized as one of three types: (HH) Highly sensitive topic with likely high prevalence of sensitive answers, (HL) Highly sensitive topic with likely low prevalence of sensitive answers, or (LH) Low sensitivity topic with likely high prevalence of sensitive answers. The current study selected HH and LH items to test the following hypotheses. (For HH items, &gt; 40% of panelists had judged that most people would be somewhat or very uncomfortable to be asked the question; for LH items, &lt; 20% of panelists had judged that most people would be somewhat or very uncomfortable to be asked the question. All these items had high likely prevalence of sensitive answers, but they varied in their extremity).  \n\nThe factors tested in these hypotheses are independent (rated topic sensitivity, rated response sensitivity, and prior likelihood of a response based on published prevalence are three independent predictors of a particular response option being selected) but they could potentially interact in leading to mode effects. \n\nHypothesis 2.5.1 If topic sensitivity (independent of response sensitivity) is what leads to mode differences (the default assumption in most studies), then mode differences in disclosure (as tested in Hypotheses 2.1 and 2.2) will be greater for HH than LH items. \n\nHypothesis 2.5.2  If sensitivity of a reported behavior (rather than the usually assumed  topic sensitivity) is what leads to mode differences, then mode differences in disclosure (as tested in Hypotheses 2.1 and 2.2) will be greater for responses rated as more sensitive.\n\nHypothesis 2.5.3 If frequency of sensitive behaviors (rather than simply topic sensitivity) is what leads to mode differences in disclosure, then mode differences in disclosure (as tested in Hypotheses 2.1 and 2.2) should be greater for behaviors with greater prevalence (as reported in published studies)--independent of topic sensitivity. \n\nAdditional analyses will explore whether effects of type of question sensitivity differ for older vs. younger participants.\nHypotheses 3: Respondent subjective experience\n\nRespondents\u2019 subjective experience is measured by debriefing questions asked after the main interview. Additional exploratory analyses based on the debriefing questions will be carried out to test, for example, whether any mode differences in respondents\u2019 satisficing or levels of disclosure are associated with different levels of reported satisfaction or privacy in the interviews, or with reported technical difficulties.\n\nHypotheses 3.1: Satisfaction \n\nHypothesis 3.1.1: Satisfaction in VM vs. TS\n\nH3.1.1.1 If respondents are more engaged and motivated by interacting with a live human in VM than they are in TS, then they should report greater satisfaction in VM than TS interviews. \nH3.1.1.2 If respondents feel interacting with a live human in VM is more intrusive or burdensome than self-administering TS, then they should report less satisfaction in VM than TS interviews. \n\nHypothesis 3.1.2: Satisfaction in VS relative to VM and TS\n\nDepending on whether participants experience VS more like VM or more like TS, different outcomes are plausible. \n\nH3.1.2.1 If recorded video of an interviewer provides as much social presence as a live video-mediated interview, then the effects of VS on satisfaction (whichever direction they end up going) should be the same (relative to TS) as of VM.\n\nH3.1.2.2 If recorded video of an interviewer provides as little social presence as a purely textual self-administered interview, then the effects of VS on satisfaction (whichever direction they end up going) should be the same (relative to VM) as of TS.\n\nH3.1.2.3 If recorded video of an interviewer provides an intermediate level of social presence with an interviewer (less than live video, but more than textual self-administration), then the effects of VS on satisfaction (whichever direction they end up going) should fall in between those of VM and TS.\n\nH3.1.2.4 If recorded video of an interviewer provides the benefits of social presence without the intrusiveness of human interviewing, then VS will lead to greater satisfaction than both VM and TS (regardless of how VM and TS compare).\n\nH3.1.2.5 If recorded video of an interviewer is as intrusive as a human interviewer without the motivating engagement of the interviewer and without the privacy of self-administration, then VS will lead to less satisfaction than both VM and TS (regardless of how VM and TS compare).\n\nHypotheses 3.1.3 Satisfaction in VM vs. TS for older vs. younger respondents\n\nH3.1.3.1 Whatever the direction of VM-TS differences observed in the full sample, the effects will be more extreme for older respondents than for younger.  If VM leads to greater satisfaction than TS (because VM promotes greater engagement), the effect could be greater for older participants who particularly prefer the \u201chuman touch.\u201d  If VM leads to less satisfaction than TS (because VM feels more pressured or more technologically challenging), the effect could be greater for older participants. In either case, the prediction is that the VM-TS difference will be greater for older than younger respondents.\n\nH3.1.3.2 Whatever the direction of VM-TS differences observed in the full sample, the effects will be less extreme for older respondents than for younger.  If VM leads to less satisfaction than TS (because VM feels more pressured or more technologically challenging), the effect could be smaller for older participants who feel technologically challenged in any online survey--even with TS.  If VM leads to more satisfaction than TS (because VM promotes greater engagement), the effect could be smaller for older participants for whom VM\u2019s technological challenges outweigh social benefits. In either case, the prediction is that the VM-TS difference will be smaller for older than younger respondents.\n\nH3.1.3.3 If live interviewing differently affects older and younger respondents\u2019 satisfaction (e.g., live interviewing makes older respondents feel more motivated and engaged but feels intrusive to younger respondents, or live interviewing feels burdensome for older respondents but easy and pleasant for younger respondents), then the pattern of differences between VM and TS will go in opposite directions for older vs. younger respondents.\n\nHypotheses 3.1.4:  Satisfaction in VS relative to VM and TS for older and younger respondents\n\nH3.1.4.1 Whatever the direction of VM/VS-TS differences in satisfaction observed in the full sample, the effects will be more extreme for older respondents than for younger.  If VM and VS lead to greater satisfaction than TS in the full sample (because VM and VS both promote greater engagement), the effect could be greater for older participants because the VM and VS moving, speaking interviewer is more engaging and motivating for them than for younger respondents.  If VM and VS lead to less satisfaction than TS in the full sample (because the moving, speaking interviewer feels intrusive or exacerbates time pressure to respond, or the video technology is more challenging to navigate), the effect could be greater for older participants. In either case, the prediction is that the VM/VS-TS difference will be greater for older than younger respondents.\n\nH3.1.4.2 Whatever the direction of VM/VS-TS differences observed in the full sample, the effects will be less extreme for older respondents than for younger.  If VM and VS lead to greater satisfaction than TS in the full sample (because VM and VS both promote greater engagement), the effect could be smaller for older participants because they find both VM and VS less compelling and socially present for them than face to face contact, compared with younger participants who may be more comfortable with videomedated interaction and watching (and responding to) videos.  If VM and VS lead to less satisfaction than TS in the full sample  (because the moving, speaking interviewer exacerbates time pressure to respond or because the video technology is challenging), the effect could be smaller for older participants for whom the social benefits of video connection mitigate the downsides. In either case, the prediction is that the VM/VS-TS difference will be smaller for older than younger respondents.\n\nMany (in fact, a combinatorial explosion) of other plausible patterns of how mode interacts with age group in predicting satisfaction could potentially be enumerated. There are multiple ways in which older and younger participants\u2019 patterns of satisfaction could reverse--either for one mode, two modes, or all three modes. Our analyses will explore what emerges; given how much is unknown about the basic patterns to be observed irrespective of age we will treat these analyses as exploratory.  \n\nHypotheses 3.2  Comfort and personal connection\n\nH3.2.1 Comfort and personal connection in VM vs. VS\n\nH3.2.1.1 If respondents are more engaged and motivated by interacting with a live human in VM than they are viewing a recorded interviewer in VS, then they should report greater comfort and personal connection with the interviewer in VM than VS interviews. \n\nH3.2.1.2 If respondents feel interacting with a live human in VM is more intrusive or burdensome than viewing a recorded interviewer in VS, then they should report less comfort and personal connection with the interviewer in VM than VS interviews. \n\nH3.2.2 Comfort and personal connection in VM vs. VS for older and younger participants\n\nH3.2.2.1 Whatever the direction of VM-VS differences observed in the full sample, the effects will be more extreme for older respondents than for younger.  If VM leads to greater comfort and personal connection than VS (because VM promotes greater engagement), the effect could be greater for older participants who particularly prefer the \u201chuman touch.\u201d  If VM leads to less comfort and personal connection than VS (because VM feels more pressured or more technologically challenging), the effect could be greater for older participants. In either case, the prediction is that the VM-VS difference will be greater for older than younger respondents.\n\nH3.2.2.2 Whatever the direction of VM-VS differences observed in the full sample, the effects will be less extreme for older respondents than for younger.  If VM leads to less comfort and personal connection than VS (because VM feels more pressured or more technologically challenging), the effect could be smaller for older participants who feel technologically challenged in any online survey--even with VS.  If VM leads to more comfort and personal connection than VS (because VM promotes greater engagement), the effect could be smaller for older participants for whom VM\u2019s technological challenges outweigh social benefits. In either case, the prediction is that the VM-VS difference will be smaller for older than younger respondents.\n\nH3.2.2.3 If live interviewing differently affects older and younger respondents\u2019 comfort and personal connection  (e.g., live interviewing makes older respondents feel more motivated and engaged but feels intrusive to younger respondents, or live interviewing feels burdensome for older respondents but easy and pleasant for younger respondents), then the pattern of differences between VM and VS will go in opposite directions for older vs. younger respondents.\n\nHypothesis 3.3: Subjective honesty\n\nHypothesis 3.3.1: Subjective honesty in VM vs. TS\n\nIf VM interviewing affects disclosure in the same way as face to face interviewing, participants should report having been more honest in VM than TS interviews. (Reports of subjective honesty may or may not align completely with levels of disclosure). \nHypothesis 3.3.2: Subjective honesty in VS relative to VM and TS\nThere are multiple logical possibilities of how subjective honesty differs across these three modes (beyond the null hypothesis that they are all the same). The following are plausible relations based on prior evidence and theorizing.\n\nH3.3.2.1  If the moving face in VS (even though it is not live) creates as much social presence as in VM, participants should report having been as little honest in VS as VM, and more honest in TS: VM=VS TS and VM (whatever their relationship).\n\nH3.3.2.5  If VS brings the worst of both VM and TS modes--the social presence of a recorded interviewer inhibits disclosure and there is no rapport (as with a live interviewer) that could promote honest responding, then participants should report having been least honest in VS relative to TS and VM:  VS &lt; TS and VM (whatever their relationship).  \n\nHypothesis 3.3.3: Subjective honesty in the different modes for older vs. younger respondents\n\nMany (in fact, a combinatorial explosion) of plausible patterns of how mode interacts with age group in predicting subjective honesty could potentially be enumerated. Older participants\u2019 subjective honesty could be more affected by one or more of these modes than younger participants\u2019, it could be less affected, or the patterns could reverse. Our analyses will explore what emerges; given how much is unknown about the basic patterns to be observed irrespective of age we will treat these analyses as exploratory.  \n\nHypothesis 3.4: Subjective privacy compared to face to face interview\n\nHypothesis 3.4.1: Subjective privacy in VM vs. TS\n\nBecause VM interviews involve a live human interviewer, participants should report that VM interviews feel less private (relative to face to face interviews) than TS interviews. \nHypothesis 3.4.2: Subjective privacy in VS relative to VM and TS\n\nH3.4.2.1  If the moving face in VS (even though it is not live) creates as much social presence as in VM, participants should report that (relative to face to face) VS feels as public (non-private) as VM, and less private that TS : VM=VS= VS  &gt; TS.\n\nH3.5.3 If the fact that in VS interviews nearby others cannot hear the responses determines how participants feel about how nearby others affected answers, then participants in VS interviews will report having been affected by nearby others less than in VM interviews, and potentially as little as in TS interviews:  VM &gt; VS &gt;= TS.\n\nHypotheses 3.6: Perceived question sensitivity\n\nH3.6.1: Perceived question sensitivity in VM vs. TS\n\nBecause VM interviews involve a live potentially judgmental human interviewer, participants should report that questions in VM interviews felt more sensitive than questions in TS interviews. \n\nH3.6.2: Perceived question sensitivity in VS relative to VM and TS\n\nH3.6.2.1 If the interviewer\u2019s moving face and audible questions reading is what affects participants\u2019 feelings about the questions\u2019 sensitivity, then participants in VS interviews will rate the questions as more sensitive than participants in TS interviews do, and potentially as much as in VM: VM &gt;= VS  &gt; TS.\n\nH3.6.2.2 If the self-administration of responses in VS interviews is what affects participants' feelings about the questions\u2019 sensitivity, then participants in VS interviews will rate the questions as less sensitive than participants in VM interviews do, and potentially as non-sensitive as in TS interviews:  VM &gt; VS &gt;= TS.\n\nHypotheses 4:  Interviewer effects in VM and VS\n\nWhen interviewers are involved in data collection, survey responses collected by the same interviewer may be correlated, due to observable interviewer characteristics and interviewer actions during the data collection. This results in variance of estimates between interviewers, which is an undesirable byproduct of the data collection process. These within-interviewer correlations (i.e., between-interviewer variance components) inflate the variances of descriptive survey estimates. \n\nThe design of the study allows focused testing of hypotheses about interviewer effects across modes because the VS interviews use recordings of the very same interviewers who administer the VM interviews. Differences in interviewer effects across modes thus can\u2019t be because the VM and VS interviewers differ in their characteristics or (broadly) behaviors (although VM interviewers can adjust and tailor their behaviors for particular respondents, while VS recordings are identical in every administration).\n\nH4.1 Because interviewer behavior (question reading, nonverbal reactions that might convey judgment) can vary more in VM than VS, individual interviewers will affect response distributions and the measures of data quality tested in Hypotheses 1 and 2 more in VM than VS. (Average ICC--that is, summarized over questions--will be higher in VM than VS).\n\nH4.2 Because VM interviewers can adjust their style, speed and responsivity to individual respondent needs (increasing within-interviewer variability relative to the fixed behaviors interviewers display in VS), individual interviewers will affect response distributions and the measures of data quality tested in Hypotheses 1 and 2 more in VS than in VM.  That is, differences between interviewers may be amplified in VS because exactly the same differences between interviewers occur in all interviews and thus cannot be mitigated.\n", "q3": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled trials.", "q4": ["For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to which they have been assigned."], "q5": "Interviewers (VM) do not know beforehand who the participants will be.\n", "q7": "Assignment to Mode:\n\nPotential respondents recruited from the CloudResearch online panel were randomized to one of three modes (VM, VS or TS) blocked by age, gender, race, and education (see Sample Size description). Due to the expected difference in response rates by mode (we expect VM to have the lowest response rate), panel members were randomly assigned to VM at a higher rate (VM:VS:TS = 60:20:20). Once VS and TS were completed, all remaining potential respondents were assigned to VM. This randomization was done by CloudResearch (TurkPrime) prior to the respondents answering any survey questions.\n\nParticipants recruited through MICHR were assigned to experimental conditions strategically (not randomly), filling the demographic quotas that the CloudResearch VM recruitment had not filled, and adding additional participants to the VS and TS conditions so that both CloudResearch and MICHR recruitment sources would be represented in all conditions in the final data set. Because demographic balance in VS and TS was good coming out of CloudResearch we will randomly assign remaining MICHR cases (determined by remaining budget) to VS and TS. \n\nParticipants recruited via ABS were randomized to one of the three modes (VM, VS, or TS). Due to the expected difference in response rates by mode (we expect VM to have the lowest response rate), twice as many addresses were sent invitations to participate in VM than were sent invitations to participate in VS and TS (VM:VS:TS = 50:25:25). \n\nAssignment to Interviewer:\n\nIn VS, respondents were randomly assigned to recorded video interviewers using blocking by interviewer. Interviewer names were repeatedly randomized in sets of 10 (the number of interviewers selected at the beginning of the project) and the interviewer assignment was made by pulling the next name in the table. Each respondent is assigned to one recorded interviewer.\n\nFully random assignment of respondents to interviewers in VM proved not to be feasible logistically because of limitations from interviewer schedules; completing the cases in the VM condition required relaxing the constraint of random assignment to allow respondents to select interview times from the full set of available interviewer slots rather than from the interviewer to whom they had been assigned under the initial randomization scheme. Any resulting socio-demographic imbalances of respondents across interviewers will be accounted for analytically as outlined in the Analysis Plan section. Where appropriate, all analyses will directly address clustering by interviewers.\n\nFor CloudResearch respondents assigned to VM in the first three replicates (see Data Collection Procedures), random assignment to interviewer was also done using blocking by interviewer. When respondents scheduled an interview appointment, they only saw the availability of the interviewer to whom they were assigned, thus limiting the windows in which they could schedule appointments. For additional respondents assigned to VM to be recruited by CloudResearch, a strategic (non-random) approach to interviewer assignment will be adopted so as to minimize socio-demographic imbalances of respondents across interviewers in the final data set.   \n\nMICHR participants were offered all available interview times from all interviewers, but at the time of scheduling they were blind to which time slots belonged to which interviewers. To balance distribution of respondents to interviewers, quotas were implemented that routed respondents of certain demographic backgrounds (information obtained from the screener) only to groups of interviewers from whom these respondent attributes were underrepresented. These participants were also blind to the identities of interviewers in those groups until after scheduling their appointments. \n", "q8": "Registration prior to creation of data", "q9": "As of the moment of preregistration, much of the TS and VS data collection has been completed.

TS interviews may be easier and quicker to finish, but they may be easier to break off because they lack the social pressure or obligation that an interviewer brings.

Because the response options in VM are presented synchronously and sequentially, with no reviewable record of them for the respondents, it is likely that they will be observed more often in VM than in VS or TS.

Not all of the measures will be computed at all three levels. Table 2 in the attached document (preregistration_tables.docx) summarizes which measures are computed at these levels. \n\nThe description of the variables measured will be organized by the hypotheses they will be used to test in the following sections. \n\nHypothesis 1: Satisficing\n\nOutcome measures: Straightlining, rounding and speeding\n\na. Straightlining\n\nWhen respondents straightline, they select the same response for multiple questions that use the same response scale in a row (e.g., selecting \u201cStrongly agree\u201d for five questions in a row). In general, variation in responses to questions with the same response scale is considered evidence of more conscientious responding and better data quality.\nThis study uses three batteries of questions to allow measurement of straightlining, on the topics of diet, materialism, and sports. In each battery the response options are the same for each item. For example, in the diet battery the items are these:  \n\nNow we'd like to ask you some questions specific to your diet. How much do you favor or oppose engaging in...\nAvoiding \"fast food\"?\nMaintaining a healthy diet?\nMonitoring cholesterol levels closely?\nEmphasizing the taste of food rather than its nutritional value?\nPaying close attention to the nutritional information on food packaging?\nLimiting the amount of red meat in your diet?\nBalancing one's diet across the key food groups?\n\nFor all items the response options are: Strongly agree, somewhat agree, neither agree nor disagree, somewhat disagree, or strongly disagree.\n\nThe diet battery (7 questions) and the sports battery (4 questions) include items keyed in the opposite direction (reverse wording), while items in the materialism battery (6 questions) are all worded in the same direction.\n\nStraightlining will be measured in the following ways, reflecting more and less stringent definitions:  \n\nStraightlining: A respondent is considered to have straightlined if they chose the same response for all items in a battery. This is a binary variable, where 1 indicates the presence of straightlining and 0 indicates the absence of straightlining. This is measured at the item battery level. \n\nNear straightlining: A respondent is considered to have straightlined if they chose the same response for all but one item in any one of the three batteries. (For this measure we do not distinguish between batteries with and without reverse wording, although straightlining may reflect different underlying processes for these two types of batteries).   This is a binary variable, where 1 indicates the presence of near straightlining and 0 indicates the absence of near straightlining.\n\nOverall straightlining: In how many of the three batteries did straightlining happen? This is an ordered categorical variable which can take a value of 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nOverall near straightlining : In how many of the three batteries did near straightlining happen? This is an ordered categorical variable which can take a value of 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nb. Rounding\n\nThis study includes 7 non-sensitive open numerical questions that allow measurement of rounding. Rounding will be measured in two ways.\nRounding to the nearest 5: A respondent is considered to have rounded if their answer is divisible by 5 (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.). \n\nRounding to the nearest 10: A respondent is considered to have rounded if their answer is divisible by 10 (e.g., 10, 20, 30, etc.). \n\nIn both cases an indicator of rounding will be created for each question, where 1 means \u2018rounding\u2019 and 0 means \u2018no rounding\u2019. Rounding will be assessed in two ways:\n\nPercentage of rounded responses: For each respondent, the percentage of responses out of the 7 that are rounded (either to the nearest 5 or the nearest 10).  \n\nItem-level analyses: for each of the 7 items, the percentage of respondents rounding. \n\nc. Speeding\n\nSpeeding (answering faster than conscientious responding allows) will be measured in two ways.\nTotal completion time for the main interview \nItem-level completion time (directly available in VS and TS, and inferrable in VM from interviewer response entry time).\n\nHypothesis 2. Disclosure \n\nThe survey includes 12 questions that allow measurement of levels of disclosure. For these questions disclosure will be measured in several different ways, at several different levels.\n\nDisclosure: Respondent level\nPercentage of the 12 items for which a sensitive response option was selected.  Responses are classified as sensitive based on panelist ratings of the extent to which each response option is considered sensitive. An indicator of disclosure will be created where \u201c1\u201d indicates the respondent chose a sensitive response option and \u201c0\u201d indicates that the respondent did not. (The exact cutoff for assigning each response as sensitive or not will be determined based on the response distributions observed; previous efforts using this approach have observed that selecting a cutoff of 40% or 50% of panelists having judged a response option as sensitive maximizes the possible comparison options, but this will have to be determined empirically from the current data set. Starting cutoff values will be set at 50% (a response will be considered sensitive if &gt;50% of panelists judged that most poeple would be somewhat or very uncomfortable to give the response); if a different cutoff strategy is needed to more clearly discriminate across conditions given the distribution of responses in our data set, we will report the reasoning for changing to that cutoff.   \nAverage level of sensitivity of responses across all 12 questions. Sensitivity ratings from the online panel will be used to quantify the sensitivity of each response.\nAttached as an Appendix B  to this document is a list of the questions and the associated sensitive response options. \n\nDisclosure: Item level\nPercentage of respondents who selected a sensitive response for each item. \nResponses will be classified as sensitive or not based on the response sensitivity cutoff used in the respondent-level measure. For this level of analysis, we will append the item characteristic (i.e. HH, or LH) as a covariate. \nAverage level of sensitivity of responses for each item. Sensitivity ratings from the online panel will be used to quantify the sensitivity of each response.\n\nDisclosure: Response level\nThis is measured by the selection of the response option for each item. It is a binary indicator of 1 \u2013 selected, and 0 \u2013 not selected. \n\nThe sensitivity ratings will be appended to this pre-registration in Appendix B. Measures of the prevalence of every response to every item intended to measure disclosure is also provided in Appendix B. The data structure for disclosure at the respondent level, item level and response option level is described in Table 4 in the attached preregistration_tables.docx\n\nHypotheses 3: Respondent subjective experience\n\nOutcome measures: Satisfaction, comfort, personal connection, subjective honesty, \nsubjective privacy, effect of nearby others, perceived question sensitivity.\n\nThe questions measuring these subjective experiences are included in Appendix A. \n\nSatisfaction: Percentage of respondents who report each of five levels of satisfaction with the interview on the 5-point scale (\u201cNot at all satisfied\u201d to \u201cVery satisfied\u201d).\n\nComfort: Percentage of respondents who report each of five levels of having been comfortable with the interviewer on the 5-point scale from \u201cNot at all comfortable\u201d to \u201cVery comfortable (measurable in VM and VS, but not TS)\n\nPersonal connection:  Percentage of respondents who report each of five levels of having been personally connected with the interviewer on the 5-point scale from \u201cDistant\u201d to \u201cClose\u201d (measurable in VM and VS, but not TS)\n\nSubjective honesty: Percentage of respondents who report each of four levels of having been able to answer the questions honestly, on a four point scale of \u201cAlways\u201d, \u201cMost of the time\u201d, \u201cSome of the time\u201d, or \u201cNever.\u201d\n\nSubjective privacy: Percentage of respondents who report each of three levels of whether the interview felt more private, the same, or less private than being asked the questions face to face.  \n\nEffect of nearby others: Percentage of respondents who report each of three levels of whether anyone nearby affected the way they answered the questions, with three possible responses:  \u201cNo, the people nearby did not affect my answers\u201d, \u201cYes, the people nearby affected my answers\u201d, \u201cNo one was around\u201d.\n\nPerceived question sensitivity: Percentage of respondents who report each of five levels of how sensitive they felt the survey questions were, on a  5-point scale from \u201cNot at all sensitive\u201d to \u201cVery sensitive.\u201d\n\nInterviewer effects\n\nWe will be using all the items in the main survey as outcome variables for our analyses of interviewer effects. Please refer to the attached Appendix A for the items. \nInterviewer-level covariates: Interviewer age, interviewer experience, interviewer race/ethnicity, interviewer gender.\n\nRespondent-level covariates: Respondent age, respondent gender, respondent race/ethnicity, respondent education level.\n\n", "q15.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e8d48e3f135350172d5cbb9", "file_name": "preregistration_tables.docx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/9jusx/files/osfstorage/5e8d48e3f135350172d5cbb9", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e8d48e3f135350172d5cbb9"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "848f2ea79ceedf3d5783d7f40c6b912b4b0e83ff934a275e55bb6539c064637d"}}, {"file_id": "5e8d48e3f135350172d5cbb7", "file_name": "osf_Appendix_B.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/9jusx/files/osfstorage/5e8d48e3f135350172d5cbb7", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e8d48e3f135350172d5cbb7"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "4ab98a99e8f38a33a7bbb72d54bdb7d7c5fd83001c9df13726581036ce18cc31"}}, {"file_id": "5e8d48e2f135350172d5cbb5", "file_name": "osf_Appendix_A.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/9jusx/files/osfstorage/5e8d48e2f135350172d5cbb5", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e8d48e2f135350172d5cbb5"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "92201fea06fb123e68ffc7ced90769fc0ea9985d8c51f2e0f36b9ee4fec09f62"}}], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "For all the following analyses, interactions between the sample source and sociodemographic variables will be tested. If there are no significant interaction effects, sample source will not be included in subsequent models. Descriptive statistics will be computed for each of the outcomes by mode. \n\nHypotheses 1: Satisficing \n\nThe analyses for this outcome will be at the respondent level, where each row corresponds to a different respondent. \n\nAs there are three measures for satisficing, we will be fitting separate models for each outcome. For Hypothesis 1.3 and 1.4, we will add the interaction term of Mode*Age.\n\nStraightlining\n\nAs there are four ways we are defining straightlining from three batteries, we have battery-specific straightling measures and overall straightlining measures:\n\nBattery specific straightling: straightlining (battery 1), near straightlining (battery 1), straightlining (battery 2), near straightlining (battery 2), straightlining (battery 3), near straightlining (battery 3)\nOverall straightlining:  Overall straightlining, overall near straightlining \nWe will fit a separate generalized linear model for each battery specific straightlining measure with a binary logit link to the outcome. As a respondent either straightlines or does not straightline, the outcome is a binary measure. For all the models, we will control for age and education, as these have been demonstrated to be  associated with satisficing (less conscientious responding). We will also control for response time and any other demographic variables that prove to differ across the experimental groups. Mode is a predictor variable. To test VS and VM vs. TS, TS will initially be set as the reference category.  \nAs for overall straightlining, the same modelling method will be used, but with a cumulative logit link.\n\nRounding\n\nThere are two measures for rounding, one at the respondent level and the other at the item level.\n\nFor respondent level rounding, we will fit a logistic regression on the proportion of rounding out of 7 items, and with mode as a predictor variable. A similar modelling approach as was used for straightlining will be used for rounding (i.e. we will control for age and education, response time and any other demographic variables that prove to differ across the experimental groups).\n\nAnalysis for item level rounding will require a data-set at the item level, where each row in the data-set corresponds to a different item. This can be analyzed in three different ways:\nFitting a single logistic regression model where the outcome is presence of rounding, using item ID and mode as predictors, controlling for age, education, response time and any other demographic variables that differ across experimental groups.\n\nFitting a single logistic regression model where the outcome is presence of rounding, using mode as predictors and item id as a random effect, controlling for age, education, response time and any other demographic variables that differ across experimental groups \nFitting separate logistic regression models where the outcome is the presence of rounding for that specific item using mode as predictors, controlling for age, education, response time and any other demographic variables that differ across experimental groups.\n\nSpeeding\n\nAnalyses this outcome is at the respondent level and item level. Due to the differences in the administration of each mode (i.e., VM = interviewer administered with the interviewer keying in the respondent\u2019s answer, VS = self-administered but respondent has to watch the videos before being able to select the answers, TS = self-administered and likely the fastest because respondent\u2019s speed of completion is only restricted by their reading speed), the speed of completion will be difficult to compare across modes, therefore this is limited to analyses within the mode itself.\n\nThe analyses here will be done at two levels: respondent level and item level:\nAt the respondent level: To test the association between age and speeding, we will fit separate linear regression models for each mode, using the respondents\u2019 total completion time as the outcome, controlling for other demographic variables. \n\nAt the item level: To test the association between age and speeding for specific items, we will need an item-level data structure where each row corresponds to a specific item. The outcome is the time taken to respond to the item (the time the response was recorded - the time the previous response was recorded). We will fit a linear mixed model where the outcome is time taken to respond to the question, with Respondent ID (and in the case of VM, Interviewer ID as well) as a random intercept, with age as a predictor variable, controlling for other demographic variables. \n\nHypotheses 2: Disclosure \n\nThe outcomes of interest for disclosure are at three levels: respondent level, item level, and response level: \n\nThere are two measures for disclosure at the respondent level: 1. the proportion of items where the respondent chose the sensitive responses in 12 sensitive items, 2. The average level of sensitivity of responses chosen by the respondent.\nFor the first outcome at the respondent level, we will fit a logistic regression model, and with mode as a predictor variable. A similar modelling approach as was used for straightlining will be used for disclosure (i.e. we will control for age and education, response time and any other demographic variables that prove to differ across the experimental groups).\nFor the second outcome at the respondent level, we will fit a linear regression model, and with mode as a predictor variable. A similar modelling approach as was used for straightlining will be used for disclosure (i.e. we will control for age and education, response time and any other demographic variables that prove to differ across the experimental groups).\n\nAt the item level, the outcome is the selection of the answer (binary) for a specific item. \nFor this outcome, we will fit a generalized linear mixed model with logit link for the outcome, and respondent ID as the random intercept. On top of mode, we will also include the topic sensitivity as predictors (i.e. HH, LH) and an interaction term of topic sensitivity with mode. If the selection of sensitive responses is associated with topic sensitivity, there will be a difference between HH and LH, and if this effect is greater in a specific mode, we will see a significant interaction effect. \n\nAt the response level, the outcome for disclosure is a binary outcome for selection of the response. In order to analyze this, we will need a response level data structure, where each row corresponds to a different response to each item. For example, if an item (e.g. \u201cHave you ever smoked?\u201d) has two responses (e.g. \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d), the responses \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d will each have their own row in the data, and a column that indicates whether that response was selected or not selected.  \n\nFor this outcome, we will fit a generalized linear mixed model with logit link for the outcome, and item ID nested within respondent ID as the random intercept. On top of mode, we will include measures of rated sensitivity of the response option and the prevalence of the selection of the response option as predictors.  \n\nFor all the above analyses, we will test the interaction of mode with age. \n\nHypotheses 3: Respondent subjective experience\n\nAll the outcome measures are at the respondent level. The analysis plan for each respondent subjective experience is as follows:\n\nSatisfaction: Percentage of respondents who report each of five levels of satisfaction with the interview on the 5-point scale (\u201cNot at all satisfied\u201d to \u201cVery satisfied\u201d).\n\nFor this outcome, we will fit a generalized linear model with a cumulative logit link, and with mode as a predictor variable. A similar modelling approach as was used for straightlining will be used for disclosure (i.e. we will control for age and education, response time and any other demographic variables that prove to differ across the experimental groups).\nComfort: Percentage of respondents who report each of five levels of having been comfortable with the interviewer on the 5-point scale from \u201cNot at all comfortable\u201d to \u201cVery comfortable (measurable in VM and VS, but not TS)\n\nPersonal connection:  Percentage of respondents who report each of five levels of having been personally connected with the interviewer on the 5-point scale from \u201cDistant\u201d to \u201cClose\u201d (measurable in VM and VS, but not TS)\n\nFor outcomes b, and c, we will fit a generalized linear model with a cumulative logit link, and with mode as a predictor variable. A similar modelling approach as above, but as these questions are not asked in TS, these will only be fit on the data from the VS and VM mode. \nSubjective honesty: Percentage of respondents who report each of four levels of having been able to answer the questions honestly, on a four point scale of \u201cAlways\u201d, \u201cMost of the time\u201d, \u201cSome of the time\u201d, or \u201cNever.\u201d\n\nFor this outcome, we will fit a generalized linear model with a cumulative logit link, and with mode as a predictor variable. A similar modelling approach as was used for straightlining will be used for disclosure (i.e. we will control for age and education, response time and any other demographic variables that prove to differ across the experimental groups).\nSubjective privacy: Percentage of respondents who report each of three levels of whether the interview felt more private, the same, or less private than being asked the questions face to face.  \n\nEffect of nearby others: Percentage of respondents who report each of three levels of whether anyone nearby affected the way they answered the questions, with three possible responses:  \u201cNo, the people nearby did not affect my answers\u201d, \u201cYes, the people nearby affected my answers\u201d, \u201cNo one was around\u201d.\n\nFor outcome e and f, we will fit multinomial regression models for each outcome, again with mode as a predictor variable, and using the same control variables as above. \n\nPerceived question sensitivity: Percentage of respondents who report each of five levels of how sensitive they felt the survey questions were, on a  5-point scale from \u201cNot at all sensitive\u201d to \u201cVery sensitive.\u201d\n\nFor outcome e, we will fit a generalized linear model with a cumulative logit link, and with mode as a predictor variable. A similar modelling approach as (a) above will be used. \nFor all the above analyses, we will test the interaction of mode with age. \n\nHypotheses 4:  Interviewer effects in VM and VS\n\nFor our analyses of interviewer effects, we will fit generalized linear mixed models with each of the main survey items as an outcome variable. We will use a different link function depending on the survey item. For example, for ordered categorical variables such as frequency response options (\u201cat least once a week,\u201d \u201calmost every week,\u201d \u201cabout once a month,\u201d \u201cseldom,\u201d \u201cnever\u201d) we may use a cumulative logit link; for open numeric responses, we will use an identity link. \n\nTo examine the interviewer effects on each of these outcomes by mode, we will fit a mixed model to the combined data from both the VM and VS modes (see table below). We will use an estimation approach that allows the variance of the random interviewer effects to be included in these models to vary depending on the mode, and we will allow observations coming from the same interviewer in general to be correlated (since each interviewer is working in both modes). For each of the survey outcomes, we will fit a model with the respondent-level covariates and the interviewer-level covariates, and estimate the unexplained variance between interviewers in the survey responses. We will test the null hypothesis that the variance components from the two modes are equal using a likelihood ratio test (where the null hypothesis will correspond to a model that does *not* allow the variance components to vary across the modes). We hypothesize that the interviewer variance components will tend to be larger for the VM condition, but if they are not, this is a positive result given the benefits associated with this condition.\n\nAfter fitting the model that includes the fixed effects of respondent and interviewer-level covariates, empirical best linear unbiased predictors (EBLUPs) of the random interviewer effects in the model will be computed for VM and VS separately. We will examine the correlation of the EBLUPs of the interviewers in VS with the EBLUPs of the interviewers in VM for each outcome. If there is a positive correlation, then we can conclude that regardless of the mode (VM or VS), there are similar effects of the interviewers regardless of the live interviewing or the video recording. If there is flat or negative correlation, then there is a difference between VM and VS in the effects that a given interviewer has, and this will merit additional analysis to understand why the same

systematic review protocol", "description": "As the most common adverse effects, nausea and vomiting can be triggered by many treatment agents. Although not life-threatening, drug-induced nausea and vomiting affect the popularization of plenty of effective agents. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are a class of such agents.The GLP-1 RAs class agent has grown rapidly in the last decade due to its effects on lowering HbA1c and weight with a low risk of hypoglycemia. However, all GLP-1 RAs experiments report gastrointestinal side effects as most frequent adverse events among which nausea and vomiting rank first, negatively lowering quality of life thus reducing adherence to treatment. As an attractive option of Diabetes and Obesity, GLP-1 RAs deserves better application. If nausea and vomiting are well treated, this class agents can be used more properly and extensively.\nAcupuncture is one of the essential parts of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which has been used for thousands of years.

We administered an explicit and implicit trustworthiness task to a sample of healthy individuals from China. During both tasks, individuals had to make trustworthiness decisions about other individuals who were either Caucasians or Chinese. However, no information was provided about the trustworthiness of the other individuals. As a consequence, the individuals had to base their trustworthiness decisions on the facial appearance of these individuals. \nAs we were interested to learn how the COVID-19 pandemic changed individuals\u2019 trustworthiness decisions, we administered the tasks at different time points of the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing a longitudinal and cross-sectional study design, the tasks were administered before the first confirmed cases of the COVID-19 (t0: October 2019 to December 2019) pandemic and after the decline of the COVID-19 pandemic (t1: March 2020). For the cross-sectional study design, we administered the tasks to 100 individuals at t0 and 100 individuals at t1. For the longitudinal study design, we re-administered the tasks at t1 to the 100 individuals that already completed the task at t0. \nIt is important to note that COVID-19 pandemic and its impact differed markedly between these time points. Whereas there was an increase in COVID-19 infections from December 2019 to January 2020, there was a decrease in COVID-19 infections from February 2020 to March 2020. However, the dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic differed between Eastern countries like China and Western countries like Germany. The number of new infections decreased from December 2019 to March 2020 in Eastern countries but the number of new infections in Western countries increased from December 2019 to March 2020. Paralleling this change in infection rates, there was an increase of new infections in China from external visitors to China, including people Western cultures who entered China since February 2020 (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/china-reports-no-domestic-cases-of-coronavirus-for-first-time-since-outbreak-began). Media articles reported that as a consequence, there was an increase in prejudices / xenophobia against Western individuals in China since February 2020 (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/china-coronavirus-anti-foreigner-feeling-imported-cases). This increase in prejudices may be driven by evolutionary models of disease transmission that state that prejudices constitute a protective mechanism against diseases that are transmitted by unknown and unfamiliar individuals (Neuberg, Kenrick, &amp; Schaller, 2011). Based on these models it can be hypothesized that individuals\u2019 performance on the implicit and explicit trustworthiness tasks towards should change throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. More precisely, it could be expected that the COVID-19 pandemic led to less favorable trustworthiness decisions for Caucasian than Chinese individuals. We, thus, hypothesized that Chinese individuals would display less trust towards Caucasian than Chinese individuals over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-08T00:13:55.313848", "date_modified": "2020-04-08T00:06:30.910501", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["COVID-19", "crosscultural", "Intercultural", "trust"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "b7879e89eb82e7efd653d49add778ee259adb58afe3e69e8fe2ee525e5790e36d4c13c65df1655e17f0ec86ee77ba530fa35022cf103afc157f804bd2b2c8610c9c3666fe137d15ef1ef1a47743569ee3e129ed6b8f0b557a399f66f569496af75a13568deef0dd78098356b22975840e1d96bf0805ad12e6886001e77d32ae1c3ceb9f725b3adceec6d1d73c35305c6", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-08T00:13:55.294593", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Alexander Lischke, Benjamin Becker"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "We expected that the COVID-19 pandemic led to less favorable trustworthiness decisions for Caucasian than Chinese individuals.

I used partial-eta squared of one-way ANOVA that analyzes the association between content of contact type and perception of the hierarchy as legitimate because the most similar variables are these. First, I pretended that the partial eta-square was like an eta-square since the researchers did not report eta-square. To use this parameter in G-Power, I converted it to \"effect size f\" with using https://www.psychometrica.de/effect_size.html. The value is .3693.

Finally, the required sample size is 100. \n\nI repeated this process for MANOVA.

Firstly, to obtain effect size f, I explored previous studies that used the same or similar independents and outcomes. The most current research was Saguy &amp; Chernyaik-Hai (2012, Study 1). I used partial-eta squared of one-way ANOVA that analyzes the association between content of contact type and perception of the hierarchy as legitimate because the most similar variables are these. First, I pretended that the partial eta-square was like an eta-square since the researchers did not report eta-square. To use this parameter in G-Power, I converted it to \"effect size f\" with using https://www.psychometrica.de/effect_size.html. The value is .3693.

For example, it has found that positive and negative emotions are related to self-expression online. Additionally, personality traits are correlated with word use and patterns of \u201clikes\u201d in Facebook and with word use and network structure on Twitter. \n\nAlthough previous work in this area has been promising, social media studies to date often rely on outward facing behaviors such as public posts or \u201clikes\u201d which are subject to self-monitoring or a public persona. Instead, we will use Twitter friends (the accounts one chooses to follow) as a behavioral measure that is less publicly highlighted on the platform and therefore, less subject to self-monitoring. We will use this behavioral data, as well as, self-reports of personality and mental health characteristics to better understand the relationship between mental health and social media usage.

As such, it is important to understand the relationship between social media and mental health. Previous research has documented a variety of relationships between psychological characteristics and online behaviors. For example, it has found that positive and negative emotions are related to self-expression online. Additionally, personality traits are correlated with word use and patterns of \u201clikes\u201d in Facebook and with word use and network structure on Twitter. \n\nAlthough previous work in this area has been promising, social media studies to date often rely on outward facing behaviors such as public posts or \u201clikes\u201d which are subject to self-monitoring or a public persona. Instead, we will use Twitter friends (the accounts one chooses to follow) as a behavioral measure that is less publicly highlighted on the platform and therefore, less subject to self-monitoring. We will use this behavioral data, as well as, self-reports of personality and mental health characteristics to better understand the relationship between mental health and social media usage. Specifically, we will examine if current mental health predicts which Twitter accounts participants choose to follow. This research will help us better understand how mental health and personality shape people\u2019s online experiences.\n", "q4": "We hypothesize that current mental health will predict which Twitter accounts participants choose to follow.

political extremity (and apolitical issues). \n\nOur goal in the current study is to understand a context wherein having a relativistic versus absolutist mindset may yield different downstream consequences. In our previous recent research on RAM, relativistic mindsets predict positive outcomes in politics such as increased empathy toward political opponents, less dehumanization, etc, compared to absolutist mindsets. However, the current COVID-19 context allows us to glean important insights into the boundary conditions and contextual variables of when it might not be ideal to be relativistic about scientific knowledge, social distancing, etc. Thus, this provides us a unique opportunity to study this using natural phenomenon and understand people's relativistic-absolutist mindsets for ways we might increase adherence to cooperative efforts in such contexts, like public health.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-03-28T21:49:36.358127", "date_modified": "2020-04-10T05:00:15.576106", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["absolutist mindset", "conflict resolution", "partisanship", "relativistic mindset", "viewpoints"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Beverly G.
