Force choice tests of adults in lab experiments on CSWL has demonstrated adults\u2019 ability to learn words under referential uncertainty (Trueswell, Medina, Hafri, &amp; Gleitman, 2013). Furthermore, eye-tracking data in these and other studies (Yu, Zhong, &amp; Fricker, 2012) demonstrate that participants who are better at learning such words spend more time looking at the target object when named, indicating that eye-movements are a fair reflection of learning accuracy in such tasks. These looking behaviours may, however, be influenced by the perceived characteristics of the object, prior knowledge of the word referent pairs, familiarity with words, and the competition due to other distractors (Yu et al., 2012). In particular, while there is strong evidence to suggest that object properties (like colour and shape) directly affect object categorisation and learning their names (Jiang &amp; Chun, 2001; Landau, Smith, &amp; Jones, 1988; Smith, Jones, Landau, Gershkoff-Stowe, &amp; Samuelson, 2002), the effect has never been demonstrated in cross-situational word learning with systemic property variations. Therefore, in this experiment we plan to use object stimuli of systematic variations in colour and shape properties in a cross-situational learning task and employ eye-tracking to understand the effect of these metric variations on real-time attention and word learning. To assess the metric effects, we will control the difference between the object properties on each training trial to create two conditions:\nThe \u2018Near\u2019 condition where the two objects on each learning trial are very similar either in shape or in colour. \nThe \u2018\u2019Far condition where the objects presented within a learning trial are very different in shape and colour.\nCritically, the same objects are used in both conditions: it\u2019s just the pairing that creates metric conflict in the moment.

Adults will be presented with 12 novel objects, two paired at a time, across 30 training trials. On each training trial, adults will hear two novel words corresponding to the two objects on the trial. Each object pair will stay on the screen for 4 s; the onset of the slide will be followed 500 ms later by the two words \u2013 each said once with a 500 ms pause between. Training will be followed by 12 test trials in which two previously presented objects are shown on a trial for 8 seconds and one word is repeated 4 times. One of these two objects on the test trial correspond to the repeated word (i.e., target object) while the other is a randomly chosen distractor. Following the eye-tracking part, we will conduct a production test, wherein participants will be shown objects one by one and asked to recall the names of these objects. There will be no explicit indication of which word was paired with which object. \nTo create the metric similarity effect, we create 12 objects with shape and colour variations such that these properties are evenly spaced around a 360-degree continuous space. Two objects on a trial within the Near condition will have one of the property values chosen at 10 degrees apart whereas, for dissimilar objects on a trial, the difference in both property values is greater than 45 degrees. See the following file (Metric Similarity Task Design.pdf) for detailed explanations of the study design.\n\nWe will measure how long adults look at each of the presented objects to determine whether they are able to map the novel words with their intended referents (objects).

Exposure Times and Looking Behaviours Conspire in Cross-Situational Word Learning", "description": "Strong evidence suggests that adults can acquire novel word-object relationships via cross-situational word learning (CSWL) wherein a learner gradually resolves the referential ambiguity in individual naming scenarios by tracking the co-occurrence statistics of words and referents across multiple naming events in time. The literature is divided into two major accounts regarding the type of processing that underlies CSWL:  Hypothesis Testing (HT) and Associative Learning (AL). While AL account suggests that learners accumulate graded statistical information of all referents for each word across all the word-object presentations (McMurray, Horst, &amp; Samuelson, 2012), HT accounts suggest that learners form a single hypothesis/mapping on each presentation that in a subsequent presentation gets confirmed if correct or else rejected causing the learner to build and test a new hypothesis for every word (also known as propose and verify; Trueswell, Medina, Hafri, &amp; Gleitman, 2013).\n\nPreviously, Trueswell et al. (2013) paired novel words to a set of 12 everyday objects and asked participants to guess the most-likely referent for each word presented over a set of 5 trials. Trueswell &amp; colleagues found that if learners guessed an incorrect object for a given word on a trial, their guesses on a follow-up trial for that word was at chance. This happened even though the correct referent had co-occurred with the tested word in prior trials and, therefore, should have been the preferred choice for the word. Trueswell et al. (2013) interpreted this finding as showing that participants had not tracked multiple possible referents for a given word, as they did not show a preferred second choice. Thus, this supports propose and verify -- an HT account. Importantly, eye-tracking data also supported the HT account showing that participants did not look significantly more at the statistically more-frequent referent than the alternatives. \n\nTo understand such behaviours at a process level, we recently designed a computational model (WOLVES) that simulates looking and learning dynamics at a moment-to-moment and trial-to-trial scale in CSWL tasks (Bhat, Spencer, &amp; Samuelson, 2018, 2020). Our model simulations of the Trueswell et. Al. (2013) task showed similar results as those reported by Trueswell et. Al. (2013) even though WOLVES is not a HT model but is a non-linear associative learning model. WOLVES suggested that the short exposure time of each trial in the Trueswell\u2019s task only allowed for one look on average during each trial which therefore enabled formation of typical only one association on each trial. WOLVES simulations suggest that modifying the Trueswell et. Al. (2013) task by allowing the participants to look at objects long enough to register multiple associations would show a different behavioural pattern wherein learners would not restart from scratch if their previous guess was wrong, but use their previously remembered associations to show preferential looking to targets.\n\nOur aim in this study is to see whether the WOLVES model predictions hold true and therefore if it is the duration of trials (and consequent looking times) that are affecting the results of this experiment. Hence, this follow-up experiment extends trial durations in Trueswell et al (2013) task to test whether participants can track multiple associations per trial and thereby show associative learning.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-03-25T17:27:37.062892", "date_modified": "2020-03-25T17:02:28.135019", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": null, "analytics_key": "a4d8767c885175c97d1222e3a1974467d46b75b35dfd8e280832b1d4cc304250c0f96e81473423ac0863737c3d7e05ac29a5c12d5af87034046f3352d61887b95a1f9104c9e12522a88f9e9d79c11c6319bc17821f124abf3247af95360083d9253fab882ecb741d7fc32ded8488cae054b337a170cddb9e1f374cab73e0182333fb6065b969592fc016b2f6445c429f", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-03-25T17:27:37.033324", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Ajaz A.
