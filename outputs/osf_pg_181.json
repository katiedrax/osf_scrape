Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) meeting inclusion criteria were included to assess the effect of additional spironolactone on office blood pressure (BP), 24h ambulatory BP or adverse events in RH patients.\nResults\nInvolving 12 trials enroll a total of 1655 patients in this meta-analysis. In comparison with placebo group, spironolactone reduced significantly office BP( office SBP, WMD = -20.14, 95% CI = -31.17 to -9.12, P &lt; 0.001; office DBP WMD = -5.73, 95% CI = -8.13 to -3.33, P &lt; 0.001) and 24h ambulatory ( ASBP, WMD = -10.31, 95% CI = -12.86 to -7.76, P &lt; 0.001; ADSP, WMD = -3.94, 95% CI = -5.50 to -2.37, P &lt; 0.001).
