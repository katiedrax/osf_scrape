neurobiological, social, behavioural, and cognitive development (Rutter, 1972). Adults who experience severe and prolonged deprivation as a child are more likely to be diagnosed with a wide range of psychiatric, cognitive, and social impairments (Sonuga-Barke et. al., 2017). What is less known is how scarcity, as opposed to deprivation, influences the development of individual differences in behaviour and cognition. Evidence suggests that people from less affluent environments tend to make poorer life choices and decisions than individuals from wealthier backgrounds. Rates of smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, debt dependence and symptoms of psychiatric disorders associated with impulse control are not uniformly distributed across the social strata.\n\nAims:\nThis study aims to replicate the findings of Griskevicius et. al. (2013), who reported that adult participants who experienced economic uncertainty during their childhood showed greater delay-reward discounting after viewing images of recession. \nThe study also aims to investigate the processes that lead to trait impulsivity in adults, specifically testing whether economic scarcity during childhood affects adult choice behaviour, and the relationship between impulsivity, scarcity and addiction.\n \nResearch Setting:\nParticipants will be invited to take part in an online survey advertised by Prolific (https://prolific.ac) and hosted on Qualtrics (https://qualitrics.com). The survey will be investigating the relationships between actual and perceived socio-economic statuses, psychometric and behavioural measures of impulsivity, coping motives, personality dimensions and addiction.\n\nMethod:\nParticipants will be asked to complete a series of short standardised questionnaires, first indicating their age, height, weight and gender. Participants will complete the National Statistics Social Economic Status (NS-SEC) and the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status twice, once to indicate their current economic status and once to indicate their childhood economic status. Following this they will complete a number of reports on impulsivity and addiction, a measure of motivations for gambling, a measure of personality dimensions and a psychometric measure of impulsivity.\n1.

Adults who experience severe and prolonged deprivation as a child are more likely to be diagnosed with a wide range of psychiatric, cognitive, and social impairments (Sonuga-Barke et. al., 2017). What is less known is how scarcity, as opposed to deprivation, influences the development of individual differences in behaviour and cognition. Evidence suggests that people from less affluent environments tend to make poorer life choices and decisions than individuals from wealthier backgrounds. Rates of smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, debt dependence and symptoms of psychiatric disorders associated with impulse control are not uniformly distributed across the social strata.\n\nAims:\nThis study aims to replicate the findings of Griskevicius et. al. (2013), who reported that adult participants who experienced economic uncertainty during their childhood showed greater delay-reward discounting after viewing images of recession. \nThe study also aims to investigate the processes that lead to trait impulsivity in adults, specifically testing whether economic scarcity during childhood affects adult choice behaviour, and the relationship between impulsivity, scarcity and addiction.\n \nResearch Setting:\nParticipants will be invited to take part in an online survey advertised by Prolific (https://prolific.ac) and hosted on Qualtrics (https://qualitrics.com). The survey will be investigating the relationships between actual and perceived socio-economic statuses, psychometric and behavioural measures of impulsivity, coping motives, personality dimensions and addiction.\n\nMethod:\nParticipants will be asked to complete a series of short standardised questionnaires, first indicating their age, height, weight and gender. Participants will complete the National Statistics Social Economic Status (NS-SEC) and the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status twice, once to indicate their current economic status and once to indicate their childhood economic status. Following this they will complete a number of reports on impulsivity and addiction, a measure of motivations for gambling, a measure of personality dimensions and a psychometric measure of impulsivity.\n1.

Women chose the responses that best described the way they had been feeling during the past seven days. There are four possible responses on a Likert scale ranging from low severity (0 = normal response) of the symptom to high severity (3 = severe response) of the symptom. \n(Exploratory)The EPDS can be divided to depression and anxiety subscales (Bina and Harrington 2016). The depression subscale (EPDS-D), includes six items (1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10), and the anxiety subscale (EPDS-A) includes three items (3, 4, and 5). Scores for the items on each subscale are summed, resulting in a possible score of 0\u201318 on the depression subscale and 0\u20139 on the anxiety subscale, with higher scores reflecting greater symptom severity.\nMLQ \u2013 Hebrew Version\nThe original MLQ questionnaire (Steger, 2006) consists of two subscales: presence of meaning in life (POM) and search for meaning in life (SFM). Items will be rated from 1 (absolutely untrue) to 7 (absolutely true) on a Likert scale; in the POM subscale there is one reverse-scored item and scores in each subscale range from 5 to 35.

Scores are summed for a total ranging from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more positive attitudes toward seeking MHT if needed.\nEPDS \u2013 Hebrew Version\nThe EPDS is a self-report scale consisting of 10 short statements of common depressive and anxious symptoms (Cox, Holden, &amp; Sagovsky, 1987). Women chose the responses that best described the way they had been feeling during the past seven days. There are four possible responses on a Likert scale ranging from low severity (0 = normal response) of the symptom to high severity (3 = severe response) of the symptom. \n(Exploratory)The EPDS can be divided to depression and anxiety subscales (Bina and Harrington 2016). The depression subscale (EPDS-D), includes six items (1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10), and the anxiety subscale (EPDS-A) includes three items (3, 4, and 5). Scores for the items on each subscale are summed, resulting in a possible score of 0\u201318 on the depression subscale and 0\u20139 on the anxiety subscale, with higher scores reflecting greater symptom severity.\nMLQ \u2013 Hebrew Version\nThe original MLQ questionnaire (Steger, 2006) consists of two subscales: presence of meaning in life (POM) and search for meaning in life (SFM). Items will be rated from 1 (absolutely untrue) to 7 (absolutely true) on a Likert scale; in the POM subscale there is one reverse-scored item and scores in each subscale range from 5 to 35. Higher scores reflect higher presence of meaning or increased search for meaning. This study will use the Hebrew version of MLQ (Littman-Ovadia &amp; Steger, 2010).\nPresence subscale score = inverse score #9, items 1, 4, 5, and 6. \nSearch subscale score = items 2, 3, 7, 8, and 10. \nISCI \u2013 Hebrew Version\nThe ISCI (Cash et al., 1975) is a help-seeking intention scale, in which respondents assess how likely they were to seek professional assistance for each of the 10 problems, on a 6-point Likert scale. Scores on all statements are summed, resulting in a score between 10-60, with higher scores indicating a larger likelihood to seek counseling for psychological and interpersonal concerns.\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "The original statistical plan included running four multiple regressions for each of the T2 measures.

Determinants of Mental Health (SDMH), with a particular focus on what determinants have been identified, outcomes/dependent variables, and theoretical embeddings. The relevance of so-called \u201cSocial Determinants\u201d for physical health has received much attention in the literature and the theoretical conceptualisation seems developed enough for the generation of assessment methods. The concept of SDMH on the other hand was developed more recently and, as such, is less well established. There are far fewer publications on SDMH and no methods for assessing these. Both concepts are not clearly related to each other. In consequence, it remains unclear whether SDMH is a subcategory of SDH or a separate concept. The current systematic review will address this question. First, both concepts will be examined within the literature, regarding their epistemological assumptions, their actual determinants and the treatment- and tackle-approaches they provide. Second, both concepts will be compared on the bases of the so extracted definitions.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-03T08:12:29.300287", "date_modified": "2020-04-03T08:09:01.827915", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["Social Determinants of Health"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Fritz Handerer"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "70e84fc804b9ed6e241523c19dca2087210ef44d4237461a8773facd891f5a0d3ac1238e5f8d0e25ae93ae6f7213850351953deb802ea16f41b02220fb3182223e8fef5321f44b8d723a8cb63af391371841028102fe14a7418f4512667622463c1b3f90fb033917110d48b47afb26fbb283840431292e2efa71a2cadf9f8dc16eeaa46894b837e7a756b6d1e3f88c4c", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-03T08:12:29.279754", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Fritz Handerer, Dr Sara Tai, Prof Peter Kinderman"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Research question: How are the Social Determinants of Health and the Social Determinants of Mental Health conceptualised?

We collect information on gender, race/ethnicity, age, income, highest degree of education, employment, and relationship status.  \n\tRelationship Functioning.\nTrust and Intimacy. In order to capture an increase in intimacy, we will collect the ACF mandated emotional support measure of trust and intimacy. A seven-item version of this measure was used in the Supporting Healthy Marriage project and reported alphas of 0.86 for men and 0.89 for women (Lowenstein et al., 2014). Here, the five item measure asks participants to rate statements from Strongly Agree (1) to Strongly Disagree (4). Scores will be reverse coded such that high scores indicate greater trust and intimacy. In a sample of 1327 individuals who have taken our screening survey, alpha was .83. \nRelationship Conflict. In order to capture a decrease of stress in the relationship, we will collect the ACF mandated negative communication measure of communication conflict. When this measure was used in the Supporting Healthy Marriage project, they reported alphas of 0.89 for men and women (Lowenstein et al., 2014). This seven item measure asks participants to rate statements from Never (1) to Often (4). Higher scores indicate greater communication conflict. In a sample of 1331 individuals who have taken our screening survey, alpha was .91.  \nPsychological Health. \n\tPsychological Distress. Measured by the Kessler Psychological Distress 6-item scale (K6), participants are classified as having severe psychological distress if they score 13 or greater. The K6 has strong reliability (alpha = .87) and a two factor model separating anxiety and depression fits better than a unidimensional factor (Bessaha, 2015). A sample item is, \u201cIn the last 30 days, how often have you felt nervous?\u201d In a sample of 1310 individuals who have taken our screening survey, alpha was .89. \nPerceived Stress. The Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen &amp; Williamson, 1988) is a 4-item measure tapping general feelings of being overwhelmed and out of control in ones\u2019 life. Alpha reliability was 0.80 in our previous online studies. A sample item is, \u201cIn the last 30 days, how often have you felt that you were unable to control the important things in your life?\u201d In a sample of 1317 individuals who have taken our screening survey, alpha was .74\n\tAlcohol Use. The 7-item PROMIS Alcohol Use measure, developed through the NIH Common Fund effort, will be used to assess problematic alcohol use in the past month (Pilkonis et al., 2013). In IRT analyses, it has an alpha &gt; .90 for T-scores of alcohol use between 49 and 75. A sample item is, \u201cIn the last 30 days, how often have you felt that you were unable to control the important things in your life?\u201d In a sample of 701 individuals who have taken our screening survey, alpha was .93. \n\tAnger. The 5-item Anger-Short Form from the NIH PROMIS measure bank will be used to assess anger. In IRT analyses, it has an alpha &gt; 0.90 for T-scores of anger between 40 and 82 (Pilkonis et al., 2011). A sample item is, \u201cIn the last 30 days, I was irritated more than other people.\u201d In a sample of 1314 individuals who have taken our screening survey, alpha was .93\n\tPhysical Health. \nPerceived Health. The 5-item General Health Perceptions subscale of the SF-36 will be used; it assesses overall physical (not mental) health (Ware &amp; Sherbourne, 1992). Across multiple large-scale studies, M alpha = .81. A sample item is, \u201cI am as healthy as anyone I know.\u201d In a sample of 2633 individuals who have taken our screening survey, alpha was .81. \n\tSelf-reported Sleep. Sleep will be assessed for the full sample using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), a 5-item self-report measure. The ISI has acceptable internal consistency (alpha = 0.74), the internal reliability remained stable over the course of treatment, and was shown to be concurrently valid with clinicians\u2019 evaluation of insomnia severity (Bastien, Valli\u00e8res, &amp; Morin, 2001). A sample item is, \u201chow satisfied are you with your current sleep pattern?\u201d In a sample of 1305 individuals who have taken our screening survey, alpha was .88. \n\tExercise. A one-item measure of exercise was adapted from the CDC BRFSS 2016 Questionnaire. Participants are asked to rate \u201cDuring the last month, other than you regular job, did you participate in any physical activities or exercises such as running, working out, playing sports, gardening, or walking for exercise?\u201d on a scale from 1- Not at all to 6- More than four times per week. The measure adequately captures sufficient physical activity and changes in physical activity over time (Dwyer-Lindgren et al., 2013).
