The study consisted of two tasks which were counterbalanced. One task tested children\u2019s preference to learn about novel people categories. The other task tested the children\u2019s tendency to generalize individual information to larger groups.\nPreference to Learn. At the beginning of each session, the experimenter familiarized the child with the current setting of Canada, and then introduced to the novel people groups living in different countries in the world, consisting of various skin colors (e.g., People in Zoovia have purple skin). Following this, the experimenter will continue:\nNow, I have some facts that I can tell you, but I can only tell you some of them because we don\u2019t have much time. So, I am going to pick up two facts at a time and you will choose the one that you would like to learn the most. Then, I will tell you the facts you chose at the end. Does that make sense? [wait for confirmation] Okay, and remember, we\u2019re imagining that these people are from different countries and the people in each country have a different skin color!\nWe used 16 cards, each with a drawing of a door on one side and a drawing of a person on the other. The two cards were placed in front of the child on a stand with the door-side facing the child and the person-side facing the experimenter. Therefore, there were eight trials where children were asked which fact they would like to learn and were encouraged to point to the card.  Each child was first be prompted with \u201cNow let\u2019s imagine that we are going on vacation to the country Zoovia. Which fact would you like to learn the most?\u201d One fact is always about the individual person (e.g., \u201cWhat this person in the picture likes to eat? This Zoovian?) and the other fact is always about the category of person (e.g., \u201cWhat this category of people like to eat? The Zoovians?; see Table 1 for a complete list of novel names). The order of the singular noun versus plural noun is counterbalanced. \nTendency to Generalize. In this task, children were shown a dot scale denoting \u201cAll\u201d, \u201cLots\u201d, \u201cSome\u201d, and \u201cFew\u201d. The children were taught what the scale represented and how to use it. The next part of the task introduced children to real pictures of people who were the same gender as a child but were either African-American or Asian depending on the child\u2019s race. If the child was non-Black then we would first present them with an African-American face and ask the child \u201cdoes this person belong to the same group as you?\u201d. If they answered \u201cyes\u201d, then the experiment continues with the African-American faces. If they answered \u201cno\u201d, then the child is shown an Asian face and asked again, \u201cdoes this person belong to the same group as you?\u201d. If the child was Black then they were shown a picture of an Asian face and asked \u201cdoes this person belong to the same group as you?\u201d. The purpose of not including Caucasian faces was to ensure that children were always asked to generalize about an outgroup. This is important because outgroups are seen as more homogenous while outgroups are seen as more heterogenous (Park &amp; Judd, 1990; Quattrone &amp; Jones, 1980). Therefore, we would suspect systemically lower generalization scores for ingroups than outgroups. There were eight different faces for each race. While asking them a question, the picture of the face was held up to them. The questions asked were about novel games, dances, puzzles, and sports (e.g., \u201cThis person is really good at a game called gorp. Now thinking about the people from the same country as this person, how many of those people are good at the game called gorp? All, Lots, Some, or Few?\u201d). There were two novel questions for each category (e.g., games, dance, puzzles, and sports) for a total of eight questions. The order of the questions was counterbalanced.

The study consisted of two tasks which were counterbalanced. One task tested children\u2019s preference to learn about novel people categories. The other task tested the children\u2019s tendency to generalize individual information to larger groups.\nPreference to Learn. At the beginning of each session, the experimenter familiarized the child with the current setting of Canada, and then introduced to the novel people groups living in different countries in the world, consisting of various skin colors (e.g., People in Zoovia have purple skin). Following this, the experimenter will continue:\nNow, I have some facts that I can tell you, but I can only tell you some of them because we don\u2019t have much time. So, I am going to pick up two facts at a time and you will choose the one that you would like to learn the most. Then, I will tell you the facts you chose at the end. Does that make sense? [wait for confirmation] Okay, and remember, we\u2019re imagining that these people are from different countries and the people in each country have a different skin color!\nWe used 16 cards, each with a drawing of a door on one side and a drawing of a person on the other. The two cards were placed in front of the child on a stand with the door-side facing the child and the person-side facing the experimenter. Therefore, there were eight trials where children were asked which fact they would like to learn and were encouraged to point to the card.  Each child was first be prompted with \u201cNow let\u2019s imagine that we are going on vacation to the country Zoovia. Which fact would you like to learn the most?\u201d One fact is always about the individual person (e.g., \u201cWhat this person in the picture likes to eat? This Zoovian?) and the other fact is always about the category of person (e.g., \u201cWhat this category of people like to eat? The Zoovians?; see Table 1 for a complete list of novel names). The order of the singular noun versus plural noun is counterbalanced. \nTendency to Generalize. In this task, children were shown a dot scale denoting \u201cAll\u201d, \u201cLots\u201d, \u201cSome\u201d, and \u201cFew\u201d. The children were taught what the scale represented and how to use it. The next part of the task introduced children to real pictures of people who were the same gender as a child but were either African-American or Asian depending on the child\u2019s race. If the child was non-Black then we would first present them with an African-American face and ask the child \u201cdoes this person belong to the same group as you?\u201d. If they answered \u201cyes\u201d, then the experiment continues with the African-American faces. If they answered \u201cno\u201d, then the child is shown an Asian face and asked again, \u201cdoes this person belong to the same group as you?\u201d. If the child was Black then they were shown a picture of an Asian face and asked \u201cdoes this person belong to the same group as you?\u201d. The purpose of not including Caucasian faces was to ensure that children were always asked to generalize about an outgroup. This is important because outgroups are seen as more homogenous while outgroups are seen as more heterogenous (Park &amp; Judd, 1990; Quattrone &amp; Jones, 1980). Therefore, we would suspect systemically lower generalization scores for ingroups than outgroups. There were eight different faces for each race. While asking them a question, the picture of the face was held up to them. The questions asked were about novel games, dances, puzzles, and sports (e.g., \u201cThis person is really good at a game called gorp. Now thinking about the people from the same country as this person, how many of those people are good at the game called gorp? All, Lots, Some, or Few?\u201d). There were two novel questions for each category (e.g., games, dance, puzzles, and sports) for a total of eight questions. The order of the questions was counterbalanced.

IMPACTS IN CHARACTER EDUCATION STRENGTHENING", "description": "Dear readers  Let me join this scientific group. I am a doctoral student in an education management study program. Currently, I am completing a dissertation. The article that I sent to be read by interested people aims to explore the role of educational leadership in implementing programs to strengthen character education in Indonesia. At present the Indonesian Ministry of Education assigns all schools from the level of early childhood education, elementary school, junior high school, and senior high school to intensify character education in schools. Based on research findings, schools in Indonesia have not yet implemented this program to the fullest. Weaknesses that occur because the principal has not found the suitability of the role with the character education program. Related to this weakness, we conducted research in two schools that have successfully implemented programs to strengthen character education. The success of these two schools lies in the humanistic approach adopted by the principal. Therefore, with all due respect, I invite the reader to know the results of our research, especially with regard to the reasons behind the two principals using the humanistic approach, and how the principal's strategic steps in applying the humanistic approach. Hopefully, I hope this article will give readers new insights into understanding the humanistic approach that is applied in the field of educational leadership", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-15T20:40:35.431201", "date_modified": "2020-04-15T20:05:40.941947", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "bafe58e2902766a12e3d6ee97f7930447c4e3098879ff2bdb1e966be54f45f527441f95c93c68e38d8def47b0ae5d6f0fd2d2211a7671476c1b187e9594ba8376df882d20040b7daecea81a304bfbeac5999e2e2cf42252d5e6d7824895fa6ecd2acb8d58ed225d52e2e29a98b63af0a99474176933c2903064f61656611ed487560e31a9c65f4f72dbb766a54e3af77", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-15T20:40:35.410636", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Yulius Rustan Effendi"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "1.

If causal explanation matters regardless of the language form used, we should find higher endorsement of essentialism in the biological origin conditions than the social origin conditions (across both linguistic form conditions). However, if linguistic form elicits essentialist beliefs only when biological explanations are provided, then we should find an interaction between linguistic form and causal explanation such that participants should exhibit higher endorsement of essentialism in the generic-biological condition than any other condition. Comparisons between a sample of children (ages 4.5-7.99) and adults will allow us to characterize how the mechanisms that elicit essentialist beliefs might shift across age.

If causal explanation matters regardless of the language form used, we should find higher endorsement of essentialism in the biological origin conditions than the social origin conditions (across both linguistic form conditions). However, if linguistic form elicits essentialist beliefs only when biological explanations are provided, then we should find an interaction between linguistic form and causal explanation such that participants should exhibit higher endorsement of essentialism in the generic-biological condition than any other condition. Comparisons between a sample of children (ages 4.5-7.99) and adults will allow us to characterize how the mechanisms that elicit essentialist beliefs might shift across age.

Therefore, we will randomly select 20% of videos to be coded by a trained researcher in order to estimate the interference rate. If it is within the bounds of the interference level found in previous work, we will conclude that the interference level is negligible and highly unlikely to influence the study patterns and therefore retain all trials for analyses. However, if the interference rate in the subset of coded videos is more than the rate estimated from previous work, then we will instead code every video trial-by-trial for instances of parental interference (with 20% also checked by a reliability coder), and we will exclude any trials where the parent or a sibling interferes such that there is a question of whether the answer reflects the child\u2019s response.

We are both partially replicating and modifying the experimental design from Droit-Volet &amp; Gil (2016) who examined the effects of emotional bodily expressions, without facial cues, on perception of time using a temporal bisection task. There will be two conditions to which a participant can be randomly assigned: one with the original images, and one with reduced outlines where the salient emotional expression has been removed. \n\nIn the first condition design, if the originally recorded effect is reliable, we expect that the durations will be perceived as longer for the fearful stimulus and that the magnitude of the lengthening effect of fearful vs sad postures will increase with the duration range. Since the paper focused on fearful responses being the salient arousing emotion that was able to impact time perception relative to the low-arousal bodily presentation of sadness, this will be the only comparison that we test. The happy/sad condition will be removed since no effect was found and we want to have the highest statistical power for looking for the main effect. This is why the first condition in the study that we are conducting is only a partial replication. \n\nIn the second condition design, we perform the same tests but with the reduced images. We hypothesize that we will get similar effects for the high-arousal vs low-arousal images since this difference in image complexity is preserved and we find the original paper\u2019s neuroscientific explanation to be an unlikely cause with insufficient verification. We are also working under the assumption that the arousal of the original image, on average, correlates with the complexity of the blob image. This is because the fearful bodily expressions frequently showed more animation, resulting in greater image complexity, while sad images looked more linear.\n\nWe are neglecting to include two other components from the Droit-Volet &amp; Gil (2016): their Experiment 2 and the survey at the end of the image processing. The reason for not including their Experiment 2, showing that the effect increases with the duration, is that this component depends on the foundation of there being a reliable effect in the first place, which is the main focus of our experiment. Including it is therefore unnecessary to our primary goal, and although it might be interesting, would ultimately increase the duration of the experiment and limit the number of participants that we could pay and therefore the statistical power for the main effect. Our reasoning for not including the survey is that when using the blob-images for our second experimental condition, the goal is to prevent there from being a singular salient emotion that is perceivable in the bodily expression. By asking them about the emotion present in each image we worry that we will both increase the duration of the experiment and also weaken our own manipulation. We are therefore also removing the survey from our partial replication test of the fearful/sadness effect since we will not have a comparison. This is not a concern for us because in Droit-Volet &amp; Gil (2016) their survey demonstrated the robustness of emotional salience resulting from their stimuli selection process, and we followed guidelines that we believe are comparable if not stricter. We also conducted a separate survey to validate the production of our blob images with 20 participants that confirmed that the process had successfully destroyed any universal emotional salience in the body expression. \n\nThe repository used for our experiment code can be found at: https://github.com/wolstad/droit-volet-time-perception-study-replication- .", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-15T19:03:12.153726", "date_modified": "2020-04-10T21:51:03.660916", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "92ec5824eebd23c88136bffa7ada4ae3da7a13b67049ad12f8d5676450f9536d1b139fcd1351a8e41fabc2f1f474a14ca8b8dcc3eed148a97ea2c9949f190d6f8074549327aa1e0a74b9e56254ca68286e6e72adfd3409bf1e21c3226f5d1739c696687635466d55291554056e0513bf14993137ff9fa5598695465fd2dbac33e08c2f6c9d920ac23d22c4cfc93c9b4f", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-15T19:03:12.123843", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Wesley Olstad, Connor McShaffrey, Karen Nakayama, Rebecca Peng, Dylan MacDonald, Jan Andrews, Joshua de Leeuw"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "The purpose of the following hypotheses is to express that we expect to get results that mirror and confirm those found by Droit-Volet &amp; Gil (2015) for both image assignments, the emotional bodies and the reduced-bird-blob-images.

A higher BP for one stimulus than another of the same duration indicates a shortened time perception. The Weber ratio will also be derived to measure time sensitivity. We will conduct a t-test on the WR for each of the two emotional groups with the two image emotional types. We will then run a t-test on the BP for each part of the study.\n", "q17.uploader": []}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecac48", "text": "Social and Behavioral Sciences"}, {"id": "584240da54be81056cecac68", "text": "Psychology"}, {"id": "584240da54be81056cecac1e", "text": "Cognition and Perception"}]]}, "relationships": {"license": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a", "type": "licenses"}}, "children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=gj95e", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "gj95e", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "gj95e", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/dkzgp/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "dkzgp", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wkzhp/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "wkzhp", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5e795fc0d2833800195735d0/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5e795fc0d2833800195735d0", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/gj95e/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gj95e/"}}, {"id": "h286m", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Delegation Opportunity &amp; Perceptions", "description": "Do people think companies offering (vs. not offering) delegation services are at greater risk for bad outcomes when consumers have bad purchase experiences?

metaethics maintain that moral statements do not serve to describe the world, but that their function instead is to express that the speaker is in a certain conative or affective state of mind. \n\nThe contrast between moral and non-moral statements is sometimes presented as the idea that, whereas non-moral statements express cognitive mental states such as belief, moral statements express non-cognitive mental states, such as approval. Moreover, the latter express non-cognitive states in the same way that non-moral statements express beliefs. This is Schroeder's 'Parity Thesis':\n\n'[M]oral sentences are related to noncognitive, desire\u2010like states of mind in the same way that ordinary descriptive sentences are related to ordinary beliefs\u2014they express them. (Schroeder, 2008, p. 3). \n\nThe Parity Thesis makes a testable prediction: if moral assertions express non-cognitive attitudes in the same way that non-moral assertions express beliefs, then whatever relations hold between non-moral assertions and belief ascriptions should hold as well between moral assertions and ascriptions of the relevant non-cognitive attitudes. In particular, just as certain combinations of non-moral assertions and belief ascriptions generate so-called Moore paradoxes (1), similar combinations of moral assertions and ascriptions of non-cognitive attitudes ought to generate analogously unacceptable constructions (2).\n\n(1) Murder is wrong but I don\u2019t think it is wrong.\n(2) Murder is wrong but I don\u2019t disapprove of it.\n\nWoods (2014) claims that this is not the case: sentences like (2) are not unacceptable in the same way that Moorean paradoxes are. He argues that this constitutes a major blow to the Parity Thesis. Woods, however, bases his claim that sentences like (2) are acceptable on his intuitions. But intuitions vary, and not everyone agrees with Woods on this score. \n\nThe purpose of our study is to empirically test the acceptability of sentences like (2), and thereby provide empirical evidence that speaks to Wood's claim, the Parity Thesis, and the connection between moral language and non-cognitive attitudes that is the focus of much contemporary literature on metaethics and philosophy of language.\n\nIn a previous study, we tested the acceptability of constructions exactly like (2) (https://osf.io/vwekq/?view_only=d5281af405f54493a67cb3c2759d76ac). In this follow-up study, we will test the acceptability of the following variant of (2): \n\n(2') Murder is wrong, that's how I personally feel about it, but I don\u2019t disapprove of it. \n\nThe rationale behind this choice is the following: often, a sentence like 'murder is wrong' can have a so-called 'exocentric' interpretation, where the perspective or standards that matter for evaluating the sentence are not the speaker's, but someone else's. For example, an anthropologist commenting on the practices of a certain community could say 'murder is wrong' to describe the moral practices of that community, even if the anthropologist themself doesn't share that judgment. \n\nMore importantly, under such exocentric use, it would make perfect sense to say something like (2): after all, if the speaker is speaking exocentrically and does not agree with the first conjunct, they could very well couple that with a denial of disapproving of murder. Thus, if a participant interprets the first conjunct of (2) exocentrically, then it should be rather easy to accept the whole construction as acceptable (perhaps the same thing applies to (1), but we are not sure about it). \n\nIn order to control for this interpretation, and make sure that participants do not interpret a sentence like (2) exocentrically, we are adding the appositive phrase 'that's how I personally feel about it' throughout all the items.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-15T15:33:37.382217", "date_modified": "2020-03-03T05:00:15.674318", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["The authors"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "3f321d7d8aab9684e5b78ee23b95c6f64c0d369ea009bf7a15da4072ee360239ff95299557553872ddda32c2274f0374e75db299405810466b837580b800c9608559a0d92183abbd89cb1db8e165db8caee9f2cd80a42683134999b540a57e2b1a8c57d9fe4425c758e2763523f74c76221b66e41ef53979d5e1b9bde653537bf55925fa2c5a4098ad2e51d3c0b89706", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-15T15:33:37.354275", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Andres Soria Ruiz, Nils Franz\u00e9n, Mora Maldonado"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "We have two hypothesis: either sentences like (2') (henceforth 'evaluative incoherencies') are acceptable or they are not.  \n\nTo test these hypotheses, we will study the acceptability of statements constructed following this template: where x is an individual-referring term and A is a propositional attitude verb,\n\nMurder is wrong, that's how I personally feel about it, but x does not A {that murder is wrong / murder}.\n\nWe will manipulate two factors on constructions that follow this template:\n(a) Attitude: A will stand for 'think' or 'disapprove of' (thus the variability between assigning a full propositional clause or just a noun)\n(b) Person: x will be the speaker ('I') or a third person ('Ann')\n\nThis two-way manipulation generates the following four statement-types:\n\n(1) Murder is wrong, that's how I personally feel about it, but I don't think that it is wrong.           \n(= Moore paradox)\n(2) Murder is wrong, that's how I personally feel about it, but I don\u2019t disapprove of it.                    \n(= Potential evaluative paradox)\n(3) Murder is wrong, that's how I personally feel about it, but Ann doesn't think that it is wrong. \n(= Third-personal counterpart of (1))\n(4) Murder is wrong, that's how I personally feel about it, but Ann doesn't disapprove of it.          \n(= Third-personal counterpart of (2))\n\nGiven the type of constructions that we will test, our hypotheses can be spelled out more concretely in the following research questions:\n\n(i) Are sentences like (1)/(2) significantly less acceptable than their third-personal counterparts (3)/(4)?

Damen, E. Krahmer, M. Antheunis, R. L. Pierce, &amp; J. E. H. Bunt\n\n\nDuring outpatient clinics, patients receive an abundant amount of health information that is often \u2013 due to its complicated nature or due to the patients\u2019 condition - quickly forgotten [1 \u2013 3]. This reduced information retention is known to affect patients\u2019 understanding of their medical condition and their treatment. For this reason, patients often decide to record the clinical consultation for later reference, with or without the physicians\u2019 knowing or approval [4]. Previous literature reviews identified the healthcare related benefits of recording doctor-patient consultations, as well as the possible barriers and facilitators of implementing the practice [5,6,7]. These reviews, however, focused either solely on consultation recordings in oncology [5], or they did not address the barriers and facilitators clinicians face when deciding to make and share the recordings with their patients [6]. Furthermore, the most recent review restricted their search to specific study interventions, and they did not provide in-depth information about the type and format of the consultations and applications used to make and share the recordings, nor about the applicable laws that affected patients\u2019 and clinicians\u2019 concerns and decisions [7]. The central aim of this scoping review is to provide this in-depth information in two subsequent steps, without restricting the literature search to specific study interventions. \n\nThe first aim of this scoping review is to synthesize existing knowledge about the barriers and facilitators patients and care providers face when deciding to make audio-recordings of clinical outpatient consultations for later reference. Secondly, we aim to synthesize existing knowledge about the clinical effects of making and sharing these audio-recorded consultations for later reference. Questions guiding this review are: What are patients\u2019 and care providers\u2019 needs, perceptions, and concerns about audio-recording outpatient clinics? Which patient and care characteristics determine whether a recording is likely to be made? Who is most likely to make the recording, and who is most likely to be the legal owner of these records? What are the effects of sharing audio-recorded consultations on the quality and safety of patient care, including patient and care provider decision making, their relationship, their satisfaction with the care being delivered, and the cost-effectiveness? Which legal and ethical considerations and technological aspects appear to impact these decisions and consequences?\n\n\nSearch strategy and eligibility criteria \n\nThis scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) [8]. Our search strategy will target words for recordings (i.e., audio, video, tape, digital) and consultations (e.g., office visits, outpatient clinics, medical consultations), combined with terms that are related to either patients\u2019 and care providers\u2019 attitudes (e.g., patient satisfaction, patient attitude, attitude of health personal), decision making processes (e.g., choice behavior, patient participation, shared decision making), or health care outcomes (e.g., quality of life, quality of healthcare).\n\nIn April 2020, we will search the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Grey Literature databases identified through Grey Matters. We will also hand search the reference list of all primary and review articles. We will exclude literature reviews, but we will include practice briefs, fact sheets, white papers, and peer-reviewed publications (including conference proceedings) focusing on any type of population or study design (e.g., qualitative, quantitative, mix-method studies). We will search for articles from inception till 2020, with no language restrictions. \n\nTo be included in the review, papers need to focus on patients\u2019 and care providers\u2019 considerations towards taping clinical consultations for later reference. Papers should either specify patients\u2019- or care providers\u2019 perceptions and attitudes towards making these recordings, or focus on the perceived or examined benefits or costs related to the making and sharing of these recordings with patients and clinicians. Table 1 (see supplemental file) provides an overview of the checklist for full articles.\n\n\nData extraction\n\nThe retrieved articles will be imported into Mendeley, and the first author (DD) will use this software to screen the articles and to select eligible papers based on their titles and abstracts. After this initial screening, the fifth author (JEHB) will screen a subset (10%) of the papers that were judged by the first author. This subset will contain a mix of excluded and included papers. Disagreements between the first and the fifth author will be resolved by inviting a third reviewer (EK/MA/RLP) to discuss the problematic cases. We will commence with the second round of screening when the inter-rater agreement (kappa) between the first and the fifth author is at least moderate (min.60; [9]). In the second round of screening, the first and fifth author will evaluate the selected articles from the first round based on the eligibility criteria. Again, disagreements will be resolved in discussion with a third review. Table 2 (see supplemental file) provides an overview of the data extraction items. \n\nReferences\n\n[1] Kessels, R. P.

The central aim of this scoping review is to provide this in-depth information in two subsequent steps, without restricting the literature search to specific study interventions. \n\nThe first aim of this scoping review is to synthesize existing knowledge about the barriers and facilitators patients and care providers face when deciding to make audio-recordings of clinical outpatient consultations for later reference. Secondly, we aim to synthesize existing knowledge about the clinical effects of making and sharing these audio-recorded consultations for later reference. Questions guiding this review are: What are patients\u2019 and care providers\u2019 needs, perceptions, and concerns about audio-recording outpatient clinics? Which patient and care characteristics determine whether a recording is likely to be made? Who is most likely to make the recording, and who is most likely to be the legal owner of these records? What are the effects of sharing audio-recorded consultations on the quality and safety of patient care, including patient and care provider decision making, their relationship, their satisfaction with the care being delivered, and the cost-effectiveness? Which legal and ethical considerations and technological aspects appear to impact these decisions and consequences?\n\n\nSearch strategy and eligibility criteria \n\nThis scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) [8]. Our search strategy will target words for recordings (i.e., audio, video, tape, digital) and consultations (e.g., office visits, outpatient clinics, medical consultations), combined with terms that are related to either patients\u2019 and care providers\u2019 attitudes (e.g., patient satisfaction, patient attitude, attitude of health personal), decision making processes (e.g., choice behavior, patient participation, shared decision making), or health care outcomes (e.g., quality of life, quality of healthcare).\n\nIn April 2020, we will search the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Grey Literature databases identified through Grey Matters. We will also hand search the reference list of all primary and review articles. We will exclude literature reviews, but we will include practice briefs, fact sheets, white papers, and peer-reviewed publications (including conference proceedings) focusing on any type of population or study design (e.g., qualitative, quantitative, mix-method studies). We will search for articles from inception till 2020, with no language restrictions. \n\nTo be included in the review, papers need to focus on patients\u2019 and care providers\u2019 considerations towards taping clinical consultations for later reference. Papers should either specify patients\u2019- or care providers\u2019 perceptions and attitudes towards making these recordings, or focus on the perceived or examined benefits or costs related to the making and sharing of these recordings with patients and clinicians. Table 1 (see supplemental file) provides an overview of the checklist for full articles.\n\n\nData extraction\n\nThe retrieved articles will be imported into Mendeley, and the first author (DD) will use this software to screen the articles and to select eligible papers based on their titles and abstracts. After this initial screening, the fifth author (JEHB) will screen a subset (10%) of the papers that were judged by the first author. This subset will contain a mix of excluded and included papers. Disagreements between the first and the fifth author will be resolved by inviting a third reviewer (EK/MA/RLP) to discuss the problematic cases. We will commence with the second round of screening when the inter-rater agreement (kappa) between the first and the fifth author is at least moderate (min.60; [9]). In the second round of screening, the first and fifth author will evaluate the selected articles from the first round based on the eligibility criteria. Again, disagreements will be resolved in discussion with a third review. Table 2 (see supplemental file) provides an overview of the data extraction items. \n\nReferences\n\n[1] Kessels, R. P.
