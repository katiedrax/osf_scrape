"description": "The 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic is an unprecedented event inducing similarly-unprecedented levels of chronic, sustained stress and anxiety on a global scale; thus, the downstream effects of these affective responses on behavior are currently unknown. Previous characterizations of stress and its effects on cognitive performance, using lab inductions of acute stress and measurements of naturally-occurring chronic stress, are arguably of a different magnitude than the intense stress and anxiety induced by the pandemic, due to its life-or-death, quickly changing, pervasive and uncontrollable nature. The current moment is thus a unique opportunity to understand how intense, real-world stress and anxiety influence fundamental cognitive processes, including the ability to flexibly allocate mental resources using cognitive control, and the evaluation of risk and basic construction of value. Understanding how these cognitive abilities and behaviors shift during a pandemic could provide crucial, missing, and foundational information about the human mind and brain under severe stress. Characterizing such effects could prove crucial to the development of strategies, interventions, and policies that address, account for, and mitigate changes in individuals\u2019 choices and cognitive performance in response to intense, real-life, stressors. \n\nTo study this, we are conducting an experiment on Pavlovia, where U.S.-based participants complete both laboratory-quality behavioral tasks and self-report surveys. In particular, participants will complete a risky decision-making task (Sokol-Hessner et al., 2016) dissociating and quantifying risk attitudes, loss aversion, choice consistency, and context effects, and a cognitive control task measuring proactive versus reactive control (an AX-CPT paradigm; adapted from Gonthier et al., 2016). Performance in both of these tasks has been shown to shift in response to affective and stress influences (e.g., risky decision-making: Sokol-Hessner et al., 2009, 2015a, 2015b, 2016; AX-CPT: Chiew &amp; Braver, 2013, 2014; Yang, Miskovich, &amp; Larson, 2018), but these effects have typically been characterized in the laboratory using experimentally-induced manipulations of affect and stress. In the present study, we propose to examine shifts in decision-making and controlled performance as a function of pandemic-related stress, which we will characterize using a combination of subjective self-report measures and objective measures indexing pandemic progression using epidemiological data. In addition to behavioral task performance, we will obtain self-reported measures of state and trait anxiety, perceived stress, subjective loneliness, and perceptions of the pandemic and its personal risk. Demographic measures including age, gender identity, socio-economic status, race, ethnicity, and state and county location will also be measured.\n\nImportantly, we will recruit a sample stratified by state and associated pandemic progression (measured using epidemiological data from state and federal public health agencies) and propose to collect participant data in two phases. In Phase 1, we will collect data every 24 hours over a 20-day period, enabling us to examine whether and how task performance and psychological measures shift across participants as the pandemic progresses over time. Pending funding, Phase 2 will commence immediately after Phase 1 (i.e., 20 days after commencing data collection in Phase 1). Phase 1 participants will be invited to re-enroll in the study and complete task and self-report measures again. Re-enrolled participants will take part in Phase 2 following their participation in Phase 1 as closely as possible (i.e., if a participant was recruited and participated on Day 4 of Phase 1, we will aim to re-enroll them and have them participate on Day 4 of Phase 2).", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-03-27T22:35:51.715528", "date_modified": "2020-03-27T22:28:36.920385", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["affect", "cognitive control", "COVID-19", "risky decision-making", "stress"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "18f09f8cb7f1de59d3b3ee08100bbbf4720e6f8d7cac6799105c0090131e8eb089546b9125ded6ee87587feb5689fa90a01e637d490d4b287922ae7f078515967ebd580dfec2011c78d9c5bb0f081b9a70947b0901e7153f4a2ce507ce4c3668ec65e5f5eda8cf52d7747ffce3926511b65ed85c313c5069756ff3014657e0df1b9cb192afb267f438f3889427fb1154", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-03-27T22:35:51.693859", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Kimberly Sarah Chiew, Peter Sokol-Hessner, Hayley R Brooks, Anne Mobley Butler, Chelsey Pan"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "We will test how pandemic-related stress, as indexed by self-report measures of anxiety, stress and loneliness, as well as pandemic-related events like changes in the number of confirmed infections or deaths from state and federal databases, are associated with changes in choice and cognitive performance. Specifically, we will test the following predictions. \n\nRisky decision-making: We will test the hypothesis that pandemic-related stress will be associated with no net effect on risk attitudes (risk aversion or risk seeking) but decreased loss aversion. We expect no net effect on risk aversion on the basis of mixed prior findings. On the one hand, increased risk aversion was found following the chronic administration of cortisol over 8 days (Kandasamy et al 2014), while another, larger study measuring chronic levels of naturally occurring cortisol on a scale of months found no consistent change (Chumbley et al, 2014). The literature on the effects of acute stress on risk aversion is also mixed, with laboratory studies finding that risk aversion increased (Porcelli &amp; Delgado, 2009), decreased (Pabst et al 2013), and did not change (Sokol-Hessner et al 2016) as a function of acute stress responses. We expect decreased loss aversion on the basis of prior findings indicating that higher chronic levels of cortisol on a scale of months are linked with reduced loss aversion (Chumbley et al, 2014). Our task will additionally enable us to separate any possible effects of chronic, pandemic-related stress on risk attitudes and loss aversion from those on choice consistency. Finally, in our recent research, we have identified strong effects of previous outcomes on subsequent risk-taking that cannot immediately be explained by learning (Brooks &amp; Sokol-Hessner, in revision). Because these findings are so recent, it is not yet known how stress may alter such integrative processes. We will thus explore the effects of stress on temporal context effects in risky monetary decision-making by examining whether the effects of past outcomes on risk taking vary as a function of stress. \n\nAX-CPT performance: We will test the hypothesis that pandemic-related stress, as indexed by both pandemic progression and self-report measures of anxiety, stress, and loneliness, will be associated with a decrease in proactive cognitive control (poorer AY trial performance) in the AX-CPT. This hypothesis is formulated on the basis of prior findings of declining context maintenance and proactive control as a function of both anxiety (Fales et al., 2008; Yang, Miskovich, &amp; Larson, 2018) and anticipation of punishment (Braver et al., 2009).

Specifically, we will test the following predictions. \n\nRisky decision-making: We will test the hypothesis that pandemic-related stress will be associated with no net effect on risk attitudes (risk aversion or risk seeking) but decreased loss aversion. We expect no net effect on risk aversion on the basis of mixed prior findings. On the one hand, increased risk aversion was found following the chronic administration of cortisol over 8 days (Kandasamy et al 2014), while another, larger study measuring chronic levels of naturally occurring cortisol on a scale of months found no consistent change (Chumbley et al, 2014). The literature on the effects of acute stress on risk aversion is also mixed, with laboratory studies finding that risk aversion increased (Porcelli &amp; Delgado, 2009), decreased (Pabst et al 2013), and did not change (Sokol-Hessner et al 2016) as a function of acute stress responses. We expect decreased loss aversion on the basis of prior findings indicating that higher chronic levels of cortisol on a scale of months are linked with reduced loss aversion (Chumbley et al, 2014). Our task will additionally enable us to separate any possible effects of chronic, pandemic-related stress on risk attitudes and loss aversion from those on choice consistency. Finally, in our recent research, we have identified strong effects of previous outcomes on subsequent risk-taking that cannot immediately be explained by learning (Brooks &amp; Sokol-Hessner, in revision). Because these findings are so recent, it is not yet known how stress may alter such integrative processes. We will thus explore the effects of stress on temporal context effects in risky monetary decision-making by examining whether the effects of past outcomes on risk taking vary as a function of stress. \n\nAX-CPT performance: We will test the hypothesis that pandemic-related stress, as indexed by both pandemic progression and self-report measures of anxiety, stress, and loneliness, will be associated with a decrease in proactive cognitive control (poorer AY trial performance) in the AX-CPT. This hypothesis is formulated on the basis of prior findings of declining context maintenance and proactive control as a function of both anxiety (Fales et al., 2008; Yang, Miskovich, &amp; Larson, 2018) and anticipation of punishment (Braver et al., 2009).

"description": "Polymorphisms in the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene have been associated with individual differences in cognition, brain structure and brain function. For example, the \u03b54 allele has been associated with cognitive and brain impairment in old age and increased risk of dementia, while the \u03b52 allele has been claimed to be neuroprotective. According to the \u201cantagonistic pleiotropy\u201d hypothesis, these polymorphisms have different effects across the lifespan, with \u03b54 for example postulated to confer benefits on cognitive and brain functions earlier in life. Using the rich cognitive and brain measures in the CamCAN cohort (www.cam-can.org), we will investigate the \u201cantagonistic pleiotropy\u201d hypothesis by testing for allele-by-age interactions in approximately 600 people from across the adult lifespan (18-88 years), on six outcome variables related to cognition, brain structure and brain function (fluid intelligence, verbal memory, hippocampal gray matter volume, mean diffusion within white matter, and resting-state connectivity measured by both functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography).", "category": "project",
