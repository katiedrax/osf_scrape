Below is information regarding the key variables of interest. \n\nMIDUS Refresher Daily Diary project\n     During one subproject of MIDUS, participants took part in a daily diary study. Each day for 8 consecutive days participants reported the events and their emotions of that day over the phone. Participants reported how much they felt each of 27 emotions (13 positive and 14 negative), which will be averaged within valence for each day and across the entire study period. They also reported stressors that had occurred in the past 24 hours using the semi-structured Daily Inventory of Stressful Events49. For each day, it was noted whether a participant experienced a stressor, how many stressors they experienced, what kind of stressor they encountered (out of 7 possible events, such as having an argument or having a stressful event at work), how severe they rated each stressor, and the negative emotions they experienced as a result of the stressor.\n\nMIDUS Refresher Neuroscience project\n     A subset of the participants who completed the diary study also completed the neuroscience project within MIDUS. MRI scanning occurred on a 3-Tesla MR750 General Electric scanner (Waukesha, WI) using an 8-channel head coil. Diffusion weighted images were collected using a Stejskal-Tanner (Stejskal &amp; Tanner, 1965) diffusion prepared single-shot echo-planar imaging pulse sequence. Sixty-five axial slices of 2 mm thickness were acquired with 6 diffusion-encoding directions at b = 400 s/mm2 and 70 diffusion encoding directions at b=1200 s/mm2, in addition to 4 baseline images (b=0 s/mm2). Images were acquired with an in-plane matrix of 128 mm \u00d7 128 mm, resulting in a 2 mm \u00d7 2 mm resolution (FOV=256 mm, TR=7000 ms, TE=68.7 ms, partial Fourier [62.5%], ASSET [SENSE] \u00d7 2). \n     The software package MRtrix3 ( v. 3.0; Tournier et al., 2019) was used to denoise the data, and correct Gibbs ringing artifacts. The FMRIB Software Library (FSL v. 5.0.11) \u2018eddy\u2019 tool was used to correct for eddy current-induced distortions and subject movements (Andersson &amp; Sotiropoulos, 2016), as well as to skull-strip the data (Smith, 2002). Weighted least squares was used to fit the tensors at each voxel using the Diffusion Imaging In Python package (v. 0.14.0; Garyfallidis et al., 2014). The Advanced Normalization Tools software package (v. 2.2.0; Avants, Tustison, &amp; Song, 2009) was used to create a study specific FA template, and to normalize each participant\u2019s images to this template. Tensors from individual subjects were reoriented to preserve the principal orientations (which is important for tractography) when spatially transforming to the template, and a population-averaged tensor template was generated using the reoriented tensor maps using the Diffusion Tensor Imaging ToolKit (v. 2.3.3; Zhang, Yushkevich, Rueckert, &amp; Gee, 2007). A mask of voxels in the FA template with values greater than 0.2 was used as a seed to compute whole-brain brain tractography using the Camino Diffusion MRI Toolkit (v. r1205; Cook et al., 2006). \n     Tracts were defined selecting only fibers passing through given ROIs (known as AND ROIs). UF were created using two AND ROIs, a coronal plane in the prefrontal cortex, and a coronal plane in the anterior temporal lobe, in the same slice as the anterior amygdala (Figure 2). A coronal plane covering the entire slice intersecting with the anterior pons served as a NOT ROI to remove fibers that extended too far posterior to be considered uncinate fasciculus.\n"}}}, "planned-sample": {"value": {"question4b": {"extra": [], "value": "Data is already collected and sample is already determined.

A coronal plane covering the entire slice intersecting with the anterior pons served as a NOT ROI to remove fibers that extended too far posterior to be considered uncinate fasciculus.\n", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question1c": "- day-level PA: average ratings of 13 positive emotion items \n- day-level NA: average ratings of 14 negative emotion items\n- Uncinate fasciculus fractional anisotropy (UFFA): see methods for how this measure was extracted\n- whole-brain FA: see methods for how this measure was extracted\n- age\n- gender\n", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question2c": "Two linear mixed-effects models ", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question3c": "- Dependent variable: day-level PA or day-level NA\n- Independent variable: UF FA\n- Covariates: whole-brain FA, age, gender\n", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question4c": "whole-brain FA is used to ensure results are not driven by overall differences in an individual's whole-brain white matter structural integrity, just the structural integrity of the Uncinate Fasciculus. \n\nAge and gender are often related to differences in reports of emotion.

The LAB currently has ~800 listings and the real problem of continuing to grow in a way difficult to manage manually. Therefore, we wish to implement a semi-automated process to help find, select, and enter data into the LAB.\n\n## Previous Work\n\nFor the Society for Computers in Psychology, we presented details about previous work on this idea (see folders 06.presentation and 03.classification). In our previous exploration, we examined several machine learning algorithms with a bag of words input into the model and a neural net model. However, this process seemed somewhat randomly generated, using techniques each researcher felt most comfortable with. This pre-registration is to take a systematic approach to finding the best predictive algorithm for our task.\n\n## Data Processing and Split\n\nYou can read about the selection process for articles in our readme file for the GitHub folder (https://github.com/doomlab/LAB2). The data was cleaned by:\n\n  - Removing non-Latin symbols\n  - Removing the word \"keywords\" from the keywords section\n  - Lower-casing all words for normalization\n  - Expanding contractions\n  - Removing a list of stopwords (the `SMART` list from the `tm` package)\n  - Removing punctuation, numbers, and extra white space\n  - There is also a stemmed dataset, but we will use the full data, as stemming may create unusual words given the context of the text (scientific abstracts)\n  - Additionally, we did not spell check the data, given we expect many words to be found as \"misspelled\" due to science specific topics, and generally abstracts should be correctly spelled\n\nWe split this data into:\n\n  - Training: all data before 2019\n    - We will further split this data into 90-10 split to train and development test our algorithms\n  - Testing: all data after 2019\n    - We will use this data to examine accuracy, precision, and recall as a second test for model selection\n\nIn our previous examinations, we originally separated out the LRE data as a separate test. It was found that models needed training on LRE type abstracts to be accurate at predicting LRE articles, and therefore, we combined data into pre and post 2019. The split on 2019 was chosen simply because of when the original LAB was compiled. \n\n## Next Steps\n\nThere are two main components one can change in our process to create a predictive algorithm: \n\n- The features extracted for input into a machine learning algorithm\n- The machine learning algorithm\n\nTherefore, we will manipulate both of these variables.\n\n### Machine Learning Algorithms\n\nWe will use the follow algorithms as popular selections for a classification task:\n\n- Logistic regression with the following setup from Python and `sklearn`:\n\n```{python eval = F}\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\nlr = LogisticRegression(penalty='l2', solver='lbfgs', multi_class='ovr',\n                        max_iter=10000, C=1, random_state=42)\n```\n\n- Naive Bayes model:\n\n```{python eval = F}\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\n\nmnb = MultinomialNB(alpha=1)\n```\n\n- Support Vector Machine:\n\n```{python eval = F}\nfrom sklearn.svm import LinearSVC\n\nsvm = LinearSVC(penalty='l2', C=1, random_state=42)\n```\n\n### Input Feature Matrix\n\nWe will use the following input feature matrices as options:\n\n- Simple bag of words frequency counts: a term by document matrix with frequency counts as numeric values\n\n```{python eval = F}\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n\ncv = CountVectorizer(binary=False, #not true false, actual counts\n                    min_df=0.0, #min proportion words have to occur to be included\n                    max_df=1.0, #max proportion \n                    decode_error='replace') #take out bad bytes\n```\n\n- The bag of words method with a Term-Frequency Inverse Document Frequency normalizer applied to it\n\n```{python eval = F}\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n\ntv = TfidfVectorizer(use_idf=True, min_df=0.0, max_df=1.0)\n```\n\nIn these two models, we will manipulate the size of the vocabulary as an input into the matrix. We will calculate the frequency of tokens found in the training text, as shown below.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(tidytext)\nlibrary(dplyr)\ntext_data &lt;- read.csv(\"../02.data/output_data/complete_processed_data_no_stem.csv\", stringsAsFactors = F)\n\ntokens &lt;- text_data %&gt;% \n  unnest_tokens(word, text) \n\ncounts &lt;- tokens %&gt;% count(word, sort = T)\nnrow(counts)\ncounts$percent &lt;- counts$n / nrow(counts) * 100\n\nsum(counts$percent &gt; .05)\n```\nThere are approximately 20,000 words in this data. We will start with the top 100 words and increase in units of 100 for matrix size up to 4000 words (which accounts for approximately .05% of word occurrence ~ 10 mentions across all articles).\n\n- A Latent Semantic Analysis space, which uses Singular Vector Decomposition to transform a term by document matrix into a vector space model\n\n```{python eval = F}\nfrom gensim import corpora\nfrom gensim.models import LsiModel\nfrom gensim.models.coherencemodel import CoherenceModel\n\n#create a dictionary of the words\ndictionary = corpora.Dictionary(processed_text)\n\n#create a TDM\ndoc_term_matrix = [dictionary.doc2bow(doc) for doc in processed_text]\n\nlsamodel = LsiModel(doc_term_matrix, \n           num_topics=VARIABLE, \n           id2word = dictionary)\n\nV = gensim.matutils.corpus2dense(lsamodel[doc_term_matrix], len(lsamodel.projection.s)).T / lsamodel.projection.s\n```\n\n- A Topics Model, which uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation to transform a term by document matrix into a vector space model\n\n```{python eval = F}\nfrom gensim.models import LdaModel\nlda_model = LdaModel(corpus = doc_term_matrix, #TDM\n                              id2word = dictionary, #Dictionary\n                              num_topics = VARIABLE,\n                              random_state = 100)\nDT = lda_model[doc_term_matrix]\nDT = gensim.matutils.corpus2csc(DT)\n#DT.T.toarray() if the sparse matrix doesn't compute\n```\n\nOn all of these models, the number of dimensions can be manipulated to input into the algorithm. We will use the same rules as above - varying the number of dimensions starting at 100 and increasing in units of 100 until we reach 4000 dimensions. \n\n- A Word2Vec model, which is a shallow neural net model. We will use the following function to export the Word2Vec vectors from the model. \n\n```{python eval = F}\nfrom gensim.models import Word2Vec\nw2v_model = Word2Vec(tokenized_train, #corpus of tokenized words\n            size=VARIABLE, #number of features\n            window=VARIABLE, #size of moving window\n            min_count=1, #minimum number of times word has to be seen \n            sg = 0, #cbow model\n            iter=5, workers=5) #iterations and cores\n            \n#create flattening function\ndef document_vectorizer(corpus, model, num_features):\n    vocabulary = set(model.wv.index2word)\n    \n    def average_word_vectors(words, model, vocabulary, num_features):\n        feature_vector = np.zeros((num_features,), dtype=\"float64\")\n        nwords = 0.\n        \n        for word in words:\n            if word in vocabulary: \n                nwords = nwords + 1.\n                feature_vector = np.add(feature_vector, model.wv[word])\n        if nwords:\n            feature_vector = np.divide(feature_vector, nwords)\n\n        return feature_vector\n\n    features = [average_word_vectors(tokenized_sentence, model, vocabulary, num_features)\n                    for tokenized_sentence in corpus]\n    return np.array(features)\n```\n\n- A FastText Model, which is an updated version of Word2Vec, which should improve with more idiosyncratic text\n\n```{python eval = F}\nfrom gensim.models.fasttext import FastText\n\nft_model = FastText(tokenized_train, \n                    size=VARIABLE, \n                    window=VARIABLE,\n                    sg = 0,\n                    min_count=1, \n                    iter=5, workers=4)\n```\n\nIn both of these models, there are several facets to manipulate:\n\n- size: the number of dimensions, starting at 100, increasing by 100, up to 4000\n- window: the size of the moving window, which we will vary from 3 words to 10 words (see http://crr.ugent.be/papers/Mandera_et_al_JML_2016.pdf)\n- CBOW versus Skip-Gram, both model types will be estimated\n\nOther models of language representation were considered (HAL, BEAGLE), but these were not easily programmed and their core conceptual underpinnings are captured in one or more of these other models. \n\n## Stopping Rule\n\nWith each of the increases of dimensionality, we will stop running models if:\n\n- Minimally, we expect to run 100 to 1000 as our dimensionality with increases up to 4000 except:\n  - Too big to compute\n  - Accuracy, precision, recall do not increase by 1%, which is our model selection rule listed below\n\n## Picking a Model\n\nThe model with the highest accuracy, recall, and precision for each class (included, not included) will be selected. In the case of models within +/- 1% of these statistics (a tie of models who all present values in the same range), we will use the simplest technique:\n\n- In order simple to complex: logistic regression, naive bayes, support vector machines\n- Order: bag of words, tf-idf, LSA, Topics, Word2Vec, FastText (although this order can be somewhat arbitrary for models of the same type, the \"older\" model was chosen as simpler)\n\nThis selection will be calculated across the testing development set, as well as the extension testing set of new articles. \n\n## A comparison point\n\nOne of the authors additionally programmed this model using a deep learning technique: a hybrid recurrent - convolutional neural net model with multiple layers. We will include this model in supplemental materials and examine how it compares to simpler approaches to classification. Because these models include many points of manipulation, we will use the model as-is from the expert, to demonstrate if the added complexity is necessary for prediction. Given our previous exploration, we believe simpler models will perform as well as the deep learning model; however, if it outperforms the simpler models, we will note this point in our paper and use this model as our prediction technique. \n\n## Follow up to classification\n\nOnce this model is selected, we will calculate the probability of inclusion (i.e. predict cases) for the entire dataset and use a ROC analysis to find a \"cut-off\" score for inclusion. We expect that a 50/50 probability will classify well, however, this analysis may give us a more sensitive score for including articles, rather than the 50/50 split normally employed by algorithms. This score will also allow us to potentially determine a \"gray\" area range for articles that should be voted on by crowd sourcing or examined more closely (i.e., by a human).\n\n## Updating the model\n\nWe will have to manually enter each item into the LAB to complete the total coding scheme. Because of this human intervention, we can weed out incorrect \"included\" classifications from the model. We will update the final selected model with new data after new articles are entered into the lab and articles are excluded. This update ensures that new trends and article writing styles are captured for future prediction.

Therefore, we wish to implement a semi-automated process to help find, select, and enter data into the LAB.\n\n## Previous Work\n\nFor the Society for Computers in Psychology, we presented details about previous work on this idea (see folders 06.presentation and 03.classification). In our previous exploration, we examined several machine learning algorithms with a bag of words input into the model and a neural net model. However, this process seemed somewhat randomly generated, using techniques each researcher felt most comfortable with. This pre-registration is to take a systematic approach to finding the best predictive algorithm for our task.\n\n## Data Processing and Split\n\nYou can read about the selection process for articles in our readme file for the GitHub folder (https://github.com/doomlab/LAB2). The data was cleaned by:\n\n  - Removing non-Latin symbols\n  - Removing the word \"keywords\" from the keywords section\n  - Lower-casing all words for normalization\n  - Expanding contractions\n  - Removing a list of stopwords (the `SMART` list from the `tm` package)\n  - Removing punctuation, numbers, and extra white space\n  - There is also a stemmed dataset, but we will use the full data, as stemming may create unusual words given the context of the text (scientific abstracts)\n  - Additionally, we did not spell check the data, given we expect many words to be found as \"misspelled\" due to science specific topics, and generally abstracts should be correctly spelled\n\nWe split this data into:\n\n  - Training: all data before 2019\n    - We will further split this data into 90-10 split to train and development test our algorithms\n  - Testing: all data after 2019\n    - We will use this data to examine accuracy, precision, and recall as a second test for model selection\n\nIn our previous examinations, we originally separated out the LRE data as a separate test. It was found that models needed training on LRE type abstracts to be accurate at predicting LRE articles, and therefore, we combined data into pre and post 2019. The split on 2019 was chosen simply because of when the original LAB was compiled. \n\n## Next Steps\n\nThere are two main components one can change in our process to create a predictive algorithm: \n\n- The features extracted for input into a machine learning algorithm\n- The machine learning algorithm\n\nTherefore, we will manipulate both of these variables.\n\n### Machine Learning Algorithms\n\nWe will use the follow algorithms as popular selections for a classification task:\n\n- Logistic regression with the following setup from Python and `sklearn`:\n\n```{python eval = F}\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\nlr = LogisticRegression(penalty='l2', solver='lbfgs', multi_class='ovr',\n                        max_iter=10000, C=1, random_state=42)\n```\n\n- Naive Bayes model:\n\n```{python eval = F}\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\n\nmnb = MultinomialNB(alpha=1)\n```\n\n- Support Vector Machine:\n\n```{python eval = F}\nfrom sklearn.svm import LinearSVC\n\nsvm = LinearSVC(penalty='l2', C=1, random_state=42)\n```\n\n### Input Feature Matrix\n\nWe will use the following input feature matrices as options:\n\n- Simple bag of words frequency counts: a term by document matrix with frequency counts as numeric values\n\n```{python eval = F}\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n\ncv = CountVectorizer(binary=False, #not true false, actual counts\n                    min_df=0.0, #min proportion words have to occur to be included\n                    max_df=1.0, #max proportion \n                    decode_error='replace') #take out bad bytes\n```\n\n- The bag of words method with a Term-Frequency Inverse Document Frequency normalizer applied to it\n\n```{python eval = F}\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n\ntv = TfidfVectorizer(use_idf=True, min_df=0.0, max_df=1.0)\n```\n\nIn these two models, we will manipulate the size of the vocabulary as an input into the matrix. We will calculate the frequency of tokens found in the training text, as shown below.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(tidytext)\nlibrary(dplyr)\ntext_data &lt;- read.csv(\"../02.data/output_data/complete_processed_data_no_stem.csv\", stringsAsFactors = F)\n\ntokens &lt;- text_data %&gt;% \n  unnest_tokens(word, text) \n\ncounts &lt;- tokens %&gt;% count(word, sort = T)\nnrow(counts)\ncounts$percent &lt;- counts$n / nrow(counts) * 100\n\nsum(counts$percent &gt; .05)\n```\nThere are approximately 20,000 words in this data. We will start with the top 100 words and increase in units of 100 for matrix size up to 4000 words (which accounts for approximately .05% of word occurrence ~ 10 mentions across all articles).\n\n- A Latent Semantic Analysis space, which uses Singular Vector Decomposition to transform a term by document matrix into a vector space model\n\n```{python eval = F}\nfrom gensim import corpora\nfrom gensim.models import LsiModel\nfrom gensim.models.coherencemodel import CoherenceModel\n\n#create a dictionary of the words\ndictionary = corpora.Dictionary(processed_text)\n\n#create a TDM\ndoc_term_matrix = [dictionary.doc2bow(doc) for doc in processed_text]\n\nlsamodel = LsiModel(doc_term_matrix, \n           num_topics=VARIABLE, \n           id2word = dictionary)\n\nV = gensim.matutils.corpus2dense(lsamodel[doc_term_matrix], len(lsamodel.projection.s)).T / lsamodel.projection.s\n```\n\n- A Topics Model, which uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation to transform a term by document matrix into a vector space model\n\n```{python eval = F}\nfrom gensim.models import LdaModel\nlda_model = LdaModel(corpus = doc_term_matrix, #TDM\n                              id2word = dictionary, #Dictionary\n                              num_topics = VARIABLE,\n                              random_state = 100)\nDT = lda_model[doc_term_matrix]\nDT = gensim.matutils.corpus2csc(DT)\n#DT.T.toarray() if the sparse matrix doesn't compute\n```\n\nOn all of these models, the number of dimensions can be manipulated to input into the algorithm. We will use the same rules as above - varying the number of dimensions starting at 100 and increasing in units of 100 until we reach 4000 dimensions. \n\n- A Word2Vec model, which is a shallow neural net model. We will use the following function to export the Word2Vec vectors from the model. \n\n```{python eval = F}\nfrom gensim.models import Word2Vec\nw2v_model = Word2Vec(tokenized_train, #corpus of tokenized words\n            size=VARIABLE, #number of features\n            window=VARIABLE, #size of moving window\n            min_count=1, #minimum number of times word has to be seen \n            sg = 0, #cbow model\n            iter=5, workers=5) #iterations and cores\n            \n#create flattening function\ndef document_vectorizer(corpus, model, num_features):\n    vocabulary = set(model.wv.index2word)\n    \n    def average_word_vectors(words, model, vocabulary, num_features):\n        feature_vector = np.zeros((num_features,), dtype=\"float64\")\n        nwords = 0.\n        \n        for word in words:\n            if word in vocabulary: \n                nwords = nwords + 1.\n                feature_vector = np.add(feature_vector, model.wv[word])\n        if nwords:\n            feature_vector = np.divide(feature_vector, nwords)\n\n        return feature_vector\n\n    features = [average_word_vectors(tokenized_sentence, model, vocabulary, num_features)\n                    for tokenized_sentence in corpus]\n    return np.array(features)\n```\n\n- A FastText Model, which is an updated version of Word2Vec, which should improve with more idiosyncratic text\n\n```{python eval = F}\nfrom gensim.models.fasttext import FastText\n\nft_model = FastText(tokenized_train, \n                    size=VARIABLE, \n                    window=VARIABLE,\n                    sg = 0,\n                    min_count=1, \n                    iter=5, workers=4)\n```\n\nIn both of these models, there are several facets to manipulate:\n\n- size: the number of dimensions, starting at 100, increasing by 100, up to 4000\n- window: the size of the moving window, which we will vary from 3 words to 10 words (see http://crr.ugent.be/papers/Mandera_et_al_JML_2016.pdf)\n- CBOW versus Skip-Gram, both model types will be estimated\n\nOther models of language representation were considered (HAL, BEAGLE), but these were not easily programmed and their core conceptual underpinnings are captured in one or more of these other models. \n\n## Stopping Rule\n\nWith each of the increases of dimensionality, we will stop running models if:\n\n- Minimally, we expect to run 100 to 1000 as our dimensionality with increases up to 4000 except:\n  - Too big to compute\n  - Accuracy, precision, recall do not increase by 1%, which is our model selection rule listed below\n\n## Picking a Model\n\nThe model with the highest accuracy, recall, and precision for each class (included, not included) will be selected. In the case of models within +/- 1% of these statistics (a tie of models who all present values in the same range), we will use the simplest technique:\n\n- In order simple to complex: logistic regression, naive bayes, support vector machines\n- Order: bag of words, tf-idf, LSA, Topics, Word2Vec, FastText (although this order can be somewhat arbitrary for models of the same type, the \"older\" model was chosen as simpler)\n\nThis selection will be calculated across the testing development set, as well as the extension testing set of new articles. \n\n## A comparison point\n\nOne of the authors additionally programmed this model using a deep learning technique: a hybrid recurrent - convolutional neural net model with multiple layers. We will include this model in supplemental materials and examine how it compares to simpler approaches to classification. Because these models include many points of manipulation, we will use the model as-is from the expert, to demonstrate if the added complexity is necessary for prediction. Given our previous exploration, we believe simpler models will perform as well as the deep learning model; however, if it outperforms the simpler models, we will note this point in our paper and use this model as our prediction technique. \n\n## Follow up to classification\n\nOnce this model is selected, we will calculate the probability of inclusion (i.e. predict cases) for the entire dataset and use a ROC analysis to find a \"cut-off\" score for inclusion. We expect that a 50/50 probability will classify well, however, this analysis may give us a more sensitive score for including articles, rather than the 50/50 split normally employed by algorithms. This score will also allow us to potentially determine a \"gray\" area range for articles that should be voted on by crowd sourcing or examined more closely (i.e., by a human).\n\n## Updating the model\n\nWe will have to manually enter each item into the LAB to complete the total coding scheme. Because of this human intervention, we can weed out incorrect \"included\" classifications from the model. We will update the final selected model with new data after new articles are entered into the lab and articles are excluded. This update ensures that new trends and article writing styles are captured for future prediction.

Unfortunately, this type of medication can lead to impulse control disorders (ICDs) in approximately 14-40% of people who take it (Weintraub et al., 2010; Bastiaens et al., 2013; Erga et al., 2018). There is currently no reliable way to identify those at risk of developing ICDs and their damaging side effects. These side effects include, but are not limited to, pathological gambling, compulsive shopping, binge eating and hypersexuality. Dopamine levels in the brain are under the influence of many complex factors, including genetics. Previous studies have identified a dopamine genetic risk score (DGRS) as a possible method to quantify genetic influences on central dopamine transmission, based upon natural mutations within 5 key dopaminergic genes (DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, COMT and DAT) (Pearson-Fuhrhop et al., 2013 &amp; 2014 MacDonald et al., 2016). Mutations within these genes are given a score dependent on whether they act to either increase (1) or decrease (0) central dopamine transmission, resulting in an overall DGRS of 0-5 (higher score = greater dopamine transmission). This DGRS has previously been utilised to determine relationships between dopamine neurotransmission and cortical plasticity (Pearson-Fuhrhop et al., 2013) or depression (Pearson-Fuhrhop et al., 2014). Of most relevance to the current study, the DGRS has predicted the effect of DA medication on impulse control behaviour recorded during laboratory-based tasks in healthy older adults of typical age for PD onset (MacDonald et al., 2016). It was found that participants with a higher DGRS had better impulse control at baseline (with no DA medication) than those with a lower DGRS. Although interestingly, participants with a higher score showed impulse control impairments following DA administration, whereas medication improved impulse control for individuals with a lower DGRS. These results reflect the current thinking that the relationship between impulse control and dopamine neurotransmission identified by the DGRS, can be visualised as an inverted-U. According to this relationship, ICDs would be seen when people are shifted (e.g. by dopamine medication) beyond the apex of the curve.\n\nThe current study seeks to answer two research questions relating to the inverted-U theory mentioned above. It is not yet known whether the same divergent relationship between dopamine genetics, medication and impulse control exists in younger healthy adults. Therefore, a worthwhile first question to ask is whether the relationship exists in younger healthy adults at baseline, without any medication, and thereby examine the pure genetic effect on dopamine neurotransmission and behaviour. By comparing this relationship between younger and older healthy adults we can not only elucidate the role of healthy aging, but thereby also isolate any further changes observed as a result of disease mechanisms and dopamine medication in people with PD.\n\nSecondly, previous work with the DGRS has assumed a direct link between levels of dopamine neurotransmission and the DGRS. Our second research question is therefore to ask whether this critical link exists between genetic polymorphisms and central dopamine levels by including measures of dopamine metabolism. We cannot directly measure dopamine transmission in widespread neural networks, but we currently predict this neurotransmission via genetic variation (DGRS) and will now investigate whether our DGRS prediction matches with biochemical measures of central dopamine activity. In humans, homovanillic acid in blood plasma (pHVA) is considered one of the most direct methods to assess widespread activity of dopamine neurons. Conversion to pHVA is the only metabolic route for dopamine and therefore total body pHVA measured in the blood will reflect neuronal dopamine release and metabolism. This measure is therefore an ideal tool to use in an initial proof-of-concept study to investigate how genetic mutations affect dopamine neurotransmission.\n\n\nAims: \n1)\tTo investigate whether behavioural measures of impulse control are significantly different between healthy younger adults with a higher versus lower DGRS.\n2)\tTo investigate whether levels of dopamine metabolism (i.e. pHVA concentrations) are significantly different between healthy younger adults with a higher versus lower DGRS.\n\n\nHypotheses:\n1)\tA higher DGRS will be associated with better objective and subjective measures of impulse control (i.e. less impulsivity) compared to a lower DGRS.\n2)\tParticipants with the higher DGRS (i.e. higher levels of dopamine transmission) will have higher concentrations of pHVA in their blood compared to participants with the lower DGRS.\n\n\nProtocol:\nDuring visit one (screening), participants will provide a saliva sample which will be sent to LGC Genomics for DNA analysis and genotyping for the 5 genes that make up the DGRS (DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, COMT and DAT). Specific mutations within these genes will determine each individual\u2019s DGRS, as outlined in the summary.\n\nScreening will allow the recruitment of 60 participants who are identified following genetic analysis to have a higher and lower DGRS (30 in each group). Participants will be between the ages of 18-40 and will not be taking any medications which could affect levels of dopamine, e.g. Ritalin. Each participant will then provide a blood sample on three separate occasions for analysis of average pHVA concentration. Participants will be told to i) avoid foods high in monoamine and flavonoid content for 24 hours prior to blood collection, ii) keep their diet consistent in the 24 hours prior to each session which will be assessed with a food diary, and iii) arrive for the session after an over-night fast. Fasting blood samples (6ml) will be collected by a trained phlebotomist via venepuncture from the antecubital vein while participants remain in a semi-supine position.\n\nIn addition to the blood samples, across their three visits, participants will complete three laboratory-based behavioural tasks. These behavioural tasks require the participants to be in a seated position, while they respond to stimuli on a computer screen using their index finger(s). The first behavioural task is the bimanual Anticipatory Response Inhibition (ARI) task (Coxon et al., 2007) which requires participants to make two rising bars on the computer screen intercept a stationary target by releasing their index fingers from two mechanical switches. Participants are occasionally required to inhibit this release response when the bars stop rising at random before the target. This task measures response inhibition, the motor component of impulse control. The second behavioural task is the Gambling task, this is a decisional impulsivity task (Verbruggen et al ,2019; Eben et al., preprint) which tests decision making, the cognitive component of impulse control. In this task, participants aim to win as many points as possible when picking between two presented pie charts. The first pie chart has a 100% guarantee of winning the amount of points in the pie chart. The second pie chart represents a choice between receiving nothing or winning a higher amount of points, however this probability varies and poses a greater risk of receiving nothing. The third behavioural task is the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) which produces a measure of risk taking behaviour (also a cognitive component of impulse control). Participants are presented with a balloon and two options. Option one allows them to incrementally pump up the balloon. With each pump they build the potential monetary reward for that balloon, but also increase the chance of the balloon randomly popping and losing any money built up in that trial. This means that with each pump there is greater risk but also greater potential reward. Option 2 allows the participant to permanently bank the money they have won at any time before the balloon pops. A simple 7-point scale will record motivation levels for each cognitive task to control for motivation as a potential confound.\n\nParticipants will also complete three questionnaires to record subjective, real-world measures of impulse control: The Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive disorders in PD short version (QUIP-short), QUIP rating scale (QUIP-RS) and the Barratt Impulsiveness scale. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment will control for general cognitive function as a potential confound.\n\n\nData analysis:\nGenotyping:\nGenotyping will be conducted for the five genes making up the DGRS (DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, COMT and DAT). For each gene, the presence or absence of a specific mutation which is predicted to either increase or decrease central dopamine transmission will result in a score of 1 or 0 for that gene, respectively. Scores for each gene will be added together and each participant will therefore receive an initial non-weighted overall score between 0 and 5. Participants will then be placed into either a higher or lower DGRS group. A weighted DGRS will also be calculated using a partial least squares method, as done previously (Pearson-Fuhrhop et al., 2013, MacDonald et al., 2016).\n\nAnticipatory Response Inhibition task:\nThe primary dependent measure of the ARI task is stop signal reaction time, as it signifies the efficacy and latency of the inhibition process of response inhibition. Lift times, bar stop time and percentage of successful trials will also be measured.\n\nGambling task:\nThe primary dependent measure is the difference in startRT after a gambled \u2018loss\u2019 versus after a gambled or non-gambled win. The startRT is defined as the time between the outcome of a trial and the start of a new trial as initiated by the subject (this decision itself does not lead to a reward or loss). This measure reflects a speeded, impulsive decision which can also be analysed as a function of win probability. Additionally, the proportion and speed of gamble choices will be measured for each participant and as a function of win probability and prior trial outcome.\n\nBalloon Analogue Risk task:\nThe primary dependent measure for the BART is the number of balloon pumps when there is a successful collection of monetary reward. Additional measures include the number of balloon pumps when there is a successful collection of monetary reward following a trial when there is a loss (the balloon bursts and no money is rewarded) versus following a trial when there is a win (monetary reward is collected).\n\nThe Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive disorders in PD:\nThe QUIP-short is dependent on current behaviours lasting the previous 4 weeks. Participants receive a score of 0-13 depending on whether they answer \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019 to experiencing specific impulsive or compulsive behaviours. The QUIP-RS is also dependent on current behaviours lasting the previous 4 weeks, these scores are rated from 0-4 depending on the frequency of the impulsive or compulsive behaviour (never, rarely, sometimes, often, very often). Participants receive an overall score between 0-96.\n\nBarratt Impulsiveness scale: \nParticipants score 30 questions relating to real-world behaviours on a 4-point scale (Rarely/Never, Occasionally, Often, Almost Always/Always), therefore receiving an overall score between 0-120. The higher the overall score, the higher a person\u2019s level of impulsiveness.\n\nThe Montreal Cognitive Assessment:\nParticipants receive a score out of 30 for completing various cognitive tasks. A normal score is equal to or greater than 26.\n\nVenepuncture:\nBlood samples will be processed immediately following venepuncture by centrifuging the EDTA tube for 10 minutes, at 2000 rpm, 8oC. Plasma samples will be kept in a -80oC freezer until analysis with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. The pHVA curve will be calculated based on the standard calibration curve according to the kit manual.\n\nStatistical analysis:\nMixed effects regression models will be used to explore associations between an individual\u2019s DGRS (independent variable) and behavioural measures of impulse control (dependent variables). Factors such as age, Montreal Cognitive Assessment score and motivation will be controlled for by inclusion in the model as covariates. Simple linear regression will be used to determine associations between impulse control measures and i) QUIP and ii) Barratt scores. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of genotypes will be assessed using Chi squared tests. An independent samples t-test will be used to test for a difference in average pHVA concentration between DGRS groups. The test will be one-tailed as we have a strong prior hypothesis that individuals with a higher DGRS will show higher concentrations of pHVA, reflecting higher levels of central dopaminergic activity. Significance level will be 0.05 and effect sizes will be reported."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"summary": "Summary:\nThe use of dopamine agonists (DA) is a common form of dopamine replacement therapy for Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Unfortunately, this type of medication can lead to impulse control disorders (ICDs) in approximately 14-40% of people who take it (Weintraub et al., 2010; Bastiaens et al., 2013; Erga et al., 2018). There is currently no reliable way to identify those at risk of developing ICDs and their damaging side effects. These side effects include, but are not limited to, pathological gambling, compulsive shopping, binge eating and hypersexuality. Dopamine levels in the brain are under the influence of many complex factors, including genetics. Previous studies have identified a dopamine genetic risk score (DGRS) as a possible method to quantify genetic influences on central dopamine transmission, based upon natural mutations within 5 key dopaminergic genes (DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, COMT and DAT) (Pearson-Fuhrhop et al., 2013 &amp; 2014 MacDonald et al., 2016). Mutations within these genes are given a score dependent on whether they act to either increase (1) or decrease (0) central dopamine transmission, resulting in an overall DGRS of 0-5 (higher score = greater dopamine transmission). This DGRS has previously been utilised to determine relationships between dopamine neurotransmission and cortical plasticity (Pearson-Fuhrhop et al., 2013) or depression (Pearson-Fuhrhop et al., 2014). Of most relevance to the current study, the DGRS has predicted the effect of DA medication on impulse control behaviour recorded during laboratory-based tasks in healthy older adults of typical age for PD onset (MacDonald et al., 2016). It was found that participants with a higher DGRS had better impulse control at baseline (with no DA medication) than those with a lower DGRS. Although interestingly, participants with a higher score showed impulse control impairments following DA administration, whereas medication improved impulse control for individuals with a lower DGRS. These results reflect the current thinking that the relationship between impulse control and dopamine neurotransmission identified by the DGRS, can be visualised as an inverted-U. According to this relationship, ICDs would be seen when people are shifted (e.g. by dopamine medication) beyond the apex of the curve.\n\nThe current study seeks to answer two research questions relating to the inverted-U theory mentioned above. It is not yet known whether the same divergent relationship between dopamine genetics, medication and impulse control exists in younger healthy adults. Therefore, a worthwhile first question to ask is whether the relationship exists in younger healthy adults at baseline, without any medication, and thereby examine the pure genetic effect on dopamine neurotransmission and behaviour. By comparing this relationship between younger and older healthy adults we can not only elucidate the role of healthy aging, but thereby also isolate any further changes observed as a result of disease mechanisms and dopamine medication in people with PD.\n\nSecondly, previous work with the DGRS has assumed a direct link between levels of dopamine neurotransmission and the DGRS. Our second research question is therefore to ask whether this critical link exists between genetic polymorphisms and central dopamine levels by including measures of dopamine metabolism. We cannot directly measure dopamine transmission in widespread neural networks, but we currently predict this neurotransmission via genetic variation (DGRS) and will now investigate whether our DGRS prediction matches with biochemical measures of central dopamine activity. In humans, homovanillic acid in blood plasma (pHVA) is considered one of the most direct methods to assess widespread activity of dopamine neurons. Conversion to pHVA is the only metabolic route for dopamine and therefore total body pHVA measured in the blood will reflect neuronal dopamine release and metabolism.
