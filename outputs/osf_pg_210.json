not at risk of transmitting HIV to their sexual partners (Rodger et al., 2014). In 2016, the Prevention Access Campaign, whose aim in part is to end HIV-related stigma, launched the U=U initiative to disseminate the slogan Undetectable = Untransmittable.\nPLHIV have been identified previously as a group vulnerable to facing stigma. In the context of HIV, this form of stigma is comprised of prejudiced beliefs and negative attitudes about PLHIV. This can manifest in three ways: enacted stigma (direct, overt negative attitudes and behaviours towards PLHIV), perceived stigma (beliefs held by PLHIV regarding the negative attitudes of others), or internalised stigma (adoption by PLHIV of negative attitudes and beliefs about themselves) (HIV Ireland, 2017). Stigma is associated with a number of negative outcomes for PLHIV, including poorer adherence to medication, lower rates of HIV testing, and decreased quality of life for PLHIV (Mahajan et al., 2008). Researchers have identified several factors which drive this form of stigma, including fear of transmission (Napper, Reynolds &amp; Fisher, 2010), and social norm enforcement (Stangl et al., 2019).\n\nThe effects of being exposed to messages promoting the finding that Undetectable = Untransmittable (U = U) remain unclear. Research on health message dissemination has suggested that the use of framing plays a key role in the effectiveness of a message (Angst &amp; Agarwal, 2009). This research tends to fall under the framework of the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM; Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 2012). Under this framework, information is processed via two pathways \u2013 the central and peripheral route. It has been demonstrated that the quality of a message positively influences the perceived usefulness of the information being conveyed (Bhattacherjee and Sanford, 2006). The ELM has previously been applied to HIV research, demonstrating that a high-quality message was more effective than a low-quality message at reducing HIV risk behaviour (Dinoff &amp; Kowalski, 1999). Whether this finding can be extended to decreasing HIV stigma has been largely untested\n\nIn this study, the efficacy of an Undetectable=Untransmittable message in decreasing HIV stigma will be compared to a message that is unrelated to HIV. The current study also seeks to investigate whether an evidence-based message will be more effective at decreasing HIV stigma through the use of central cues such as the quality of the message, and peripheral cues such as the credibility of the source, than an opinion-based message, which makes poor use of central and peripheral cues.

lumbar or hip.\n5.\tOutcomes are pooled prevalence estimates and the prevalence rate for each risk factor.\n6.\tPublished in English or Chinese. \nExclusion criteria\nStudies that meet the following criteria need to be excluded from our review:\n1. Participants diagnosed with other types of diabetes mellitus.\n2. Review, case report, letter, or abstract.\n3. A duplicate report.\n4. The information regarding prevalence estimates and risk factors can not be directly extracted or obtained from the corresponding author.\nSearch strategy\nFour English databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library) and two Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database) will be retrieved from their inceptions to May 2020. The electronic search strategy is accessible in Supplemental Digital Content. Moreover, we will also conduct a manual search in the library of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine and Duquesne University in case of any missing literature. \nSelection of studies \nTwo members of our workgroup will independently screen the titles and abstracts of potential articles, then read the whole contents to further identify the eligible studies by employing the drafted inclusion and exclusion criteria. A third reviewer will be an arbitrator to make a judgment when disputes arise. Additionally, the two reviewers will record the results of selection (authors, titles and publication year) in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA), and another reviewer will supervise the whole process.

Furthermore, the study will be excluded if the missing data cannot be acquired after contacting the corresponding author. \nAssessment of risk of bias in individual study\nTwo reviewers will independently assess the risk of potential bias in each study applying the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), which is devised for nonrandomized studies. The NOS consists of three aspects, which are the selection of study groups, comparability, and assessment of outcome. Based on the three aspects, a total score ranging from 0 to 9 points will be measured, and a study with a total score of greater than 7 points is defined as a high-quality study. Any disagreement will be determined by a third reviewer.\nData analysis and synthesis\nWe will conduct this study on the basis of at least two studies employing the software Stata version 12.0. We will display all the information extracted from the eligible studies via plotting summary tables, flow diagrams, or graphs, depending on the necessities. It should be noted that we prefer to choose the random-effect model to calculate the pooled prevalence estimates since the prevalence estimates tend to vary among different populations. The heterogeneity among studies will be quantified via applying the I2 index. Moreover, a narrative synthesis will be performed when the meta-analysis is not suitable to be administered.\nPublication bias\nThe Begg\u2019s test, as well as the Egger\u2019s test, will both be utilized to judge the potential publication bias. Additionally, the trim and fill method will be employed if the results of the Begg\u2019s test and the Egger\u2019s test demonstrate that substantial publication bias exists. \nSubgroup analysis \nIt is essential to conduct the subgroup analysis in this study in order to screen the potential osteoporosis-related risk factors among Chinese diabetics.

The problem is then finding the social welfare function that implicitly best fits society\u2019s values.  In other words, the group decision problem is a problem of maximizing an unknown social welfare function implicitly held by society. While there is a wealth of literature on possible social welfare functional forms based on different information assumptions, we are proposing an empirical approach that will predict a group's social welfare function based on both individual preferences and group voting behavior, and observe whether the group agrees with the recommendation.\n\nWe propose to tackle this challenge taking advantage of the ongoing Democratic Party 2020 Presidential Primary and recruit participants in groups to discuss on specific climate change/energy policy alternatives. The study is divided into three stages:  1) individual elicitation (30 minutes), 2) clustering (immediate), and 3) group decision-making (45 minutes). In Stage 1, individual utility functions are estimated for each person using choice data from a two-alternative forced choice task.

In Stage 1, individual utility functions are estimated for each person using choice data from a two-alternative forced choice task.  In Stage 2, participants are clustered into groups based on the choices they made in Stage 1. In Stage 3, participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms in groups of 4 and asked to come to discuss an energy/climate policy for the US.\n\nThe aim of Stage 1 is to elicit individual utility functions over energy policies for each decision-maker in the sample.  Preferences are elicited for everyone over energy policy alternatives defined by four attributes with 3, 6, 3, and 3 levels, resulting in a total of 168 attribute combinations (policy alternatives). The complete policy alternatives characteristics (including all attributes and their levels) are listed in the attached table. Participants make 44 choices, and all participants are given the same choice sets. Individual utility functions are generated for each participant. From pilot testing we expect each question to take approximately 30 seconds. In addition, participants take between 5-10 minutes to read the introductory material to the task. The stage will then take up to 32 minutes (22 minutes for 44 questions at 30 seconds each, plus up to 10 minutes for introductory material). \n\nThe second stage clusters participants into groups based on the choices they made in Stage 1. The aim is to construct groups that are a stratified sample of participants, where stratification is across groups of participants with heterogeneous preferences. This is required to prevent groups from having participants who all agree with each other, which would make for an uninformative experiment in Stage 3. However, research participants are not involved in this stage. Participants who answered negatively to planning to vote in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary will be excluded at this stage. \n\nIn the third stage, each group created in stage 2 will be randomly assigned (single blind) into one of two treatment arms. Groups are briefed at the beginning of this task and told that their goal is come to a negotiated decision about energy policy given the attributes discussed in stage one. In addition to the personal compensation each participant will receive, each group will also be told that if the group agrees to the recommended policy alternative, the Democratic Presidential Primary candidate that had the closest proposed policy to the group consensus will receive a nominal donation ($10). If the group does not reach a consensus, then the nominal donation will be given to a random candidate. This is to ensure that participants are motivated to meaningfully engage in the exercise. Randomly donating the money to a candidate in the case of no consensus will ensure strategy proofness. \n\nStage 3 is further divided into three distinct phases for both treatment arms. In the first phase, 15 policy comparisons (2 alternatives) are shown to the group one at a time, and participants are asked to select one of the two alternatives that they believe the group should choose. Each group will have two minutes for each comparison, and participants must make vote before the end of the two minutes. Participants do not have to agree before making their vote, but they are encouraged to discuss with others in their group and  share their perspectives and opinions with each other.\n\nAfter phase one is complete, phase two starts and the group will be presented with one recommended policy alternative. Different treatment arms will generate the recommended policy alternative through different algorithms, but participants will not see any difference between the treatment arms. Participants must vote on whether they are willing to accept this policy alternative for the group. Similar to phase one, participants have two minutes to discuss between themselves, and they must vote before the end of the two minutes. \n\nOnce the group finishes phase two, phase three starts. During phase three, the group must make an additional 10 comparisons (similar to phase one), however, one of the two alternatives for each comparison is the recommended policy alternative generated in phase two. In addition, participants will only have 30 seconds to vote for each comparison. After phase three, the participants are compensated and the study ends. \n\nAnalysis will be conducted at the group level (between subject design on whether groups accept the recommendation, and win rate of recommendation against random alternatives) and individual level (between subject design clustered on groups, measuring on whether each individual accepted the recommendation, win rate of recommendation against random alternatives, and regret of the recommended solution against their individual utility function).

We will also examine whether demographics are related to individual and group preferences using a mixed logit model.", "q25": "", "q8.question": "This study is divided into three stages: 1) individual elicitation (30 minutes), 2) clustering (immediate), and 3) group decision-making (45 minutes). ). In Stage 1, individual utility functions are estimated for each person using choice data from a two-alternative forced choice task.  In Stage 2, participants are clustered into groups based on the choices they made in Stage 1. In Stage 3, participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms in groups of 4 and asked to come to discuss an energy/climate policy for the US.\n\nThe aim of Stage 1 is to elicit individual utility functions over energy policies for each decision-maker in the sample.  Preferences are elicited for everyone over energy policy alternatives defined by four attributes with 3, 6, 3, and 3 levels, resulting in a total of 168 attribute combinations (policy alternatives). The complete policy alternatives characteristics (including all attributes and their levels) are listed in the attached table. Participants make 44 choices, and all participants are given the same choice sets. Individual utility functions are generated for each participant. From pilot testing we expect each question to take approximately 30 seconds. In addition, participants take between 5-10 minutes to read the introductory material to the task. The stage will then take up to 32 minutes (22 minutes for 44 questions at 30 seconds each, plus up to 10 minutes for introductory material). \n\nThe second stage clusters participants into groups based on the choices they made in Stage 1. The aim is to construct groups that are a stratified sample of participants, where stratification is across groups of participants with heterogeneous preferences. This is required to prevent groups from having participants who all agree with each other, which would make for an uninformative experiment in Stage 3. However, research participants are not involved in this stage. Participants who answered negatively to planning to vote in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary will be excluded at this stage. \n\nIn the third stage, each group created in stage 2 will be randomly assigned (single blind) into one of two treatment arms. Groups are briefed at the beginning of this task and told that their goal is come to a negotiated decision about energy policy given the attributes discussed in stage one. In addition to the personal compensation each participant will receive, each group will also be told that if the group agrees to the recommended policy alternative, the Democratic Presidential Primary candidate that had the closest proposed policy to the group consensus will receive a nominal donation ($10). If the group does not reach a consensus, then the nominal donation will be given to a random candidate. This is to ensure that participants are motivated to meaningfully engage in the exercise. Randomly donating the money to a candidate in the case of no consensus will ensure strategy proofness. \n\nStage 3 is further divided into three distinct phases for both treatment arms. In the first phase, 15 policy comparisons (2 alternatives) are shown to the group one at a time, and participants are asked to select one of the two alternatives that they believe the group should choose. Each group will have two minutes for each comparison, and participants must make vote before the end of the two minutes. Participants do not have to agree before making their vote, but they are encouraged to discuss with others in their group and  share their perspectives and opinions with each other.\n\nAfter phase one is complete, phase two starts and the group will be presented with one recommended policy alternative. Different treatment arms will generate the recommended policy alternative through different algorithms, but participants will not see any difference between the treatment arms. Participants must vote on whether they are willing to accept this policy alternative for the group. Similar to phase one, participants have two minutes to discuss between themselves, and they must vote before the end of the two minutes. \n\nOnce the group finishes phase two, phase three starts. During phase three, the group must make an additional 10 comparisons (similar to phase one), however, one of the two alternatives for each comparison is the recommended policy alternative generated in phase two. In addition, participants will only have 30 seconds to vote for each comparison. After phase three, the participants are compensated and the study ends. \n\nAnalysis will be conducted at the group level (between subject design on whether groups accept the recommendation, and win rate of recommendation against random alternatives) and individual level (between subject design clustered on groups, measuring on whether each individual accepted the recommendation, win rate of recommendation against random alternatives, and regret of the recommended solution against their individual utility function).

This was the main reason for us to register the study, and to maintain a high standard of transparency and accountability in our research process.\n\nMeasure of gender-science stereotypes\n\nAfter the evaluation task, the participants continue to the last part of the study: our measure of gender-science stereotypes. First, the participants complete a short memory task: in two minutes, they are asked to write down anything they remember about the neuroscientific article. This task was used to increase the effect of the manipulation of gender essentialism on gender-science stereotypes as well as to test whether the participants remembered the article until the end of the study. At this point, the participants were asked to rate 30 gendered traits on a 7-point scale of importance (i.e., How important are each of the following traits to become a successful scientist in STEM?). The participants then completed a traditional measure of gender-science stereotypes (i.e., How much do you associate science with men/women?), that we used in Study 1. We decided to compare these two measure to investigate in more depth this stereotypes.\n\n\nDemographic questions\n\nIn the last section, the participants give some background information: sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, political orientation, annual income, religious orientation, age, year of university attended.\n\n\nData analyses protocol\n\n1. Manipulation check\nEach participant will be assigned a score based on the number of correct answers they gave to the four true/false questions regarding the article. The participants that do not have any correct answer will be excluded from further analyses. The score of the participant will be added to our last model as a covariate, to check if the results change. If we do not find an effect of gender essentialism on the resumes\u2019 evaluations, this last model will allow us to understand whether our hypothesis is wrong, or if there is something wrong with our manipulation of gender essentialism (e.g., the article was too complex).\nSimilarly, the level of agreement with the conclusion of the article will be added as a covariate in our last model, again for comparison reasons. In case a main effect of gender essentialism is not found, we will be able to understand if our hypothesis is wrong or if the participants showed resistance to our manipulation.\n\n2. Missing data\nWe are going to perform a missing values inspection in SPSS, for both variables and cases. We do not expect MNAR (missing not at random) due to the questions being ambiguous, too difficult, or causing resistance because we (a) hide the aim of the study carefully, and (b) state clearly that specific knowledge or skills are not necessary to complete the survey. We do not expect a lot of MAR/MCAR (missing at random) due to the participants skipping a question because (c) the number of items is relatively small and (d) we set the graphic to be as user friendly as possible. What is more, multilevel modelling in R handles missing values very well. Therefore, we do not plan to do any data replacement or imputation.\n\n3. Scale reliability and structure\nWe are going to inspect each item using histograms and by calculating the indexes of skewness and kurtosis, as well as by inspecting Cronbach's alpha and item-rest correlation in R. We will do so to check for ceiling and floor effects, as well as normality of each item, and to investigate the reliability and the structure of each scale.\n\nResume evaluation: An inspection of this scale is necessary to set the multilevel model in the right way. We want to test the relationship between the four subscales of the resume evaluation, namely (a) competence, (b) cultural fit, (c) personal (dis)comfort, and (d) hireability. From a theoretical point of view, it is interesting to keep these aspects divided and run four separate multilevel models. However, if the four subscales are highly correlated merging the subscales should be considered. If this is the case, we will first run four separate models, and then compare the results to a fifth model in which the scores on the fours scales are collapsed in one score. The scores will be calculated as unweighted averages of the items.\n\nGender-science stereotypes: As our measure of gender-science stereotypes based on importance rating, which we devised based on previous literature, has never been used before , we will inspect the structure of this scale running an exploratory factorial analysis using the psych package in R, with predetermined two factors, representing gender-science stereotypes based on personality traits and on skills, and compare this solution to two considering -1 or +2 factors. We will eliminate those items that show a correlation with their factor that is lower than .35, and we will investigate the correlation between the factors to reach the solution the best compromises between the theory and goodness of fit with the data. Finally, we will proceed to calculate participants\u2019 scores indexing the corresponding items, and test the correlation between the new and the old measure of gender-science stereotypes. Based on the results of these analyses, we will decide whether to include both measures of gender-science stereotypes or just the \u201cnew\u201d one.\n\n4. Exploratory analyses\nWe are going to explore the dataset by inspecting the average scores of resume\u2019s evaluation by between-subject and within-subject conditions, to start investigating the effect of the manipulations at both levels of analyses on the main dependent variables. Second, we will explore the average scores of gender-science stereotypes by conditions of gender-essentialism, to start investigating the effect of the between-subject manipulation on the mediator. Finally, we are going to explore the correlation matrix of our main variables, which will also let us investigate the effect of the covariates on the main variables.\n\nBefore running the analyses to test our main hypothesis we are going to explore further the data using line plots for both levels of analyses. We will also perform separate regression analysis per participants and then plot the intercepts, the slopes and the Rsquared values.

Therefore, our measure of resumes\u2019 evaluation allows us to compare the effect of gender essentialism on participants\u2019 prejudice towards LGBQs in STEM across the three between-subject conditions, as well as to investigate individual level prejudice towards LGBQs in comparison to the evaluations of women (i.e., sexism) and heterosexual men."}, "conditions": {"extra": [], "value": "The participants are randomly assigned to one of three between-subject conditions: (1) support gender essentialism; (2) challenge gender essentialism; (3) control. Our manipulation of gender essentialism consists of a Neuroscientific article that presents recent findings about gender-based differences in the human brain. In the control condition, the participants read an article about Alzheimer's Disease. We added a short filler article about physics to hide the intent of the study. For the same reason, this part of the study is presented as a test about people\u2019s understanding of scientific information. After reading each article, the participants complete four true/false questions, that we use as a manipulation check. Later on, the participants indicate their agreement with the article on a 5-point scale; we use this question as a measure of resistance to our manipulation of gender essentialism. In fact, we expect that if the participants do not believe in/disagreee with the content of the article then their beliefs in gender essentialism may not be affected by our manipulation. \n\nNext, each participant evaluates four different resumes (within-subject condition). Each resume is either of a man or a woman, and either of a heterosexual or LGBQ person. This part of the study is presented as a measure of people\u2019s understanding of scientific competency.\n\nThus, our study has the following design: 3 (gender essentialism) between-subject X 2 (applicant\u2019s sex) within-subject X 2 (applicant\u2018s sexual orientation) within-subject."}, "hypothesis": {"extra": [], "value": "In this research project, we want to test the role of gender essentialism (e.g., gender as binary, fixed, biological) and gender-science stereotypes (e.g., science is masculine) as a barrier to the inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (LGBQ) people in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) academic fields. In a first study, which we did not pre-register, we tested this question using a correlational design: the participants (N = 223) completed a series of 7-point Likert questionnaires measuring gender essentialism, modern sexual prejudice, perceived fit of LGBQs in STEM, explicit gender-science stereotypes, and modern sexism; They also responded to a reaction time task (IAT) to assess their implicit gender-science stereotypes. In Study 1, we tested our hypotheses with Structural Equation Modeling in MPlus and we found that a specific subscale of gender essentialism (i.e., gender is binary, natural, and fixed) predicted both modern sexual prejudice, and perceived fit of LGBQs in STEM, as well as gender-science stereotypes at the explicit level. Additionally, explicit gender-science stereotypes mediated the relationship between gender essentialism and perceive fit of LGBQs in STEM (but not modern sexual prejudice and modern sexism). In this second study, we are going to investigate the effect of experimentally manipulated gender essentialism (vs. gender as a dynamic construct) on the evaluation of LGBQs\u2019 resumes applying to a Ph.D. program in STEM. We hypothesize that: (1) Supporting gender essentialism will increase the endorsement of gender-science stereotypes and negative evaluation of LGBQs, compared to the other conditions; (2) Challenging gender essentialism will decrease the endorsement of gender-science stereotypes and negative evaluation of LGBQs, compared to the other conditions; (3) Gender-science stereotypes mediate the relationship between gender essentialism and participant\u2019s evaluations."}, "study_type": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment"}, "study_type_other": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"data": "It's complicated. We have already collected some data but explain in Question 8 why readers may consider this a valid pre-registration nevertheless.", "name": "LGBQ in STEM: A Matter of Gender - Study 2. An experimental investigation of the role of gender essentialism and gender-science stereotypes to the inclusion of LGBQs in STEM.\n\nWe consider this to be a valid pre-registration as data collection is underway and we have not looked at the data collected yet. Our intent is to be transparent and maintain accountability in the way we will treat our data and test our hypothesis. For this reason, we have given and extensive presentation of the data analysis protocol that we are going to follow, and have explained how each analysis that we will carry out connects to our study design.", "other": "We would like to register the other measure included in the study (i.e., gender science stereotypes), and the entire protocol of statistical analyses that we intend to follow. This was the main reason for us to register the study, and to maintain a high standard of transparency and accountability in our research process.\n\nMeasure of gender-science stereotypes\n\nAfter the evaluation task, the participants continue to the last part of the study: our measure of gender-science stereotypes. First, the participants complete a short memory task: in two minutes, they are asked to write down anything they remember about the neuroscientific article. This task was used to increase the effect of the manipulation of gender essentialism on gender-science stereotypes as well as to test whether the participants remembered the article until the end of the study. At this point, the participants were asked to rate 30 gendered traits on a 7-point scale of importance (i.e., How important are each of the following traits to become a successful scientist in STEM?). The participants then completed a traditional measure of gender-science stereotypes (i.e., How much do you associate science with men/women?), that we used in Study 1. We decided to compare these two measure to investigate in more depth this stereotypes.\n\n\nDemographic questions\n\nIn the last section, the participants give some background information: sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, political orientation, annual income, religious orientation, age, year of university attended.\n\n\nData analyses protocol\n\n1. Manipulation check\nEach participant will be assigned a score based on the number of correct answers they gave to the four true/false questions regarding the article. The participants that do not have any correct answer will be excluded from further analyses. The score of the participant will be added to our last model as a covariate, to check if the results change. If we do not find an effect of gender essentialism on the resumes\u2019 evaluations, this last model will allow us to understand whether our hypothesis is wrong, or if there is something wrong with our manipulation of gender essentialism (e.g., the article was too complex).\nSimilarly, the level of agreement with the conclusion of the article will be added as a covariate in our last model, again for comparison reasons. In case a main effect of gender essentialism is not found, we will be able to understand if our hypothesis is wrong or if the participants showed resistance to our manipulation.\n\n2. Missing data\nWe are going to perform a missing values inspection in SPSS, for both variables and cases. We do not expect MNAR (missing not at random) due to the questions being ambiguous, too difficult, or causing resistance because we (a) hide the aim of the study carefully, and (b) state clearly that specific knowledge or skills are not necessary to complete the survey. We do not expect a lot of MAR/MCAR (missing at random) due to the participants skipping a question because (c) the number of items is relatively small and (d) we set the graphic to be as user friendly as possible. What is more, multilevel modelling in R handles missing values very well. Therefore, we do not plan to do any data replacement or imputation.\n\n3. Scale reliability and structure\nWe are going to inspect each item using histograms and by calculating the indexes of skewness and kurtosis, as well as by inspecting Cronbach's alpha and item-rest correlation in R. We will do so to check for ceiling and floor effects, as well as normality of each item, and to investigate the reliability and the structure of each scale.\n\nResume evaluation: An inspection of this scale is necessary to set the multilevel model in the right way. We want to test the relationship between the four subscales of the resume evaluation, namely (a) competence, (b) cultural fit, (c) personal (dis)comfort, and (d) hireability. From a theoretical point of view, it is interesting to keep these aspects divided and run four separate multilevel models. However, if the four subscales are highly correlated merging the subscales should be considered. If this is the case, we will first run four separate models, and then compare the results to a fifth model in which the scores on the fours scales are collapsed in one score. The scores will be calculated as unweighted averages of the items.\n\nGender-science stereotypes: As our measure of gender-science stereotypes based on importance rating, which we devised based on previous literature, has never been used before , we will inspect the structure of this scale running an exploratory factorial analysis using the psych package in R, with predetermined two factors, representing gender-science stereotypes based on personality traits and on skills, and compare this solution to two considering -1 or +2 factors. We will eliminate those items that show a correlation with their factor that is lower than .35, and we will investigate the correlation between the factors to reach the solution the best compromises between the theory and goodness of fit with the data. Finally, we will proceed to calculate participants\u2019 scores indexing the corresponding items, and test the correlation between the new and the old measure of gender-science stereotypes. Based on the results of these analyses, we will decide whether to include both measures of gender-science stereotypes or just the \u201cnew\u201d one.\n\n4. Exploratory analyses\nWe are going to explore the dataset by inspecting the average scores of resume\u2019s evaluation by between-subject and within-subject conditions, to start investigating the effect of the manipulations at both levels of analyses on the main dependent variables. Second, we will explore the average scores of gender-science stereotypes by conditions of gender-essentialism, to start investigating the effect of the between-subject manipulation on the mediator. Finally, we are going to explore the correlation matrix of our main variables, which will also let us investigate the effect of the covariates on the main variables.\n\nBefore running the analyses to test our main hypothesis we are going to explore further the data using line plots for both levels of analyses. We will also perform separate regression analysis per participants and then plot the intercepts, the slopes and the Rsquared values. ", "sample": "We conducted a preliminary power analysis, using the software GPower Version 3.0.10, to determine the ideal sample size. With power of .80, alpha of .05, medium effects size (f = .25), the suggested sample size was of 126. With a small effect size (f = .10) the suggested sample size was 264. We aim at collecting at least 200 responses. We are going to collect the data on a student sample from New York University.", "analyses": "To test the effect of our manipulation of gender essentialism on people\u2019s evaluation of LGBQs identities in STEM we are going to run a mixed multilevel model. A separate multilevel model will be run for each evaluative aspect (competence, hireability, cultural fit, and personal (dis)comfort). Person-level evaluation will be included as the dependent variable. The applicants\u2019 sex and sexual orientation will be added as level 1 predictors, and gender essentialism condition will be included as level 2 predictor. Additionally, gender science stereotypes will be included as level 1 predictor. The multilevel models will be clustered by participants ID. Participants\u2019 sex, sexual orientation, and political orientation will be included as covariates. We will fit the model using the function lmer in R, with estimates that optimize the log-likelihood. Before fitting the models, we will explore the data using line plots for the two levels of analysis. We will use a step-wise approach to fit the model, starting from the unconditional means model. We will compare the models using the anova function. In the unconditional means model we are going to test the intraclass correlation, which is an indicator of whether proceeding with multilevel is appropriate.\n\nIf the intraclass correlation is lower than .35 then proceeding with multilevel model is not appropriate and we will opt for repeated measure ANCOVA or repeated measure MANCOVA (if the correlation between the four sub-scales of resume\u2019s evaluation show a correlation higher than .35) with bootstrapping.\n\nWe are going to test the mediation hypothesis with the MEDIATION package in R, which uses a quasi-Bayesian method with weak assumptions. We will test the mediation hypothesis on the final model that we will obtain from the aforementioned analyses, and the model in which gender essentialism predicts gender-science stereotypes, while controlling for the effect of  the covariates (sex, sexual orientation, and political orientation). To this last model we will add a fourth covariate indicating whether the participant passed or failed the memory task (explained later in this pre-registration). This way, if we do not find an effect of gender essentialism on gender-science stereotypes we will be able to disentangle whether our hypothesis can be rejected or whether this resulted from the non-persistence of the effect of our manipulation into the second part of the study. Depending on the results of the exploratory factor analysis on the scale of gender-science stereotypes and on the correlation between the old and the new measure of gender-essentialism, we are going to either run separate mediation analyses for each subscale of gender-science stereotypes or one multivariate mediation analysis.", "outliers": "We are going to investigate possible outliers graphically (e.g., scatterplots of resume evaluations by condition, residuals plot), as well as through calculating Cook's Distances. We expect to find people that responded at random, as well as extreme cases. The cases that show a Cook's distance above |3 | will be excluded progressively.\n\nWe are going to exclude the responses of the participants that: (1) Did not give their consent at the end of the survey, (2) failed the attention check, (3) discovered the real intent of the study (i.e., to be about LGBQ-related issues). Next, we need to identify the participants that responded at random: We will exclude the participants that took 10 minutes or less to complete the survey, as we consider 10 minutes to be the minimum time necessary to complete the survey even at an extremely fast pace. The analysis of outliers will allow us to identify other participants that responded at random. Finally, each participant will be assigned a score based on the number of correct answers they gave to the four true/false questions regarding the article. The participants that do not have any correct answer will be excluded from further analyses.", "dependent": "Our dependent variable is LGBQ applicants\u2019 resume evaluations compared to heterosexual applicants\u2019 resume evaluations. The participants evaluate the resume of six students applying to a Ph.D. program in the field of Physics. They are asked to rate their agreement with eight statements, regarding four evaluative aspects: (a) competence, (b) hireability, (c) cultural fit, and (d) personal (dis)comfort at the idea of working with the applicant. Four of the six resumes are target resumes, and two are filler resumes that we added to hide the intent of the study.

I will conduct the analysis removing all cases where all deaths are from unknown origin. I will also conduct an analysis which assumes that the unknown deaths are equally caused by the government and the insurgency to avoid dropping cases.\n\tThere are four main dependent variables: trust of government, trust of movement, institutional political participation, contentious political participation. Trust of government is measured by the 4-score question \u201cto what extent do you trust the local government\u201d, corresponding to the independent variable which is at the locality level.

I will conduct the analysis at both the county level and aggregate county-level deaths to prefectural-level for robustness.\n\tThe deaths have three origins, caused by government, caused by insurgents, and unknown cause. The moderator of my analysis is the proportion of deaths caused by the government. The moderator, however, can only be calculated in counties where there are no unknown origin deaths, which will lower my sample size. I will conduct the analysis removing all cases where all deaths are from unknown origin. I will also conduct an analysis which assumes that the unknown deaths are equally caused by the government and the insurgency to avoid dropping cases.\n\tThere are four main dependent variables: trust of government, trust of movement, institutional political participation, contentious political participation. Trust of government is measured by the 4-score question \u201cto what extent do you trust the local government\u201d, corresponding to the independent variable which is at the locality level. Trust of movement is measured by the 5-score question \u201cto what extent do you agree that public demonstration should be forbidden\u201d. Institutional pollical participation is a binary variable which is 1 if the respondent has ever participated in \u201cattend a political meeting/ contact official to express views/ contact media to express views/ contact civic organization to express views/ donate money for an organization or activity\u201d. Contentious political participation is a binary variable which is 1 if the respondent has ever participated in \u201cpetition/ demonstration/ joining a movement group\u201d. \n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "The baseline specification of the model will be a linear model with an interaction term and with errors clustered at county/prefecture level depending on the unit of the independent variable.

I will also estimate an instrumental-variable model to address endogeneity issues. The instrument is the distance to sulfur mine, which determines the location of weapon factories.
