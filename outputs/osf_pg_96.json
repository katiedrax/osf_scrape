For the purpose of this study, the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) will be discussed as a measurement of physiological reactivity. The PNS is a marker of physiological arousal and regulation when individuals are faced with stressful or challenging situations in the environment (Beauchaine, 2001). Researchers can reliably measure PNS activity through respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), which reflects the variation of heart rate during the respiration cycle (Barbosa, Beeghly, Moreira, Tronick &amp; Fuentes, 2018; Beauchaine, 2001). RSA is driven by  the withdrawal or activation of the vagus nerve. During stressful or challenging states, the vagus nerve withdraws its influence on heart rate, thus allowing an increase in heart rate and a decrease in RSA (Porges, 2003).\n\t\nExtensive research has explored the associations between infants\u2019 physiological responses to stress and their caregiving experiences, attachment patterns, and emotion regulation abilities (Barbosa et al., 2018; Beauchaine, 2001; Conradt &amp; Ablow, 2010; Ham &amp; Tronick, 2009; Holochwost, Gari\u00e9py, Propper, Mills, &amp; Moore, 2014; Moore, Cohn &amp; Campbell, 2001; Moore, Hill-Soderlund, Propper, Calkins, Mills-Koonce, &amp; Cox, 2009). However, little is known about infants\u2019 autonomic response trajectories across time. One study that has examined these longitudinal patterns is Alkon, Lippert, Vujan, Rodriguez, Boyce and Eskenazi (2006), which measured infants\u2019 RSA during stressful and resting states at six and 12 months. Their results demonstrated that although infants\u2019 RSA responses increased with development, infants\u2019 individual rank order was relatively stable within that time frame. Further, Jewell, Suk and Luecken (2018) studied infants\u2019 RSA trajectories from six weeks to two years of age. However, because only baseline activity was used for their analyses, this study lacked RSA reactivity during states of arousal.\n\nThe Still Face Paradigm (SFP) is commonly used to assess physiological responses to resting and challenging states of arousal for infants between the ages of four and nine months (Barbosa et al., 2018; Braugart-Rieker, Zentall, Lickenbrock, Ekas, Oshio, &amp; Planalp, 2014; Conradt &amp; Ablow, 2010; Holochwost et al., 2014; Moore, Cohn &amp; Campbell, 2001; Moore et al., 2009). The standard SFP consists of three episodes (play, still-face, and recovery) in which the caregiver is instructed to either interact with their infant as they normally would or hold a neutral facial expression (Conradt &amp; Ablow, 2010). Infants\u2019 RSA levels tend to decrease be-tween play and still-face episodes as the infant becomes distressed in response to the caregiver\u2019s neutral facial expression. Although RSA levels typically return to baseline levels between still-face and recovery episode (Barbosa et al., 2018; Conradt &amp; Ablow, 2010; Ham &amp; Tronic, 2009; Holochwost et al., 2014; Jones-Mason, Alkon, Coccia, &amp; Bush, 2018; Moore &amp; Calkins, 2004; Moore et al., 2009; Qu &amp; Leerkes, 2017; Weinberg &amp; Tronick, 1996), the rate of recovery can depend on a variety of parent-child factors such as attention, parental sensitivity and socioeco-nomic status (Conradt &amp; Ablow, 2010; Jones-Mason et al., 2018; Moore et al., 2009).\n\nThe Strange Situation Procedure (SSP) is commonly used to assess physiological responses to stress for infants between the ages of 12 and 24 months. The SSP consists of eight episodes (1: baseline; 2: mother-child play, 3: mother-child-stranger; 4: child-stranger [1st separation]; 5: mother-child reunion; 6: child alone [2nd separation]; 7: child-stranger; and 8: child-mother reunion; Qu &amp; Leerkes, 2017; Smith, Woodhouse, Clark, &amp; Skowron, 2016). Infants\u2019 RSA levels typically decrease from baseline starting on episode 5 reach the lowest point during episode 7, and then increase and partially recover during the final episode (Hill-Soderlund, Mills-Koonce, Propper Calkins, Granger, Moore, Gariepy, &amp; Cox, 2008; Kohler-Dauner, Roder, Krause, Buchheim, G\u00fcndel, Fegert, Ziegenhain, &amp; Walter, 2019; Roder, Koehler-Dauner, Krause, Prinz, Rottler, Alkon, Kolassa, G\u00fcndel, Fegert, Ziegenhain, &amp; Walter, 2020; Smith et al., 2016).\n\t\nTo our knowledge, no studies have examined the longitudinal associations between pat-terns of RSA reactivity during the SFP and the SSP. Assessing these longitudinal patterns will provide researchers with a deeper understanding of the stability of physiological patterns during this important developmental period. With this in mind, the present study aims to investigate whether infant\u2019s mean RSA levels at seven months of age during the SPF predict mean RSA levels at 18 months of age during the SSP.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-03T16:34:22.095322", "date_modified": "2020-04-02T17:13:53.245984", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Lee Raby"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "f3e96304b4e14bbba06ecade47d0648c47b4f4b57527d1b000b04f9c279d05f99ef38570129ea7a24368dd08e206732aacfc57babac9a8913cd44d2cd36351d4a3990f81e5dadcecc0f2ca562579262dc1aff8cf4d363f0bceacb0ba207cc64dcd5c3387a88b2c99ebcb512fe12c6212cf2cf09dd696ab997240ad333d7bc63e5ca36ae3dae4af5233785a227b091ce3", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-03T16:34:22.077135", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Tracey Tacana, Bailey Speck, Lee Raby"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "First, we expect infants\u2019 mean RSA levels will decrease during the still-face episodes compared to the play episode and then increase during the recovery episodes.

Starting with the play episode, the mother is instructed to engage in positive interactions with her child during which baseline RSA reactivity is established. Following play, the mother is instructed to hold a neutral facial expression (unresponsive), which usually results in the child becoming distressed, providing us with RSA during a challenging state. Lastly, during the recovery episode, mother is instructed to become responsive to their infant, often trying to soothe them. We can then determine if the child is able to recover to baseline RSA reactivity. \n\nInfants\u2019 RSA activity will be measured during the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP), which was completed when infants were approximately age 18 months. The SSP consists of eight, three-minute episodes: baseline, free play, stranger, separation 1 (child with stranger), reunion 1, separation 2 (child alone), child with stranger, and reunion 2. The SSP was designed by Mary Ainsworth based on John Bowlby\u2019s theory of attachment (Ainsworth, 1973). The SSP was designed to elicit separation anxiety and stranger anxiety in one-year old infants. During baseline, mother is walked into a room and then left alone with their child. During free play, mother is instructed to sit in a chair and let her child play with toys, and advised to only interact with their child if they seek her attention. Then, during the stranger episode, a stranger comes into the room and quietly sits for one minute, engages with mom for another minute, and tries to engage with baby on the last minute of the episode as the mother leaves the room, marking the start of separation 1 (child with stranger). The stranger tries to play, comfort or distract the child, cutting the episode if the child can\u2019t be comforted. During reunion 1, mother enters the room and pauses in the doorway for the child to respond to her, while the stranger leaves. Moth-er is instructed to leave the child alone during separation 2 to continue playing with toys for the entire episode, unless they become too distressed. The stranger comes in and behaves like they did during the stranger episode, finishing the episode if the child becomes inconsolable. Last, reunion 2 takes place when mother comes in and engages with their child (Ainsworth, 1970).\n\nRSA will be collected through sensors attached to the infant\u2019s torso. Physiological signals are checked throughout the task to ensure that heart rate and respiration data are accurately measured. After data collection, Mindware\u2019s Heart Rate Variability (HRV) software will be used to clean the echocardiograph (ECG) data and extract information about RSA levels.

We will also average RSA reactivity scores for both Strange Situation reunion episodes to ensure consistent methodological decisions across tasks. \n\nTo create a measure of overall reactivity during the SFP, we will subtract mean RSA activity during the recovery episodes from mean RSA reactivity during the first play episode.

Research assistants recruited pregnant women who were receiving prenatal care at University of Utah associated OBGYN clinics. Pregnant women were also recruited through flyers, brochures, and social media posts. These recruited women and their infants participated in study visits beginning with a prenatal visit, followed by a post-birth hospital visit, a seven-month lab visit, an 18-month lab visit, and finally an 18-month home visit. \n\nFor the purpose of this study, only data collected at the seven and 18-month lab visits will be used. At the seven-month lab visit, electrodes intended to measure cardiac and respiratory activity were placed on mothers and their infants. Mothers were then instructed to complete the Still Face Paradigm (SFP). The SFP is a task that consists of seven episodes and is designed to elicit a distress response from the child. Families were compensated $50 for their participation in this seven-month lab visit. \n\nAt the 18-month lab visit, electrodes intended to measure cardiac and respiratory activity were placed on mothers and their infants. Mothers were then instructed to complete the Strange Situation (SSP). The SSP consists of eight episodes and is designed to elicit stress response from the child. Participants were compensated an additional $50 for participating in this 18-month lab visit. \n", "q10.uploader": [], "q14.question": "None", "q14.uploader": [], "q15.question": "Infants\u2019 mean RSA activity will be measured during the Still Face Paradigm (SFP), which was completed when infants were approximately age 7 months. The SPF consists of three (play, still-face, recover), two minutes episodes, and was designed by Tronick, Adamson, Als, and Brazelton (1975) to elicit distress response from children two to nine months of age (Adamson, &amp; Prick, 2003; Tronick et al., 1975). Starting with the play episode, the mother is instructed to engage in positive interactions with her child during which baseline RSA reactivity is established. Following play, the mother is instructed to hold a neutral facial expression (unresponsive), which usually results in the child becoming distressed, providing us with RSA during a challenging state. Lastly, during the recovery episode, mother is instructed to become responsive to their infant, often trying to soothe them. We can then determine if the child is able to recover to baseline RSA reactivity. \n\nInfants\u2019 RSA activity will be measured during the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP), which was completed when infants were approximately age 18 months. The SSP consists of eight, three-minute episodes: baseline, free play, stranger, separation 1 (child with stranger), reunion 1, separation 2 (child alone), child with stranger, and reunion 2. The SSP was designed by Mary Ainsworth based on John Bowlby\u2019s theory of attachment (Ainsworth, 1973). The SSP was designed to elicit separation anxiety and stranger anxiety in one-year old infants. During baseline, mother is walked into a room and then left alone with their child. During free play, mother is instructed to sit in a chair and let her child play with toys, and advised to only interact with their child if they seek her attention. Then, during the stranger episode, a stranger comes into the room and quietly sits for one minute, engages with mom for another minute, and tries to engage with baby on the last minute of the episode as the mother leaves the room, marking the start of separation 1 (child with stranger). The stranger tries to play, comfort or distract the child, cutting the episode if the child can\u2019t be comforted. During reunion 1, mother enters the room and pauses in the doorway for the child to respond to her, while the stranger leaves. Moth-er is instructed to leave the child alone during separation 2 to continue playing with toys for the entire episode, unless they become too distressed. The stranger comes in and behaves like they did during the stranger episode, finishing the episode if the child becomes inconsolable. Last, reunion 2 takes place when mother comes in and engages with their child (Ainsworth, 1970).\n\nRSA will be collected through sensors attached to the infant\u2019s torso. Physiological signals are checked throughout the task to ensure that heart rate and respiration data are accurately measured. After data collection, Mindware\u2019s Heart Rate Variability (HRV) software will be used to clean the echocardiograph (ECG) data and extract information about RSA levels. RSA reactivity will then be analyzed to compare reactivity for both lab visits.\n", "q15.uploader": [], "q16.question": "To account for infants who were not able to complete the second still face and reunion episodes, as they became too distressed by the first still face and reunion episodes, we will average each infant\u2019s RSA activity measures recovery one and recovery two, thus gathering the most accurate RSA reaction for all infants.

This form of intervention in the electoral process does not only pose a normative dilemma between the desire to ensure appropriate descriptive representation of women and the democratic principle to have a free, unrestricted choice between candidates, but also has practical implications. The practical consequences of gender quotas like their effect on electoral performance (G\u00b4orecki and Kuko lowicz, 2014), candidate quality (Allen, Cutts and Campbell, 2016), and the substantive representation of women (Franceschet and Piscopo, 2008) have been covered by scholars. Yet, surprisingly little effort has been made to study the effect of gender quotas on perception of \u201dquota-women\u201d. While gender quotas\nmight not have an adverse impact on the objective quality of female candidates\nand MPs, voters and party members might stereotype these candidates and MPs\nas \u201dquota-women\u201d who are not up for the job. The literature on gender quotas\nhas so far neglected these potential (negative) subjective effects of gender quotas\n(Franceschet, Krook and Piscopo, 2012). Yet neglecting these (side)effects of gender quotas can shift focus away from areas in which quotas might have an adverse\neffect on the representation of women in politics e.g. career advancement within\npolitical parties and parliament. While the case for gender quotas can be easily be made, as they \u201dare the most effective way in practice to achieve descriptive representation\u201d (Kittilson, 2005), gender quotas may also have unintended consequences. For example, G\u00b4orecki\nand Kuko lowicz (2014) show that gender quotas in Poland may have decreased\nelectoral performances of women. Studies of attitudinal effects of gender quotas,\nalso show that gender quotas can have negative effects. A noteworthy example is\nClayton (2015), who suggests that gender quotas in Lesotho have actually reduced\nwomen\u2018s political engagement due to the aversion against the gender quota as\nselection mechanism.\n\nThese potential negative effects of gender quotas are not surprising, as gender quotas can be perceived as disruptive to the free selection of candidates and MPs in a democratic society. Furthermore gender quotas usually are framed in terms of supporting women achieving equal representation, which effectively establishes male dominance in parliaments as the norm and women in parliament as the deviation (Murray, 2014). In general, quotas also set up a separate competition spaces for men and women: Women compete against other women and men compete against other men. Therefore quotas can be perceived to make the candidate selection less competitive and undermine merit based candidate selection. This potential change in the perception of competitiveness and merit should affect women more than men, as the quotas were introduced to ensure the representation of women and therefore they are the reason why the candidate selection can be perceived as less competitive. Furthermore the underrepresentation of women in parliaments might have led party members and voters to believe, that women are less qualified for the job\nbecause they \u201dcould not handle themselves\u201d in a system with free competition. Quotas can be perceived to \u201dartificially\u201d increase the chances of candidates that could not handle themselves beforehand. Therefore my first hypothesis is:\n\nH1: Women elected through gender quotas are perceived to be less qualified\nthan women not elected through gender quotas \n\nThe hypothesised negative effect of gender quotas on women should also manifest itself in the career paths of female politicians. If it is truly the case that\ngender quotas negatively impact the assessment of women, than they might not\nbe considered to be viable candidates for higher political office by political parties.\nBreaking through the glass ceiling with the help of a gender quota therefore can\npotentially create another glass ceiling in later career stages:\n\nH2: Women elected through gender quotas are less likely to be considered for\nhigher political office than women not elected through a gender quota\n\n\nAnother potential effect of gender quotas is that they encourage essentialism,\nthe belief that members of a particular group have a certain essence that nonmembers cannot acquire. In the context of representation this means, that women\ncan be perceived to be the only individuals that can represent women due to\ntheir essential characteristics, which in turn means that women are not able to\nrepresent men. Quotas enforce gender division by implicitly or explicitly stating\nthat women should be represented by women (Mansbridge, 2005). This potential\nencouragement of essentialism through gender quotas should affect men and women\ndifferently and therefore I propose the following hypotheses:\n\nH3a: Men will feel less represented by a woman elected through a gender quota\nthan by women not elected through a gender quota\n\nH3b: Women will feel more represented by a woman elected through a gender\nquota than by women not elected through a gender quota\n\nI will also test the argument that in order to facilitate the acceptance and counteract potential negative sight effects gender quotas should be framed as quotas for men (Murray 2014). In line with this argument,  I expect potential negative effects of gender quotas to be weaker if the quota is framed as a quota for men. \n\nH4: Potential negative effects of gender quotas will be weaker if the quota is framed as a quota for men. \n\nResearch Design\n\nIn order to asses the hypothesized subjective effects of gender quotas I will employ\na survey experiment. This will allow me to estimate the causal effect of gender\nquotas on the perception of female politicians.\n\nParticipants will receive information on a MP through a vignette. This text\nwill contain information on the MPs professional background, parliamentary committee membership, the MPs policy area of expertise and information on when this\nfemale MP was elected to parliament. The treatment that will be manipulated in\nthis experiment is the information, whether the party of the female MP used a quota or not during nominating her as candidate. More specifically, whether they did not use a quota (no information on quotas provided), which is the control group, a Frauenquote (quota for women), which is the first treatment group or a \"H\u00f6chstquote f\u00fcr M\u00e4nner\" (ceiling quota for men). \n\n After being randomly assigned treatment 1, treatment 2  or control status, the\ntreatment groups will receive the information that the politicians won a seat in\nparliament through a gender quota (male vs female), whereas the control group will not receive any\ninformation on whether the female MP was elected through a quota or not.\nIn order to make the experimental environment more realistic, I opt to let the\nparticipants listen to an an audio clip of a neutral policy statement of said MP\ninstead of the very commonly used text information. Audio clips contain additional\ninformation compared to text excerpts. Most importantly, through the sound of\nthe voice I am able to remind participants that said politicians is actually a women,\nwhich could cue respondents in the treatment group to think more intensely about\ngender quotas. Furthermore I will use the statements of real MPs elected through quotas, in order to ensure that it is a realistic statement and setting. Participants will receive a\nstatement by an unknown MP from a different country, in order to make sure that\nthey have little prior knowledge on said MP.\n\nThe cases and the population of my experiment will be th\nparty leaders in Austria, Switzerland and Germany. The In all three countries no legal gender quotas exists, but some parties have introduced quotas in their candidate selection process\nvoluntarily (IDEA, 2018). This provides me with variation regarding the exposure\nto gender quotas of the different party leaders.\n\nThe dependent variables will be constructed though a questionnaire both the\ncontrol and treatment group receive after listening to the audio clip. In this questionnaire participants will be asked to asses whether they think that the legislator\nis competent, qualified, is able to substantively represent men and women and\nwhether they would consider her for higher political office. With this information\nthe ATE of gender quotas on the perception of female candidates by party leaders\ncan be calculated. Before being assigned treatment and control status, participants\nwill be asked to answer questions on their socio-demographic and political characteristics.

contexts. We will first assign participants to one of two minimal groups using either the dot estimation or artistic preference minimal group paradigm (both adapted from Tajfel et al., 1971). Participants will then complete a resource allocation task designed to measure their intergroup bias (Tajfel et al., 1971). In this task, participants will see a series of six matrices. Each matrix consists of 13 columns with two rows. Participants will then select one column that represents the points to be awarded to two anonymous individuals. One person will share the same group membership as the participant (ingroup), and the other person will have a different group membership (outgroup). Although the six matrices in this research were originally used by Tajfel et al. (1971), the Qualtrics scripts we used for this research were adapted from Loersch &amp; Arbuckle's (2013, Study 1), and like these researchers, we only include ingroup/outgroup allocation decisions (i.e., no ingroup/ingroup or outgroup/outgroup trials). Critically, unlike previous research, we will examine whether the category labels of the groups that participants are assigned to influence the allocation decisions and moderate any intergroup bias. To test this, we will conduct the current research in two different studies.\n\nIn the first study, participants will be randomly assigned to the overestimator or underestimator group (Tajfel et al., 1971) using a Numerical Estimation Style Test (Ratner &amp; Amodio, 3013; Ratner et al., 2014) and then they will complete the resource allocation task in reference to overestimator and underestimator targets. We will collect 200 participants using Qualtrics. We will attempt to recruit 100 participants in each minimal group condition (overestimator-ingroup vs. underestimator-ingroup), but we are randomly assigning participants through Qualtrics, thus the number of participants in each condition may not be exactly equal. We will then conduct a 2 (ingroup vs. outgroup) X 2 (overestimator vs. underestimator) mixed design ANOVA on the total number of resources allocated to each group. \n\nIn the second study, participants will be assigned to either the Kandinsky or Klee groups (Tajfel et al., 1971) and complete the resource allocation task for a Klee group member or a Kandinsky group member. We will collect 200 participants using Qualtrics. We will attempt to recruit 100 participants in each minimal group condition (Klee-ingroup vs. Kandinsky-ingroup), but we are randomly assigning participants through Qualtrics, thus the number of participants in each condition may not be exactly equal. We will then conduct 2 (ingroup vs. outgroup) X 2 (Kandinsky vs. Klee) mixed design ANOVA on the total number of resources allocated to each group. \n\nWe will also get ratings of different minimal groups on their likability (1- very negative; 5 - very positive) as well as thirteen trait impressions (Oosterhof &amp; Todorov, 2008). We will examine relationships between these ratings and how participants allocated resources to different groups and category labels.\n\nA note about our sample size determinations:\nThe Qualtrics script we will use was adapted from Loersch &amp; Arbuckle (2013, Study 1). In Loersch &amp; Arbuckle's study, they used a sample of 76 undergraduate students. Although we felt like their study was the closest to ours for determining potential sample size, our research differs from theirs in important ways. First, our group manipulations are different than theirs. Second, we plan to recruit participants using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Third, they were interested in general ingroup and outgroup differences and we are interested in group differences, differences due to category labels, and potential interactions between group assignment and category labels. Given these differences between their study and ours, we viewed 76 participants per overestimator-ingroup condition, 76 participants per underestimator-ingroup condition, 76 participants per Kandinsky-ingroup condition, and 76 participants per Klee-ingroup condition as the minimum sample sizes per condition, but based on the resources we were willing to allocate to this research we decided to round-up to approximately 100 participants per condition (depending on random assignment) for a total of 400 participants (200 for Study 1 and 200 for study 2).    \n\nAttached are the Qualtrics scripts we will use for our two studies (Tajfe_Matrices_NEST.qsf -overestimator/underestimator; Tajfe_Matrices_ART.qsf - Kandinsky/Klee)"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Tajfel_Matricies_NEST.qsf"}, "nodeId": "pzv5a", "sha256": "71819ef1079e0f8ad0b52e7331445968df490a510906a9d28e3bc55786f68dbc", "viewUrl": "/project/xd3ag/files/osfstorage/5e77bb010cd06c0684000d7f/", "selectedFileName": "Tajfel_Matricies_NEST.qsf"}, {"data": {"name": "Tajfel_Matricies_ART.qsf"}, "nodeId": "pzv5a", "sha256": "e8f01e9c266c7b971ae8f30b9c6bd9bf048c5baa60ddebe38a6932cee60ad354", "viewUrl": "/project/xd3ag/files/osfstorage/5e77bb010cd06c0684000d7d/", "selectedFileName": "Tajfel_Matricies_ART.qsf"}], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"summary": "In this research, we will examine intergroup bias in resource allocation in minimal group contexts.

to COVID-19", "description": "Autonomy has been described as a fundamental human need and satisfying the need for autonomy is an important motivator of behavior (Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000). Autonomy can be supported in various ways, and autonomy-supportive environments are associated with more successful behavior change (Ng et al., 2012). Framing information and decisions in autonomous ways, emphasizing choice and agency, may increase receptivity to health messages and promote behavior change. In this study, we assess the degree to which framing health messages related to COVID-19 in ways that support autonomy improves message effectiveness and promotes social distancing behaviors.",
