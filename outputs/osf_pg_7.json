{"data": [{"id": "8cgxd", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Effect of Fenugreek on vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women: Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis", "description": "Background: Vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes or night sweats) are closely related to the impaired quality of life in menopausal women. Fenugreek is the ripe seed of Trigonella foenum graecum Linn. In China, this plant is used to relieve menopausal symptoms in women. Although recent studies have shown that fenugreek may have a good effect on the menopausal symptoms, there is no meta-analysis to systematically evaluate its efficacy in improving menopausal vasomotor symptoms.\nMethods: Randomized controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria will be retrieved in Five English online databases and four Chinese online databases. The primary outcomes are changes in frequency and intensity of vasomotor symptoms that measured by validated scales. The secondary outcomes will include quality of life, blood hormone parameters, blood biochemical parameters, and adverse events. Heterogeneity of data will be assessed by I2 and Cochrane\u2019s Q statistics. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis will be performed to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Egger's test and Begg\u2019s test will be used to assess the publication bias. Finally, we will evaluate the quality of evidence by the GRADE approach. All the data statistics will be performed using the STATA 15.0 software.\nResults: All the results of will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-22T03:00:24.960514", "date_modified": "2020-04-22T03:12:36.414202", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "fa27c1e693a572700e6a32fcac3fcdff3f4f72c29b179d4934707dafbda1d33b77c5275613efa4b37db93198c8b1eca6da41df3032008f2c9902564083ab82e372cc9933f749209d261a0e09dda4bf0c01131f486c184c42c0d802058a6e27ef325331e64f437cf5f048f8c859861ae3d53170465380e1aa5042682955742135c08aaa4914b7caadd329980cb7bb1cf9", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": "", "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-22T03:00:24.942545", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Tingchao Wu"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Fenugreek could improve menopausal vasomotor symptoms."}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": ["No blinding is involved in this study."]}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q6": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria\n1.1. Study design \nOnly randomized controlled trials (RCTs) will be included in our study. Non-RCTs, observational studies, real-world studies, reviews, case reports, and animal experiments will be excluded.\n1.2. Participants\nwomen who were experiencing vasomotor symptoms due to menopausal, perimenopausal or postmenopausal period will be included. Women with vasomotor symptoms due to breast cancer treatment or surgical menopause will be excluded.\n1.3. Interventions\nThe intervention of the test group was fenugreek or fenugreek extract, and the control group was placebo-controlled. Moreover, studies using fenugreek or its extract as part of the compound prescription will not be included.\n1.4. Outcomes\nThe primary outcomes are changes in frequency and intensity of vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes or night sweats). The vasomotor symptoms must be measured by the Cooperman\u2019s index, Kupperman Index, Greene Climacteric scale, Menopause Rating Scale, or any other criteria for measuring menopausal symptoms. The secondary outcomes will include quality of life (based on generic validated scales), blood hormone parameters, blood biochemical parameters, and adverse events.\n2. Study search\nTwo authors (Tingchao Wu and Mingmin He) will independently search the online databases (including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, China National Knowledge Internet, VIP Information Chinese Periodical Service Platform, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, and Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database) for identifying the relevant studies. The search strategies will be performed using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and free-text words. There will be no restrictions on the language and time of publication. \n3. Study selection\nEndNote X9 software will be used to manage the retrieved literature. Two independent authors (Tingchao Wu and Mingmin He) will screen the retrieved literature according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the first step, the duplicated literature will be removed, and then the titles and abstracts will be reviewed. Subsequently, the full-text of the relevant literature will be investigated to assess their suitability for meta-analysis. Any discrepancies will be resolved by discussion with the corresponding author (Rensong Yue). \n4. Data extraction\nWe will extract relevant data from the included articles based on the following items: first Author; year of publication; country; study design; sample size (test/control group); age (test/control group); intervention (dosage form, dosage and duration of trial); outcomes in the test and control groups; Safety parameter and adverse event. If the data we need are not available in an article, we will try to obtain it by contacting the original investigators.\n5. Risk of bias assessment\nTwo investigators (Tingchao Wu and Mingmin He) will independently assesse the quality of the included studies according to the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. The content of the evaluation will cover six domains of bias: selection bias (\u201crandom sequence generation\u201d and \u201callocation concealment\u201d), performance bias (\u201cblind of participants and personnel\u201d), detection bias (\u201cblinding of outcome assessment\u201d), attrition bias (\u201cincomplete outcome data\u201d), reporting bias (\u201cselective reporting\u201d), and other bias. Any discrepancies will be judged by consultation with the corresponding author. \n6. Data analysis\nThe STATA 15.0 software will be used for data statistics. For continuous data, mean difference (MD) between groups will be calculated if outcomes were reported on the same scale, while standardized mean difference will be calculated if outcomes were reported on different scales. Heterogeneity of the included studies will be assessed by I2 and Cochrane\u2019s Q statistics. I2 &lt; 50% with P &gt; 0.05 indicate that there is no significant heterogeneity, the fixed-effect model will be used to combine effect sizes; otherwise, the random-effect model will be applied. The overall effects with P-value less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.\n7 Subgroup analysis\nTo better explore the sources of heterogeneity, subgroup analyses will be performed based on the following moderator variables: geographical area of subjects, assessment scale, dosage of fenugreek, dosage form of fenugreek, and intervention duration.\n8. Sensitivity analysis\nSensitivity analysis will be used to evaluate the stability of the overall results by removing each trial sequentially. Then we will focus on the comparison of the pooled effect size and heterogeneity before and after sensitivity analysis.\n9. Publication bias assessment\nIf more than 10 trials are finally included in our study, Egger's linear regression test and Begg\u2019s test will be used to assess the potential publication bias. P-value less than 0.05 will be considered as statistically significant.\n10. Grading the quality of evidence\nThe GRADE approach will be used to evaluate the quality of evidence for the entire study. The evaluation includes five domains: risk of bias (study design and execution), imprecision, indirectness, inconsistency, and publication bias. Each domain will be defined as \u201cvery low\u201d, \u201clow\u201d, \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q8": {"extra": [], "value": "Registration prior to creation of data"}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q10": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "1.

In this test, a non-inverting electrode is placed at Cz, and the inverting electrode is placed on the right ear lobule, and a ground electrode is placed on the forehead. The impedance value of all electrodes is below 5 k\u03a9 (maximum=1.5 k\u03a9). The stimulus is a 40-msec synthetic /da/ syllable, used in previous studies by the Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory of Nina Kraus et al.15 at Northwestern University (USA). The test will be performed in a quiet place with closed eyes (or during sleep) while leaning against a comfortable chair in an acoustic room with low light and low ambient noise. No cognitive stimulus will be used during the experiments7.\n\u2022 Central tests, including gap detection in noise (GIN), duration pattern test (DPT), and QuickSIN, will be performed. These tests are sensitive to the central auditory nervous system (CANS) lesions but are not affected by peripheral hearing loss35.\nGIN test: This test consists of a series of 36 different six-second segments of white noise. Each segment contains zero to three gaps of silence. The interval between the noise segments is five seconds, and the duration of silence gaps is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, and 20 msec. Ten practice items are presented before starting the test. There are four lists available for the test, which allow for a comparison of the tests. Generally, one list is used for each ear. Although the test is run through a single channel, a second channel is also used by the examiner to control and rate the responses. The test includes two criteria for examining the results: 1) a threshold for detecting gaps in noise; and 2) the percentage of correct responses for each ear. The gap detection threshold in noise is considered as the shortest gap duration for which there are four out of six correct responses. The percentage of correct responses is the mean percentage of correct responses during the test36.\nDPT test: This test consists of three pure tones in each segment. The frequency of each tone is 1000 Hz, and its duration is either 250 msec (short) or 500 msec (long). The gap between the tones is 300 msec. Generally, there are six patterns for this test (LLS, LSL, LSS, SLS, SLS, SLL, and SSL), and a six-second gap of silence separates the segments. The percentage of correct responses is the mean of all percentages of one's correct responses during the test. It is recommended to perform the test at 50 dB SL to the speech recognition threshold or pure tone average (500, 1000, and 2000 Hz). Since intensity has insignificant effects on test performance, it can be also performed at 10 dBSL36.\nQuickSIN test: In general, QuickSIN is a quick test to quantify one\u2019s ability to hear in the presence of noise. It can be performed using headphones and/or free-field speakers (free-field in this study). In this test, a series of sentences are presented to both ears, and at the same time, a babbling noise is presented to both ears; in other words, noise is competitive with the stimulus. This test is performed at the most comfortable level (MCL). The patient's response is written, and the number of correct repeated words is documented in the \u201cresults\u201d sheet. A total of five lists are used for each person.\nEach list contains six sentences, and each sentence has five keywords, all of which are presented in babble noise. The noise level is set at six levels (preset on CD) and increases in 5-dB steps; in other words, the test conditions gradually become more and more competitive. The signal-to-noise ratios include 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, and 0 dB. At the end of each list, the total number of correct repeated words is recorded, and the signal-to-noise reduction ratio (SNR loss) is calculated30."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q16": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q17": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "\nFirst, the Chi-square test will be used to examine the normal distribution of each variable.

In this test, a non-inverting electrode is placed at Cz, and the inverting electrode is placed on the right ear lobule, and a ground electrode is placed on the forehead. The impedance value of all electrodes is below 5 k\u03a9 (maximum=1.5 k\u03a9). The stimulus is a 40-msec synthetic /da/ syllable, used in previous studies by the Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory of Nina Kraus et al.15 at Northwestern University (USA). The test will be performed in a quiet place with closed eyes (or during sleep) while leaning against a comfortable chair in an acoustic room with low light and low ambient noise. No cognitive stimulus will be used during the experiments7.\n\u2022 Central tests, including gap detection in noise (GIN), duration pattern test (DPT), and QuickSIN, will be performed. These tests are sensitive to the central auditory nervous system (CANS) lesions but are not affected by peripheral hearing loss35.\nGIN test: This test consists of a series of 36 different six-second segments of white noise. Each segment contains zero to three gaps of silence. The interval between the noise segments is five seconds, and the duration of silence gaps is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, and 20 msec. Ten practice items are presented before starting the test. There are four lists available for the test, which allow for a comparison of the tests. Generally, one list is used for each ear. Although the test is run through a single channel, a second channel is also used by the examiner to control and rate the responses. The test includes two criteria for examining the results: 1) a threshold for detecting gaps in noise; and 2) the percentage of correct responses for each ear. The gap detection threshold in noise is considered as the shortest gap duration for which there are four out of six correct responses. The percentage of correct responses is the mean percentage of correct responses during the test36.\nDPT test: This test consists of three pure tones in each segment. The frequency of each tone is 1000 Hz, and its duration is either 250 msec (short) or 500 msec (long). The gap between the tones is 300 msec. Generally, there are six patterns for this test (LLS, LSL, LSS, SLS, SLS, SLL, and SSL), and a six-second gap of silence separates the segments. The percentage of correct responses is the mean of all percentages of one's correct responses during the test. It is recommended to perform the test at 50 dB SL to the speech recognition threshold or pure tone average (500, 1000, and 2000 Hz). Since intensity has insignificant effects on test performance, it can be also performed at 10 dBSL36.\nQuickSIN test: In general, QuickSIN is a quick test to quantify one\u2019s ability to hear in the presence of noise. It can be performed using headphones and/or free-field speakers (free-field in this study). In this test, a series of sentences are presented to both ears, and at the same time, a babbling noise is presented to both ears; in other words, noise is competitive with the stimulus. This test is performed at the most comfortable level (MCL). The patient's response is written, and the number of correct repeated words is documented in the \u201cresults\u201d sheet. A total of five lists are used for each person.\nEach list contains six sentences, and each sentence has five keywords, all of which are presented in babble noise. The noise level is set at six levels (preset on CD) and increases in 5-dB steps; in other words, the test conditions gradually become more and more competitive. The signal-to-noise ratios include 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, and 0 dB. At the end of each list, the total number of correct repeated words is recorded, and the signal-to-noise reduction ratio (SNR loss) is calculated30.", "q15.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "\nFirst, the Chi-square test will be used to examine the normal distribution of each variable.

Studies from 1950-2020 will be included. The search will combine the following key words; tumour, balloon, and occlusion. We will include all English-language full-text articles that compared intra-operative aortic balloon occlusion in sacral tumour surgery to conventional surgery controls. The studies are required to be comparative, with the experimental group receiving aortic balloon occlusion and the control group receiving conventional treatment.\n\n12. * Condition or domain being studied.\n\nSacral and pelvic tumour resection surgeries are associated with significant intra- and post-operative bleeding. Although intra-aortic balloon occlusion or resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion has re-emerged as an acute tool for controlling hemorrhage from trauma, its use in elective surgeries has not yet been thoroughly conducted. While studies have published the effects of prophylactic intra-aortic balloon occlusion as a mean of decreasing blood loss in sacropelvic tumour resections, these are few and are generally small cohort retrospective studies or case series. Yet, published results are promising and show significant improvements in blood loss and transfusion amount. We propose reviewing the current literature on the surgical outcomes of prophylactic intra-aortic balloon occlusion during sacral and pelvic tumour surgery in a meta-analysis.\n\n13. * Participants/population.\n \nInclusion:\n-Patients with sacral tumours requiring surgical resection receiving aortic balloon occlusion intra-operatively for control of blood loss.\n\nExclusion:\n-Patients under 18 years of age.\n-Patients requiring surgery for any other condition, including acetabular fracture, abdominal aortic aneurysm, gynecological bleeding, and trauma.\n\n14. * Intervention(s), exposure(s).\n \nIntervention: Intra-operative balloon occlusion of the aorta during sacral tumour resection.\n\nIntra-aortic balloon occlusion (IABO), or resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA), was first utilized in the Korean War to treat uncontrolled intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and its use is expanding to a range of different traumatic and non-traumatic indications. This technique involves advancing a compliant balloon into the aorta and inflating it to obstruct blood flow into the distal circulation. In pelvic and sacral tumour surgery, an IABO device can be inserted prophylactically to control bleeding that may occur distal to the iliac bifurcation with handling and resection of the tumour.

Studies from 1950-2020 will be included. The search will combine the following key words; tumour, balloon, and occlusion. We will include all English-language full-text articles that compared intra-operative aortic balloon occlusion in sacral tumour surgery to conventional surgery controls. The studies are required to be comparative, with the experimental group receiving aortic balloon occlusion and the control group receiving conventional treatment.\n\n12. * Condition or domain being studied.\n\nSacral and pelvic tumour resection surgeries are associated with significant intra- and post-operative bleeding. Although intra-aortic balloon occlusion or resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion has re-emerged as an acute tool for controlling hemorrhage from trauma, its use in elective surgeries has not yet been thoroughly conducted. While studies have published the effects of prophylactic intra-aortic balloon occlusion as a mean of decreasing blood loss in sacropelvic tumour resections, these are few and are generally small cohort retrospective studies or case series. Yet, published results are promising and show significant improvements in blood loss and transfusion amount. We propose reviewing the current literature on the surgical outcomes of prophylactic intra-aortic balloon occlusion during sacral and pelvic tumour surgery in a meta-analysis.\n\n13. * Participants/population.\n \nInclusion:\n-Patients with sacral tumours requiring surgical resection receiving aortic balloon occlusion intra-operatively for control of blood loss.\n\nExclusion:\n-Patients under 18 years of age.\n-Patients requiring surgery for any other condition, including acetabular fracture, abdominal aortic aneurysm, gynecological bleeding, and trauma.\n\n14. * Intervention(s), exposure(s).\n \nIntervention: Intra-operative balloon occlusion of the aorta during sacral tumour resection.\n\nIntra-aortic balloon occlusion (IABO), or resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA), was first utilized in the Korean War to treat uncontrolled intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and its use is expanding to a range of different traumatic and non-traumatic indications. This technique involves advancing a compliant balloon into the aorta and inflating it to obstruct blood flow into the distal circulation. In pelvic and sacral tumour surgery, an IABO device can be inserted prophylactically to control bleeding that may occur distal to the iliac bifurcation with handling and resection of the tumour. This presumably maintains hemodynamic stability and improves view of the operative field.\n\n15. * Comparator(s)/control.\n \nComparator: Patients receiving conventional surgery for sacral tumour resection.\n\nInclusion:\n-Patients receiving conventional surgery for sacral tumour resection.\n\nExclusion:\n-Patients under 18 years of age.\n-Patients receiving surgery for acetabular fracture, abdominal aortic aneurysm, trauma, and other applications of aortic balloon occlusion.\n-Patients receiving intra-operative balloon occlusion peri-operatively.\n\n16. * Types of study to be included.\n \nInclusion Criteria:\n-Studies reporting on the use of balloon occlusion of the aorta during sacral tumour resection. \n-Eligible study designs include retrospective cohort, prospective cohort, randomized controlled trials (RCT), and randomized clinical trials.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n-Case reports, case series, gray literature, and review articles are excluded.\n-Studies reporting on surgery for acetabular fracture, abdominal aortic aneurysm, trauma, and other applications of aortic balloon occlusion.\n\n17. * Main outcome(s).\n \nMain outcomes:\ni) Blood loss intra-operatively\nii) Post-operative blood loss\niii) Total blood loss\niv) Total transfusion volume\nv) Operation time\nvi) Mortality\n\nTiming and effect measures:\n\nTiming = peri- and post- intervention\n\nEffect measure = standardized mean difference with random effects model\n\n18. * Additional outcome(s).\n \ni) Morbidity\nii) Adverse events\niii) Complications\niv) Recurrence of tumours\n\nTiming and effect measures:\nTiming = peri- and post- intervention\n\nEffect measure = standardized mean difference with random effects model\n\n19. * Data extraction (selection and coding).\n\nStudy selection\n\u2022 Two independent, blinded reviewers will apply the inclusion and exclusion criteria to select studies for inclusion into the systematic review.
