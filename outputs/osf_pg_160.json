Before the experiment, the participants will be shown an example of how to complete a cognitive therapy exercise using an artificial scenario. This will be followed by comprehension check questions. In phase 2, they will be asked to fill out a pre-questionnaire, which will be hosted on Qualtrics. The questionnaire will cover three main parts: a perceived usefulness subscale, which is derived from the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (McAuley et al. 1989); a self-efficacy questionnaire, which is based on participants' self-image with regard to doing the thought-strengthening exercises; and a question asking to distribute 20 minutes on two tasks: picture identification task and thought strengthening exercise. Afterward, they will be presented with three motivational barriers that could obstruct them from completing the thought strengthening exercise and they will be asked to rank them based on how applicable they are to themselves. We will have three barriers in the experiment: usefulness, self-efficacy, and perfectionism. The participants will then be given a new, randomly selected scenario and asked to rate the believability of 3 negative and 3 positive thought options from 0 to 100 percent. The highest-rated (negative and positive) thoughts will be used in the exercise. The third phase is the experiment itself, wherein Groups B and C will receive support corresponding to each participant\u2019s top motivational barrier, while Group A will receive nothing. In the beginning, the participants will write evidence for or against their most believable negative thought to examine it, then write evidence for the most believable positive thought. After that, they will be asked again to rate the believability of the 3 negative and 3 positive thoughts (from 1 to 100 percent). In the last phase, the intervention\u2019s effect on the participants\u2019 behavioral intentions will be assessed by asking them to rerate the barrier, having them answer the questionnaire again, and asking them the picture identification question again. An additional survey will be added regarding their enjoyment of the barrier addressing method, and this survey will be derived from the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (McAuley et al. 1989).\n\nThe participants will be recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk, and the workers should be from English-speaking countries.

The participants of each group will be asked to fill pre- and post-experiment surveys on the measures (namely, perceived usefulness and self-efficacy) that will be used to compare the three groups.", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "The experiment will be conducted online and will include 4 phases. The first phase will be the introduction, in which the participants will be asked to complete an informed consent form. Additionally, they will be briefed about the nature of the experiment and informed about the exclusion policies for responses (e.g., if they write gibberish or irrelevant answers). Before the experiment, the participants will be shown an example of how to complete a cognitive therapy exercise using an artificial scenario. This will be followed by comprehension check questions. In phase 2, they will be asked to fill out a pre-questionnaire, which will be hosted on Qualtrics. The questionnaire will cover three main parts: a perceived usefulness subscale, which is derived from the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (McAuley et al. 1989); a self-efficacy questionnaire, which is based on participants' self-image with regard to doing the thought-strengthening exercises; and a question asking to distribute 20 minutes on two tasks: picture identification task and thought strengthening exercise. Afterward, they will be presented with three motivational barriers that could obstruct them from completing the thought strengthening exercise and they will be asked to rank them based on how applicable they are to themselves. We will have three barriers in the experiment: usefulness, self-efficacy, and perfectionism. The participants will then be given a new, randomly selected scenario and asked to rate the believability of 3 negative and 3 positive thought options from 0 to 100 percent. The highest-rated (negative and positive) thoughts will be used in the exercise. The third phase is the experiment itself, wherein Groups B and C will receive support corresponding to each participant\u2019s top motivational barrier, while Group A will receive nothing. In the beginning, the participants will write evidence for or against their most believable negative thought to examine it, then write evidence for the most believable positive thought. After that, they will be asked again to rate the believability of the 3 negative and 3 positive thoughts (from 1 to 100 percent). In the last phase, the intervention\u2019s effect on the participants\u2019 behavioral intentions will be assessed by asking them to rerate the barrier, having them answer the questionnaire again, and asking them the picture identification question again. An additional survey will be added regarding their enjoyment of the barrier addressing method, and this survey will be derived from the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (McAuley et al. 1989).\n\nThe participants will be recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk, and the workers should be from English-speaking countries.

Beer"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Research Question 1:\nWhat makes us feel authentic? Theories of authenticity suggest that people should feel most authentic when they act in line with the unique pattern of qualities that make up their true self, that is, what makes them really them (Harter, 2002; Kernis &amp; Goldman, 2006; Schmader &amp; Sedikides, 2018). However, daily diary studies consistently find that people feel most authentic when their behavior conforms to a particular pattern of personality traits (e.g., high extraversion, high agreeableness, high conscientiousness, low neuroticism, and high openness) rather than acting in line with their own patterns of baseline traits (see Beer &amp; Harris, 2019 for a review).  \nWhy would this pattern of personality traits make people feel more authentic than the pattern of qualities they claim characterizes their true self? One possibility is suggested by the way we judge authenticity in objects. Specifically, people tend to judge the authenticity of food or other objects based on their conformity to convention (Lehman, O\u2019Connor, Kovacs &amp; Newman, 2018). The pattern of qualities that tend to be associated with feelings of authenticity in daily diary studies tend to be those that are valued by the participants\u2019 societies (most studies have been conducted in Western countries). Research has shown that we view people as less than fully human when they fail to conform to societal conventions (Fincher &amp; Tetlock, 2016). Therefore, when it comes time to make a judgment about our own authenticity, we may use criteria that are closer to how we judge the authenticity of an object such as food. It may be that we draw on social conventions about how a person should act to evaluate our own authenticity.\nTherefore, we will test the extent to which feelings of authenticity are increased by thinking about what it means to be a human (e.g., \u201cWhat is it about you that makes you human\u201d), the true self (e.g., \u201cWhat is it about you that makes you who you really are?\u201d), or a control condition in which self-evaluation is grounded in a day\u2019s activity (e.g., \u201cWhat kind of activities are you doing today?\u201d).\n\nQuestion 1: Does priming someone to think about their humanity (general category) vs. their true self (unique to them) affect feelings of authenticity?\n\nResearch Question 2:\nHow much do people value learning about their \u201ctrue self\u201d compared to other kinds of self-relevant information?  Research on authenticity asserts that people strive to know their true selves (Harter, 2002; Kernis &amp; Goldman, 2006; Schmader &amp; Sedikides, 2018). In addition to research on authenticity and self-assessment, there is a large literature discussing people\u2019s interest in self-enhancement (Alicke &amp; Sedikides, 2011; Sherman &amp; Hartson, 2011) and self-verification (Swann, 1983, 1990). However, there is less empirical evidence concerning how much people relatively place value on learning about their true, core selves in relation to self-enhancing and self-verifying information. This research tests how much people value feedback about their true self compared to self-verifying (confirming what you already know) or self-enhancing (only revealing your strengths) feedback. Our previous research has suggested that participants, when asked in a between-subject design, tend to value feedback about their true self more than self-verifying feedback (and self-enhancing feedback falls in between). In this study, we use a within-subject design to understand more explicit representations of value across these feedback types. That is, when people are aware that these various types of feedback are available, do they self-report placing more value on feedback about their true selves than self-verifying feedback (with self-enhancing feedback\u2019s value falling in between the two) or do they show a different pattern of value? Specifically, we will measure  willingness to pay (WTP) for personality information as a function of the framing of the feedback as 1) revealing the true, core self, 2) confirming their preexisting self-conceptions, 3) as only self-enhancing in nature, or 4) not specified (control condition in which no details about the feedback are specified).\n\nQuestion 2: Does an individual\u2019s willingness to pay for personality information differ as a function of the framing of the feedback they will receive?\n\nExploratory Research Questions:\nQuestion 3: We plan to explore the effect of the writing prompt manipulation on subcomponents of authenticity (rather than an aggregate score). We will conduct a parallel analyses as those described under \u201cstatistical models\u201d for the four subscales of our Authenticity measure (unbiased processing, relational orientation, awareness, and behavior)\n\nQuestion 4: We will test for correlations between Authenticity, the four subscales of Authenticity (awareness, unbiased processing, behavior, and relational orientation), Self-esteem, Meaning in Life, each factor of the BFI (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism), and willingness to pay.\n\nQuestion 5: We plan to explore the effect of the writing prompt manipulation on our meaning in life measure (both subscales, presence and search; Schlegel, Hicks, King &amp; Arndt, 2011)."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypothesis 1: We hypothesize that there will be a main effect of writing prompt (humanity, authenticity and control) on feelings of authenticity. Theories of authenticity from the self literature suggest that thinking about one\u2019s true self would significantly increase feelings of authenticity beyond simply recounting one\u2019s daily activities (H1a) whereas theories about authenticity from the consumer goods literature suggests that thinking about what makes someone human should additionally significantly increase feelings of authenticity beyond simply recounting one\u2019s daily activities (H1b).  \n\nHypothesis 2: We hypothesize that there will be a main effect of feedback type on willingness to pay. If people\u2019s explicit representations of the value of self-relevant feedback are similar to their tacit representations (measured in our previous work), then it may be that people will pay more for feedback about their true self than self-verifying or control condition feedback while self-enhancing feedback will fall in between the true self and self-verifying conditions (i.e., not significantly different from either)."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

They will then answer a series of demographic questions and view the debriefing form. \n\nTo address question 1, we use a between-subjects design with writing prompt (humanity, authenticity, and control) as a between-subjects factor. The dependent variable is Authenticity (composite score from the Kernis-Goldman Authenticity Inventory \u2013 Short Form). \n\nTo address question 2, we use a within-subjects design where subjects are exposed to all four feedback types and measure the subjects\u2019 willingness to pay for each type of feedback with a set amount of money ($20).\n\nProcedure:\n1. Self-Reference Writing Task. Participants will be instructed to write for 2 minutes on one of three prompts:\n\tA.

Big Five Inventory (BFI; 44 items): Participants will complete this inventory to measure the Big Five Factors (dimensions) of personality, (1 \u2013 disagree strongly, 5 \u2013 agree strongly).\nC. Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE; 10 items): Participants will complete this inventory to measure global self-worth, (1 \u2013 disagree strongly, 5 \u2013 agree strongly)\nD. Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ; 10 items): Participants will complete this inventory to measure two dimensions of meaning in life: 1) presence of meaning and 2) search for meaning, (1 \u2013 absolutely untrue, 5 absolutely true)\n\n3. Value of Personality Feedback Task. Participants will be instructed to allocate $20 to reflect how much they would be willing to pay for the four different types of feedback displayed below. They have the option to allocate similar or different amounts across feedback type but allocations must add up to $20.\nA.

If people\u2019s explicit representations of the value of self-relevant feedback are similar to their tacit representations (measured in our previous work), then it may be that people will pay more for feedback about their true self than self-verifying or control condition feedback while self-enhancing feedback will fall in between the true self and self-verifying conditions (i.e., not significantly different from either).", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

After completing a series of personality measures outlined in \u201cmeasured variables\u201d and assessing two TAT pictures (not measured but included to increase the ostensible validity and sophistication of the testing to participants), participants indicate their willingness to pay for four different types of personality reports offering different types of feedback (self-enhancing, self-verifying, true self, and control). They will then answer a series of demographic questions and view the debriefing form. \n\nTo address question 1, we use a between-subjects design with writing prompt (humanity, authenticity, and control) as a between-subjects factor. The dependent variable is Authenticity (composite score from the Kernis-Goldman Authenticity Inventory \u2013 Short Form). \n\nTo address question 2, we use a within-subjects design where subjects are exposed to all four feedback types and measure the subjects\u2019 willingness to pay for each type of feedback with a set amount of money ($20).\n\nProcedure:\n1. Self-Reference Writing Task. Participants will be instructed to write for 2 minutes on one of three prompts:\n\tA. Human Convention condition: \u201cWhat is about you that makes you human?\u201d\n\tB. True self condition: \u201cWhat is it about you that makes you who you really are?\u201d\n\tC. Control condition: \u201cWhat kind of activities are you doing today?\u201d\n\n2. Questionnaires. Participants will be instructed to complete the following questionnaires ostensibly to develop a personality profile. We randomly present our target Authenticity items with items from other personality questionnaires.\nA. Kernis-Goldman Authenticity Inventory \u2013 Short Form (KGAI-SF; 20 items): Participants will complete this inventory to measure a composite authenticity score as well as four subscales, 1) awareness, 2) unbiased processing, 3) behavior, and 4) relational orientation, (1 \u2013 disagree strongly, 5 \u2013 agree strongly)\nB. Big Five Inventory (BFI; 44 items): Participants will complete this inventory to measure the Big Five Factors (dimensions) of personality, (1 \u2013 disagree strongly, 5 \u2013 agree strongly).\nC. Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE; 10 items): Participants will complete this inventory to measure global self-worth, (1 \u2013 disagree strongly, 5 \u2013 agree strongly)\nD. Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ; 10 items): Participants will complete this inventory to measure two dimensions of meaning in life: 1) presence of meaning and 2) search for meaning, (1 \u2013 absolutely untrue, 5 absolutely true)\n\n3. Value of Personality Feedback Task. Participants will be instructed to allocate $20 to reflect how much they would be willing to pay for the four different types of feedback displayed below. They have the option to allocate similar or different amounts across feedback type but allocations must add up to $20.\nA. Self-enhancement condition: \u201cCross validation studies conducted by the University of Michigan in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles have shown that feedback from this set of personality tests identifies positive personal qualities you may not already know about yourself.\u201d \nB. Self-verification condition: \u201cCross validation studies conducted by the University of Michigan in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles have shown that feedback from this set of personality tests confirms personal qualities that you are likely to already know about yourself.\u201d\nC.
