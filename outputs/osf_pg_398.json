The awareness of need mechanism includes two treatments. We will test for interactions with Palestinian-Jordanian identity, education, age, gender, income, and frequency of contact with Syrians. The conjoint analysis will evaluate the effects of 11 attributes: gender; age; occupation in Jordan; receiving benefits from UNHCR; place of residence in Jordan; education level; religious sect; religiosity; place of residence in Syria; reason for fleeing Syria; and family status. We will look for sub-group effects among educated and higher-income respondents, urban and rural respondents, respondents with children, and Palestinian-Jordanians. We will also explore interactions between the attributes. See the pre-analysis plan for more details.", "q17": "The attitudinal experiments will be analyzed with OLS regressions using robust standard errors. We will test effects on several outcome questions and on an index of the outcome questions designed using polychoric PCA. The analysis will be conducted with no covariates; with a set of limited covariates; and a more extended set of covariates. The conjoint analysis will be analyzed using standard methods, with the AMCE estimated by regressing the outcomes on dummy variables for each of the attribute levels. Standard errors will be clustered by respondent. For both sets of analysis, we will report both weighted and unweighted results, with weights taken from Jordan's 2015 census.", "q18": "Jordan", "q19": "3200", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes",

Within each community, we measured perceptions of the councillor, perceptions of the allocation process, and anticipated voting behavior. By collecting baseline and endline voter survey data, and by including these three groups in the process, we expect to be able to isolate aggregate differences in public opinion that are due to the influx of development goods in the community from such differences that are due to simply being favored by the political process or national shifts in public opinion over time. Also, unlike other studies, we can evaluate voter perceptions in precisely those places where politicians have chosen to allocate development goods. This provides us with a more realistic and arguably a \u201cmost likely\u201d case for seeing an effect of aid on public opinion and political behavior.

In 2015, the PIs executed a field experiment examining the allocation of NGO-provisioned school aid by local councillors in Malawi (Jablonski and Zimmerman 2015). This earlier project resulted in the constrained and randomized allocation of school aid and provides us with a unique opportunity to evaluate the causal effects of aid on perceptions of government, voting, and beliefs about government and NGO performance.", "q16": "See attached PAP", "q17": "To evaluate these effects, we conducted baseline and endline surveys before and after the delivery of school aid. These were conducted among voters in three separate groups: (1) communities that were selected by the elected councillors to receive goods and received them after selection in the lottery, (2) communities that were selected by the elected councillors to receive goods but did not receive them because they were not selected in the lottery; (3) communities that were not selected by the elected councillors to receive goods. Within each community, we measured perceptions of the councillor, perceptions of the allocation process, and anticipated voting behavior. By collecting baseline and endline voter survey data, and by including these three groups in the process, we expect to be able to isolate aggregate differences in public opinion that are due to the influx of development goods in the community from such differences that are due to simply being favored by the political process or national shifts in public opinion over time. Also, unlike other studies, we can evaluate voter perceptions in precisely those places where politicians have chosen to allocate development goods. This provides us with a more realistic and arguably a \u201cmost likely\u201d case for seeing an effect of aid on public opinion and political behavior. The results of this study will allow us to validate our priors that voters value the allocation of donor development goods and often attribute such goods to the influence of elected leaders.", "q18":
