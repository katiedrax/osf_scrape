"value": "The study will be presented as a simple survey of \"Health and Opinions\" to reduce potential expectations as participants begin Participants first see an informed consent document. After consenting, participants are randomly counterbalanced in terms of order to see either the Personal Need for Structure (PNS) or Big Five Personality Inventory (Mini-IPIP) first. The PNS is a validated measure of a dispositional desire for order and structure in everyday life, composed of 12 items (e.g., \"I find that a consistent routine enables me to enjoy life more\"), measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = \"Strongly disagree\" - 5 = \"Strongly agree\"). The Mini-IPIP is a shorter measure of the dispositional Big Five Traits of Intellect (e.g., \"I have a vivid imagination\"), Extraversion (e.g., \"I am the life of the party\"), Agreeableness (e.g., \"I sympathize with others' feelings\"), Conscientiousness (e.g., \"I like order\"), and Neuroticism (e.g., \"I get upset easily\"), measured on the same Likert scale as the PNS.  \nAfter the PNS and Big Five, participants are presented with the mortality salience manipulation. This manipulation is patterned after standard mortality salience manipulations commonly used in terror management research, where participants are asked to \"jot down [their] thoughts and feelings related to your own death\" (compared to a control condition in which participants write about experiencing dental pain, which is negatively-valanced but unrelated to mortality). However, in the present study, these manipulations employ either mention of COVID-19 (serving as the mortality prime, due to current circumstances) or the seasonal flu (a similar issue, but less related to mortality). Participants are randomly assigned to one of these two writing prompts, double blindly, through random assignment in the Qualtrics system. \nFollowing the mortality salience manipulation, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X) will be presented. Traditional terror management research utilizes the PANAS-X as a distraction task during which the thoughts associated with mortality become less conscious (i.e., distal). This task will serve as such, but will also be analyzed to examine the extent to which negative affective states (especially anxiety) are instigated by COVID-19 priming. Additionally, an attention-check item (\"For this item, please select \"extremely\") is embedded within the 60-item, 5-point Likert scale (1= Mot at all - 5 = Extremely).\nAfter the PANAS-X, death-thought accessibility will be measured using another standard terror management measure: a wordstem completion task. Out of 25 presented wordstems, 6 can be spelled with either neutral words, or words related to mortality. Participants will see some letters and asked to fill in the remaining blanks as quickly as possible; for example, \"C O F F __ __\", which can be completed as either \"COFFEE\" or \"COFFIN\". The number of mortality-completed words are then tallied. Additionally, this task is timed, allowing for potential screening and other analyses to examine how long participants take to consider each word.\nAfter DTA, participants are presented with a novel measure of flu-related health behaviors. The behaviors themselves are those listed by the Centers for Disease Control as helpful in containing the spread of the flu (e.g., washing hands for 20 seconds). Participants are asked to rate the extent to which they can imagine themselves engaging in the listed behaviors on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Not at all - 5 = Entirely).\nThen, participants are presented with a measure of voting intentions pertaining to the upcoming November 2020 election. They are asked to characterize their political ideology, strength of ideology, party affiliation, intended candidate, and level of confidence in their intended candidate. \nFinally, standard demographic questions are presented. Within the demographics, a manipulation check is presented to ensure that participants remembered the prompt with which they were presented, along with short probing questions (e.g., \"Do you have any thoughts or feelings about this study\").\nAt the very end, participants are debriefed and thanked for their participation."}}}, "planned-sample": {"value": {"question4b": {"extra": [], "value": "Sample will be selected from Amazon MTurk workers who live in the United States and have objectively high reviews based on MTurk metrics (e.g., high HIT completion rate)."}, "question5b": {"extra": [], "value": "Data will be collected through the Amazon MTurk system.

If some mistake is made, we will stop data collection and restart from scratch.", "description-methods.procedure.question10b": "The study will be presented as a simple survey of \"Health and Opinions\" to reduce potential expectations as participants begin Participants first see an informed consent document. After consenting, participants are randomly counterbalanced in terms of order to see either the Personal Need for Structure (PNS) or Big Five Personality Inventory (Mini-IPIP) first. The PNS is a validated measure of a dispositional desire for order and structure in everyday life, composed of 12 items (e.g., \"I find that a consistent routine enables me to enjoy life more\"), measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = \"Strongly disagree\" - 5 = \"Strongly agree\"). The Mini-IPIP is a shorter measure of the dispositional Big Five Traits of Intellect (e.g., \"I have a vivid imagination\"), Extraversion (e.g., \"I am the life of the party\"), Agreeableness (e.g., \"I sympathize with others' feelings\"), Conscientiousness (e.g., \"I like order\"), and Neuroticism (e.g., \"I get upset easily\"), measured on the same Likert scale as the PNS.  \nAfter the PNS and Big Five, participants are presented with the mortality salience manipulation. This manipulation is patterned after standard mortality salience manipulations commonly used in terror management research, where participants are asked to \"jot down [their] thoughts and feelings related to your own death\" (compared to a control condition in which participants write about experiencing dental pain, which is negatively-valanced but unrelated to mortality). However, in the present study, these manipulations employ either mention of COVID-19 (serving as the mortality prime, due to current circumstances) or the seasonal flu (a similar issue, but less related to mortality). Participants are randomly assigned to one of these two writing prompts, double blindly, through random assignment in the Qualtrics system. \nFollowing the mortality salience manipulation, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X) will be presented. Traditional terror management research utilizes the PANAS-X as a distraction task during which the thoughts associated with mortality become less conscious (i.e., distal). This task will serve as such, but will also be analyzed to examine the extent to which negative affective states (especially anxiety) are instigated by COVID-19 priming. Additionally, an attention-check item (\"For this item, please select \"extremely\") is embedded within the 60-item, 5-point Likert scale (1= Mot at all - 5 = Extremely).\nAfter the PANAS-X, death-thought accessibility will be measured using another standard terror management measure: a wordstem completion task. Out of 25 presented wordstems, 6 can be spelled with either neutral words, or words related to mortality. Participants will see some letters and asked to fill in the remaining blanks as quickly as possible; for example, \"C O F F __ __\", which can be completed as either \"COFFEE\" or \"COFFIN\". The number of mortality-completed words are then tallied. Additionally, this task is timed, allowing for potential screening and other analyses to examine how long participants take to consider each word.\nAfter DTA, participants are presented with a novel measure of flu-related health behaviors. The behaviors themselves are those listed by the Centers for Disease Control as helpful in containing the spread of the flu (e.g., washing hands for 20 seconds). Participants are asked to rate the extent to which they can imagine themselves engaging in the listed behaviors on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Not at all - 5 = Entirely).\nThen, participants are presented with a measure of voting intentions pertaining to the upcoming November 2020 election. They are asked to characterize their political ideology, strength of ideology, party affiliation, intended candidate, and level of confidence in their intended candidate. \nFinally, standard demographic questions are presented. Within the demographics, a manipulation check is presented to ensure that participants remembered the prompt with which they were presented, along with short probing questions (e.g., \"Do you have any thoughts or feelings about this study\").\nAt the very end, participants are debriefed and thanked for their participation.", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question1c": "The COVID-19 prime will elicit higher death-thought accessibility (DTA) compared to the seasonal flu.\n", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question2c": "A one-way between-subjects ANOVA will assess mean differences in death-thought accessibility between the COVID-19 and seasonal flu primes.

We then force the respondents to choose between the two immigrants on whom to allow into Denmark. After this, respondents are asked to rate their preference for allowing each of the immigrants into Denmark. The forced choice and the rating task are defined as one conjoint task.

We then force the respondents to choose between the two immigrants on whom to allow into Denmark. After this, respondents are asked to rate their preference for allowing each of the immigrants into Denmark. The forced choice and the rating task are defined as one conjoint task. There are 5 conjoint tasks in total. \n\nFollowing the 5 conjoint tasks, we randomize the respondents into two groups containing 500 respondents each.

The continuity of interaction despite a transient loss of perceptual contact often exists and contributes to goal achievement. Here, we study the dynamics of this continuity, in two experiments involving participants (N=7) synchronizing their movements in space and in time. We show that behavioural unison can be maintained after perceptual contact has been lost, for about 7s. Agent similarity and spatial configuration in the group modulated synchronization performance, differently so when perceptual interaction was present or when it was memorized. Modelling these data through a network of oscillators enabled us to clarify the double origin of this memory effect, of individual and social nature. These results shed new light into why humans continue to move in unison after perceptual interruption, and are consequential for a wide variety of applications at work, in art and in sport.",
