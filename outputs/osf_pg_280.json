The use of an online questionnaire has the advantage that it is anonym and time- and location-independent (D\u00f6ring, 2003). Participants will be recruited using a snowball sampling technique through campus-wide emails, flyers, posting a link online on social media sites (Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram) and using the platform \u201cSurvey Circle\u201d. The final sample should consist (as calculated with the program G*Power 3.1) of at least 252 participants, so that 84 participants are in each group. The statistical analysis will be done with the statistics program SPSS (Ibm, 2017).\nThe study will have two different priming conditions (positive Instagram priming vs. negative Instagram priming) and one control condition in which no priming occurs in the questionnaire. After some information about the survey and the letter of agreement, which the participants will have to agree, the participants will answer some demographic items (e.g. sex, age, nationality, specific questions about Instagram and highest educational degree). After the demographics the participants will complete a questionnaire specific for their Instagram use. The next part is the priming paradigm which is based on former priming studies showing that priming with SNS has an influence on perceived social capital (Chiou et al., 2015) and self-esteem (Gonzales &amp; Hancock, 2011) which might also affect satisfaction with life. The priming paradigm is the independent variable. \nThe participants will be randomly assigned to three different priming conditions: positive Instagram priming, negative Instagram priming and no priming at all. In the two priming conditions, the participants will read a story about Instagram and imagine that they are the person in the story. At the beginning of the stories the person has a good day with friends and posts a picture of himself/ herself on Instagram in the evening. In the positive priming condition, the person gets a lot of likes and positive comments as feedback to the post. In the negative priming condition, the person does not get many likes and negative comments as feedback to the post. After the positive or negative feedback, the story ends up and the participants will be asked some questions about their feelings (\u201cHow do you feel after such comments?\u201d, \u201cHow do you react after such comments?\u201d and \u201cWhat do you think about your followers now?\u201d).\nIn the no priming condition, the participants will just have to complete all the questionnaires and will not read any story about Instagram. \nFurthermore, the participants will fill out questionnaires about self-esteem, satisfaction with life and social capital which serve as the dependent variables. Right after the priming one item of each scale will occur, which has the highest factor loading, because priming effects pass by fast (F\u00f6rster &amp; Liberman, 2007; F\u00f6rster, Liberman, &amp; Friedman, 2007). All other measures (except for the Instagram questionnaire which shows up at the beginning) will be presented completely randomized, so that no order effects can occur.

Besides, we predict multimodal sensory integration and sensory-motor interaction will be present after learning for recognition, while frontal-temporal activity involving deeper-level semantic processing will be present after learning for comprehension.\n\nAim 2: Explore how the activation of literacy-related areas (such as VWFA and PT) changes after ancient Chinese poem learning.\nWe predict that the activity in literacy-related areas, such as Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) and Planum Temporale (PT), will be modulated by learning experience and learning protocols. \n\nAim 3: Investigate how learning-induced brain changes are related to behavioral performance.\nIf the brain regions and functional networks identified in the efforts aiming towards Aim 1 and 2 are critical for the poem learning, the brain activity changes will be associated with behavioral performance in the final exam after the learning program.\n", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.
