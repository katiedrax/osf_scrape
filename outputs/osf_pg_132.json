This will be tested using the Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT).", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Group descriptives regarding depression, anxiety, age, gender, IQ, education level  will be reported. One way anova will be conducted to investigate any group differences in these variables.\n\nA two way mixed factorial ANOVA will be conducted to explore whether there is a main effect of group, main effect of cue and any interaction between group*cue on the dependent variable specificity. The independent variables are the participant group (HD/OCD/CC) and cue valence the dependent variable is memory specificity. \n\nThese analyses will be run with and without relevant covariates, as identified through early analysis of group differences in the following variables: depression, anxiety, IQ, age, education, gender. \n\nDescriptive data for each group (HD, CC, OCD) regarding trauma exposure will be provided as a dichotomous variable (indicating the presence of at least one endorsed lifetime trauma ) and as a composite score.\n\nOne way anova may be used to explore whether there are group differences in trauma exposure. with post hoc tests to analyse the quality of differences.\n\nWe may use an ANCOVA to investigate whether there is a main effect of trauma (as a dichotomous or composite score) or an interaction between group* trauma on the DV specificity. Furthermore, we may investigate whether trauma exposure predicts specificity and whether this differs as a function of group, a linear regression will be used to test the predictive ability of the interaction between group*trauma on the DV specificity. \n\nParticipants who complete the study screening variables but are ineligible to participate in the main study variables will be excluded from any further analysis. Any responses considered to be fraudulent in nature (e.g. duplicates) will be removed from the dataset. Analyses will be conducted with and without the presence of outliers, and any influence of outliers on the results will be reported. \n\nMissing data\n \nWhere there are omissions or missing data in participant responses on the AMT task, missing responses will not be imputed and participants will not be excluded on this basis. This is because omissions/missing data are informative for understanding memory ability if a memory is not reported. Omissions/missing data will be calculated alongside the raw number of specific memories so that this information is explicit and transparent. There are no formal guidelines for dealing with missing data on the LEC. Any missing data on this variable will be noted and will not be imputed.\n\nExploratory analysis\n \nAs, to our knowledge, no investigation of this nature has yet been conducted, we will operationalise the presence of objects in memories as the % and raw number of memories where objects are reported (by group), because this provides a descriptive understanding of object representation across memories, irrespective of the number of objects described within each memory. Further exploration may entail investigating whether the % of memories where objects are present differs as a function of group using a one way ANOVA. Similarly, the meaning of objects in the memories where objects are present will be operationalised by coding descriptions of object-related acquisition, discard, emotional attachment, decision making. The % of memories where object-related acquisition, discard, emotional attachment and decision making are present will be provided (by group). Further exploration will investigate group differences in object-related meaning using ANOVA. Further exploratory analyses may be conducted to reveal the % of specific and general memories, separately, where objects are present, and the % of specific and general memories, separately, where object-related acquisition, discard, emotional attachment and decision making are present (by group).\n\n\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecac48", "text": "Social and

binary split.\nWe may use plots to visualize some of this data.\n\nExperiment:\nManipulation check: ANOVA to test effect of condition on self-world fit\nFirst test of significance: Two-way ANOVA to test interaction between condition and child rearing attitudes in predicting authoritarian attitudes (RWA)\nSecond test of significance: Fisher's R-to-Z to test significance of difference in
