Despite the overlap in subject matter between psychology and philosophy, there is a marked gender imbalance across the two fields.

They range from democracy-promoting interventions that attempt to level the electoral playing field to partisan interventions that seek to tilt the playing field in favor of a preferred candidate. Today, democracy-promoting international election observers monitor more than 80 percent of elections. And, great powers such as the United States and Russia have intervened in partisan ways in numerous elections since World War II, often doing so in ways that successfully swing elections for domestic allies. Although scholars have examined the effects of these interventions on outcomes such as electoral fraud and the vote count, a critical outcome has been overlooked in many studies: individual trust in elections. Likewise, research on trust in elections has focused mainly on domestic political explanations, ignoring the potential for foreign actors to affect electoral trust. This study seeks to understand why and under what conditions foreign actors influence local trust in elections through a case study of Georgia. The survey covered by this pre-registration document is a face-to-face pre-election survey conducted during two weeks prior to the 2018 presidential election in Georgia. We will employ a survey experiment with the following conditions: (a) a control group with no primes about foreign actors; (b) 3 treatment groups about international election monitors; and (c) 4 treatment groups about foreign meddling. The international election monitoring treatments provide information about the presence and activities of international election monitors. The international monitors are described as being: (a) capable of detecting fraud but biased in favor of a particular candidate; (b) not capable of detecting fraud but neutral towards all candidates; or (c) capable of detecting fraud and neutral towards all candidates. We are interested in comparing the treatments to each other as well as to the control of no treatment. Post-treatment questions probe which country or organization the respondent thought we were describing in the treatment. The foreign meddling treatments prime people through a question-order experiment in which individuals answer questions about whether they have heard rumors that foreign actors are attempting to influence the upcoming election, and how likely they think it is that foreign actors are attempting to influence the upcoming election. The actors described in the primes are: (a) the United States; (b) Russia; (c) European countries; and (d) Russia, as described in a report by an American organization. We are interested in comparing the treatments to each other, as a group to the control of no treatment, and individually to the control of no treatment. Given the format of the question-order experiment related to foreign meddling, we plan to analyze both all respondents who received the treatments and also those respondents who answered that it was at least \u201csomewhat likely\u201d or \u201cnot too likely\u201d that the foreign actor in question was attempting to influence the upcoming election. Our core interest is in understanding how these experimental treatments affect individuals\u2019 reported trust in the election, and that is what we focus on in this registration document. Further analyses may also explore how trust in election affects political behaviors, including through a follow-up survey conducted after the election. This registration document also explores several theoretically-relevant moderators as described below."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "We seek to test the following hypotheses about the direct effects of foreign actors: 1. People will have more trust in elections when they learn about the monitoring activities of election observers that they perceive as capable and unbiased. The logic behind this hypothesis, which we developed in prior work on this topic (Bush and Prather 2018), is that election observers can send a signal to the public about the electoral playing field, but only when they are perceived as being capable of detecting fraud and willing to do so (i.e., unbiased in their monitoring activities). Our emphasis on election observers that are perceived to be capable and unbiased matters since many different organizations serve as election observers around the same elections. 2. People will have less trust in elections when they think foreign meddling is likely. The logic here is similar in that foreign meddling sends a signal to the public about the fairness of the electoral playing field since meddlers are trying to tilt the playing field in favor of a particular candidate or party. We also seek to test the following hypotheses about how various factors moderate the effect of foreign actors: 1. Nationalism conditions the effect of foreign interventions on trust. We expect that any type of foreign intervention (but perhaps especially meddling) could spark a negative emotional response from highly nationalistic individuals, which affects how they update their trust in elections in response to foreign actors\u2019 involvement. As such, nationalism may mute trust-enhancing information about election monitors and amplify trust-decreasing information about foreign meddling. 2. Feelings about specific foreign actors condition the effects of foreign interventions on trust. We hypothesize that when specific foreign countries or organizations inspire positive feelings, it can augment their positive effects on trust and mitigate or reverse their negative effects on trust. Similarly, when specific foreign countries or organizations inspire negative feelings, it can augment their negative effects on trust and mitigate or reverse their positive effects. 3. Vote choice conditions the effects of foreign interventions on trust. Building on our previous work on motivated reasoning and trust in elections (Bush and Prather 2017), we posit that election winners\u2019 trust will be more positively influenced by trust-enhancing interventions, whereas election losers\u2019 trust will be more negatively influenced by trust-decreasing interventions. However, the moderating effect of vote choice may be weaker in the pre-election environment since individuals are in a less emotional state as the results of the election are not yet known. 4. Strength of partisan or candidate attachment conditions the effects of foreign interventions on trust. We expect that people who have stronger attachments to parties or candidates will be more likely to have strong emotional reactions to winning or losing an election. Therefore, we expect that they will be more likely to display the conditional effects related to vote choice described above. However, the moderating effect of partisan or candidate attachment may be weaker in the pre-election environment since individuals are in a less emotional state as the results of the election are not yet known. We will also test a secondary hypothesis that trust-enhancing treatments will make people who previously reported trusting the election more certain about their trust and people who previously reported distrusting the election less certain, and vice versa for trust-decreasing treatments. In other words, it is possible that for some individuals we will not see their trust in the election change, but their certainty in their beliefs may respond to treatment."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "The hypotheses will be tested using the survey experiment described above. The key outcome measures in the study are as follows: 1. Main DV 1: Do you think that you will trust the results of the presidential election? (answer options: yes and no, followed by trust strongly, trust somewhat, trust a little, distrust a little, distrust somewhat, distrust strongly) 2. Main DV 2: Do you think it is likely that the results of the presidential election will reflect the will of the Georgian people? (answer options: yes and no, followed by very likely, somewhat likely, not too likely, not too unlikely, somewhat unlikely, very unlikely) 3. Secondary DV 1: How certain are you about your response to this question? (asked about DV 1; answer options: very certain, somewhat certain, not too certain, not certain at all. 4. Secondary DV 2: How certain are you about your response to this question? (asked about DV 2; answer options: very certain, somewhat certain, not too certain, not certain at all. The first two measures will be analyzed separately and in combination to capture electoral trust. When the dependent variable is binary, we will use logistic regression or difference of proportion tests, and when the dependent variable is ordered, we will use OLS or difference in means tests. We will use an alpha of 0.1, where the null hypothesis is that the mean of our outcome variable does not differ between experimental conditions. Demographic control variables will be included in some regression specifications; decisions about what to include will be informed by the results of balance tests. For a different operationalization, we can look at within-subject variation in reported trust, comparing responses to the same questions before and after the experimental treatments described above. We will use similar methods to test the hypothesis related to the secondary DVs. The key moderators in the study are as follows: 1. Nationalism: (1) When someone says something bad about the country of Georgia, how strongly do you feel it is as if they said something bad about you? (answer options: very strongly, somewhat strongly, not too strongly, not strongly at all); (2) How much do you feel that what happens to the country of Georgia in general will be your fate as well? (answer options: a lot, some, not too much, not at all); (3) If you are a citizen of Georgia, how much does being a Georgian citizen have to do with how you feel about yourself? (answer options: a lot, some, not too much, not at all); responses to these three questions may be combined into one measure of nationalism, depending on how correlated they are 2. Feelings about specific countries and organizations: Please tell me how favorably you feel about the following groups/countries in general? (a) the United States; (b) National Democratic Institute (NDI); (c) Russia; (d) Georgian civil society organizations; (e) European countries (answer options: very favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable, very unfavorable) 3. Vote choice: If voting: Who do you intend to vote for? If not voting: Although you do not intend to vote, who would you vote for if you were to vote? How likely do you think it is that [previous answer] will win the October 28 presidential election? (answer options: very likely, somewhat likely, not too likely, not likely at all.) 4. Strength of candidate attachment: Strong candidate attachment is indicated by people who support a particular candidate and plan to vote for that candidate, whereas weak candidate attachment is indicated by people who support a particular candidate but do not plan to go to the polls on Election Day. In the main analyses, we plan to create dichotomous indicators for each of these moderators; for the indicators that have four response options, we will combine the first two answer options and the second two answer options. Moderators will be interacted with the treatment variables using regression analyses of the sort described above.

They range from democracy-promoting interventions that attempt to level the electoral playing field to partisan interventions that seek to tilt the playing field in favor of a preferred candidate. Today, democracy-promoting international election observers monitor more than 80 percent of elections. And, great powers such as the United States and Russia have intervened in partisan ways in numerous elections since World War II, often doing so in ways that successfully swing elections for domestic allies. Although scholars have examined the effects of these interventions on outcomes such as electoral fraud and the vote count, a critical outcome has been overlooked in many studies: individual trust in elections. Likewise, research on trust in elections has focused mainly on domestic political explanations, ignoring the potential for foreign actors to affect electoral trust.

We are investigating how the personality trait Grit relates to academic involvement, engagement, and self-efficacy in students. Grit is defined as the propensity to sustain the interest and effort needed to achieve long-term goals (e.g. passion + perseverance). We predict that Grit will be seen more in students who are highly involved on campus. These involved students will also show high academic self-efficacy, which could indicate grit is a moderating factor in the relationship between academic self-efficacy and campus engagement. Conversely, we predict that conscientiousness will uniquely predict academic success \u201con paper\u201d (i.e. GPA) but not necessarily campus engagement.
