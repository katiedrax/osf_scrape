Condition or domain being studied.\n\nPseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a rare, autosomal recessive, and multi-system disease due to ABCC6 gene mutations that affects the eye. In the later stages of the disease, macular atrophy and retinal hemorrhages may develop, leading to irreversible loss of central vision. Vision impairment has been found to most severely affect the quality of life of patients with PXE, exceeding that of cardiovascular related complications. The treatment of CNV secondary to PXE has been centred around the limiting the progression of retinal hemorrhages due to CNV. In particular, the use of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents has been shown to stabilize and improve the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT). In addition, good evidence exists for the use of bevacizumab and ranibizumab for angioid streaks. However, to date and to our knowledge, the literature lacks a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of anti-VEGF therapy for the treatment of CNV secondary to PXE.\n\nTherefore, the objective of this review is to provide an overview and evaluate the current evidence on the effectiveness of anti-VEGF therapy on the functional and structural outcomes in the context of CNV secondary to PXE.\n\nOutcomes: Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA), Central Retinal Thickness (CRT), Central Macular Thickness (CMT), greatest lesion height, and quality of life scores.\n\n18. Participants/population.\n\nInclusion: Patients with choroidal neovascularization secondary to pseudoxanthoma elasticum.\nExclusion: Patients under 18 years of age. Patients with choroidal neovascularization secondary to another condition. Patients receiving combination therapy (i.e., agents and/or treatments in addition to anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF))\n\n19. Intervention(s), exposure(s).\n\nAnti-VEGF agents (ranibizumab, bevacizumab, aflibercept) administered through intravitreal injection to affected eye. \n\n20. Comparator(s)/control.\n\nStudies will be separated according to comparator used:\n\n1)\tPatient BCVA, CRT, CMT, greatest lesion height, and quality of life scores at baseline.\n2)\tPatient BCVA, CRT, CMT, greatest lesion height in contralateral, untreated eye.\n\n21. Types of study to be included.\n\nThe studies are required to be comparative. Eligible study designs include retrospective cohort, prospective cohort, randomized controlled trials (RCT), and quasi-randomized clinical trials. Case reports, case series, and other studies reporting less than 4 patients will be excluded from the quantitative analysis, but will be informally included in the qualitative part of the review.\n\n22. Context.\n\nStudies in hospital providing anti-VEGF therapy to patients with choroidal neovascularization secondary to pseudoxanthoma elasticum.\n\n23. Main outcome(s).\n\nPrimary outcomes: Patient BCVA, CRT, CMT, and greatest lesion height.\n\n\n24. Additional outcome(s).\n\nQuality of life scores\n\n25. Data extraction (selection and coding).\n\nStudy selection\n\u2022\tTwo independent, blinded reviewers will apply the inclusion and exclusion criteria to select studies for inclusion into the systematic review. Discrepancies will be resolved by a third reviewer, the supervisor of the study.\n\u2022\tExcel software will be used to record decisions. \n\nData extraction\n\u2022\tInformation about and not limited to study design and methodology, participant demographics and baseline characteristics, and adverse events will be recorded. Study authors will be contacted for additional information if required.\n\u2022\tTwo independent, blinded reviewers will extract data from select studies. Less than 5% error between reviewers will be acceptable in cases where estimation is required (i.e., using ImageJ software to estimate values from Figures when the data is not reported in text or supplemental materials). Discrepancies will be resolved by a third reviewer, the supervisor of the study.\n\u2022\tExcel software will be used to record data. \n\n26. Risk of bias (quality) assessment.\n\nMethods for assessing risk of bias reported in systematic review protocols should include:\n\u2022\tThe Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials, version 2.0, will be used to assess the risk of bias of all included studies. \n\u2022\tTwo independent, blinded reviewers will apply the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials, version 2.0, to assess the risk of bias and quality of studies. Discrepancies will be resolved by a third reviewer, the supervisor of the study.\n\u2022\tAssessment will be done at the study level.\n\u2022\tOnly studies will a low risk of bias will be included in the meta-analysis of outcomes. \n\n28. Strategy for data synthesis.\n\n\u2022\tData will only be synthesized if there are more than two studies that report on the same outcome. \n\u2022\tOutcomes that will be synthesized include BCVA, CRT, CMT, greatest lesion height, and quality of life scores.\n\u2022\tThe mean difference in a random-effects meta-analysis for quantitative data will be used to pool data for BCVA, CRT, CMT, and greatest lesion height, as these outcomes should be directly comparable. The standardised mean difference will be used for quality of life scores.\n\n29. Analysis of subgroups or subsets.\n\nSubgroup analysis is not planned. \n\n30.

Condition or domain being studied.\n\nPseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a rare, autosomal recessive, and multi-system disease due to ABCC6 gene mutations that affects the eye. In the later stages of the disease, macular atrophy and retinal hemorrhages may develop, leading to irreversible loss of central vision. Vision impairment has been found to most severely affect the quality of life of patients with PXE, exceeding that of cardiovascular related complications. The treatment of CNV secondary to PXE has been centred around the limiting the progression of retinal hemorrhages due to CNV. In particular, the use of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents has been shown to stabilize and improve the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT). In addition, good evidence exists for the use of bevacizumab and ranibizumab for angioid streaks. However, to date and to our knowledge, the literature lacks a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of anti-VEGF therapy for the treatment of CNV secondary to PXE.\n\nTherefore, the objective of this review is to provide an overview and evaluate the current evidence on the effectiveness of anti-VEGF therapy on the functional and structural outcomes in the context of CNV secondary to PXE.\n\nOutcomes: Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA), Central Retinal Thickness (CRT), Central Macular Thickness (CMT), greatest lesion height, and quality of life scores.\n\n18. Participants/population.\n\nInclusion: Patients with choroidal neovascularization secondary to pseudoxanthoma elasticum.\nExclusion: Patients under 18 years of age. Patients with choroidal neovascularization secondary to another condition. Patients receiving combination therapy (i.e., agents and/or treatments in addition to anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF))\n\n19. Intervention(s), exposure(s).\n\nAnti-VEGF agents (ranibizumab, bevacizumab, aflibercept) administered through intravitreal injection to affected eye. \n\n20. Comparator(s)/control.\n\nStudies will be separated according to comparator used:\n\n1)\tPatient BCVA, CRT, CMT, greatest lesion height, and quality of life scores at baseline.\n2)\tPatient BCVA, CRT, CMT, greatest lesion height in contralateral, untreated eye.\n\n21. Types of study to be included.\n\nThe studies are required to be comparative. Eligible study designs include retrospective cohort, prospective cohort, randomized controlled trials (RCT), and quasi-randomized clinical trials. Case reports, case series, and other studies reporting less than 4 patients will be excluded from the quantitative analysis, but will be informally included in the qualitative part of the review.\n\n22.

Data extraction (selection and coding).\n\nStudy selection\n\u2022\tTwo independent, blinded reviewers will apply the inclusion and exclusion criteria to select studies for inclusion into the systematic review. Discrepancies will be resolved by a third reviewer, the supervisor of the study.\n\u2022\tExcel software will be used to record decisions. \n\nData extraction\n\u2022\tInformation about and not limited to study design and methodology, participant demographics and baseline characteristics, and adverse events will be recorded. Study authors will be contacted for additional information if required.\n\u2022\tTwo independent, blinded reviewers will extract data from select studies. Less than 5% error between reviewers will be acceptable in cases where estimation is required (i.e., using ImageJ software to estimate values from Figures when the data is not reported in text or supplemental materials). Discrepancies will be resolved by a third reviewer, the supervisor of the study.\n\u2022\tExcel software will be used to record data. \n\n26. Risk of bias (quality) assessment.\n\nMethods for assessing risk of bias reported in systematic review protocols should include:\n\u2022\tThe Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials, version 2.0, will be used to assess the risk of bias of all included studies. \n\u2022\tTwo independent, blinded reviewers will apply the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials, version 2.0, to assess the risk of bias and quality of studies. Discrepancies will be resolved by a third reviewer, the supervisor of the study.\n\u2022\tAssessment will be done at the study level.\n\u2022\tOnly studies will a low risk of bias will be included in the meta-analysis of outcomes. \n\n28. Strategy for data synthesis.\n\n\u2022\tData will only be synthesized if there are more than two studies that report on the same outcome. \n\u2022\tOutcomes that will be synthesized include BCVA, CRT, CMT, greatest lesion height, and quality of life scores.\n\u2022\tThe mean difference in a random-effects meta-analysis for quantitative data will be used to pool data for BCVA, CRT, CMT, and greatest lesion height, as these outcomes should be directly comparable.

The measure of prototypicality was based on the study by Hogg, Cooper-Shaw, &amp; Holzworth (1993). Participants were asked to identify the characteristics of the group of youth (18 to 25 years of age) and to describe a prototype in no more five lines. They will then be asked to indicate how difficult it was for them to generate this description (1 = very easy, 7 = very difficult), how confident they were that this was an accurate description (1 = not very convinced, 7 = very convinced), and what percentage of the group they think generally agrees with their description. Finally, the prototypicality of the participants will be measured in 1 item: \"How typical of the group of young people do you consider yourself to? \"(1 = not at all representative, 7 = very representative), adapted in French from studies by Hogg, Cooper-Shaw, and Holzworth (1993). \n2.

They will be given a brief presentation of the study, and will be asked to complete a pre-manipulation questionnaire online in order to participate in the study.\n\nPre-manipulation questionnaire. This questionnaire will include several measures: \n- Attitudes towards increasing tuition fees (Dependent Variable, Time 1)\n- Proximity to the group (covariate)\n- Demographic information (sex, date of birth, parents' socio-professional category, initials)\n\n1. For the presence of vicarious dissonance condition: \nParticipants will be greeted by an experimenter who will tell them that this is a paired study. The experimenter will then stage a telephone conversation with another experimenter during which he or she will learn that the other participant has arrived.\n\nOnce the participants are seated in the experiment room, the experimenter will tell them that this is a computer study. The experimenter will explain that he was studying linguistic subcultures, to explore whether the mere fact of living together might cause unique speech patterns to develop (Norton et al., 2003). We stressed these potential differences between groups to make group concerns salient (Turner et al., 1987). The experimenter will specify that in his research, he is particularly interested in the language differences between the youth group (18-25 years old) and the senior group (65-75 years old), and that the paired participant who performs the experiment at the same time as him is also part of the youth group. It will be indicated that this person is of the same sex as him/her: if it is a girl student, we will say that the pair is a girl, if it is a boy, we will say that the pair is a young man (control of group membership). The experimenter will then explain to the participants that in order to study these linguistic subcultures, one of the participants will have to write an argumentative text in favor of increasing tuition fees, while the other will judge this argumentative text on a set of linguistic criteria. To manipulate the negative consequences, the experimenter will explain that the Dean needed students to make speeches in favor of a tuition increase so that the Dean could use the arguments generated to justify any increase. To manipulate the choice of target and the target's opinion of the increasing tuition fees, participants will read a scripted exchange of e-mail messages (via Quaknet software) between the experimenter and the author of the advocacy text. The author of the argumentative text will express his total disagreement with the position to be defended and has asked the experimenter if he is obliged to write it. The experimenter will reply that, of course, he is not obliged to do so, but that he would really appreciate it if they wrote it. The author of the text will answer that he has no more questions and that he was ready to begin. Our cover will be corroborated by the presence of a sheet of paper and a pen on the table in each experimental room. Once instructions have been given, the experimenter will leave the experiment room and the participant will complete the tasks on the computer.\nAfter reading a brief article on linguistic subcultures, all participants will be led to believe that the computer randomly assigns the position of judge or writer of the argumentative text. While waiting for their pair to write the argumentative text, the participants will complete the post-manipulation questionnaire. \n\nPost-manipulation questionnaire: \n- Attitudes towards increasing tuition fees (Dependent Variable, Time 2)\n- Demographic information (sex, date of birth, parents' socio-professional category, initials)\n- Manipulation check (perception of observed choice and the negative consequences follow from one\u2019s actions, affiliation with the writer's group)\n\n2. For the absence of vicarious dissonance condition:\nParticipants will complete only the post-manipulation questionnaire, with dependent measure (i.e., Attitudes towards increasing tuition fees in time 2), without following a vicarious dissonance procedure. \n\nWe will use block randomization, where each participant will be randomly assigned to one of the two equally sized, predetermined blocks \nFor randomization, we will use https://www.random.org/integers/\n\n"}}}, "planned-sample": {"value": {"question4b": {"extra": [], "value": "Participants will be undergraduate student from Aix Marseille University, recruited through advertisements.

Our measure of proximity with the group consists of 4 measures: group prototypicality, social identification with the group, similarity and interpersonal proximity to the group. \n1. The measure of prototypicality was based on the study by Hogg, Cooper-Shaw, &amp; Holzworth (1993). Participants were asked to identify the characteristics of the group of youth (18 to 25 years of age) and to describe a prototype in no more five lines.

Finally, the prototypicality of the participants will be measured in 1 item: \"How typical of the group of young people do you consider yourself to? \"(1 = not at all representative, 7 = very representative), adapted in French from studies by Hogg, Cooper-Shaw, and Holzworth (1993). \n2.

They will be given a brief presentation of the study, and will be asked to complete a pre-manipulation questionnaire online in order to participate in the study.\n\nPre-manipulation questionnaire.

For the presence of vicarious dissonance condition: \nParticipants will be greeted by an experimenter who will tell them that this is a paired study. The experimenter will then stage a telephone conversation with another experimenter during which he or she will learn that the other participant has arrived.\n\nOnce the participants are seated in the experiment room, the experimenter will tell them that this is a computer study. The experimenter will explain that he was studying linguistic subcultures, to explore whether the mere fact of living together might cause unique speech patterns to develop (Norton et al., 2003). We stressed these potential differences between groups to make group concerns salient (Turner et al., 1987). The experimenter will specify that in his research, he is particularly interested in the language differences between the youth group (18-25 years old) and the senior group (65-75 years old), and that the paired participant who performs the experiment at the same time as him is also part of the youth group. It will be indicated that this person is of the same sex as him/her: if it is a girl student, we will say that the pair is a girl, if it is a boy, we will say that the pair is a young man (control of group membership). The experimenter will then explain to the participants that in order to study these linguistic subcultures, one of the participants will have to write an argumentative text in favor of increasing tuition fees, while the other will judge this argumentative text on a set of linguistic criteria. To manipulate the negative consequences, the experimenter will explain that the Dean needed students to make speeches in favor of a tuition increase so that the Dean could use the arguments generated to justify any increase. To manipulate the choice of target and the target's opinion of the increasing tuition fees, participants will read a scripted exchange of e-mail messages (via Quaknet software) between the experimenter and the author of the advocacy text. The author of the argumentative text will express his total disagreement with the position to be defended and has asked the experimenter if he is obliged to write it. The experimenter will reply that, of course, he is not obliged to do so, but that he would really appreciate it if they wrote it. The author of the text will answer that he has no more questions and that he was ready to begin. Our cover will be corroborated by the presence of a sheet of paper and a pen on the table in each experimental room. Once instructions have been given, the experimenter will leave the experiment room and the participant will complete the tasks on the computer.\nAfter reading a brief article on linguistic subcultures, all participants will be led to believe that the computer randomly assigns the position of judge or writer of the argumentative text. While waiting for their pair to write the argumentative text, the participants will complete the post-manipulation questionnaire. \n\nPost-manipulation questionnaire: \n- Attitudes towards increasing tuition fees (Dependent Variable, Time 2)\n- Demographic information (sex, date of birth, parents' socio-professional category, initials)\n- Manipulation check (perception of observed choice and the negative consequences follow from one\u2019s actions, affiliation with the writer's group)\n\n2.
