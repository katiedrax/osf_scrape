Studies that individuals about particular facets of their life (e.g. in education, as a mother) are not in-scope.\n\u2022\tStudies must include data collection methods that interact directly with the in-scope population, such as interviews, focus groups or surveys. Studies that also consult with other populations (e.g. parents, bureaucrats), on top of the target population, are also considered in-scope.\n\u2022\tA framework, including a list of dimensions and/or indicators must be clearly specified.\n\u2022\tData collection methods must include at least one open-ended question regarding what wellbeing means to the participants. This thus excludes studies that purely ask participants to rank wellbeing areas according to a pre-defined list.\n\u2022\tStudies that seek to validate a pre-defined list through social research are in-scope, but only if the final wellbeing framework differs to that of the original list.\n\nStudies will not be assessed with any quality markers, and both published and grey literature is in-scope. Only studies that have been published since 1st January 2000 are in scope.\n\nThe review will search seven databases to retrieve relevant studies that develop a participatory wellbeing framework. Google (first 100 results) will also be searched to find any additional studies in either the published or grey literature. All reference lists will be scanned to identify any additional studies. Finally, key researchers in the field will be contacted to ascertain whether any studies are missing, and other studies known to the authors will also be included.\n\nThe search databases that will be used are ASSIA, PubMed, PsycInfo, Social Sciences Citation Index, IBSS and Sociological Abstracts. These databases were chosen for their relevance to the research subject, and to cover the various disciplines that are in-scope (i.e. social sciences, psychology and health).\n\nThe following search terms will be used:\nWellbeing: \u201cquality of life\u201d OR \u201cwell-being\u201d OR wellbeing OR \n                     HRQOL OR capability OR capabilities OR \"good life\"\nFramework: framework AND (dimension OR indicator OR domain OR theme)\nParticipatory: \"participatory method\" OR \"participatory technique\" OR  \n                          \"participatory research\" OR \"participatory framework\" OR  \n                          \"participatory approach\" OR \"participatory process\" OR \n                          \"participatory wellbeing\" OR \"participatory well-being\" OR  \n                          \"participatory assessment\" OR \u201cparticipatory mechanism OR  \n                          \"participatory study\" OR \u201cparticipatory studies\u201d OR\n                          \"participatory exercise\" OR \"participatory activity\" OR \u201cparticipatory \n                           activities\u201d OR \"participatory evaluation\" OR \"self-perceive\" OR \n                           \"self perceive\" OR \"self-rate\" OR \"self rate\" OR \u201cself assess\u201d OR \n                           \u201cself-assess\u201d OR \u201cself generate\u201d OR self-generate\u201d OR person \n                           generate\u201d OR person-generate\u201d\n\nTwo authors will screen the title/abstract to determine possible eligible studies, and two authors will then screen the full-text. Any conflicts will be resolved by a third author.\n\nThe data will be extracted by two authors as a quality assurance process, with the collected data being: basic publication information (title, author, journal etc.), country, population group, method, the level of participation in study, sample size, theoretical basis for study, list of wellbeing dimensions, and list of wellbeing indicators (if applicable).\n\nThe screening and data extraction processes will be conducted through the Covidence Systematic Review platform.", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Data will be collected by reviewing the included studies.
