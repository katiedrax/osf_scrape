However, up to date there is a striking lack of research on whether the VWM task itself induces emotional experiences, and whether they impact VWM performance. In our registered report we argue that the VWM task can be considered an achievement situation, therefore leading to participants naturally experiencing achievement emotions (AE) including joy, pride, anger, and shame. Specifically, we hypothesize (1) that these AE correlate with individual differences in VWM performance, that this link is (2) mediated by subjective task performance (STP; i.e. how well or poorly participants think they are doing) and (3) moderated by performance goal orientation (PGO). Further, we believe (4) that AE, PGO, and task difficulty interact in predicting VWM. N = 225 participants will be recruited to perform the continuous colour wheel task. The task shall be comprised of 240 trials, which include arrays of either four (easy) or eight (difficult) coloured squares. Participants\u2019 AE and STP will be obtained by self-report after the VWM task. We expect that our findings will highlight the relevance of AE as a potentially confounding variable for interpreting an individual\u2019s VWM ability.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-21T07:26:32.413152", "date_modified": "2020-04-21T07:45:31.520834", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "7b9ae8d6142ff7e9d93d82be0d9177ce1a4cc6d4caa244ce1cf89766823db6f2c032a38fbeed8060479b38341e548510c2a546d6da22b484247b5fa3ab905c5f5f572ba2bda92d714a23d1da9e64cec33c49e14dd6ed242611a90d43d586a9e11c1e9a1015611a661c88b96c106500080cd409619ff015e67160c8f2a07ccaabbbbeb599e11bf6e3859ee61034a40fa6", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-21T07:26:32.395241", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Preregistration Template from AsPredicted.org", "registered_meta": {"data": {"extra": [], "value": "No, no data have been collected for this study yet."}, "name": {"extra": [], "value": "Task-induced Achievement Emotions and their Role in Visual Working Memory Performance: A Registered Report "}, "other": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "sample": {"extra": [], "value": "G*Power suggests a total sample size of n = 204.

Fear and anxiety are especially prevalent emotions during an epidemic like this, and can have long-lasting negative consequences on psychological health. It is critical to identify strategies to help people better cope with the current epidemic. The aim is to provide insights and strategies to combat fear and anxiety, and to improve people\u2019s psychological well-being, both during current epidemic and in similar future situations. Research has shown that psychological distance--temporally distancing the self from stressful events--promotes adaptive coping, mitigate emotional distress and reactivity, and improves adaptive emotional control. By eliciting a distant future perspective, the current research aims to reduce negative affect (e.g., anxiety/fear), and facilitate coping with current COVID-19 epidemic, through the mechanism of impermanent focus (i.e. focusing on transitory aspects of the stressor). Eventually, we plan to mitigate negative psychological consequences through online interventions because a timely online intervention is most desirable when opportunities to deliver in-person interventions are limited by widespread quarantine measures. Moreover, it guarantees easy access to the masses and allow interventions to be disseminated at a low cost.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-21T07:17:10.298712", "date_modified": "2020-04-20T07:51:39.356050", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Copyright 2020"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "43934abb6fb4719e8587adbda80f16c3ac5abbb406bc607e7889e6edff07f95a96403d58a0524c5bf339a75bc5f81d81450ae445571526b109ddb5071baa04b271b324bc096b7f3e68db73da3da8237a615f09b9ce0ab38f5aacbd4a2fd72d1f50eb3ed11eb1b4c6592b012f4066332389cbf72279865bae7a0212a478a09468fbf387cb16748fc7864601dfbb2ebb51", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-21T07:17:10.263916", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Suhui Yap, Li-Jun Ji"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "We hypothesize that temporally distancing the self from stressful events will reduce negative affect (e.g., anxiety/fear), and facilitate adaptive coping with current COVID-19 epidemic, through the mechanism of impermanent focus (i.e. focusing on transitory aspects of the stressor)."}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.
