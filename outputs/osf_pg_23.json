cerebrovascular accident, cardiovascular associated death)\nS: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies\n\n11. * Searches.\n\nOn April 16th, 2020, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase databases were searched from their inception using keywords \u201chidradenitis\u201d, \u201ccerebrovascular\u201d, \u201ccardiovascular\u201d, and \u201cinfarction\u201d, without restrictions.\n\n12. * Condition or domain being studied.\n\nHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is an inflammatory disease of the skin and has been associated with various cardiac risk factors. However, there is conflicting evidence as to whether HS is associated with Major Adverse Cardiac Events, such as cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular-associated death.\n\n13. * Participants/population.\n\nAdult patients with HS (&gt;18 years of age)\n\n14. * Intervention(s), exposure(s).\n\nNone\n\n15. * Comparator(s)/control.\n\nGeneral adult population (&gt;18 years)\n\n16. * Types of study to be included.\n\nCase-control, cohort, and cross-sectional studies.

The extracted results will include risk estimates, such as Odds ratio, Hazard ratio, incidence rate ratio, and their 95% confidence intervals. Authors will be contacted for data, if required.\n\n19. * Risk of bias (quality) assessment.\n\nThe risk of bias for each study will be determined using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.\n\n20. * Strategy for data synthesis.\n\nReview Manager Software, version 5.3 (Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collaboration) will be used to conduct the meta-analysis when three or more studies provide useable data for an outcome. The meta-analysis will be conducted using the Der Simonian\u2013Laird random-effects model, to account for heterogeneity between studies, and effect estimates will be combined using generic inverse variance method. Risk ratios (RR), incidence rate ratios, or hazard ratios will be pooled as they will be considered relative measures of risk for cohort studies. Risk estimates will be reported through odds ratios (OR) for case-control studies. Case-control studies and cohort studies will be analyzed separately given differences in study design. Risk estimates will be combined to estimate the risk of MACEs in both the cohort and case-control studies. The pooled analysis of less than three studies will be presented only for qualitative interpretation. Heterogeneity will be assessed using the I\u00b2 statistic, and an I\u00b2 greater than 50% will be considered substantial heterogeneity. Funnel plots will be used to assess for publication bias. P&lt;0.05 will be considered significant.\n\n21. * Analysis of subgroups or subsets.\n\nSubgroup analysis will be performed for MI, CVA, and cardiovascular-associated death.\n\n22.

The first model will focus on the implicit attitudes data we collect about whether people would post inappropriate posts or photos (Potential Posts).  We will use R studio for generating the model. After reading in a .csv file with our data and re-coding it accordingly, we will run an ANOVA with the following formula: \n\naov(potential_posts_inapp ~ conditions_combined + potential_posts_inapp_diff)\n\nThis ANOVA will compute whether how likely people are to post inappropriate items differs significantly based on the condition and their baseline attitudes toward posting inappropriate media before the intervention. If the difference between the pre and post test term (potential_posts_inapp_diff) is significant in the model, it would indicate that attitudes significantly shifted after the intervention in at least one of the three conditions. Additionally, if the conditions_combined term (conditions_combined) is statistically significant, this will indicate that people\u2019s likelihood of posting the items depends on the intervention being tested. We can then perform pairwise comparisons between these three measures of interest (using the TukeyHSD function) to reveal which condition(s) showed differences in people\u2019s likelihood of posting inappropriate items, and whether these effects differed significantly from those people\u2019s baseline opinions. \n\nIf we then find that the experimental conditions both differed significantly from the control condition, it would support Hypothesis 1a. Further, if we find that the outcome of the Intervention with Writing condition (Experimental Condition 2) differed significantly from the outcome of the non-writing intervention (Experimental Condition 1), it would support Hypothesis 1b. Including the pre-test attitude measure for each condition as a covariate in the model allows us to see whether the resulting attitudes in each condition were changed as a result of the intervention given. We will use an identical model to test for differences in the explicit attitudes toward posting inappropriate types of content online, replacing the outcome variable with a term for the Appropriateness Ratings of inappropriate situations.\n\nTo test Hypothesis 2, we will follow the same procedure for creating a two-way ANOVA model as described above, but we will test differences in the responses to the appropriate photos and posts instead of the inappropriate ones. We will use the term potential_posts_app to signify the attitudes toward posting appropriate items during the post-test in each condition. We will also use the term potential_posts_app_diff to represent the changes in attitudes from before the intervention. The same reasoning in the first model will apply here. \n\nIf the outcome term is insignificant in this model, it would indicate support for Hypothesis 2, because it would mean that attitudes toward posting appropriate items would not differ among the conditions. If the term is significant, it indicates that either our intervention affected attitudes toward posting appropriate media, or that baseline attitudes toward posting it were already significantly different among the conditions. We can solve this question by looking at the difference in attitudes term: if it is significant, the attitudes of the groups already differed before our intervention, meaning our intervention still did not affect these attitudes, supporting Hypothesis 2. If this term were insignificant, it would imply that our intervention impacted these attitudes, a topic for discussion in our paper since this is not necessarily desirable. We will use an identical model to test for differences in the explicit attitudes toward posting appropriate types of content online, replacing the outcome variable with a term for the Appropriateness Ratings of appropriate situations.\n\nFinally, we can use a similar model to test Hypothesis 3. We can include a term for the Permission Asking variable (permission_asking) as our outcome variable, and include the conditions_combined term along with a permission asking_diff term as we did for the differences in pre and post test outcomes for the other attitude measures. The same reasoning used in the first model applies: if the conditions_combined term is significant, then the permission asking attitudes differ significantly depending on whether people got the intervention or not. If the difference term is significant, it means that the attitudes changed as a result of the intervention in at least one of the conditions. We can then use the Tukey pairwise comparisons method to investigate exactly which conditions cause this effect.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "We will recode the yes/no answers to whether people would post the photos and posts as 1=yes and 0=no.

The 7-item test was introduced by Pennycook and Rand (2018) with an acceptable reliability proved, Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.77. Participants\u2019 score on CRT is the number of correct responses. Higher scores indicate better cognitive ability and/or more analytic cognitive style (compared to intuitive cognitive style). \nActively open-minded thinking (AOT) is measured by a short form of actively open-minded thinking scale which is reported to be most relevant to general population (Haran, Ritov, &amp; Mellers, 2013). This scale includes seven items, participants rate to which degree they agree with the statements, ranges from 1 (= Completely Disagree) to 7 (= Completely Agree). Scores on AOT scale is the sum of the ratings after recoding the reversed items.\nParticipants will be instructed to rate the accuracy of the news headlines through a four-point scale (1 = Not at all accurate, 2 = Not very accurate, 3 = Somewhat accurate, 4 = Very accurate).  \nSharing intention is included as an exploring question.
