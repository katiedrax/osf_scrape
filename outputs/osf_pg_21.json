well-being in care-experienced young people compared to their peers", "description": "There is extensive evidence that care-experienced young people have poorer mental health than their peers, attributed at least partly to early, often prolonged, exposure to maltreatment. However, there has been little exploration of the mechanisms that may link these experiences to their mental health outcomes, limiting knowledge of potential intervention targets. In this study we focus on the potential role of affective control, a core cognitive building block associated with emotion regulation and mental health outcomes. We will explore three key questions: (i) whether care-experienced young people have poorer affective control than sex and age-matched peers; (ii) whether the affective control of care-experienced young people is associated with broad internalising and externalising problems, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and school well-being; (iii) whether associations between affective control and these emotional and school well-being outcomes are partially explained by emotion regulation capacity. We aim to recruit 71 care-experienced young people aged 11-18, which will be compared to data already collected from young people at secondary school. Participants will complete a battery of computer-based tasks and questionnaires. This is comprised of three experimental tasks measuring affective control ability, a brief standardised IQ test and validated questionnaires measuring internalising and externalising problems, post-traumatic stress symptoms, school well-being and emotion regulation.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-17T11:50:25.660457", "date_modified": "2020-04-17T11:50:04.774637", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["care-experienced", "mental health", "PTSD", "transdiagnostic"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["University of Bath", "Rosie McGuire", "Sarah Halligan", "Susanne Schweizer", "Rachel Hiller"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "38ca1156741c96cdcb5b02d79f9e6f4007f8cf74772d585d7563ba53f370e45d86767eaaf9700e734e21c26302ebec33a5c1a2ac0066ffdf1687f75e7354e0cd2a3d684463fd7d059d202020d86d4d8c3df778b1328b89617286b4189d63c06882fb242f46584e6ef657b5626fb4631980c67a313df57c0b41448c0806ddb11ce86ae3fd5b5d1631cb55aa2000d30e40", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-17T11:50:25.636451", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Open-Ended Registration", "registered_meta": {"summary": {"extra": [], "value": "In this study, we will investigate the affective control ability of care-experienced young people.

A final, unknown factor is the relationship that the current increase in pathogenic anxiety and disgust will interact with these dimensions and compliance to recommendations.  Inbar et al. (2012) found that those more likely to vote to the political right also demonstrate higher disgust sensitivity, as such are more aware of potential microbial infection, coupled with Faulkner at al.\u2019s (2004) link between disease avoidance and contemporary xenophobia, it would seem that this population is more likely that others to be avoidant of potential sources of infection, thus more likely to comply with public health recommendations.

replication and extension", "description": "Baldwin and Lammers (2016) recently published a program of research demonstrating that conservatives are more susceptible to pro-environmental messages that are past-focused compared to the same messages when framed as future-focused. In their third study, they showed participants a series of images comparing pristine and degraded environments to induce past and future temporal focus in the participants. These were labelled to depict changes from the current state of the environment to how it used to be (demonstrating pristine environments of the past, i.e., past-focused manipulation), or how it will be in the future (demonstrating degraded natural environments of the future, i.e., future-focused manipulation). Their research showed that past-focused comparisons attenuated the negative effect of political conservatism (measured with a single item liberal to conservative scale) on environmental attitudes (measured with the New Ecological Paradigm). That is, political conservatism was a weaker predictor of environmental attitudes among those who first viewed past-focused comparisons. \n\nIn an effort to replicate and extend on their research, we conducted a study in 2019 among participants based in the United States recruited via crowdsourcing site Prolific. We presented participants with the same image-pairs as seen in Study 3 of Baldwin and Lammers (2016). However, we aimed to extend their work to test whether the temporal framing effect extended to increases in other forms of environmentalism, such as increased willingness to engage in pro-environmental action (measured using Liu and Sibley\u2019s (2012) willingness to sacrifice scale), support for climate change policy (measured using Bateman &amp; O\u2019Connor\u2019s (2016) policy support scale), and/or belief in climate change. We also employed a multidimensional measure of political ideology, measuring this construct with social dominance orientation (using Ho et al.\u2019s (2015) SDO7 scale), and testing the utility of the two dimensions of SDO (Dominance and Anti-egalitarianism) in place of the single item political orientation measure. \n\nOur preliminary analyses found differences in responses by condition across the political spectrum only for perceived certainty that climate change is happening. Specifically, while those with a more liberal political orientation were equally certain that climate change is happening, regardless of framing condition, those who were more conservative reported greater certainty after viewing the past comparisons. However, this interaction did not replicate for the other three environmental-outcome measures we included, despite more than doubling Baldwin and Lammers\u2019 (2016) sample size (from 200 participants to just over 500 participants). We had planned to test several potential explanations for the temporal framing effect, such as differences in perceived certainty that the environmental changes have or will occur. However, in the absence of a significant interaction between political orientation and framing condition, comprehensive tests of these explanations were not possible. As an initial exploratory test of these explanations, we regressed political orientation, framing condition, and the interaction term on two explanatory variables (certainty ratings and temporal distance). We found that political orientation and temporal framing condition interacted only to predict certainty ratings, with individuals identifying as moderately to very conservative significantly more certain that the environmental changes depicted have occurred (i.e., if they were in the past-focused condition), than they will occur (future-focused condition).\n\nThis study will follow up on possible reasons for the failure to replicate Baldwin and Lammers (2016) finding of a temporal framing interaction with political orientation. From our exploratory analyses, we propose that there may be four potential reasons as to why the effect did not replicate in our study, which we outline below: \n\n1.\tIn our first study, we asked participants to rate the likely causes of environmental changes in the photo pairs, while Baldwin and Lammers asked the extent that each image demonstrated the effects of climate change. Using a similar temporal framing approach, Lammers and Baldwin (2018) eliminated the temporal framing effect when asking people to carefully evaluate their framed message, suggesting that this engages a different kind of processing style (central, rather than peripheral) that inoculates participants from the effects of the frame. It is possible that asking participants to rate causes engages a similar level of scepticism and/or inoculation, hence erasing the effect. To test this possible explanation, in addition to the temporal focus manipulation (past- versus future-comparisons), this study will also include a cover story manipulation, where participants are randomly assigned to either rate the causes of the depicted environmental changes (as in our study) or the extent they depict the effects of climate change (as in Baldwin &amp; Lammers). \n\n2.\tAnother explanation for our non-replication is that we employed different outcome measures. Baldwin and Lammers (2016) used the new environmental paradigm scale, which is the most widely used measure of pro-environmentalism. Based on criticisms of the scale (e.g. whether it measures attitudes, beliefs, values, or a worldview), our first study instead included a host of different environmental variables that were specifically related to climate change. We note that some framing effects do not extend to other forms of environmentalism (e.g. Levine &amp; Kline, 2017), and therefore we include the same new environmental paradigm scale from Baldwin and Lammers in this study to test whether the effect replicates on the same outcome measure. This is in addition to the other outcome variables included in our first study (climate change belief, certainty that climate change is happening, willingness to make sacrifices for the environment, climate change policy support, and agreement to sign a petition). To control for possible order effects, we will randomise the presentation of these outcome variables. \n\n3.\tAnother aim of our first study was to replicate the temporal framing effect with a multidimensional measure of political ideology. Specifically, some work suggests that the anti-egalitarian dimension/factor of social dominance orientation (SDO-E) is particularly relevant in predicting environment-relevant attitudes (Stanley et al., 2017) when compared to the dominance dimension/factor (SDO-D). In our exploratory analyses, we put SDO-E in place of political orientation, and when doing so we did replicate the interaction with condition on both climate change certainty and policy support. In this study, we expand the focus on the influence of more foundational attitudes towards how the world ought to be structured (SDO) and controlled (right-wing authoritarianism; RWA). To build on the exploratory findings that replicated the effect across SDO-E, this study will include a measure of right-wing authoritarianism, which is another ideological component underlying both political attitudes and predicting lower levels of pro-environmental attitudes and climate change belief (e.g. H\u00e4kkinen &amp; Akrami, 2014; Schultz &amp; Stone, 1994).\n\n4.\tFinally, although we took care to sample from the same target population as Baldwin and Lammers (i.e., those based in the United States), the political context has changed since the original study was conducted. When Baldwin and Lammers asked participants to think to the past, they did so at a time when the Democratic Party was in charge. Our data were collected under the Trump administration, who campaigned on a return to the past (e.g. \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d), and so it is possible that past comparisons are no longer effective for conservatives under this context as they have already returned to their \u2018desired\u2019 past.
