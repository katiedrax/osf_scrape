Political science research suggests that IGOs reduce the occurrence of militarized conflict between states (Russett, Oneal, and Davis, 1998; Boehmer, Gartzke, and Nordstrom, 2004).

It tests whether different mechanisms behind IGOs\u2019 potential influence on conflict resolution resonate to a different degree with members of the mass public. Members of the public are an important target audience for pacifying signals from IGOs.

rates (Choi et al. 2003, Madrian and Shea 2001). The world\u2019s poor, saddled with additional stressors that alter decision-making (Mani et al. 2013), also tend to save less than they say they would prefer (Banerjee and Duflo 2007, Collins et al. 2010). This disconnect between desired and observed savings rates may be driven in part by present bias (Strotz 1956; Bartels, Urminsky, and Frederick 2011). An extensive experimental and quasi-experimental literature documents attempts to create savings products which account for present bias, often by providing commitment devices (Thaler and Benartzi 2004; Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin 2006; Gin\u00e9, Karlan, and Zinman 2010; Bryan, Karlan, and Nelson 2010). These commitment-based savings products, however, have largely failed to find broad market appeal; penalties for early withdrawal may deter potential participants who fear unforeseen circumstances. But present bias may play an important role in another part of the savings equation: the perception of interest. In theory, interest compensates savers at or above the rate at which they discount the future. However, present bias may distort this calculation and prevent people from making the initial decision to save. Meanwhile, other areas of behavioral economics that have received less attention in the savings literature may offer a particularly useful set of insights for savings product design: loss aversion and salience (Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler 1990; Finkelstein 2009; Stango and Zinman 2014; Goldin and Homonoff 2013). Individuals appear to value items that they already possess at above market value, and they also weigh losses significantly more than gains of the same magnitude and are willing to pay disproportionate costs \u2013 and accept greater risk \u2013 to avert losses than to achieve similar gains. Mobile network operators (MNOs) have hitherto been prohibited from offering interest in many jurisdictions. Since mobile money is the only interaction many people have with the formal financial system, this has made it difficult to examine the role of interest in how the very poor make savings decisions in the developing world. By distributing profits in a way comparable to paying interest, our MNO partner has found a way to circumvent this restriction. We hope this study will be one of the first of many to investigate how innovative ways to pay interest can help encourage savings through digital financial services (DFS). We propose a savings device that leverages present bias and loss aversion by framing accumulated future interest as a salient, lumpy bonus, to be deposited up-front in the saver\u2019s account and to be lost in the event of early withdrawal. The saver can keep the upfront interest only by saving a specified amount over the pre-determined period of time. Because the retention of the upfront interest is contingent on saving, the account functions very similarly to a normal savings account from the practical perspective of the financial institution \u2013 in this case the mobile network operator (MNO) offering digital financial services (DFS). However, we anticipate that framing the interest as an upfront interest will activate savers\u2019 loss aversion and motivate increased saving relative to a traditionally-structured savings account."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Our study aims to address the core question of whether a loss-aversion-based savings account can motivate increased savings among recipients of quarterly cash transfers. The main hypotheses we are testing are: H1: the offer of an upfront interest savings account will increase savings relative to a traditional interest savings account and a messaging and training placebo. H1a: The offer of an upfront interest savings account will be more effective in motivating savings among those with a minimal-level of mobile money acumen. H1b: The offer of an upfront interest savings account will be more effective in motivating savings among participants who are the primary or sole-users of their mobile money accounts. H2: the offer of an upfront interest savings account will increase other usage of digital financial services (e.g., receiving and sending of remittances). H2a: The offer of an upfront interest savings account will be more effective in inducing additional DFS use among those with a minimal-level of mobile money acumen. H2b: The offer of an upfront interest savings account will be more effective in inducing additional DFS use among participants who are the primary or sole-users of their mobile money accounts."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "To test these hypotheses we are undertaking a large-scale randomized control trial on 2,300 young rural Tanzanian women. Study participants are all existing enrollees in Sauti, a quarterly cash-transfer program being implemented in Tanzania by Jhpiego and its partners. The aim of the quarterly cash-transfers of 70,000 TZS (~$32.00 USD) is to buffer the population from risky behavior and reduce HIV/AIDs and other sexually transmissible infections. (All participants in our study are 18 years of age and older.) To facilitate the cash transfers, each participant has received a basic mobile phone handset and a SIM card from one of Tanzania\u2019s major mobile network operations. Among those participants who are interested in being eligible for a special mobile money savings program, we will randomly assign them to one of three groups: 1.) Upfront interest savings account treatment (N=~770): a front-loaded benefit of 7,000 Tanzanian Shillings (~$3.15 USD) if subjects commit to saving 10 percent of each quarterly cash transfer they receive over the course of 5 months. In other words, if participants agree to save 10% of each 70,000 TZS (~$32.00 USD) quarterly cash transfer they receive within a 5-month window (two transfers received; a total of 14,000 TZS or ~$6.30 USD savings), we will provide them with 7,000 TZS (~$3.15 USD) upfront (50% interest rate). 2.) Traditional interest savings account treatment (N=~770): a more traditionally structured savings account in which participants will receive the lump sum interest at the end of the 5-month period if they save 10 percent of each of three quarterly cash transfers they receive from Jhpiego within that 5-month period. That is, if they commit to saving the 14,000 TZS or ~$6.30 USD, we will pay them the 50% interest (7,000 TZS or ~$3.15) at the end of the savings period. 3.) Training and messaging placebo (N=~770): These participants are not eligible for any interest but will receive training and messaging that parallels the treatments, including an in-person meeting right before the cash transfer on the benefits of savings, and regular messages including right before they receive a quarterly cash transfer to remind them of importance of savings. To evaluate our main hypotheses and compare savings and DFS use across these three groups, the main outcome measures will be drawn from administrative data on mobile phone use provided by our MNO partner (one of Tanzania's main mobile phone companies). At the time of registration, we worked with our implementing partner Jhpiego to gain consent from all program participants to use their mobile phone data for research purposes. The main mobile phone outcomes we will use in our study includes: **savings levels at the end of the 5-month savings program period **default rates (how many fail to save or who use their upfront interest) **effects on frequency of other digital financial services activities **how much they save in the 5th and 6th cash transfer installments (1 and 4 months after the savings program concludes) **how much they save 6 months out from end of enrollment period We will measure these outcomes using data provided by our MNO partner via a weekly data transfer containing anonymized data on each participant\u2019s mobile money balance at closing, weekly min, weekly max, weekly average, and weekly aggregate of mobile money transactions and amounts (sent and received and deposits and withdrawals). In addition, the data transfer will provide information on the interest payment amounts to each MSISDN per quarter.

The world\u2019s poor, saddled with additional stressors that alter decision-making (Mani et al. 2013), also tend to save less than they say they would prefer (Banerjee and Duflo 2007, Collins et al. 2010). This disconnect between desired and observed savings rates may be driven in part by present bias (Strotz 1956; Bartels, Urminsky, and Frederick 2011). An extensive experimental and quasi-experimental literature documents attempts to create savings products which account for present bias, often by providing commitment devices (Thaler and Benartzi 2004; Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin 2006; Gin\u00e9, Karlan, and Zinman 2010; Bryan, Karlan, and Nelson 2010). These commitment-based savings products, however, have largely failed to find broad market appeal; penalties for early withdrawal may deter potential participants who fear unforeseen circumstances. But present bias may play an important role in another part of the savings equation: the perception of interest. In theory, interest compensates savers at or above the rate at which they discount the future. However, present bias may distort this calculation and prevent people from making the initial decision to save. Meanwhile, other areas of behavioral economics that have received less attention in the savings literature may offer a particularly useful set of insights for savings product design: loss aversion and salience (Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler 1990; Finkelstein 2009; Stango and Zinman 2014; Goldin and Homonoff 2013). Individuals appear to value items that they already possess at above market value, and they also weigh losses significantly more than gains of the same magnitude and are willing to pay disproportionate costs \u2013 and accept greater risk \u2013 to avert losses than to achieve similar gains. Mobile network operators (MNOs) have hitherto been prohibited from offering interest in many jurisdictions. Since mobile money is the only interaction many people have with the formal financial system, this has made it difficult to examine the role of interest in how the very poor make savings decisions in the developing world. By distributing profits in a way comparable to paying interest, our MNO partner has found a way to circumvent this restriction. We hope this study will be one of the first of many to investigate how innovative ways to pay interest can help encourage savings through digital financial services (DFS). We propose a savings device that leverages present bias and loss aversion by framing accumulated future interest as a salient, lumpy bonus, to be deposited up-front in the saver\u2019s account and to be lost in the event of early withdrawal. The saver can keep the upfront interest only by saving a specified amount over the pre-determined period of time. Because the retention of the upfront interest is contingent on saving, the account functions very similarly to a normal savings account from the practical perspective of the financial institution \u2013 in this case the mobile network operator (MNO) offering digital financial services (DFS). However, we anticipate that framing the interest as an upfront interest will activate savers\u2019 loss aversion and motivate increased saving relative to a traditionally-structured savings account.", "q16": "Our study aims to address the core question of whether a loss-aversion-based savings account can motivate increased savings among recipients of quarterly cash transfers. The main hypotheses we are testing are: H1: the offer of an upfront interest savings account will increase savings relative to a traditional interest savings account and a messaging and training placebo. H1a: The offer of an upfront interest savings account will be more effective in motivating savings among those with a minimal-level of mobile money acumen. H1b: The offer of an upfront interest savings account will be more effective in motivating savings among participants who are the primary or sole-users of their mobile money accounts. H2: the offer of an upfront interest savings account will increase other usage of digital financial services (e.g., receiving and sending of remittances). H2a: The offer of an upfront interest savings account will be more effective in inducing additional DFS use among those with a minimal-level of mobile money acumen. H2b: The offer of an upfront interest savings account will be more effective in inducing additional DFS use among participants who are the primary or sole-users of their mobile money accounts.", "q17": "To test these hypotheses we are undertaking a large-scale randomized control trial on 2,300 young rural Tanzanian women. Study participants are all existing enrollees in Sauti, a quarterly cash-transfer program being implemented in Tanzania by Jhpiego and its partners. The aim of the quarterly cash-transfers of 70,000 TZS (~$32.00 USD) is to buffer the population from risky behavior and reduce HIV/AIDs and other sexually transmissible infections. (All participants in our study are 18 years of age and older.) To facilitate the cash transfers, each participant has received a basic mobile phone handset and a SIM card from one of Tanzania\u2019s major mobile network operations. Among those participants who are interested in being eligible for a special mobile money savings program, we will randomly assign them to one of three groups: 1.) Upfront interest savings account treatment (N=~770): a front-loaded benefit of 7,000 Tanzanian Shillings (~$3.15 USD) if subjects commit to saving 10 percent of each quarterly cash transfer they receive over the course of 5 months. In other words, if participants agree to save 10% of each 70,000 TZS (~$32.00 USD) quarterly cash transfer they receive within a 5-month window (two transfers received; a total of 14,000 TZS or ~$6.30 USD savings), we will provide them with 7,000 TZS (~$3.15 USD) upfront (50% interest rate). 2.) Traditional interest savings account treatment (N=~770): a more traditionally structured savings account in which participants will receive the lump sum interest at the end of the 5-month period if they save 10 percent of each of three quarterly cash transfers they receive from Jhpiego within that 5-month period. That is, if they commit to saving the 14,000 TZS or ~$6.30 USD, we will pay them the 50% interest (7,000 TZS or ~$3.15) at the end of the savings period. 3.) Training and messaging placebo (N=~770): These participants are not eligible for any interest but will receive training and messaging that parallels the treatments, including an in-person meeting right before the cash transfer on the benefits of savings, and regular messages including right before they receive a quarterly cash transfer to remind them of importance of savings. To evaluate our main hypotheses and compare savings and DFS use across these three groups, the main outcome measures will be drawn from administrative data on mobile phone use provided by our MNO partner (one of Tanzania's main mobile phone companies). At the time of registration, we worked with our implementing partner Jhpiego to gain consent from all program participants to use their mobile phone data for research purposes. The main mobile phone outcomes we will use in our study includes: **savings levels at the end of the 5-month savings program period **default rates (how many fail to save or who use their upfront interest) **effects on frequency of other digital financial services activities **how much they save in the 5th and 6th cash transfer installments (1 and 4 months after the savings program concludes) **how much they save 6 months out from end of enrollment period We will measure these outcomes using data provided by our MNO partner via a weekly data transfer containing anonymized data on each participant\u2019s mobile money balance at closing, weekly min, weekly max, weekly average, and weekly aggregate of mobile money transactions and amounts (sent and received and deposits and withdrawals). In addition, the data transfer will provide information on the interest payment amounts to each MSISDN per quarter. Because we are able to obtain both static measurements of account activity, as well as account activity across time, we will also be able to measure account fluctuations at frequent intervals across the study time-period. Finally, we will be able to measure account data at the moments of the Jhpiego unconditional mobile money transfer one- and four-months following the end of the program.
