extremity. To diagnose the severity of such injuries or corresponding concomitant injuries, the investigators have both clinical test procedures and imaging measures at their disposal. Due to the fact that imaging procedures are associated with increased costs, and that X-ray examinations, for example, involve exposure to X-rays, diagnostic guidelines have been established. One element of these guidelines is the so-called \"Ottawa Ankle Rules\" (OAR), which are intended to limit the performance of X-ray diagnostics. \nThe OAR provide guidelines in the diagnosis of painful ankle joints. They are part of the AWMF guidelines for the examination of acute injuries to the outer ligament of the upper ankle. However, reviews such as those by Bachmann et al. show that the use of the OAR is not routinely applied in Germany. Current studies show that the consistent use of OAR could reduce the number of X-ray examinations by 30-40%. \nFrom the problem definition the question arises why the OAR are hardly implemented in Germany. Therefore, the question will be investigated as to whether doctors are aware of the contents of the OAR or whether they consider them to be clinically relevant. On the other hand, it will be investigated how relevant doctors and physiotherapists regard imaging diagnostics in the examination of patients with lateral ankle pain.  In addition, it will be analysed whether there are differences in the observance of the OAR between physicians and physiotherapists in terms of diagnostics.\nThe work starts at the point where it seems that patients with supination traumas are too often subjected to X-ray examinations. Due to the health risks that can arise from too frequent exposure to X-rays, a reduction of radiation exposure in these patients is possible by implementing the OAR in clinical diagnostics. \nOn the other hand, the analysis is used by physicians and therapists to investigate possible differences in the planning and approach of clinical diagnostics. \nThe OAR were established in 1992 and are described in the current guidelines of the German Society for Trauma Surgery (DGU) from the year 2017. There is evidence that ankle fractures can be almost 100% excluded by using the OAR. Nevertheless, current studies show that diagnostics by means of X-ray diagnostics is used in almost all patients with suspected fractures in the area of the upper ankle joint. There are also tendencies that imaging diagnostics are used, but other concomitant injuries, such as syndesmosis injuries, are overlooked.  The question that cannot be answered in these studies is why the OAR are rarely used and whether they are regularly used by the clinical examination of physiotherapists in Germany. \nThe aim of the thesis is to investigate the assessment of the clinical relevance of the contents of the OAR by physicians and therapists.\n\n\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: The contents of the \"Ottawa Ankle Rules\" are recognized as clinically relevant by physicians working as outpatients in Germany.\nH2: The contents of the \"Ottawa Ankle Rules\" are recognised as clinically relevant by physiotherapists working as outpatients in Germany.\nH3: There are no differences in knowledge of the Ottawa Ankle Rules between medical and therapeutic examination.\nH4: There are differences regarding the recognition of the clinical relevance of the Ottawa Ankle Rules in the regions of Southern, Northern, Western and Eastern Germany. \nH5: The professional experience of outpatient physicians in Germany has an influence on the recognition of the clinical relevance of the Ottawa Ankle Rules.\nH6: The professional experience of physiotherapists working as outpatients in Germany has an influence on the assessment of the clinical relevance of the Ottawa Ankle Rules.\nH7: Physicians working in outpatient clinics in Germany assess the testing of syndesmosis tibiofibularis as clinically relevant in the clinical examination of acute injuries of the upper ankle joint.\nH8: Physiotherapists working in outpatient clinics in Germany consider the testing of syndesmosis tibiofibularis clinically relevant in the clinical examination of acute injuries of the upper ankle joint.\nH9: Outpatient physicians in Germany consider testing of the anterior drawer to be clinically relevant in the clinical examination of acute injuries of the upper ankle joint.\nH10: Physiotherapists working in outpatient clinics in Germany consider testing of the front drawer to be clinically relevant in the clinical examination of acute injuries of the upper ankle joint.\nH11: Physicians working in outpatient clinics in Germany assess the evaluation of imaging procedures in the clinical examination of acute injuries of the upper ankle joint as clinically relevant.\nH12: The clinical acceptance of the \"Ottawa Ankle Rules\" has an influence on the assessment of the relevance of the evaluation of imaging procedures.\nH13: There is an influence of the professional experience of outpatient physicians in Germany on the evaluation of the clinical relevance of imaging procedures. \nH14: Outpatient physicians and physiotherapists in Germany assess the testing of pressure pain sensitivity of the proximal fibula as clinically relevant in the clinical investigation of acute injuries of the upper ankle.

According to Schnell et al. the aim of quantitative research is \"to test theories that are suitable for the formulation of generally valid statements and regularities\" (Schnell et al. 2005: 7). \nIn the present study a non-experimental design in the form of a questionnaire is used. In addition, the study has the research design of a cross-sectional study, since the data were collected at a specific point in time or in a specific period of time. \nFurthermore, inclusion criteria were defined, which should be considered when the study participants answer the questions. On the one hand, the age for the consideration of the questions was determined to be between 18 and 65 years. These criteria were shown within the explanation of the questionnaire.

This form of the questionnaire is to be counted towards a written survey. It was used because the size of the sample can be larger than with other forms of survey, such as telephone surveys or oral (face-to-face) interviews, with the same amount of resources (cf. Schnell et al. 1999: 335 ff.). Furthermore, written surveys increase the anonymity of the survey and reduce the time pressure when answering the questionnaire (cf. Kirchhoff et al. 2000).\nIn order to keep the workload for the participating practices as low as possible, a so-called \"Microsoft Office\" developer tool was used to answer the questions in the questionnaire file. This made it possible to fill out the questionnaire directly on the computer. For this purpose, a box was added to each answer option of the 9 questions, which was marked with a cross by clicking on it. The respondents were asked to do this for each question. Afterwards, the questionnaire should only be saved and sent back to the investigator-in-charge by e-mail.\nThe survey period was set to 4 weeks. In the run-up to the survey, all participants were interviewed by telephone or e-mail about their participation in the study. All questionnaires were sent to the participating practices on the same day. After two weeks, the practices were contacted by telephone or e-mail whose questionnaires had not yet been returned to the survey director. The same procedure was carried out at the beginning of the fourth week of the given period.   \nThe completed questionnaires were then coded and the results of the survey were transferred to an Excel spreadsheet. In order to guarantee the objectivity of the analysis, the coding and transfer was carried out by an independent person. Therefore the results can be considered blinded. On the other hand, this step increases data protection. \nInclusion criteria were defined for the recruitment of study participants. For the participating physiotherapies, care was taken to ensure that \"manual therapy\" or \"sports physiotherapy\" was included in the range of services offered by the corresponding facilities. Care was taken to ensure that the participating medical practices were general practitioners, sports physicians or orthopaedic specialists. \nIt was also determined that only outpatient practices would be contacted for the study. Hospitals and rehabilitation clinics were excluded because it was difficult to establish contact with these institutions and it was often not possible to contact a corresponding contact person in the institution directly.  \nThe aim of recruitment was to recruit a total of one hundred outpatient physiotherapy practices for participation in the study, and one hundred outpatient medical practices. In order to achieve a representation of the results for all of Germany, Germany was divided into 4 regions. A distinction was made between Southern Germany, Eastern Germany, Northern Germany and Western Germany. The aim of this measure was also to identify possible local differences in the application of the OAR. In southern Germany, practices from the federal states of Bavaria and Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg were contacted. The area of eastern Germany included the federal states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, Brandenburg and Berlin. Northern Germany was to be represented by the federal states of Bremen, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein. The region of West Germany included the federal states of Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland. An attempt was made to recruit twenty-five medical practices and physiotherapy practices per region or area. In addition, the aim was to have at least three medical and physiotherapy practices in each state. \nThe participants were also asked to sign a declaration of consent to participate in the study and to return this form scanned to the study director.

The mean value and the median describe \"the position of the observed values on a numerical line and are therefore defined [as] position parameters\" (Lehn &amp; Wegmann 1992: 80). The minimum value, on the other hand, like the maximum value, is called the \"dispersion parameter\" and forms the value of the range, which is to be regarded as the \"difference between minimum and maximum\" (Lehn &amp; Wegmann 1992: 23). The standard deviation is also a measure of dispersion and is to be regarded as \"a measure of the spread of the values of a characteristic around its mean value\" (Walser 2011: 11). The basis for the calculation of the standard deviation is the variance. This value characterises the distribution of values around the mean value and is \"the square of the standard deviation\" (Walser 2011: 13). The standard deviation is then calculated as root of the variance. The lower and first quartile as well as the upper and third quartile were also determined for each data series. Both are further measures of location, which are less sensitive to extreme values. The range between the upper and lower quartiles is referred to as the quartile distance. This was also determined for each of the 9 questions asked in the questionnaire. The quartile distance describes the range of the middle fifty percent of a data series. The quartile distance is also considered less sensitive to extreme values. \nIn the field of inductive statistics, different procedures were applied depending on the hypothesis. In order to make the knowledge of the OAR comparable, questions one and three to six were combined with the corresponding evaluations per question. The sum of these 5 questions could be used to assess the knowledge of the OAR. It was determined that a minimum value of 35 had to be reached in order to assume knowledge of the OAR. The minimum value of 35 was set because this corresponded to an average score of 7. A score of 7 should be considered as the minimum value of the class, which is considered to be very relevant and should be taken into account for the clinical examination. In order to compare the knowledge of the OAR among physicians and physiotherapists (hypothesis 3), a mean value comparison of the two groups was carried out. Since the evaluation of the questions should be considered as ordinal data, no \"t-test\" could be used. Since the sample survey was carried out individually in each case, it is an independent type of sample survey.

To diagnose the severity of such injuries or corresponding concomitant injuries, the investigators have both clinical test procedures and imaging measures at their disposal. Due to the fact that imaging procedures are associated with increased costs, and that X-ray examinations, for example, involve exposure to X-rays, diagnostic guidelines have been established. One element of these guidelines is the so-called \"Ottawa Ankle Rules\" (OAR), which are intended to limit the performance of X-ray diagnostics. \nThe OAR provide guidelines in the diagnosis of painful ankle joints. They are part of the AWMF guidelines for the examination of acute injuries to the outer ligament of the upper ankle. However, reviews such as those by Bachmann et al. show that the use of the OAR is not routinely applied in Germany. Current studies show that the consistent use of OAR could reduce the number of X-ray examinations by 30-40%. \nFrom the problem definition the question arises why the OAR are hardly implemented in Germany. Therefore, the question will be investigated as to whether doctors are aware of the contents of the OAR or whether they consider them to be clinically relevant. On the other hand, it will be investigated how relevant doctors and physiotherapists regard imaging diagnostics in the examination of patients with lateral ankle pain.  In addition, it will be analysed whether there are differences in the observance of the OAR between physicians and physiotherapists in terms of diagnostics.\nThe work starts at the point where it seems that patients with supination traumas are too often subjected to X-ray examinations. Due to the health risks that can arise from too frequent exposure to X-rays, a reduction of radiation exposure in these patients is possible by implementing the OAR in clinical diagnostics. \nOn the other hand, the analysis is used by physicians and therapists to investigate possible differences in the planning and approach of clinical diagnostics. \nThe OAR were established in 1992 and are described in the current guidelines of the German Society for Trauma Surgery (DGU) from the year 2017. There is evidence that ankle fractures can be almost 100% excluded by using the OAR. Nevertheless, current studies show that diagnostics by means of X-ray diagnostics is used in almost all patients with suspected fractures in the area of the upper ankle joint. There are also tendencies that imaging diagnostics are used, but other concomitant injuries, such as syndesmosis injuries, are overlooked.  The question that cannot be answered in these studies is why the OAR are rarely used and whether they are regularly used by the clinical examination of physiotherapists in Germany. \nThe aim of the thesis is to investigate the assessment of the clinical relevance of the contents of the OAR by physicians and therapists.\n\n\n", "q4": "H1: The contents of the \"Ottawa Ankle Rules\" are recognized as clinically relevant by physicians working as outpatients in Germany.\nH2: The contents of the \"Ottawa Ankle Rules\" are recognised as clinically relevant by physiotherapists working as outpatients in Germany.\nH3: There are no differences in knowledge of the Ottawa Ankle Rules between medical and therapeutic examination.\nH4: There are differences regarding the recognition of the clinical relevance of the Ottawa Ankle Rules in the regions of Southern, Northern, Western and Eastern Germany. \nH5: The professional experience of outpatient physicians in Germany has an influence on the recognition of the clinical relevance of the Ottawa Ankle Rules.\nH6: The professional experience of physiotherapists working as outpatients in Germany has an influence on the assessment of the clinical relevance of the Ottawa Ankle Rules.\nH7: Physicians working in outpatient clinics in Germany assess the testing of syndesmosis tibiofibularis as clinically relevant in the clinical examination of acute injuries of the upper ankle joint.\nH8: Physiotherapists working in outpatient clinics in Germany consider the testing of syndesmosis tibiofibularis clinically relevant in the clinical examination of acute injuries of the upper ankle joint.\nH9: Outpatient physicians in Germany consider testing of the anterior drawer to be clinically relevant in the clinical examination of acute injuries of the upper ankle joint.\nH10: Physiotherapists working in outpatient clinics in Germany consider testing of the front drawer to be clinically relevant in the clinical examination of acute injuries of the upper ankle joint.\nH11: Physicians working in outpatient clinics in Germany assess the evaluation of imaging procedures in the clinical examination of acute injuries of the upper ankle joint as clinically relevant.\nH12: The clinical acceptance of the \"Ottawa Ankle Rules\" has an influence on the assessment of the relevance of the evaluation of imaging procedures.\nH13: There is an influence of the professional experience of outpatient physicians in Germany on the evaluation of the clinical relevance of imaging procedures. \nH14: Outpatient physicians and physiotherapists in Germany assess the testing of pressure pain sensitivity of the proximal fibula as clinically relevant in the clinical investigation of acute injuries of the upper ankle.

Bortz and D\u00f6ring describe that there are different methods of qualitative social research to operationalize a research object. These include oral and written questioning. One form of the written survey is the analysis by means of a questionnaire. According to Schnell et al. the aim of quantitative research is \"to test theories that are suitable for the formulation of generally valid statements and regularities\" (Schnell et al. 2005: 7). \nIn the present study a non-experimental design in the form of a questionnaire is used. In addition, the study has the research design of a cross-sectional study, since the data were collected at a specific point in time or in a specific period of time. \nFurthermore, inclusion criteria were defined, which should be considered when the study participants answer the questions. On the one hand, the age for the consideration of the questions was determined to be between 18 and 65 years. These criteria were shown within the explanation of the questionnaire. Inclusion criteria were also defined for the respondents themselves. Thus, it was determined that the respondents must be employed at the time of the survey and must have sufficient knowledge of the German language to participate in the study. These two criteria were already checked during the recruitment of the study participants. \n", "q8.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e6223c2a0964501dc051bfe", "file_name": "Survey for clinical investigation of acute trauma to the upper ankle.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/m5zqv/files/osfstorage/5e6223c2a0964501dc051bfe", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e6223c2a0964501dc051bfe"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "a41e12e7b807dab3a5946ee15cd4e75178a765bbc244e855acc03fca2fcbc959"}}], "q12.question": "The data collection took place in the form of an e-mail, in which the questionnaires were sent electronically to the participating practices. This form of the questionnaire is to be counted towards a written survey. It was used because the size of the sample can be larger than with other forms of survey, such as telephone surveys or oral (face-to-face) interviews, with the same amount of resources (cf. Schnell et al. 1999: 335 ff.). Furthermore, written surveys increase the anonymity of the survey and reduce the time pressure when answering the questionnaire (cf. Kirchhoff et al. 2000).\nIn order to keep the workload for the participating practices as low as possible, a so-called \"Microsoft Office\" developer tool was used to answer the questions in the questionnaire file. This made it possible to fill out the questionnaire directly on the computer. For this purpose, a box was added to each answer option of the 9 questions, which was marked with a cross by clicking on it. The respondents were asked to do this for each question. Afterwards, the questionnaire should only be saved and sent back to the investigator-in-charge by e-mail.\nThe survey period was set to 4 weeks. In the run-up to the survey, all participants were interviewed by telephone or e-mail about their participation in the study. All questionnaires were sent to the participating practices on the same day. After two weeks, the practices were contacted by telephone or e-mail whose questionnaires had not yet been returned to the survey director. The same procedure was carried out at the beginning of the fourth week of the given period.   \nThe completed questionnaires were then coded and the results of the survey were transferred to an Excel spreadsheet. In order to guarantee the objectivity of the analysis, the coding and transfer was carried out by an independent person. Therefore the results can be considered blinded. On the other hand, this step increases data protection. \nInclusion criteria were defined for the recruitment of study participants. For the participating physiotherapies, care was taken to ensure that \"manual therapy\" or \"sports physiotherapy\" was included in the range of services offered by the corresponding facilities. Care was taken to ensure that the participating medical practices were general practitioners, sports physicians or orthopaedic specialists. \nIt was also determined that only outpatient practices would be contacted for the study. Hospitals and rehabilitation clinics were excluded because it was difficult to establish contact with these institutions and it was often not possible to contact a corresponding contact person in the institution directly.  \nThe aim of recruitment was to recruit a total of one hundred outpatient physiotherapy practices for participation in the study, and one hundred outpatient medical practices. In order to achieve a representation of the results for all of Germany, Germany was divided into 4 regions. A distinction was made between Southern Germany, Eastern Germany, Northern Germany and Western Germany. The aim of this measure was also to identify possible local differences in the application of the OAR. In southern Germany, practices from the federal states of Bavaria and Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg were contacted. The area of eastern Germany included the federal states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, Brandenburg and Berlin. Northern Germany was to be represented by the federal states of Bremen, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein. The region of West Germany included the federal states of Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland. An attempt was made to recruit twenty-five medical practices and physiotherapy practices per region or area. In addition, the aim was to have at least three medical and physiotherapy practices in each state. \nThe participants were also asked to sign a declaration of consent to participate in the study and to return this form scanned to the study director. A standardized declaration of the Ethics Committee of the German Sport University in Cologne was used.", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "The evaluation of each of the nine questions was recorded. The respondents were able to rate the relevance of each question between 1 (not relevant) and 9 (very relevant). \nIn addition, personal data was collected. The professional experience, the prevalence of acute ankle injuries in daily practice, the profession or specialty of the participants, and the region in Germany in which the respondents work in the outpatient sector were recorded.

The mean value and the median describe \"the position of the observed values on a numerical line and are therefore defined [as] position parameters\" (Lehn &amp; Wegmann 1992: 80). The minimum value, on the other hand, like the maximum value, is called the \"dispersion parameter\" and forms the value of the range, which is to be regarded as the \"difference between minimum and maximum\" (Lehn &amp; Wegmann 1992: 23). The standard deviation is also a measure of dispersion and is to be regarded as \"a measure of the spread of the values of a characteristic around its mean value\" (Walser 2011: 11). The basis for the calculation of the standard deviation is the variance. This value characterises the distribution of values around the mean value and is \"the square of the standard deviation\" (Walser 2011: 13). The standard deviation is then calculated as root of the variance. The lower and first quartile as well as the upper and third quartile were also determined for each data series. Both are further measures of location, which are less sensitive to extreme values. The range between the upper and lower quartiles is referred to as the quartile distance. This was also determined for each of the 9 questions asked in the questionnaire. The quartile distance describes the range of the middle fifty percent of a data series. The quartile distance is also considered less sensitive to extreme values. \nIn the field of inductive statistics, different procedures were applied depending on the hypothesis. In order to make the knowledge of the OAR comparable, questions one and three to six were combined with the corresponding evaluations per question. The sum of these 5 questions could be used to assess the knowledge of the OAR. It was determined that a minimum value of 35 had to be reached in order to assume knowledge of the OAR. The minimum value of 35 was set because this corresponded to an average score of 7. A score of 7 should be considered as the minimum value of the class, which is considered to be very relevant and should be taken into account for the clinical examination. In order to compare the knowledge of the OAR among physicians and physiotherapists (hypothesis 3), a mean value comparison of the two groups was carried out. Since the evaluation of the questions should be considered as ordinal data, no \"t-test\" could be used. Since the sample survey was carried out individually in each case, it is an independent type of sample survey. Since the mean value comparison of physicians and physiotherapists involves exactly 2 study groups, the \"Mann-Whitney-U-Test\" was used. \nThe mean value comparison was different for the analysis of the application of the OAR in the different regions of Germany (Hypothesis 4).

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the preferred treatment for patients with anxiety disorders or OCD. Even though CBT is effective for most patients, 30-40% of the patients do not respond to CBT (Durham, Chambers, MacDonald, Power, &amp; Major, 2003). For those patients, often no alternative evidence-based psychological treatments are available. Therefore, new evidence-based therapies need to be developed.\nA new treatment program was developed for patients with an anxiety disorder or OCD and comorbid personality disorder: \u2018SCHerp\u2019 aims to reduce anxiety symptoms by combining and integrating schema therapy (SCH) with exposure and response prevention (erp). Previous observational research investigating the effectivity of SCHerp showed that 58.2% of the patients improved after treatment (Appel, Pranger, Stappenbelt, Burke, Van Passel, &amp; Krans, submitted for publication). Although these results are promising, the SCHerp program can still be improved. \nThe aim of this study is to evaluate, for each participant, the effectiveness of the SCHerp program in reducing both psychological malfunction and severity of disorder specific symptoms. In addition, we aim to evaluate changes in adaptive and maladaptive schema modes, and in implicit avoidance tendencies during the SCHerp program. Lastly, we aim to identify and generate hypotheses about periods within SCHerp with the highest gains (e.g. largest decline in anxiety/OCD symptoms)."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "With this explorative study we aim to generate hypotheses about the effectiveness and underlying working mechanisms of the SCHerp program.  \n\nOur first objective is to evaluate, for each participant, the effectiveness of the SCHerp program.

Furthermore, including a control group would be ethically complicated in this population, as it is difficult to select a suitable comparison. That is, guideline treatment was previously unsuccessful in these patients, often even with multiple attempts, and a waiting list would keep them from necessary treatment for 6 months more than usual. Additional practical and ethical advantages of a multiple baseline design are that (1) the design requires fewer participants and (2) it has an increased power because participants act as their own control (Arntz, Sofi, van Breukelen, 2013). The study will have a duration of 10.5 months. In this period, we will assess 2 cohorts of 4 SCHerp patients each (total number of patients N = 8).

This questionnaire consists of three subscales: (1) symptom distress, (2) problems in interpersonal relations and (3) problems in social role performance. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (always). The OQ-45 has a Cronbach\u2019s alpha of 0.93 and a test-retest Person\u2019s correlation of 0.79 (Jong et al., 2008). \n(2)\tSeverity of disorder specific symptoms (depending on the diagnosis assessed with the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, the Panic Disorder Severity Scale, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, the Penn State Worry Questionnaire, The Whiteley Index or the Posttraumatic Symptom Scale).\n\u2022\tYale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Self-Report version) (YBOCS-SR; Goodman et al., 1989a; Steketee, Frost, &amp; Bogart, 1996) is a 10-item self-report questionnaire assessing the severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme). The Y-BOCS-SR has a Cronbach\u2019s alpha of 0.78-0.89 and a test-retest Person\u2019s correlation of 0.88 (Rapp, Bergman, Piacentini, &amp; Mcguire, 2016). \n\u2022\tPanic Disorder Severity Scale (Self-Report version) (PDSS-SR; Houck, Spiegel, Shear, &amp; Rucci, 2002) is a 7- item self-report questionnaire used to assess panic disorder severity. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from (0) none to (4) extreme. The PDSS-SR has a Cronbach\u2019s alpha of 0.92 and a testretest Person\u2019s correlation of 0.81 (Houck et al., 2002).\n\u2022\tLiebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS; Liebowitz, 1987) is a 24-item self-report questionnaire used to assess social anxiety and social avoidance severity. Questions can be divided into two subscales: (1) social situations and (2) situations in which one has to perform. Every item has to be rated twice to assess both their frequency of avoidance and to assess the anxiety that the situation evokes. Items about anxiety and avoidance are both rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (very much) and from 0 (never) to 3 (almost always), respectively. The LSAS has a Cronbach\u2019s alpha of 0.95 and a test-retest Person\u2019s correlation of 0.83 (Baker, Heinrichs, Kim, Hofmann, 2001). \n\u2022\tPenn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; Meyer, Miller, Metzger, &amp; Borkovec, 1990) is used for participants with generalized anxiety disorder. The PSWQ is a 16-item self-report questionnaire used to assess worry. This questionnaire consists of four subscales: (1) occurrence, (2) intrusiveness, (3) pervasiveness and (4) other characterizing features of an individual\u2019s experience with worry. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all typical) to 5 (very typical of me). The PSWQ has a Cronbach\u2019s alpha of 0.93 and a test-retest Person\u2019s correlation of 0.92 (Meyer et al., 1990). \n\u2022\tWhiteley Index (WI; Pilowski, 1967; Speckens et al., 1996) is used for patients with hypochondria. The WI is a 7-item self-report questionnaire assessing hypochondriacal worries and beliefs. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very bad). The WI has a Cronbach\u2019s alpha of 0.73 and a test-retest Person\u2019s correlation of 0.66 (Hedman et al., 2015). \n\u2022\tPosttraumatic Symptom Scale (Self-Report version) (PSS-SR; Foa, Riggs, Dancu, &amp; Rothbaum, 1997; Engelhard, Arntz, &amp; Van den Hout, 2007) is a 17-item self-report questionnaire assessing PTSD symptoms. This questionnaire consists of 3 subscales: (1) hyperarousal, (2) re-experiencing and (3) avoidance. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 3 (5 times per week or more). The PSS-SR has a Cronbach\u2019s alpha of 0.92 and a test-retest Person\u2019s correlation of 0.83 (Foa et al., 1997). \n(3)\tAdaptive and maladaptive modes (assessed with the short Schema Mode Inventory (SMI)).\n\u2022\tThe short Schema Mode Inventory (SMI; Young et al., 2007) is a 124-item self-report questionnaire assessing the presence of the following 14 modes: Vulnerable Child, Angry Child, Enraged Child, Impulsive Child, Undisciplined Child, Happy Child, Compliant Surrenderer, Detached Protector, Detached Self-Soother, Self-Aggrandizer, Bully and Attack, Punitive Parent, Demanding Parent, and Healthy Adult. These modes can be categorized in an adaptive adult mode (healthy adult), an adaptive child (happy child) and maladaptive modes (remaining 12 modes; Schaap, Chakhssi, &amp; Westerhof, 2016).

Pulling the joystick will make the picture bigger (approach) while pushing will make the picture smaller (avoid). To assess avoidance tendencies, reaction times in the pull condition are compares to reaction times in the corresponding push condition. An avoidance tendency is reflected when the response time in the push condition is shorter than in the pull condition. In this study, the individual stimuli will be adjusted to the specified anxiety disorder and fears of the participant.

Hendriks, Julie Krans", "q3": "Anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) are among the most common mental health issues worldwide (Ghaedi, Tavoli, Bakhtiari, Melyani, &amp; Sahragard, 2010). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the preferred treatment for patients with anxiety disorders or OCD. Even though CBT is effective for most patients, 30-40% of the patients do not respond to CBT (Durham, Chambers, MacDonald, Power, &amp; Major, 2003). For those patients, often no alternative evidence-based psychological treatments are available. Therefore, new evidence-based therapies need to be developed.\nA new treatment program was developed for patients with an anxiety disorder or OCD and comorbid personality disorder: \u2018SCHerp\u2019 aims to reduce anxiety symptoms by combining and integrating schema therapy (SCH) with exposure and response prevention (erp). Previous observational research investigating the effectivity of SCHerp showed that 58.2% of the patients improved after treatment (Appel, Pranger, Stappenbelt, Burke, Van Passel, &amp; Krans, submitted for publication). Although these results are promising, the SCHerp program can still be improved. \nThe aim of this study is to evaluate, for each participant, the effectiveness of the SCHerp program in reducing both psychological malfunction and severity of disorder specific symptoms. In addition, we aim to evaluate changes in adaptive and maladaptive schema modes, and in implicit avoidance tendencies during the SCHerp program. Lastly, we aim to identify and generate hypotheses about periods within SCHerp with the highest gains (e.g. largest decline in anxiety/OCD symptoms).", "q4": "With this explorative study we aim to generate hypotheses about the effectiveness and underlying working mechanisms of the SCHerp program.  \n\nOur first objective is to evaluate, for each participant, the effectiveness of the SCHerp program.

Furthermore, including a control group would be ethically complicated in this population, as it is difficult to select a suitable comparison. That is, guideline treatment was previously unsuccessful in these patients, often even with multiple attempts, and a waiting list would keep them from necessary treatment for 6 months more than usual. Additional practical and ethical advantages of a multiple baseline design are that (1) the design requires fewer participants and (2) it has an increased power because participants act as their own control (Arntz, Sofi, van Breukelen, 2013).
