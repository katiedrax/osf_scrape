Between persons, children and adolescents higher in prosocial skills are usually lower in behavioral problems such as externalizing and internalizing problems (Flynn et al., 2015; Memmott-Elison et al., 2020). These studies indicate that prosocial skills might be a protective factor for developing behavioral problems and therefore several researchers have suggested that prosocial skills might be an interesting target in interventions for behavioral problems. However, little research has been done on within-person changes of prosocial skills and behavioral problems over time. Put otherwise, do changes within a person in one construct affect performance on the other construct? This is a crucial question with respect to intervention planning. To our knowledge, studies investigating this question so far mainly focused on within-person changes during adolescence (Padilla-Walker et al., 2015; Padilla-Walker et al., 2018). For instance, Padilla-Walker et al. (2018) showed that prosocial behavior and aggression were negatively associated bi-directionally over time. However, since prosocial behavior is a relatively stable trait once developed (Nantel-Vivier et al., 2009; Flynn et al., 2015), it might be important to investigate within-person changes in an earlier phase, during childhood. Moreover, until now it remains unclear whether there are sensitive windows for within-person changes. It is often suggested that early intervention (i.e., during early childhood) results in the largest effect. However, one might suggest that middle childhood is a more suitable period for such within-person changes, as this is a developmental phase where the first friendships emerge and prosocial skills become specifically important (Del Giudice et al., 2009; van der Meulen et al., 2018). \n\nTo shed light on these important questions, the current project proposes to use random-intercept cross lagged panel models (RI-CLPM; Hamaker et al. (2015) to investigate within person effects of prosocial skills on behavioral problems (either internalizing or externalizing) and vice versa during childhood, see Figure 1. To obtain robust results, three indicators of prosocial skills will be used: parental report of prosocial skills (SDQ); parental report of empathy (My Child); and costly donating behavior. Within time points we will test how these prosocial skills relate to both internalizing (SDQ subscales emotional problems + peer problems) and externalizing (SDQ subscale conduct problems + hyperactivity) problem behavior. The evidence on the relation between behavior problems and the three measures of prosocial skills will be aggregated by means of Bayesian evidence synthesis (Kuiper et al., 2013; Zondervan et al., 2019).
