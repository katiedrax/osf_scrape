Lawrence et al., 2018). Most of the research has used \u201cultra-high field\u201d MRI of 7T and above which has the capacity to increase the SNR of the acquired images, thus enabling independent measures of the BOLD signal at different depths of the neocortex. Each depth has dominant functions and connections associated with it.\nFor example, the primary visual cortex consists of six histological layers. Previous research methods have been able to divide the cortex into three gray-matter depths. The BOLD signals within the superficial and deep depths is associated with feedback, while activity in the middle depth is feedforward processes (Lawrence, Norris, &amp; de Lange, 2019). Recent work from the de Lange lab has shown differing laminar profiles between contrast effects (a bottom-up manipulation) and attention effects (top-down) in the early visual cortex (V1-V3). During the contrast manipulation, granular layers were more active, while during the attention task agranuar layers showed higher activity. Furthermore, Lawrence et al.

The subjects will be presented with two Gabor patches of different orientations (on for 0.2 seconds each with a 0.4s interstimulus interval) followed by a cue (0.8s) indicating which orientation to remember. After the stimuli, a delay period (10.7s) will follow during which the participants have to maintain the remembered orientation. A probe stimulus (0.5s) will be presented after the delay period following which the subjects have to indicate (2 seconds time window for response) whether the orientation of the probe stimulus was shifted clockwise or counter-clockwise compared to the remembered orientation. A feedback screen (0.3s) will be presented indicating whether the answer was correct. Grating stimuli will be presented centrally at 50% contrast on a gray background behind an ever present fixation annulus mask (outer radius 8\u00b0, inner radius 1\u00b0).

of fiction and nonfiction, and how transported they are by reading, impacts their critical thinking. This study follows a previous observational pilot survey about reading and critical thinking disposition, and expands upon it by introducing experimental manipulation, and by addressing critical thinking skill rather than disposition. In this study, participants will be given a critical thinking test; they will be assigned fiction or nonfiction readings in the experimental conditions or no set readings in the control condition; they will be asked to complete a reading log over a two-week period; they will be given another version of the critical thinking test.\n\nExisting research has shown that higher levels of reading are associated with a greater knowledge base (Stanovich and Cunningham, 1993). Furthermore, reading fiction has been shown to improve social skill (e.g. Mar, Oatley, Hirsh, dela Paz, and Peterson, 2006). Finally, fiction genre reading also plays a role in counterfactual thinking (Black, Capps, and Barnes, 2017). Reading is thought to have these effects due to the way that narrative transports the reader, and how they imagine and engage with the characters and scenes described. Experimental studies have shown that asking participants to read a fiction or a nonfiction text can result in different outcomes in empathy and theory of mind (Kidd and Castano, 2013), and that fiction reading can prompt pro-social behaviors (Johnson, 2012). We hypothesise that the knowledge, social skills, and counterfactual thinking gained through reading, especially fiction reading, will be deployed in critically evaluating texts. Therefore, we expect people who read more fiction over the experimental period to show greater critical thinking test score improvement than those who read less, or those who mainly read nonfiction. \n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "H\u2080: Reading (quantity nor type) will have no significant association with critical thinking score either at t1, or with the difference between t1 and t2 score.\n\nH\u2081: Higher reading engagement will have a significant association with higher baseline critical thinking score at t1.\n\nH\u2082: Higher amounts of reading recorded over the reading log period will have a significant association with increases in critical thinking score from t1 to t2.\n\nH\u2083: Higher amounts of fiction reading recorded over the reading log period will have a stronger association with increases in critical thinking score from t1 to t2 than nonfiction.\n\nH\u2084: Narrative transportation will mediate the relationships predicted in H\u2082 and H\u2083.\n\nH\u2084: Participants assigned to the fiction experimental group will have greater increases in their critical thinking test scores from t1 to t2 than either the nonfiction group or the control group.\n\nExploration: Reading some genres, such as Science Fiction and Fantasy, may correlate more strongly than other genre reading with greater increases in critical thinking score from t1 to t2. Nonfiction topic and type may likewise effect critical thinking score increases, with more fiction-like materials (such as biography) leading to greater increases. How engaged with, and how impacted by, participants are by the assigned texts may also have an impact on increases in critical thinking score.

This study follows a previous observational pilot survey about reading and critical thinking disposition, and expands upon it by introducing experimental manipulation, and by addressing critical thinking skill rather than disposition. In this study, participants will be given a critical thinking test; they will be assigned fiction or nonfiction readings in the experimental conditions or no set readings in the control condition; they will be asked to complete a reading log over a two-week period; they will be given another version of the critical thinking test.\n\nExisting research has shown that higher levels of reading are associated with a greater knowledge base (Stanovich and Cunningham, 1993). Furthermore, reading fiction has been shown to improve social skill (e.g. Mar, Oatley, Hirsh, dela Paz, and Peterson, 2006). Finally, fiction genre reading also plays a role in counterfactual thinking (Black, Capps, and Barnes, 2017). Reading is thought to have these effects due to the way that narrative transports the reader, and how they imagine and engage with the characters and scenes described. Experimental studies have shown that asking participants to read a fiction or a nonfiction text can result in different outcomes in empathy and theory of mind (Kidd and Castano, 2013), and that fiction reading can prompt pro-social behaviors (Johnson, 2012). We hypothesise that the knowledge, social skills, and counterfactual thinking gained through reading, especially fiction reading, will be deployed in critically evaluating texts. Therefore, we expect people who read more fiction over the experimental period to show greater critical thinking test score improvement than those who read less, or those who mainly read nonfiction. \n", "q4": "H\u2080: Reading (quantity nor type) will have no significant association with critical thinking score either at t1, or with the difference between t1 and t2 score.\n\nH\u2081: Higher reading engagement will have a significant association with higher baseline critical thinking score at t1.\n\nH\u2082: Higher amounts of reading recorded over the reading log period will have a significant association with increases in critical thinking score from t1 to t2.\n\nH\u2083: Higher amounts of fiction reading recorded over the reading log period will have a stronger association with increases in critical thinking score from t1 to t2 than nonfiction.\n\nH\u2084: Narrative transportation will mediate the relationships predicted in H\u2082 and H\u2083.\n\nH\u2084: Participants assigned to the fiction experimental group will have greater increases in their critical thinking test scores from t1 to t2 than either the nonfiction group or the control group.\n\nExploration: Reading some genres, such as Science Fiction and Fantasy, may correlate more strongly than other genre reading with greater increases in critical thinking score from t1 to t2. Nonfiction topic and type may likewise effect critical thinking score increases, with more fiction-like materials (such as biography) leading to greater increases. How engaged with, and how impacted by, participants are by the assigned texts may also have an impact on increases in critical thinking score. Being assigned to an experimental group that is congruous (i.e. fiction reader assigned fiction reading) or incongruous (i.e. nonfiction reader assigned fiction reading) may also have different effects. All of these are exploratory areas of interest.\n", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

They will also state their gender and their highest obtained educational level. \n\nFirst all interested participants will be grouped (fiction reading women with degrees, nonfiction reading women with degrees, fiction reading women without degrees, nonfiction reading women without degrees, fiction reading men with degrees, nonfiction reading men with degrees, fiction reading men without degrees, nonfiction reading men without degrees, other gender fiction readers, other gender nonfiction readers).\n\nA random number generator will be used to selected participants from each group to take part in the study. 60 fiction readers, and 60 nonfiction readers will be selected. Fiction and nonfiction readers will be divided evenly between the fiction group (n=40), nonfiction group (n=40), and control group (n=40). This will yield 6 blocks (fiction readers assigned fiction, fiction readers assigned nonfiction, nonfiction readers assigned fiction, nonfiction readers assigned nonfiction, fiction readers in control group, nonfiction readers in control group), with the control variables of gender and education as evenly distributed across those 6 blocks as possible.\n\nThis procedure will enable us to balance our experimental groups, controlling for gender and educational level as potential confounding variables.

Furthermore, using G*Power for a power analysis, assuming a medium effect size (f\u00b2 0.15) and a power of 80%, it is calculated that 77 participants are required for a multiple regression analysis of the measured variables upon critical thinking change.

This is a Categorical, ordinal variable. If possible, answers will be re-coded to the categories of equivalent educational level in the 2011 UK Census. However, in my pilot study this grouping did not fit the data well, as my participants were highly educated and therefore segmenting the higher education levels into smaller categories, and collapsing the lower education levels into fewer categories, better reflected the data.
