To date few studies have addressed this question despite the millions of children who are learning to read in bilingual environments. The grain size accommodation hypothesis (Lallier &amp; Carreiras, 2018) proposes that cross-linguistic variations (the differences between languages) and cross-linguistic transfer (the influence from one language to another) affect bilingual reading strategies as well as cognitive function. Sparks, Ganschow, and Pohlman (1989) proposed the linguistic coding differences hypothesis to further explain the relationship between native and second-language reading difficulties. These authors suggest that children who have difficulty reading in their native language will also show difficulties reading in their second language. The explanation behind this reasoning is that the same skill deficits will be present because both native and second language reading depend on the same set of linguistic skills (Li, Tao, Joshi, &amp; Xu, 2018; Sparks, Ganschow, &amp; Pohlman, 1989). In the present study we will examine the extent to which reading performance is determine by resistance to distractor interference (as measured in the Flanker task) and practice reading (as measured through a self-report questionnaire of number of hours reading in each language). Our study focuses on the relationship between cognitive and linguistic abilities. Our population are 8 to 10 years-old students that are currently attending a Spanish immersion school in the USA.

To date few studies have addressed this question despite the millions of children who are learning to read in bilingual environments. The grain size accommodation hypothesis (Lallier &amp; Carreiras, 2018) proposes that cross-linguistic variations (the differences between languages) and cross-linguistic transfer (the influence from one language to another) affect bilingual reading strategies as well as cognitive function. Sparks, Ganschow, and Pohlman (1989) proposed the linguistic coding differences hypothesis to further explain the relationship between native and second-language reading difficulties. These authors suggest that children who have difficulty reading in their native language will also show difficulties reading in their second language. The explanation behind this reasoning is that the same skill deficits will be present because both native and second language reading depend on the same set of linguistic skills (Li, Tao, Joshi, &amp; Xu, 2018; Sparks, Ganschow, &amp; Pohlman, 1989). In the present study we will examine the extent to which reading performance is determine by resistance to distractor interference (as measured in the Flanker task) and practice reading (as measured through a self-report questionnaire of number of hours reading in each language). Our study focuses on the relationship between cognitive and linguistic abilities. Our population are 8 to 10 years-old students that are currently attending a Spanish immersion school in the USA.

In an effort to encourage interactions that can better support children\u2019s language outcomes, public awareness programs and interventions have begun to promote ways to enrich caregiver-child interactions. One approach is from the framework of target caregivers, by encouraging them to talk more with their children throughout the day (e.g., Suskind et al., 2016), while another approach is to focus on stimulating activities that can support children\u2019s early language and literacy skills (e.g., Reach out and Read). Given the links between low-socioeconomic status (SES), caregiver input, and children\u2019s developmental outcomes (Hart &amp; Risley, 1995; Walker et al. 1994, Hoff, 2003), both approaches have been targeted to families living in low-SES backgrounds. However, effects of such interventions have been found to be small to moderate for children\u2019s outcomes, suggesting that it is still unclear what aspects of children\u2019s language environments can be influenced to support their learning. In this work we investigate caregivers\u2019 verbal engagement with their children, sampled from their densest hour of day-to-day, naturalistic, and spontaneous interactions. This study is a secondary analysis of previously collected data in the Fernald lab. Prior analyses have been run using approximations of the language environment (i.e., using automated estimations from LENA), but never before with transcriptions confirmed for child-directed speech. \n\nOur goal with this work is to tease apart the extent to which the language learning environment is linked to intra-individual stability within caregivers\u2019 themselves, or whether different activities can change the language learning environment. We also examine how caregivers\u2019 verbal engagement within and across activities is linked to children\u2019s later outcomes. Activities consist of one-on-one child-centered activities of book reading, play, food-related activities, routines, and unstructured conversation, as well as adult-centered activities (e.g., periods of divided adult engagement such as doing the laundry but providing child-directed speech), and periods of overheard speech.
