Steve D. Charman, Amy Douglass"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "The first question this study addresses is whether witnesses exhibit non-verbal cues to accuracy while making their identification decision. This question is critical because researchers have uncovered only a small number of cues to witness accuracy (called \u2018postdictors\u2019), the utility of which can be questionable. For example, even though identification speed is a reliable cue to accuracy (i.e., witnesses who make quick decisions tend to be more accurate than witnesses who take long decisions; Brewer et al., 2006), without a video record, there is no accurate measure of how long a witness took to make a decision (Wells &amp; Bradfield, 1998). Another known postdictor relates to witnesses\u2019 descriptions of how their decision was made; witnesses who describe a deliberative process tend to be less accurate than those who describe an automatic process (e.g., the culprit\u2019s photo \u2018popped out,\u2019 Dunning &amp; Stern, 1994). However, these self-reports are themselves distorted by post-identification variables, such as feedback about accuracy, underming their reliability (Wells &amp; Bradfield, 1998). A third postdictor of accuracy, witness confidence, can strongly postdict witness accuracy under \u2018pristine\u2019 conditions, but can fail to postdict accuracy strongly if not collected immediately after the identification, or in the presence of memory-distorting variables (Wixted &amp; Wells, 2017). One of the main problems with these postdictors, therefore, is that they rely on self-reports, which can be subject to distortion. The discovery of postdictors that are not subject to self-report would therefore be highly desirable (e.g., Charman &amp; Cahill, 2012). Consequently, we examine whether witnesses\u2019 non-verbal behaviors during a lineup procedure\u2014which can only be uncovered by video-recording their identifications\u2014can postdict accuracy. Such non-verbal postdictors are particularly desirable given their lower susceptibility to distortion. Therefore, this study examines whether there are behavioral cues that can differentiate accurate from inaccurate witnesses. \nThe second question this study addresses is whether video-recording affects the identification decisions that witnesses make. If video-recording does not affect witnesses\u2019 decisions, this experiment will be a critical supplement to persuasive attempts to encourage police departments to adopt video-recording. However, if video-recording does affect choosing, this would be essential information for psychological researchers to know before continuing to advocate for this recommendation. Why might video-recording affect witness choosing? One possibility is that video-recording makes the potential for contradiction or embarrassment salient. If so, witnesses\u2019 willingness to choose a photo (and potentially be wrong) might diminish, or witnesses may express lower confidence in their identifications. Research showing that witnesses produce lower confidence reports in public (cf. private) provides some support for this possibility (Shaw, Appio, Zerr, &amp; Pontoski, 2007; Shaw, Zerr, &amp; Woythaler, 2001). Alternatively, video-recording might make witnesses more likely to choose a photo because they want to show others that they are a \u2018good\u2019 witness. Therefore, as described below, we manipulate whether witnesses are aware of being video-recorded during their lineup procedure, and, among those who are aware, whether they are told that video-recording is standard protocol (thereby minimizing the salience of subsequent evaluation) or whether they are told it will be evaluated by peers (thereby maximizing the salience of potential negative evaluations). Should witness choosing and/or confidence be affected by the explanation for the video-recording, our data will advance our understanding of theoretical models of eyewitness decision-making by, for instance, expanding the constellation of variables known to shift witnesses\u2019 willingness to choose (i.e., their decision criterion, e.g., Dobolyi &amp; Dodson, 2013; Palmer &amp; Brewer, 2012).\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "We expect inaccurate witnesses to show more non-verbal signs of uncertainty, specifically touching the face while examining the photospread, making noises suggestive of uncertainty (e.g., sighs, groans), re-adjusting the lineup, and displaying facial signs of uncertainty (e.g., grimacing), and non-verbal wavering (e.g., going back and forth between two photos).

Backward search: reference lists of eligible studies will be searched manually. \n5. Forward search: articles that have cited eligible studies will be examined manually. \n\nAll materials and literature search results will be stored in Mendeley. This account will be managed by the lead author [MC].

Three reviewers [MC and GH] will execute the initial screening process independently with a 30% overlap in screening material. During this process the title and abstract are first assessed against the eligibility criteria followed by a full-text review. When a decision cannot be made based solely on the title and abstract, the full text will be reviewed. A third member of the research team [DG or TR] will adjudicate any disagreements regarding study eligibility between the two primary assessors. Reasons for study exclusion will be summarised as part of the search and data extraction flow diagram. \n\nAfter this initial search process three authors [MC, BS, GH] will then examine these primary studies on the basis of pre-determined criteria and only include studies in the meta-analytic database if they satisfied in inclusion criteria specified previously. Coding will be conducted independently and in duplicate for 30% of the initial papers (Johnson &amp; Hennessy, 2019).

Measurements could be self-reports but other possibilities include: clinical interviews (e.g. for emotional resilience); standardised assessments (e.g. for cognitive outcomes such as attention or executive functioning); and via third-party evaluations (e.g. for job performance).\n"}, "q14": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q15": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q16": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Not relevant"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q17": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "We will focus on several primary outcomes relating to emotional, cognitive, and job performance resilience in relation to a demanding event: deployment. These outcomes are anticipated to be measured in many ways across the studies, which are listed and defined below: \n1.\tAffective symptoms: In order to categorize outcomes in this meta-category, the description of the DSM-5 disorders under depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, trauma and stress-related disorders, and dissociative disorders were used as a reference guide. This meta-category maps several symptoms associated with anger, anxiety, depression, emotional health, frustration, and fear.\n2.\tNon-clinical stress-related outcomes:  these are non-clinical stress-related outcomes such as stress and burnout. Recent research has confirmed that clinical disorders (e.g. depression) and burnout greatly overlap (Ahola, Hakanen, Perhoniemi, &amp; Mutanen, 2014; Ahola et al., 2005), there are various studies focusing on the burnout construct, and therefore important to consider as a separate outcome relating to emotional resilience. This category includes burnout both as a single score and as emotional exhaustion. Stress defines a neuroendocrine hyper-activation state of response mechanisms to environmental (i.e., physical and/or psychosocial) stimuli (so-called stressors) accompanied by heightened alertness, and affective or neurotic symptoms (Contrada, 2010; Dallman &amp; Hellhammer, 2010). Some of the operationalisations of stress are job tension, job strain, distress, conflict stress, and psychological distress.\n3.\tMeasures of resilience or adjustment: relate to the perception that one is robust or able to quickly adjust to stressors or adversity (Kalisch et al., 2017). While these outcomes are often highly related to both affective symptoms and non-clinical stress-related outcomes, they are often measured as distinct and therefore it is important to consider them as a separate outcome. \n4.\tCognitive outcomes: are measures that relate to cognitive functioning or impairment. Different levels of cognitive impairment can relate to both symptoms of mental ill-health and the job-demand context (e.g., poor sleep). Such impairments may relate to memory, attention, executive functioning, cognitive failures, cognitive fatigue, semantic memory and fluency etc. Cognitive outcomes of interest will not be limited a-priori, rather we intend to identify a wide range of cognitive outcomes that have been explored in relation to the post-deployment context. \n5.\tJob performance: overall job performance consists of both task performance and organisational citizenship behaviours (OCBs). Task performance involves behaviours that directly affect organizations\u2019 technical cores via technical processes, whereas OCBs are discretionary behaviours that improve the organizational, psychological, and/or social environments in which organizations\u2019 technical cores function (Motowidlo &amp; Van Scotter, 1994).  Such measures may include self or other ratings of job performance.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among military personnel is an issue that receives a large amount of attention, particularly in the context of operational deployment in relation to the experience of potentially traumatic events (e.g., Adler et al., 2008). A recent meta-analysis of military personnel investigating PTSD following deployment to the Iraq and Afghanistan conflict identified 49 papers emerging between 1991 and 2012 (Hines, et al., 2014). Yet, there is a dearth of meta-analysis investigating the role the job-related demands and resources play in relation to deployment related-outcomes. Personnel serving in deployment contexts also experience other demands, such as sleep disruption, barriers to fulfilling goals, ethical challenges (Kok, Herrell, Grossman, West, &amp; Wilk, 2016; McCauley, Liebling-Kalifani, &amp; Hughes, 2012). Other job-related demands also play a role in individual vulnerability to PTSD. Personnel serving in deployment contexts also experience such demands as sleep disruption, barriers to fulfilling goals, and ethical challenges (Kok, Herrell, Grossman, West, &amp; Wilk, 2016; McCauley, Liebling-Kalifani, &amp; Hughes, 2012). Other job-related demands also play a role in individual vulnerability to PTSD, as do recent life stressors (Bonanno, Galea, Bucciarelli, &amp; Vlahov, 2007). Thus the backdrop of stressors has implication for the emergence of PTSD. Moreover, deployments may result in a range of other debilitating mental health concerns including: cognitive functioning, anxiety, depression, and burnout (Alder, et al., 2017; Black, et al., 2004; Booth-Kewley, et al., 2012). These may arise as a consequence of other job-related factors that have not yet been the focus of attention in the military context.", "q4": "We aim to make three distinct contributions to the literature. First, we will gain a deeper and integrated understanding of the job-demands that exist in the military deployment setting that impinge on psychological resilience, cognitive and job-performance. Second, we will establish the relative importance of these job-demands in the predicting decrements in these outcomes. Third, we investigate the job-resources and individual-characteristics that moderate these effects and their role in attenuating the negative effects of job-demands. \n\nThis meta-analysis is intended to provide: (i) a useful qualitative and quantitative synthesis of the available evidence regarding the role of job demands and resources in post-deployment outcomes, (ii) identify gaps in current work that may be areas for future research, and (iii) inform the development of a tool for measuring the critical job demands and resources that are likely to affect at-sea post-deployment outcomes in a Navy population. Therefore, the specific aims of this meta-analysis are to:\n1.\tDetermine the variety of job demands and resources most commonly examined in the context of deployment across and between different services (Army, Navy, Air Force). \n2.\tDetermine which, of those commonly-identified demands grouped into three broad categories (i.e., physical, cognitive, and emotional), have the largest and most consistent associations with outcomes (i.e., mental ill-health, psychological resilience, cognitive and job performance) and whether these associations differ for the different services.\n3.\tIdentify the job-related resources that moderate the association between job demands and outcomes in three broad categories (i.e., physical, cognitive and emotional). \n4.\tIdentify the individual-related resources that moderate the association between job demands and outcomes. Individual-resources will be groups into three broad categories: (1) resilient beliefs (e.g., self-efficacy, optimism), (2) coping and emotion regulatory strategies (e.g., support seeking, planning, avoidance) and coping resources (e.g., social support networks). \n5.\tIdentify how long after deployment it takes for effects on wellbeing (e.g., depression, PTSD, anxiety) to emerge.\n", "q5": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies.", "q6": ["No blinding is involved in this study."], "q7": "", "q9": "", "q10": "Registration prior to creation of data", "q11": "", "q13": "Time period of the search will be from inception to the date of the electronic search.

The stimuli vary along four binary feature dimensions: type of horns, type of arms, type of marks, and type of eyes. The category structure consists of (a) one diagnostic feature that separates the two categories (the horns); (b) one feature equally distributed across both categories (the eyes); and (c) two features assigned into a pair of correlated features and equally distributed across both categories (the arms and the marks). Correlated feature pairs are feature dimensions that always occur together, regardless of category membership. All possible feature combinations were made, generating a total of 8 unique monsters per category. For the feature inference test, various images (i.e. a cloud, brick wall, tree, etc.) were used to hide the monsters so that only one feature was shown.\n\nPROCEDURE:\n\nParticipants will be seated with the experimenter while doing the experiment. Instructions will be read out to all participants. \n\nThe trial orders will be randomized for each participant to avoid any order effects. \n\nFor the first task participants will see a monster appear in the middle of the screen and will have to categorize the monster based on if the participant thinks the monster is a \u201cMizulee\u201d or a \u201cNedril\u201d. Participants make responses by pressing either the left or right arrow key corresponding to the monster category. This task will contain 32 trials where after making a response, the participant will be told whether they were correct or incorrect. Each monster will appear on the screen for 30 seconds and at this time, the participants have to make their response. The monster will remain on the screen for an additional 1 second so that the participants have a chance to look over the features. \n\nThe second task will be feature inference and consist of 14 two alternative forced-choice trials. The monster will appear on the screen for 30 seconds and will be covered by an object (i.e. a cloud, brick wall, etc.) Only one feature of the monster will be visible to the participant. Two choices of the matching feature will be displayed on the bottom of the screen and participants must choose which feature they think corresponds to the feature seen on the monster. This judgement will be based on what the participant learned about the monster categories in the learning phase. There is a total of 4 correlations trials with correct answers, and 10 control trials with no right or wrong answer. This was done to alleviate any carry-over effects from the previous trial, as well as, allow for more trials in this phase.\n\nThe study will end with a thank you slide, and participants will be given credit for participation."}}}, "planned-sample": {"value": {"question4b": {"extra": [], "value": "The participants must be between the ages of 4- to 9-years old.

The stimuli vary along four binary feature dimensions: type of horns, type of arms, type of marks, and type of eyes. The category structure consists of (a) one diagnostic feature that separates the two categories (the horns); (b) one feature equally distributed across both categories (the eyes); and (c) two features assigned into a pair of correlated features and equally distributed across both categories (the arms and the marks). Correlated feature pairs are feature dimensions that always occur together, regardless of category membership.

The monster will remain on the screen for an additional 1 second so that the participants have a chance to look over the features. \n\nThe second task will be feature inference and consist of 14 two alternative forced-choice trials. The monster will appear on the screen for 30 seconds and will be covered by an object (i.e. a cloud, brick wall, etc.) Only one feature of the monster will be visible to the participant. Two choices of the matching feature will be displayed on the bottom of the screen and participants must choose which feature they think corresponds to the feature seen on the monster. This judgement will be based on what the participant learned about the monster categories in the learning phase. There is a total of 4 correlations trials with correct answers, and 10 control trials with no right or wrong answer.
