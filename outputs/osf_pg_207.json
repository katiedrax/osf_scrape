Women continue to be discriminated against and treated with prejudice. For example, women are judged based on appearances rather than their accomplishments, and their achievements are not attributed to their abilities. In general, fellow students and professors pay more attention to men than women when they speak, and men often interrupt or talk over women or over-explain things to women as if women have no understanding of the issue.

In general, colleges create special scholarships for women and encourage employers to include female candidates when recruiting for jobs. Another example is the elimination of some of the most commonly played sports by men on college campuses as a result of Title IX. Men are also held to a different standard than women.

Women and men are being supported equally on campus. For example, colleges spend money supporting programs for both women and men, and the number of women and men have become more similar within a range of majors and disciplines. Women and men are also treated more equally by both students and professors. For example, the achievements of both women and men are attributed to their abilities.

In the female condition, the high identity threat condition reads:\n\nDespite efforts, gender equality \u2013 equal status between men and women \u2013 has not been achieved at universities.\n\nSexist behavior on college campuses continues to exist by both students and professors. Women continue to be discriminated against and treated with prejudice. For example, women are judged based on appearances rather than their accomplishments, and their achievements are not attributed to their abilities. In general, fellow students and professors pay more attention to men than women when they speak, and men often interrupt or talk over women or over-explain things to women as if women have no understanding of the issue. Women are also the target of sexist remarks and jokes. For example, women who take a leadership role or are assertive are called \u201ctoo bossy\u201d. In general, women are conceptualized as weak, delicate, incompetent, and therefore inferior to men.\n\nIn the male condition, the high identity threat condition reads:\n\nIn recent years, the discrimination against men has grown in universities.\n\nMen are being discriminated against on college campuses. Colleges spend money supporting Women\u2019s Studies programs and encouraging women to study STEM disciplines but no money is spent to support Men\u2019s Studies programs or encourage men to study majors predominantly studied by women. In general, colleges create special scholarships for women and encourage employers to include female candidates when recruiting for jobs. Another example is the elimination of some of the most commonly played sports by men on college campuses as a result of Title IX. Men are also held to a different standard than women. For example, men are treated more harshly in campus disciplinary actions and are often denied rights provided to all Americans off campus. In general, men are at a disadvantage at universities.\n\nFor both the female and male condition, the no threat condition reads:\n\nAfter years of effort, gender equality \u2013 equal status between men and women \u2013 has improved at universities.\n\nThere is an equal number of women and men enrolled on college campuses. Women and men are being supported equally on campus. For example, colleges spend money supporting programs for both women and men, and the number of women and men have become more similar within a range of majors and disciplines. Women and men are also treated more equally by both students and professors. For example, the achievements of both women and men are attributed to their abilities.
