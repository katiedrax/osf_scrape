Briefly, we have two main outcome measures, each an index measure constructed from several survey questions: we label these our \u201cpolitical efficacy\u201d and \u201ceconomic pessimism\u201d measures, and their construction is described in the PAP. For each of these two outcomes, we run two different tests, each of them a difference-in-differences setup. For political efficacy, for example, we want to compare the over-time changes (before-after minimum wage increase) in political efficacy among people who are and are not affected by the minimum wage increase. We set up this simple difference-in-differences design (in regression terms, predicting the outcome measure with a dummy for whether the person is part of the group affected by the wage increase, a dummy for whether it is after the wage increase takes place, and the interaction between the two) using two different comparison groups. First, we compare our affected group (people in Massachusetts who earn between $11 and $12/hour before the minimum wage increase) to other people in the same state who are not affected by the minimum wage increase, because they already earned more than the new minimum wage (people in Massachusetts who earn between $12 and $15/hour). But because we worry that this comparison could understate the effect of the policy on minimum-wage workers\u2019 attitudes if above-minimum-wage workers also notice and draw political conclusions from the wage increase, we then do a second test with a different comparison group. This time, we set up the same diff-in-diff, comparing affected workers in MA to low-wage workers in neighboring Connecticut, which did not increase its minimum wage in 2019. We then run the same two diff-in-diff analyses (comparing across earnings and across geography) for our other outcome measure, economic pessimism. These four tests constitute our main analyses, testing our two main hypotheses. As noted above, there is also a small experimental manipulation embedded in the second wave of the survey. We will check whether the location of the priming question within the survey changed respondents\u2019 answers by calculating the difference in means between people who saw the question early in the survey and those who saw it at the end of the survey (focusing on people affected by the minimum wage increase, so people in Massachusetts making under $12/hour at baseline).

will be different among young voters (under age 45). o H0: No change in treatment effects o Applied to each treatment individually and pooled treatment average o Applied to each outcome: overall turnout, temporal pattern of returns, and ballot return method o Two-tailed hypothesis, but increase expected based on proposition that higher education funding is more salient to young voters - H8: (Heterogeneity across observational covariate \u2013 blocked randomization) Treatment effects will be different among voters who cast ballots in the May 2017 municipal election. o H0: No change in treatment effects o Applied to each treatment individually and pooled treatment average o Applied to each outcome: overall turnout, temporal pattern of returns, and ballot return method o Two-tailed hypothesis \u2022 It may be easier to mobilize those who participated in recent local election because of habituation to voting \u2022 It may be more difficult to increase turnout among those who participated in recent local election because of fatigue and/or turnout in low profile elections is influenced by salience of specific contests on ballot - H9: (Heterogeneity across observational

individually and pooled treatment average o Applied to each outcome: overall turnout, temporal pattern of returns, and ballot return method o Two-tailed hypothesis \u2022 It may be easier to mobilize those who reside in overlapping K-12 school district because of shared issue salience (May ballot had very large Portland K-12 school funding measure similar to PCC measure) \u2022 It may be more difficult to increase turnout among those who reside in overlapping K-12 school district because of issue fatigue (see note above about May ballot) - H10: (Heterogeneity across observational covariate \u2013 blocked randomization) Treatment effects will be larger among voters who have stronger ties to Portland area (operationalized by Portland area code for mobile phon", "q17": "- Hypothesis testing will be done using randomization inference procedure o Re-randomization procedure in original randomization undermines the assumptions used in classical hypothesis testing, so randomization inference is necessary o Randomization inference will use the same re-randomization process for each iteration as was used in original random assignment - Regression for estimating effects within randomization inference o Regression of post treatment measures on dummies for treatment conditions, with control group omitted as the reference point o OLS to examine differences in the data \u2022 Not logit/probit because this compares \u201ctypical case\u201d rather than means within each group. o Heterogeneous treatment effects assessed with interaction terms between treatment dummies and each covariate where heterogeneity is expected (see Hypotheses) - Multi-voter households o Each analysis will be conducted among all households and among households with only a single target o Multi-target households may produce \u201cnoisy\u201d results because: \u2022 Multi-target households may be an indication of poor data quality, especially out-of-date information \u2022 Multi-target households distort treatment effect due to violation of SUTVA assumption within households - Covariates o All outcomes will be reported using regressions with and without covariates \u2022 Main text will report estimates without covariates based on evidence of balanced assignment (i.e. re-randomization procedure) and large N of experiment o Covariates are the same as those used in the

Specifically, it argues that descriptive ethnic representation is a non-material benefit that \u2013 when provided \u2013 can create slack for the poor delivery of public goods and services by a coethnic politician. Descriptive representation is valuable because of the respect, recognition, and status it is felt to bestow upon members of the ethnic group. Some subpopulations within the ethnic group hold a higher demand for descriptive representation than others, and are therefore more likely to trade-off good governance with the symbolic provision of status and recognition. This approach to ethnic voting differs from both instrumental views and social identification views in the extant political science literature. Unlike instrumental views, it does not see ethnicity as simply a signal for performance or patronage \u2013 which would imply that ethnic voting would not exist in the presence of full information on these variables. Unlike social identification views, it does not claim that voters do not care about performance or patronage and are concerned only with affirming their ethnic identities. Unlike both, it attempts to systematically characterize variation within ethnic groups in how much each type of concern matters. It expects that certain subpopulations weigh identity concerns more than others, and may therefore be willing to accept poor performance by co-ethnic politicians on the material front."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Main Effect (H1): The likelihood that a voter will vote to re-elect an incumbent increases if the incumbent provides descriptive representation, regardless of whether the incumbent has provided poor or good governance while in office.

Specifically, it argues that descriptive ethnic representation is a non-material benefit that \u2013 when provided \u2013 can create slack for the poor delivery of public goods and services by a coethnic politician. Descriptive representation is valuable because of the respect, recognition, and status it is felt to bestow upon members of the ethnic group. Some subpopulations within the ethnic group hold a higher demand for descriptive representation than others, and are therefore more likely to trade-off good governance with the symbolic provision of status and recognition. This approach to ethnic voting differs from both instrumental views and social identification views in the extant political science literature. Unlike instrumental views, it does not see ethnicity as simply a signal for performance or patronage \u2013 which would imply that ethnic voting would not exist in the presence of full information on these variables. Unlike social identification views, it does not claim that voters do not care about performance or patronage and are concerned only with affirming their ethnic identities. Unlike both, it attempts to systematically characterize variation within ethnic groups in how much each type of concern matters. It expects that certain subpopulations weigh identity concerns more than others, and may therefore be willing to accept poor performance by co-ethnic politicians on the material front.", "q16": "Main Effect (H1): The likelihood that a voter will vote to re-elect an incumbent increases if the incumbent provides descriptive representation, regardless of whether the incumbent has provided poor or good governance while in office.

has been paid to rule compliance. How can managers get employees to comply with organizational rules? This management question applies across sectors\u2014for-profit, nonprofit, and government, but is especially important in the public sector. Rules are in place to limit the discretion of street-level bureaucrats to ensure all citizens are treated fairly and equally (Bozeman & Scott, 1996; Scott, 1997). In response to calls for research to examine how external stakeholders are examined by rules (Pandey, Pandey, & Van Ryzin, 2017), our study focuses on prosocial rule breaking for both an internal and external stakeholder. Formalization, the degree to which organizational policies and procedures are written (Pugh et al., 1963), is a key attribute for effective rules (DeHart-Davis, 2017). We examine whether formal, written rules are more likely to be followed than more informal, unwritten rules. Since a person inherently conveys the rule, we also examine how the gender of the manager influences rule following. This study contributes to research on street-level bureaucrats and prosocial rule bending. Theories on street level bureaucrats center on street level bureaucrats\u2019 discretion to interpret and enact organizational rules (Lipsky, 1980; Maynard-Moody & Musheno, 2003). We focus on the citizen-agent perspective (Maynard-Moody & Musheno, 2003), where street level bureaucrats make a judgement about the citizen and use their discretion to use organizational rules as they see fit. Bureaucrats will rigidly apply the rules to citizens viewed as underserving, whereas they will bend the rules for citizens viewed as deserving. Rules may be bent or broken for both self-serving and prosocial motives. Although rules are more likely to be bent to help others rather than out of self-interest (DeHart Davis, 2017). Prosocial rule breaking: is when \u201can employee intentionally violates a formal organizational policy, regulation, or prohibition with the primary intention of promoting the welfare of the organization or one of its stakeholders\u201d (Morrison, 2006, 10). O\u2019Leary\u2019s (2014) studies on government guerillas provide examples of this. Rule bending can be beneficial for organizations (Brockmann, 2015). Realatedly, Borry (2017) found rule bending to be more prevalent where the ethical climate emphasizes the organization\u2019s interest. Contributing to research on representative bureaucracy, we also examine whether who gives the rules matters. Researchers have linked passive representation, the mere presence of diverse groups in the bureaucracy, to active representation, where government employees help advance the social groups they represent (Mosher, 1968). For example, Marvel (2015) found female teachers with female principals are more likely to work overtime. However, the influence of gender congruence on rule following has yet to be examined. We employ an experiment to advance our understanding of rule formalization and representative bureaucracy on rule following and breaking. Using a MTurk survey experiment, we test two scenarios. In the first, a middle manager is given a written or unwritten rule to suspend a very good employee without pay for a week for being late to work multiple times in a pay period. In the second, a frontline employee at a large foundation is asked whether they would accept a grant application from a nonprofit organization that provides after-school care for disadvantaged youth that was submitted an hour after the deadline, which would break the rule that all grants must be received by 5pm. For both scenarios, we vary the gender of the manager giving the rule, both written and unwritten. For the unwritten rules, we use audio clips of male and female computer generated voices reading the written rules. We examine how choice architecture of government rules, such as formalization, and gender congruence influence rule following. Both our scenarios place the respondent in a potential prosocial rule breaking scenario, where respondents could break the rule to help a good employee or a nonprofit organization that may be viewed as deserving. We hope to shed light on theories of formalization and representative bureaucracy as well as growing research on prosocial rule breaking for internal and external stakeholders."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Our first hypothesis is that written rules have greater compliance.

This second hypothesis may also be tested in terms of gender match or no gender match and the appropriate statistical test in this case is a proportional difference test. The final test is an interaction and, thus, we will need to use a multivariate statistical technique, which will likely be binary logistic regression. Two-way ANOVA could be used to test the interaction but the assumptions of ANOVA are slightly violated by our dichotomous compliance variable. However, the use of ANOVA with dichotomous variables is used in some contexts. If the two way ANOVA analysis supports the hypothesis and doesn't contradict the findings from the logistic regression then this will be the test that is reported in the final write-up.
