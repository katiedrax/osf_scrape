immigrants and asylum seekers? Xenophobic sentiment is on the rise in many western countries receiving large immigrant and refugee inflows, and there is increasing agreement that such sentiment seems to be motivated more by cultural than by economic factors. And yet, the demographic profile of the \u201crooted\u201d native population in both the US and Europe has itself to a large extent been shaped by immigration or forced relocation in the 20th century or earlier. How does this historical experience of forced relocation affect modern-day views of refugees from Syria? Our project attempts to answer this question in the context of Greece, a country that serves as an entry port to Europe for a large number of refugees today \u2014with almost 400,000 new asylum seekers arriving in the country between May 2015 and September 2015 (UNHCR 2016)\u2014 and whose present-day population composition was also significantly determined by a population exchange in the early 20th century. In 1923, after the defeat of the Greek army in the Greco-Turkish war of 1919\u20131922, Greece and the newly formed Republic of Turkey signed an international treaty agreeing to a compulsory exchange of populations.

A voluminous and influential literature points to the impact ethnicity \u2014 social identity based principally on shared descent \u2014 has on politics and the allocation of state resources. From social trust to provision of public services to civil war and genocide, ethnicity is found to powerfully structure a wide-range of political and economic processes. Understanding the factors that shaped these ethno-political divisions is an important line of inquiry in the study of political science and development economics. Until recently, there were few systematic studies into the origins of ethnic diversity. Over the last few years, however, a burgeoning literature has emerged on this subject. Ethnic fractionalization has been linked to variability in physical geography; migratory distance from the cradle of humankind and duration of human settlements; the effects of the slave trades; and a history of political centralization, or state antiquity. Less well understood is what causes the politicization of ethnicity, that is, why, among the socially-relevant ethnic groups in a given country, some groups or coalitions of groups are politically-active but not others. This represents a major gap in the literature. A growing body of research finds that, following from Posner (2004a, 854), important economic and political outcomes are best modeled focusing on \u201cthe groups that are actually doing the competing over policy\u201d \u2013 that is, among the politically- relevant ethnic groups \u2013 rather than among \u201cones that an ethnographer happens to identify as representing distinct cultural units.\u201d But without knowing the sources of the ethno-political configurations that structure politics this literature is vulnerable to serious selection problems. Most fundamentally, the factors causing group formation and politicization may also affect economic outcomes, obscuring the true effect of ethnic politics. Our study will address this gap in the literature and analyze the historical sources of Africa\u2019s ethno-political landscape."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "What are the origins of the ethnic landscapes that define contemporary states? In Africa, we argue the current ethnno-political configurations were shaped by the dual economic revolutions that swept across the continent in the 19th and 20th centuries: the spread of cash crop agriculture and the diffusion of printing and writing technologies. We propose that these economic changes transformed ethnicity via their effects on politicization and boundary-making. The adoption of print technologies is hypothesized to have increased groups\u2019 communication capabilities, while leading to more salient\u2014yet porous\u2014ethnic identities through an Andersonian process of imagined communities. Cash crop endowments are also hypothesized to have increased the salience of ethnicity and groups\u2019 mobilizational capabilities due to the occupation of a common economic niche and greater resource wealth, but with less porous boundaries due to a Weberian process of social closure. More specifically, we hypothesize that groups endowed with cash crops or print technologies during the colonial era are likely to be more politically-relevant in the post- independence period and their members are expected to have more salient ethnic identities, more homogeneous political preferences, and lower levels of trust and marriage with other ethnic groups. As a secondary hypothesis, we will test whether cash crops and printing caused differential effects on ethnic boundary-making and conflict. The commercialization of agriculture is hypothesized to have increased economic competition and social closure, leading to a legacy of less porous ethnic boundaries and more communal conflict. We expect the printing press had the opposite effect, contributing to more open ethnic boundaries and reducing the risk of ethnic conflict."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "To test the effect of these economic processes on ethnic politicization, we combine detailed historical data on cash crop production and the record of nearly all historical publications in African languages with contemporary ethnicity data. Following from Roessler et al. (2019), historical cash crop data is drawn from Hance, Kotschar and Peterec (1961). It identifies 9,517 geocoded production points valued at $289,270 per point, covering 9 groups of cash crops, 20 minerals and metals, and forest, animal and manufactured products. Publications data represents a novel dataset compiled from Rowling and Wilson (1923) and Mann and Sanders (1994). Together, these two sources cover approximately 10,000 titles in 370 distinct languages. To capture ethnic politicization, we employ group-level and individual-level measures. At the group-level, we use the Ethnic Power Relations (EPR) dataset (Vogt et al., 2015), which indicates the ethnic groups or coalitions that are competing for access to state power. To measure ethnic politicization at the individual level, we use survey data from Afrobarometer and the Demographic and Health Surveys that reflects expressed ethnic salience, inter-ethnic marriage and inter-ethnic trust, and the homogeneity of political preferences. To test potential heterogeneous effects of cash crops and print technologies on the openness of boundary-making, we will compare the relative effect sizes of the two economic variables on the social processes of inter-ethnic marriage and inter-ethnic trust. We also expect there to be different effects on local ethnic conflict. The exclusionary nature of ethnic boundaries brought about by cash crops, combined with heightened competition for land, should increase the relative risk of ethnic conflict compared to the inclusionary boundaries induced by the printing press. In our empirical models, our primary unit of analysis will be a given ethnic group identified in the Ethnologue database. Ethnologue aims to capture the complete universe of ethno-languages regardless of their social or political relevance, demographic size, or contemporary use (Simons and Fennig, 2017). Each ethnolinguistic group is uniquely identified with a given isocode and for the subsample of groups for which it is possible, they are also mapped. Additional data sources can thus be merged either spatially (using each group\u2019s location), or with the ethnic name. We will spatially match the historical cash crop data, as well as geographic characteristics that serve as controls. Using ethnolinguistic names, we match the publications data and the outcome measures of ethnic politicization and boundary-making. With the final dataset, we will then compare relative levels of the outcomes between groups treated by cash crops, groups treated by print technologies, groups treated by both, and \u201ccontrol groups\u201d that were not treated by either economic change. Following from Nunn and Wantchekon (2011), information on historical ethnic homelands and survey respondents\u2019 stated identities allows to separate ethnic \u201dstayers\u201d from ethnic \u201dmigrants\u201d, to distinguish location-specific effects from culturally transmitted traits that travel with those who move.

A voluminous and influential literature points to the impact ethnicity \u2014 social identity based principally on shared descent \u2014 has on politics and the allocation of state resources. From social trust to provision of public services to civil war and genocide, ethnicity is found to powerfully structure a wide-range of political and economic processes. Understanding the factors that shaped these ethno-political divisions is an important line of inquiry in the study of political science and development economics. Until recently, there were few systematic studies into the origins of ethnic diversity. Over the last few years, however, a burgeoning literature has emerged on this subject. Ethnic fractionalization has been linked to variability in physical geography; migratory distance from the cradle of humankind and duration of human settlements; the effects of the slave trades; and a history of political centralization, or state antiquity. Less well understood is what causes the politicization of ethnicity, that is, why, among the socially-relevant ethnic groups in a given country, some groups or coalitions of groups are politically-active but not others. This represents a major gap in the literature. A growing body of research finds that, following from Posner (2004a, 854), important economic and political outcomes are best modeled focusing on \u201cthe groups that are actually doing the competing over policy\u201d \u2013 that is, among the politically- relevant ethnic groups \u2013 rather than among \u201cones that an ethnographer happens to identify as representing distinct cultural units.\u201d But without knowing the sources of the ethno-political configurations that structure politics this literature is vulnerable to serious selection problems. Most fundamentally, the factors causing group formation and politicization may also affect economic outcomes, obscuring the true effect of ethnic politics. Our study will address this gap in the literature and analyze the historical sources of Africa\u2019s ethno-political landscape.", "q16": "What are the origins of the ethnic landscapes that define contemporary states? In Africa, we argue the current ethnno-political configurations were shaped by the dual economic revolutions that swept across the continent in the 19th and 20th centuries: the spread of cash crop agriculture and the diffusion of printing and writing technologies. We propose that these economic changes transformed ethnicity via their effects on politicization and boundary-making. The adoption of print technologies is hypothesized to have increased groups\u2019 communication capabilities, while leading to more salient\u2014yet porous\u2014ethnic identities through an Andersonian process of imagined communities. Cash crop endowments are also hypothesized to have increased the salience of ethnicity and groups\u2019 mobilizational capabilities due to the occupation of a common economic niche and greater resource wealth, but with less porous boundaries due to a Weberian process of social closure. More specifically, we hypothesize that groups endowed with cash crops or print technologies during the colonial era are likely to be more politically-relevant in the post- independence period and their members are expected to have more salient ethnic identities, more homogeneous political preferences, and lower levels of trust and marriage with other ethnic groups. As a secondary hypothesis, we will test whether cash crops and printing caused differential effects on ethnic boundary-making and conflict. The commercialization of agriculture is hypothesized to have increased economic competition and social closure, leading to a legacy of less porous ethnic boundaries and more communal conflict. We expect the printing press had the opposite effect, contributing to more open ethnic boundaries and reducing the risk of ethnic conflict.", "q17": "To test the effect of these economic processes on ethnic politicization, we combine detailed historical data on cash crop production and the record of nearly all historical publications in African languages with contemporary ethnicity data. Following from Roessler et al. (2019), historical cash crop data is drawn from Hance, Kotschar and Peterec (1961). It identifies 9,517 geocoded production points valued at $289,270 per point, covering 9 groups of cash crops, 20 minerals and metals, and forest, animal and manufactured products. Publications data represents a novel dataset compiled from Rowling and Wilson (1923) and Mann and Sanders (1994). Together, these two sources cover approximately 10,000 titles in 370 distinct languages. To capture ethnic politicization, we employ group-level and individual-level measures. At the group-level, we use the Ethnic Power Relations (EPR) dataset (Vogt et al., 2015), which indicates the ethnic groups or coalitions that are competing for access to state power. To measure ethnic politicization at the individual level, we use survey data from Afrobarometer and the Demographic and Health Surveys that reflects expressed ethnic salience, inter-ethnic marriage and inter-ethnic trust, and the homogeneity of political preferences. To test potential heterogeneous effects of cash crops and print technologies on the openness of boundary-making, we will compare the relative effect sizes of the two economic variables on the social processes of inter-ethnic marriage and inter-ethnic trust. We also expect there to be different effects on local ethnic conflict. The exclusionary nature of ethnic boundaries brought about by cash crops, combined with heightened competition for land, should increase the relative risk of ethnic conflict compared to the inclusionary boundaries induced by the printing press. In our empirical models, our primary unit of analysis will be a given ethnic group identified in the Ethnologue database. Ethnologue aims to capture the complete universe of ethno-languages regardless of their social or political relevance, demographic size, or contemporary use (Simons and Fennig, 2017). Each ethnolinguistic group is uniquely identified with a given isocode and for the subsample of groups for which it is possible, they are also mapped. Additional data sources can thus be merged either spatially (using each group\u2019s location), or with the ethnic name. We will spatially match the historical cash crop data, as well as geographic characteristics that serve as controls. Using ethnolinguistic names, we match the publications data and the outcome measures of ethnic politicization and boundary-making. With the final dataset, we will then compare relative levels of the outcomes between groups treated by cash crops, groups treated by print technologies, groups treated by both, and \u201ccontrol groups\u201d that were not treated by either economic change. Following from Nunn and Wantchekon (2011), information on historical ethnic homelands and survey respondents\u2019 stated identities allows to separate ethnic \u201dstayers\u201d from ethnic \u201dmigrants\u201d, to distinguish location-specific effects from culturally transmitted traits that travel with those who move.

What shape voters' attitudes towards redistribution and the state? In this study, we examine the repercussions of a large, visible, and programmatic housing policy on social and political attitudes. We expect that voters' attitudes towards incumbents and regarding social issues to change at different paces: we argue that the expectation of becoming a policy beneficiary shapes political attitudes, while the actuality of becoming a policy beneficiary affects social beliefs and political attitudes. We use the lotteries implemented in the city of Rio de Janeiro to allocate housing units to compare lottery winners and nonwinners' opinions on incumbents, political parties, state vs. market, redistribution, and the program's impact on beneficiaries' welfare. We survey lottery participants after they have won the lottery but before they have moved to their homes (late lottery) and participants that have already moved to their home for at least two years (early lottery).

First, we expect that lottery winners will have a higher evaluation of incumbents than lottery nonwinners even before winners move to their new home. Second, and related to that, we expect that lottery winners will show higher support for the president and the city government (not the state government). We expect that voters will credit politicians more closely related to the creation and implementation of the program. This is an important caveat given the current political instability and recent changes in the presidency in Brazil. Third, we expect lottery winners to have higher evaluations of the incumbents after they move to their new homes, but this support should decline with time. Fourth, we expect lottery winners to develop more pro-market and less pro-state attitudes after they move to their new homes, but we do not expect such changes before they move to their new homes.We based this hypothesis and all of our related predictions on previous work done by Di Tella, Galliani and Schargrodsky (2007) and de Janvry, Gonzalez-Navarro and Sadoulet (2014). Although we favor this interpretation, our subjects are receiving a good from a governmental program that is clearly labeled as such (based on our fieldwork). Thus, their preferences towards the state may not change at all (because of the cross-pressures from becoming a de facto homeowner and a government beneficiary) or they may even move in the opposite direction, and develop more pro-state preferences. We break down these four general hypotheses into several predictions which we list in our pre-analysis plan.

What shape voters' attitudes towards redistribution and the state? In this study, we examine the repercussions of a large, visible, and programmatic housing policy on social and political attitudes. We expect that voters' attitudes towards incumbents and regarding social issues to change at different paces: we argue that the expectation of becoming a policy beneficiary shapes political attitudes, while the actuality of becoming a policy beneficiary affects social beliefs and political attitudes. We use the lotteries implemented in the city of Rio de Janeiro to allocate housing units to compare lottery winners and nonwinners' opinions on incumbents, political parties, state vs. market, redistribution, and the program's impact on beneficiaries' welfare. We survey lottery participants after they have won the lottery but before they have moved to their homes (late lottery) and participants that have already moved to their home for at least two years (early lottery). We also examine this program's impact on social welfare using administrative data.", "q16": "We are examining four main hypotheses. First, we expect that lottery winners will have a higher evaluation of incumbents than lottery nonwinners even before winners move to their new home. Second, and related to that, we expect that lottery winners will show higher support for the president and the city government (not the state government). We expect that voters will credit politicians more closely related to the creation and implementation of the program. This is an important caveat given the current political instability and recent changes in the presidency in Brazil. Third, we expect lottery winners to have higher evaluations of the incumbents after they move to their new homes, but this support should decline with time. Fourth, we expect lottery winners to develop more pro-market and less pro-state attitudes after they move to their new homes, but we do not expect such changes before they move to their new homes.We based this hypothesis and all of our related predictions on previous work done by Di Tella, Galliani and Schargrodsky (2007) and de Janvry, Gonzalez-Navarro and Sadoulet (2014). Although we favor this interpretation, our subjects are receiving a good from a governmental program that is clearly labeled as such (based on our fieldwork). Thus, their preferences towards the state may not change at all (because of the cross-pressures from becoming a de facto homeowner and a government beneficiary) or they may even move in the opposite direction, and develop more pro-state preferences. We break down these four general hypotheses into several predictions which we list in our pre-analysis plan. We also expect heterogeneous treatment effects on participants' welfare based on the location of the housing projects (relative to downtown) and on political opinions based whether or not they receive other governmental benefits (such as Bolsa Fam\u00edlia).", "q17": "We will conduct two surveys (early and late lotteries) and an analysis of administrative data using a list of all lottery participants (winners and nonwinners) that we compiled using public data from the city's housing agency.
