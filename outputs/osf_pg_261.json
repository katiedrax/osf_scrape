However, debate has emerged on the extent to which Bayesian analysis can and should be formalized in qualitative research.

Advocates argue that formalization can improve analytic transparency, eliminate ambiguity inherent in common language used to describe probabilities, better locate disagreements over interpretation of evidence, and make our reasoning more systematic (Bennett 2015, Humphreys and Jacobs 2015, Rohlfing 2013).

In light of this debate, a fundamental and conceptually prior question should be addressed: does training in Bayesian reasoning change how scholars evaluate evidence and assess alternative hypotheses in qualitative case research? Would scholars reach different conclusions given a body of evidence depending on whether they reason informally about which hypothesis provides the best explanation, as is most often done in qualitative research, or instead endeavor to evaluate the relative likelihood of the evidence under one hypothesis compared to a rival, and then update their prior degrees of belief in those hypotheses using Bayes\u2019 theorem?

The WOE indicates how to update log-odds for the two hypotheses in light of the evidence. The WOE can be elicited explicitly on the post-test for treatment-group students who have received training in Bayesian probability, and indirectly on the pre-tests and control group post-test. Our experimental hypotheses are as follows: H1: Bayesian training should lead students to evaluate evidence differently than students in the control group, such that (post-test WOE \u2013 pre-test WOE) should differ on average for the treatment and control groups. H2: Bayesian training should lead students to report weights of evidence that are closer to the investigators\u2019 expert assessments of reasonable conclusions for each case scenario on the post-test. H3a: Bayesian training should help build inter-personal consensus on weights of evidence, such that the variance in the post-test WOE is smaller for the treatment group compared to the control group. H3b: A regression of post-test WOE plotted against pre-test WOE should tend toward a horizontal line for the treatment group, as they come to a reasonable consensus despite pre-treatment differences, while the control group should tend closer to a 45 degree line reflecting that they remain more \u201cset in their ways\u201d or have had their thinking less changed by the non-Bayesian training.

The treatment group will receive approximately 4 hours of training in Bayesian probability and applications to case study research, plus overnight homework exercises, while the control group will receive an equivalent amount of non-Bayesian process-tracing training. We will look for differences in inferences across the treatment and control groups. In addition, all participants will be randomly assigned to one of two sub-groups, which will receive different versions of the pre-test. These pre-tests will differ only in the order of the pieces of evidence presented for one of the two case scenarios. Because we are interested in the possible effects of Bayesian training, it is natural to adopt and apply Bayesian analysis to assess these hypotheses, in addition to employing more standard frequentist statistical methodology.

We have designed an experiment that will begin to address these questions, to be conducted in the summer of 2016 with roughly 80 political science graduate students.", "q16": "The primary variable of interest is the Weight of Evidence (WOE), which is proportional to log [ P ( E | H1 ) / P ( E | H2 ) ] for a particular piece of information E given two rival hypotheses H1 and H2. The WOE indicates how to update log-odds for the two hypotheses in light of the evidence. The WOE can be elicited explicitly on the post-test for treatment-group students who have received training in Bayesian probability, and indirectly on the pre-tests and control group post-test. Our experimental hypotheses are as follows: H1: Bayesian training should lead students to evaluate evidence differently than students in the control group, such that (post-test WOE \u2013 pre-test WOE) should differ on average for the treatment and control groups. H2: Bayesian training should lead students to report weights of evidence that are closer to the investigators\u2019 expert assessments of reasonable conclusions for each case scenario on the post-test. H3a: Bayesian training should help build inter-personal consensus on weights of evidence, such that the variance in the post-test WOE is smaller for the treatment group compared to the control group. H3b: A regression of post-test WOE plotted against pre-test WOE should tend toward a horizontal line for the treatment group, as they come to a reasonable consensus despite pre-treatment differences, while the control group should tend closer to a 45 degree line reflecting that they remain more \u201cset in their ways\u201d or have had their thinking less changed by the non-Bayesian training. H4: The order in which pieces of evidence are presented on the pre-test should matter for how students evaluate the evidence, such that the mean aggregate WOE will differ between the two groups.", "q17": "Participants will be divided into a treatment group (to receive Bayesian training) and control group (to receive non-Bayesian training) via blocked random assignment, based on results from a brief preliminary survey that assesses overall educational attainment as well as experience with mathematics and statistics courses. The treatment group will receive approximately 4 hours of training in Bayesian probability and applications to case study research, plus overnight homework exercises, while the control group will receive an equivalent amount of non-Bayesian process-tracing training. We will look for differences in inferences across the treatment and control groups. In addition, all participants will be randomly assigned to one of two sub-groups, which will receive different versions of the pre-test. These pre-tests will differ only in the order of the pieces of evidence presented for one of the two case scenarios. Because we are interested in the possible effects of Bayesian training, it is natural to adopt and apply Bayesian analysis to assess these hypotheses, in addition to employing more standard frequentist statistical methodology. Bayesian methods enjoy a number of advantages, particularly when testing multiple hypotheses, but the attached pre-analysis plan focuses on the frequentist analysis.", "q18": "United States of

All data will be obtained from on-line self-report questionnaires. Based on a power analysis (see Data Analysis section below), the target sample size is approximately 85 emerging adults who identify as LGB and 85 emerging adults who identify as heterosexual. Data collection will continue until June 1, 2020 and all participants who meet study criteria who have completed the surveys will be included in the study, even if this number exceeds 85.

Participants who do not respond to every question or who do not complete the questionnaire in its entirety will be excluded from the study. In order to calculate the means and standard deviations of the variables, descriptive statistics will be utilized. The average level of psychological well-being, anxiety symptoms, worry symptoms and depression symptoms will be reported along with the standard deviation of each variable. A Pearson correlation will be utilized in order to test each hypothesis and the analyses conducted in order to determine if statistical test assumptions were met will include a visual inspection of the data to ensure a linear relation exists for all of the variables. Three multiple regression analyses will be conducted in order to examine the exploratory analyses. For the exploratory regression analyses, assumptions include examining collinearity to ensure there is not a strong correlation between active and passive use. The residuals will also be plotted in order to ensure that normal distribution occurs. If assumptions are violated, then a robust regression will be conducted, and bootstrapping will be adjusted for the coefficients.\nA power analysis was conducted to ascertain the number of participants needed to achieve a power level of .80, with an alpha level of .05 for small, medium, and large effect sizes.
