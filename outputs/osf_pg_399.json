These group memberships importantly raise self esteem by conferring a sense of pride or belonging but also cause individuals to categorize members and nonmembers of these groups (``us'' versus ``them'') \\citep{brewer1979}. A large body of social science research has demonstrated the effects of group identities on behaviors ranging from cooperation to ethnic conflict. Many football\\footnote{We use the term ``football'' throughout to refer to what Americans call ``soccer.''} supporters consider themselves to be part of the professional clubs they support and derive some of their sense of who they are from their connection to these clubs. Social identity theory suggests that this identity may be important for behaviors outside the context of football. \\textbf{The study we describe here explores whether affinity for one's favorite club can be used as a mobilization tool in national and supranational elections.} We are collaborating with a football live score app, \\textit{Forza Football}, to conduct this study. The basic idea of our experiment is simple: we randomly assign two types of advertisements on the app that both ask users in six countries to vote in the upcoming EU election. Our treatment appealed to their club identity by suggesting that other supporters of their favorite club would be participating in the election."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "[H1] Compared to the control condition, the treatment will lead to higher levels of intended voting.

[H4] The effect of the treatment (a higher level of intended voting) will be stronger among users with a strong self-reported (in the survey) club affinity compared to those with a weak club affinity. We have a number of secondary hypotheses described in the preanalysis plan."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "For the analysis of H1 we will run an OLS regression on the pooled data from all six countries. We will include the following covariates: the device a user saw the message on (Apple iPhone, Apple iPad, or Samsung Android); the day they saw the advertisement (May 25 or 26); and country fixed effects.

A large body of social science research has demonstrated the effects of group identities on behaviors ranging from cooperation to ethnic conflict. Many football\\footnote{We use the term ``football'' throughout to refer to what Americans call ``soccer.''} supporters consider themselves to be part of the professional clubs they support and derive some of their sense of who they are from their connection to these clubs. Social identity theory suggests that this identity may be important for behaviors outside the context of football. \\textbf{The study we describe here explores whether affinity for one's favorite club can be used as a mobilization tool in national and supranational elections.} We are collaborating with a football live score app, \\textit{Forza Football}, to conduct this study.

This might be a neglected component of the variation in support for these parties within European countries. In this study we want to trace the Francoist legacies in the vote for the emerging radical right party in Spain, Vox. We will use the April 29 2019 general election data at the local level, and we will assess to what extent the geography of support for Vox can be traced back to the geography of francoism in Spain.", "q16": "1. We expect latent Francoist preferences to have an unconditional positive effect on the percentage of votes obtained by VOX in the 2019 Spanish General Elections. 2. We also expect that an informational shock (originated by the exposure of the electoral results in Andalusia after its regional elections) should activate the latent Francoist preferences. As such, we expect that the exposure of the results will moderate the effect of Francoist preferences and we plan to test this hypothesis with individual-level data from surveys. 3. We also expect what we define as a replacement mechanism. Specifically, we expect that negative valence shocks on the conservative party (due to corruption scandals) should favors the rise of the radical right (Vox), especially where the latent preferences are Francoist. 4. We also expect an unconditional effect of unemployment shocks (after the 2008 economic crsis) and immigra- tion increases at the municipality-level on the electoral results obtained by VOX. 5. Finally, we expect a conditional effect of immigration growth and unemployment growth. Specifically, we expect that latent Francoist preferences will be moderated by both unemployment shocks and immigration increases.", "q17": "In order to test our hypothesis we plan to estimate a set of models exploiting geographical variation in the electoral results obtained by a specific-party, VOX, in the General Spanish Elections to be held on Sunday 28th of April, 2019. More specifically, we plan to analyze the percentage of votes obtained by VOX at the municipality-level (in study 2), whereas in study 2 we will exploit two individual-level surveys (CIS Surveys 3231 and 3234) to estimate at the individual-level the effects of the release of the electoral results in a pseudo-UESD design.

"Candidate debates are often important, and highly publicized, campaign events. Increasingly, governmental and non-governmental organizations are organizing them in new democracies around the world, with the goals of increasing voter knowledge and access to information about policy platforms and promises, promoting policy-based campaigning and voting (as opposed to clientelistic or identity based campaigning and voting), and enhancing political tolerance.

To address this question, this project will conduct an experiment around presidential candidate debates organized in advance of Malawi's May 2019 elections."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Family A: Hypotheses on vote choice and candidate evaluations HA1: On average, voters exposed to debates will become more supportive of (or more likely to vote for) the three candidates that participated in the debates. HA2: On average, voters exposed to debates will become less supportive of (or less likely to vote for) the incumbent president, who chose not to participate in the debates. -- The effects predicted above will be less pronounced among strong supporters of the president's party (DPP): DPP supporters will punish the president less for not appearing in the debates and will not reward the challengers as much for participating -- Will also test HA1 and HA2 separately for swing versus partisan voters HA3: Voting across party lines: Debates make partisan voters more supportive of (or more likely to vote for) candidates from different political parties. HA4: Voting across ethno-regional lines: Debates make voters more supportive of (or more likely to vote for) candidates that are associated with different ethno-regional groups. HA5: Debate Performance: Participants will become more supportive of (or likely to vote for) candidates that perform well in the debate. -- Will test whether effects above are different for partisans versus swing/independent voters. -- If there is variation in performance ratings across the three different policy segment conditions, will also use this random source of variation in performance to test this hypothesis. HA6: Debate Performance + Priors: -- When candidates perform better than the voter expected them to before the debate, the debates increase support for that candidate. -- When candidates perform worse than the voter expected them to before the debate, the debates decrease support for that candidate. -- Will test whether effects above are different for partisans versus swing/independent voters. -- If there is variation in performance ratings across the three different policy segment conditions, will also use this random source of variation in performance to test this hypothesis. HA7: Policy importance: When participants are randomly assigned to view a policy segment in the policy area most important to them, the impact of debates (as predicted above) will be larger than when the participant is randomly assigned to view a policy segment that is less important to them. -- Will test whether effects above are different for partisans versus swing/independent voters. Family B: Hypotheses related to causal mechanisms HB1: The impact of debates will be greater for participants who report learning a lot about candidates' policy positions HB2: Debates impact perceptions about the strength of candidates' policy positions. HB3: Debates make voters more confident that they understand candidate policy positions. HB4: Debates improve voter knowledge of candidate policy positions. HB5: Debates increase the chances that voters vote for candidates that share their policy preferences. HB6: The impact of debates will be greater for participants who report learning a lot about candidates' quality (qualifications and trustworthiness) HB7: Debates impact perceptions about candidate quality (qualifications and trustworthiness). Family C: Hypotheses on additional outcomes HC1: Voter turnout: Voters exposed to the debates will be more likely to turnout to vote. HC2: Engagement: Voters exposed to the debates will be more engaged in the campaign and more likely to discuss politics with those in their family or social group. HC3: Efficacy: Voters exposed to the debates will have a greater sense that they are informed and understand politics, and that their vote is meaningful. HC4: Policy-based voting versus Identity or Clientelism: -- Voters exposed to the debates will be more likely to report that candidate/party policies or platforms were important in determining their vote. -- Voters exposed to the debates will be less likely to report that identity or handouts (clientelism) were important in determining their vote HC5: Tolerance: Debates enhance political tolerance and reduce fear of out-group candidates HC6: Legitimacy of the electoral process: Voters exposed to the debates will have more positive perceptions of the legitimacy and quality of the electoral and democratic process in Malawi. Family D: Community-Level Hypotheses and Persistence of Effects HD1: The effects of debates will persist more strongly when voters live in electorally competitive districts HD2: The effects of debates will persist more strongly when voters have partisan diverse social networks.

Increasingly, governmental and non-governmental organizations are organizing them in new democracies around the world, with the goals of increasing voter knowledge and access to information about policy platforms and promises, promoting policy-based campaigning and voting (as opposed to clientelistic or identity based campaigning and voting), and enhancing political tolerance. Do candidate debates achieve these goals? To address this question, this project will conduct an experiment around presidential candidate debates organized in advance of Malawi's May 2019 elections.", "q16": "Family A: Hypotheses on vote choice and candidate evaluations HA1: On average, voters exposed to debates will become more supportive of (or more likely to vote for) the three candidates that participated in the debates. HA2: On average, voters exposed to debates will become less supportive of (or less likely to vote for) the incumbent president, who chose not to participate in the debates. -- The effects predicted above will be less pronounced among strong supporters of the president's party (DPP): DPP supporters will punish the president less for not appearing in the debates and will not reward the challengers as much for participating -- Will also test HA1 and HA2 separately for swing versus partisan voters HA3: Voting across party lines: Debates make partisan voters more supportive of (or more likely to vote for) candidates from different political parties. HA4: Voting across ethno-regional lines: Debates make voters more supportive of (or more likely to vote for) candidates that are associated with different ethno-regional groups. HA5: Debate Performance: Participants will become more supportive of (or likely to vote for) candidates that perform well in the debate. -- Will test whether effects above are different for partisans versus swing/independent voters. -- If there is variation in performance ratings across the three different policy segment conditions, will also use this random source of variation in performance to test this hypothesis. HA6: Debate Performance + Priors: -- When candidates perform better than the voter expected them to before the debate, the debates increase support for that candidate. -- When candidates perform worse than the voter expected them to before the debate, the debates decrease support for that candidate. -- Will test whether effects above are different for partisans versus swing/independent voters. -- If there is variation in performance ratings across the three different policy segment conditions, will also use this random source of variation in performance to test this hypothesis. HA7: Policy importance: When participants are randomly assigned to view a policy segment in the policy area most important to them, the impact of debates (as predicted above) will be larger than when the participant is randomly assigned to view a policy segment that is less important to them. -- Will test whether effects above are different for partisans versus swing/independent voters. Family B: Hypotheses related to causal mechanisms HB1: The impact of debates will be greater for participants who report learning a lot about candidates' policy positions HB2: Debates impact perceptions about the strength of candidates' policy positions. HB3: Debates make voters more confident that they understand candidate policy positions. HB4: Debates improve voter knowledge of candidate policy positions. HB5: Debates increase the chances that voters vote for candidates that share their policy preferences. HB6: The impact of debates will be greater for participants who report learning a lot about candidates' quality (qualifications and trustworthiness) HB7: Debates impact perceptions about candidate quality (qualifications and trustworthiness). Family C: Hypotheses on additional outcomes HC1: Voter turnout: Voters exposed to the debates will be more likely to turnout to vote. HC2: Engagement: Voters exposed to the debates will be more engaged in the campaign and more likely to discuss politics with those in their family or social group. HC3: Efficacy: Voters exposed to the debates will have a greater sense that they are informed and understand politics, and that their vote is meaningful. HC4: Policy-based voting versus Identity or Clientelism: -- Voters exposed to the debates will be more likely to report that candidate/party policies or platforms were important in determining their vote. -- Voters exposed to the debates will be less likely to report that identity or handouts (clientelism) were important in determining their vote HC5: Tolerance: Debates enhance political tolerance and reduce fear of out-group candidates HC6: Legitimacy of the electoral process: Voters exposed to the debates will have more positive perceptions of the legitimacy and quality of the electoral and democratic process in Malawi. Family D: Community-Level Hypotheses and Persistence of Effects HD1: The effects of debates will persist more strongly when voters live in electorally competitive districts HD2: The effects of debates will persist more strongly when voters have partisan diverse social networks. HD3: The effects of debates will persist more strongly when voters live in ethnically diverse enumeration areas. HD4: Effect of debates will dissipate most when voters live in a census enumeration area where the majority of the population is a coethnic of one of the main presidential candidates.", "q17": "I am conducting a panel survey with 1,500 Malawians sampled from 12 districts across the country.
