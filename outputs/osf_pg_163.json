While early migration reports migration as circular, it has since become more permanent and many Pacific Islanders are permanently emigrating from their islands (1). \n\nMost health information available homogenises Pacific people into one group, and much less has evaluated Pacific-specific health. The life expectancy of Pacific peoples is at least 6 years lower than that for all people living in New Zealand combined (2). CVD is the major cause of this difference, as (with diabetes) it is the major cause of amenable mortality among Pacific peoples. The amenable mortality rate from CVD among Pacific men is 2.5 times the rate of NZ men, and for Pacific women is 3.2 times the rate of NZ women (2). Despite overall reductions in the morbidity and mortality of CVD in New Zealand since the 1980s, Pacific peoples continue to experience a disproportionately high burden of CVD compared with Europeans (3). \n\nPacific peoples are exposed to greater levels of CVD risk factors, such as smoking (men only), diabetes, diastolic blood pressure and ratios of total cholesterol to high density lipoprotein cholesterol (women only) (3). After adjusting for multiple established CVD risk factors, in addition to deprivation, 5-year risk of a first CVD event was approximately 20% higher for Pacific peoples compared with Europeans (4). Pacific peoples in New Zealand comprise a heterogeneous population who identify with at least one of 12 nations originating from the Pacific Islands of Polynesia, Melanesia and Micronesia (5).\n\nAs with other data reported in New Zealand, data on CVD generally combines Pacific peoples into a single category, despite important differences between Pacific peoples in CVD risk profiles (5). In addition to self-identified ethnicity, there are important differences between New Zealand-born and migrant Pacific peoples, particularly in terms of the duration of their exposure to the New Zealand physical and social environment (6). \n\nA recent health needs analysis of Pacific peoples in metro Auckland, in which 71% of the New Zealand Pacific population resides, assessed Pacific health in Pacific-specific subgroups (7). The analysis found that the prevalence of ischemic heart disease and peripheral vascular disease were significantly higher among Cook Island Maori than among other Pacific-specific subgroups (7). The prevalence of stroke was higher in Samoan people and lower in Tongan people, compared with the overall prevalence of stroke in Pacific peoples (7).\n\nNo known reviews of the epidemiology and management of cardiovascular disease among Pacific people according to their Pacific-specific ethnicity and country of birth exist, despite evidence suggesting lower all-cause (and possibly cancer and CVD) mortality rates for Pacific migrants resident in NZ for less than 25 years relative to those resident for more than 25 years (8).

All identified studies and systematic reviews from each information source will be exported into separate Endnote libraries.\n\nAll studies and systematic reviews will then be exported from Endnote into Covidence, a web-based software platform that streamlines the production of systematic reviews and facilitates collaboration among reviewers to support more efficient production of systematic reviews. At importation, de-duplication of study citations is automatic with an option of manual override. The PRISMA flow diagram is automatically populated through Covidence and will be used to depict information through the different phases of the systematic review.\n\nPrior to the formal screening process, the screening questions will be piloted.\n\nSelection process\nJW and VS will independently screen the titles and abstracts yielded by the search against the inclusion criteria. Each study will be graded either eligible, not eligible, or might be eligible through the study title and abstract. Full reports will be obtained for all titles that appear to meet the inclusion criteria or where there is any disagreement between JW and VS. Reviewers will resolve disagreements by discussion, and MH or CG will adjudicate unresolved disagreements. Neither of the review authors will be blind to the journal titles or the study authors or institutions. \n\nData collection process\nJW and VS will independently extract data using a standardised form accessible through Covidence. To ensure consistency, we will pilot data extraction before beginning the data extraction. Data abstracted will include general information, study characteristics and participant characteristics. Reviewers will resolve disagreements by discussion, and MH or CG will adjudicate unresolved disagreements. We will contact study authors to resolve any uncertainties and to obtain additional data if needed.\n\nRisk of bias in individual studies\nRisk of bias for each included study and systematic review will be assessed by JW and VS using the relevant GATE (Graphic Appraisal Tools for Epidemiology) worksheet (https://www.fmhs.auckland.ac.nz/en/soph/about/our-departments/epidemiology-and-biostatistics/research/epiq/2017-evidence-based-practice-and-cats.html). \nReviewers will resolve disagreements by discussion, and MH or CG will adjudicate unresolved disagreements. \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Winter-Smith OSF preregistration 3 Mar 2020.pdf"}, "nodeId": "qda5v", "sha256": "767a4fd43e0545c2f6477c22e522fb8776fb7f5e7080d77523c09b5601c1c8ed", "viewUrl": "/project/r3u8e/files/osfstorage/5e5d7f1186b40d0044d049de/", "selectedFileName": "Winter-Smith OSF preregistration 3 Mar 2020.pdf"}], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "The systematic search should include all relevant publications in the field of Pacific subgroup cardiovascular disease.

All identified studies and systematic reviews from each information source will be exported into separate Endnote libraries.\n\nAll studies and systematic reviews will then be exported from Endnote into Covidence, a web-based software platform that streamlines the production of systematic reviews and facilitates collaboration among reviewers to support more efficient production of systematic reviews. At importation, de-duplication of study citations is automatic with an option of manual override. The PRISMA flow diagram is automatically populated through Covidence and will be used to depict information through the different phases of the systematic review.\n\nPrior to the formal screening process, the screening questions will be piloted.\n\nSelection process\nJW and VS will independently screen the titles and abstracts yielded by the search against the inclusion criteria. Each study will be graded either eligible, not eligible, or might be eligible through the study title and abstract. Full reports will be obtained for all titles that appear to meet the inclusion criteria or where there is any disagreement between JW and VS. Reviewers will resolve disagreements by discussion, and MH or CG will adjudicate unresolved disagreements. Neither of the review authors will be blind to the journal titles or the study authors or institutions. \n\nData collection process\nJW and VS will independently extract data using a standardised form accessible through Covidence. To ensure consistency, we will pilot data extraction before beginning the data extraction. Data abstracted will include general information, study characteristics and participant characteristics. Reviewers will resolve disagreements by discussion, and MH or CG will adjudicate unresolved disagreements. We will contact study authors to resolve any uncertainties and to obtain additional data if needed.\n\nRisk of bias in individual studies\nRisk of bias for each included study and systematic review will be assessed by JW and VS using the relevant GATE (Graphic Appraisal Tools for Epidemiology) worksheet (https://www.fmhs.auckland.ac.nz/en/soph/about/our-departments/epidemiology-and-biostatistics/research/epiq/2017-evidence-based-practice-and-cats.html). \nReviewers will resolve disagreements by discussion, and MH or CG will adjudicate unresolved disagreements. \n", "q12.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e5d7f1186b40d0044d049de", "file_name": "Winter-Smith OSF preregistration 3 Mar 2020.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/r3u8e/files/osfstorage/5e5d7f1186b40d0044d049de", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e5d7f1186b40d0044d049de"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "767a4fd43e0545c2f6477c22e522fb8776fb7f5e7080d77523c09b5601c1c8ed"}}], "q16.question": "N/A", "q16.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e5d7f1186b40d0044d049de", "file_name": "Winter-Smith OSF preregistration 3 Mar 2020.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/r3u8e/files/osfstorage/5e5d7f1186b40d0044d049de", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e5d7f1186b40d0044d049de"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "767a4fd43e0545c2f6477c22e522fb8776fb7f5e7080d77523c09b5601c1c8ed"}}], "q17.question": "Data extraction: Where available, the following data will be extracted:\n\na)\tGeneral information\na.\tAuthor\nb.\tArticle title\nc.\tYear\nd.\tCountry\nb)\tStudy characteristics\na.\tAims/objectives of study\nb.\tStudy design/type\nc.\tStudy inclusion/exclusion criteria\nd.\tRecruitment procedures and sample size\nc)\tParticipant characteristics\na.\tSample size\nb.\tEthnicity\nc.\tCountry of birth\nd)\tStudy results measured on outcome(s) listed in this preregistration\n", "q17.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e5d7f1186b40d0044d049de", "file_name": "Winter-Smith OSF preregistration 3 Mar 2020.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/r3u8e/files/osfstorage/5e5d7f1186b40d0044d049de", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e5d7f1186b40d0044d049de"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "767a4fd43e0545c2f6477c22e522fb8776fb7f5e7080d77523c09b5601c1c8ed"}}], "q18.question": "N/A", "q18.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e5d7f1186b40d0044d049de", "file_name": "Winter-Smith OSF preregistration 3 Mar 2020.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/r3u8e/files/osfstorage/5e5d7f1186b40d0044d049de", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e5d7f1186b40d0044d049de"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "767a4fd43e0545c2f6477c22e522fb8776fb7f5e7080d77523c09b5601c1c8ed"}}], "q19.question": "It is unlikely that this systematic review will yield enough measures and data that is similar enough to each other to conduct a meta-analysis.

improving health practices by incorporating information from health research into the daily clinical decision-making process.1 In this sense, KT involves all aspects of the development of new knowledge and its application in practice, to produce beneficial results for society.2 KT, therefore, is essential to plan health services and guide health professionals in making decisions about their clinical practices.3\nHowever, despite investments in research and training of health professionals, effective interventions and programs do not always reach users, who could benefit from this, meaning that the production of evidence, policies and guidelines does not guarantee its effective application.4 Besides, regardless of the broad consensus on the importance of transferring scientific knowledge into practice, we still lack high-quality information on how to do to it.5\nPrimary Health Care (PHC) has unique issues related to KT. It presents a broad scope of health care demands, dealing with different health problems and human needs.2 Considering this context, the need for research to support professional performance in health care is equally broad2 and hard to handle.\n\nWhy it is important to do this review:\nKT has been recently cited amongst the top-10 priorities in Primary Health Care research.6 This review is meant to identify factors and strategies that bring research results into practice in Primary Health Care. We aim to provide the scenario of KT in PHC, mapping the state-of-the-art and identifying the research gaps. Based on that, we will also build elements to consult health professionals on the best approach to conduct KT in PHC. \n\nResearch question: Which strategies have been developed to promote knowledge translation, of health professionals and researchers, in the Primary Health Care around the world?\n\nObjective: Map and analyze strategies to promote knowledge translation in Primary Health Care.\n\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "To promote the translation of knowledge in primary care, active and networked collaboration between researchers and users is necessary in all stages of the study."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Other"}, "q6": {"extra": [], "value": ["No blinding is involved in this study."]}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q8": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "The review structure consists of five steps, as proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute7 \n(1) Identifying the research question/objective; \n(2) Identifying relevant studies;\n(3) Study selection; \n(4) Extracting and charting the results;\n(5) Collating, summarizing and reporting results"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q10": {"extra": [], "value": "Registration prior to creation of data"}, "q11": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q12": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Stage 1: Identifying the research question/objective\nWhich strategies have been developed to promote knowledge translation, of health professionals and researchers, in the Primary Health Care around the world?\nObjective: Map and analyze strategies to promote knowledge translation in Primary Health Care.\n\nStage 2: Identifying relevant studies\nIn this stage, we will identify the criteria that will be used to select studies that will be included in the review. \nTypes of studies: Studies of any design will be considered for this scoping review, published in indexed journals in the health area. There will be no restriction as to date or language. Exclusion criteria: studies lacking details on the strategies/interventions used for knowledge translation or lacking information about the context in which they are developed. Studies in which knowledge translation is not applied in the context of Primary Health Care.\nPopulation:  Health professionals and researchers.\nConcept: Knowledge Translation strategies are interventions that ease the incorporation of research data into health practice. \nContext: Primary Health Care attendance in all countries.\n\nThe following bibliographic databases will be searched electronically: PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science and LILACS. Further, the list of references of the included studies will be explored and the \u2018related articles\u2019 function in PubMed will be used. \nThe search will be based on the search terms \u201cTranslational Medical Research\u201d, \u201cKnowledge Translation\u201d and \u201cPrimary Health Care\u201d, along with their synonyms and Boolean operators. The search will be adapted to each database accordingly.\nOther sources: Translational Research, American Journal of Translational Research, Journal of Translational Medicine, besides catalog of theses and dissertations (published by national and international universities and research centers). Additionally, the key authors known to publish in this area will be contacted for any additional published or unpublished work. \n\nStage 3: Study selection\nAll study references will be imported into EndNote Web to remove duplicates. Then, they will be imported into Rayyan QCRI for selection based on titles and abstracts. A form will be developed and piloted by two authors (LRS, SARJ) on the first 20 titles and abstracts. Any queries raised by the pilot will be reviewed and the form will be amended. Studies will be selected in duplicate, independently and blinded as to the other reviewer\u00b4s decision. Those studies that do not meet the criteria will be removed. Thereafter, the full text of the remaining studies will be obtained and screened to determine eligibility. Disagreements in this process will be solved by discussion until reaching consensus. The reasons for exclusion will be noted and the process of study selection will be documented in a flow diagram, as per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A table of characteristics of the included studies will be recorded.\n\nStage 4: Extracting and charting the results\nData extraction for a scoping review is known as \u2018data mapping\u2019. Information about the studies should be aligned to the study aim and to the research questions.7 Information to be extracted include (i) author(s), (ii) year of publication, (iii) title, (iv) country of origin, (v) purpose (vi) study design, (vii) description of strategies, (viii) main results.\nData mapping is an interactive process and the information to the extracted may change depending on the included studies.7"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "not applicable"}, "q14": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q15": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q16": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q17": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "(i) author(s), (ii) year of publication, (iii) title, (iv) country of origin, (v) purpose (vi) study design, (vii) description of strategies, (viii) main results."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q19": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Stage 5.

It presents a broad scope of health care demands, dealing with different health problems and human needs.2 Considering this context, the need for research to support professional performance in health care is equally broad2 and hard to handle.\n\nWhy it is important to do this review:\nKT has been recently cited amongst the top-10 priorities in Primary Health Care research.6 This review is meant to identify factors and strategies that bring research results into practice in Primary Health Care. We aim to provide the scenario of KT in PHC, mapping the state-of-the-art and identifying the research gaps. Based on that, we will also build elements to consult health professionals on the best approach to conduct KT in PHC. \n\nResearch question: Which strategies have been developed to promote knowledge translation, of health professionals and researchers, in the Primary Health Care around the world?\n\nObjective: Map and analyze strategies to promote knowledge translation in Primary Health Care.\n\n", "q4": "To promote the translation of knowledge in primary care, active and networked collaboration between researchers and users is necessary in all stages of the study.", "q5": "Other", "q6": ["No blinding is involved in this study."], "q7": "", "q9": "", "q10": "Registration prior to creation of data", "q11": "", "q13": "not applicable", "q14": "", "q15": "", "q20": "", "q21": "", "q22": "", "q23": "", "q24": "", "q25": "5.

There will be no restriction as to date or language. Exclusion criteria: studies lacking details on the strategies/interventions used for knowledge translation or lacking information about the context in which they are developed. Studies in which knowledge translation is not applied in the context of Primary Health Care.\nPopulation:  Health professionals and researchers.\nConcept: Knowledge Translation strategies are interventions that ease the incorporation of research data into health practice. \nContext: Primary Health Care attendance in all countries.\n\nThe following bibliographic databases will be searched electronically: PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science and LILACS. Further, the list of references of the included studies will be explored and the \u2018related articles\u2019 function in PubMed will be used. \nThe search will be based on the search terms \u201cTranslational Medical Research\u201d, \u201cKnowledge Translation\u201d and \u201cPrimary Health Care\u201d, along with their synonyms and Boolean operators. The search will be adapted to each database accordingly.\nOther sources: Translational Research, American Journal of Translational Research, Journal of Translational Medicine, besides catalog of theses and dissertations (published by national and international universities and research centers). Additionally, the key authors known to publish in this area will be contacted for any additional published or unpublished work. \n\nStage 3: Study selection\nAll study references will be imported into EndNote Web to remove duplicates. Then, they will be imported into Rayyan QCRI for selection based on titles and abstracts. A form will be developed and piloted by two authors (LRS, SARJ) on the first 20 titles and abstracts. Any queries raised by the pilot will be reviewed and the form will be amended. Studies will be selected in duplicate, independently and blinded as to the other reviewer\u00b4s decision. Those studies that do not meet the criteria will be removed. Thereafter, the full text of the remaining studies will be obtained and screened to determine eligibility. Disagreements in this process will be solved by discussion until reaching consensus. The reasons for exclusion will be noted and the process of study selection will be documented in a flow diagram, as per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A table of characteristics of the included studies will be recorded.\n\nStage 4: Extracting and charting the results\nData extraction for a scoping review is known as \u2018data mapping\u2019. Information about the studies should be aligned to the study aim and to the research questions.7 Information to be extracted include (i) author(s), (ii) year of publication, (iii) title, (iv) country of origin, (v) purpose (vi) study design, (vii) description of strategies, (viii) main results.\nData mapping is an interactive process and the information to the extracted may change depending on the included studies.7", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "(i) author(s), (ii) year of publication, (iii) title, (iv) country of origin, (v) purpose (vi) study design, (vii) description of strategies, (viii) main results.", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Stage 5.

The extracted data will be categorized based on the year of publication, study design, geographic region, type of intervention. Data will be presented in tabular and graphical forms.\n2. A narrative summary describing the included studies and how the results are related to the objective of the review and the research question. The exact reporting format cannot be determined until the data is charted, which would depend on the literature found.
