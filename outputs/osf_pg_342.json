Several studies have suggested that solving such problems is easier for groups that are more homogenous, that is, for groups in which most individuals share a social identity, and often that finding is explained by a greater individual willingness to benefit in-group members (among others, Fersthman/Gneezy 2001, Fowler/Kam 2007). A few studies consider other mechanisms by which greater group homogeneity results in more successful collective action (e.g., through superior shared technology, see Habyarimana/Humphreys/Posner/Weinstein 2007). We propose that strategic uncertainty may drive this phenomenon: Collective action often requires that individuals coordinate on taking an action that is costly with certainty, but that yields benefits only if enough others take similar actions. Individuals in more homogenous groups may face less uncertainty regarding how other groups members will behave, i.e. they may be more confident that enough of their fellow group members will also take the risky action, making them more willing to take the risky action themselves. We aim to distinguish this mechanism from the mechanism in which individuals\u2019 preferences for benefiting those who share one\u2019s social identity, or to hurt those who do not, drives the increased propensity to take the risky action in more homogeneous groups (as laid out in previous studies). We also investigate a mechanism where shared social identity implies shared beliefs about fellow in-group members\u2019 types (i.e., risk preferences). We implement a laboratory experiment consisting of three stages. In stage 1, we elicit what subjects deem their two most important social group memberships and then, depending on a random draw, either assign subjects based on those stated social identities into two social identity groups of similar subjects or assign them randomly into two social identity groups (called \u201cKlees\u201d and \u201cKandinskys\u201d). Subjects know that both assignment procedures are possible; they are not told that the probability assigned to the random procedure is .99. In stage 2, subjects retain the social identities from stage 1 but are assigned to decision groups of either size 2, 3, or 4. Decision groups may consist of individuals with different social identities. Each decision group then plays a stag hunt game: Each subject in each decision group chooses between two options \u201cW\u201d and \u201cR\u201d. If all subjects in the decision group play W, everyone receives a payoff w, while if all subjects play R, everyone receives a payoff r. If subjects in a decision group do not coordinate on one option, those who play W receive a payoff x and those who play R receive a payoff y, where w>r>y>x. Subjects choose between option W and R for each of 20 rounds, and they are randomly re-matched into decision groups in each round. In some sessions, they are assigned to groups of size 2 or 3, and in some other sessions they are assigned to groups of 4, where the ratio of group members of one social identity to those of another is either 2:2 or 3:1.

And, we look at decision groups of 4 that either feature, from the perspective of a given subject, two subjects with a shared social identity (4-2in), one other subject with a shared social identity (4-1in), or three other subjects with a different social identity (4-3out).

The decentralization of the state in the aftermath of the Francoist dictatorship (1939-1976) \u2013 with the creation of the State of Autonomies - served to consolidate transition to democracy and appease territorial tensions during more than three decades. This model has been recently challenged by the raise of secessionist demands in Catalonia since the mid-2000s, increasing political polarisation and a convoluted political period during which the Catalan government declared independence following the celebration of an illegal referendum. The central government responded to the declaration of independence with the suspension regional autonomy (invoking article 155 in the Constitution), the imprisonment of some of the Catalan leaders and the call for a new regional election. Following the celebration of elections in December 21st 2017, Catalan political parties were unable to put forward a successful candidate to the vote of investiture for more than four months. The deadlock ended on may 17th 2018 with the investiture of a new Catalan president. The appeasement of the Catalan crisis is not likely to happen in the short-run. Political polarization in Catalonia largely complicates bargaining among Catalan political parties and between national representatives and Catalan leaders. In a polarised context compromise might become highly contested by sectors of the electorate that interpret it as a humiliated defeat. Political polarization around the territorial/identity debate has also permeated national politics. The two most important state-wide parties that compete for the hegemony of the right-wing bloc (Partido Popular and Ciudadanos) largely base their electoral appeal among centrist and right-wing voters in a hardliner stance that forbids any sort of political bargaining to sort out the Catalan crisis. In addition, electoral politics do not help to appease the escalation of demands. There is an underlying electoral competition among Catalan secessionist parties to become the hegemonic actor within the pro-independence bloc. That turns the bargaining process about the formation of government into a sort of Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma. As a result, even if a majority of party leaders were moderate pragmatists (which does not correspond with the actual balance of powers between hardliners and softliners within the secessionist bloc, which tips towards the former group), no one has incentives to be the first one to show the moderate flag within the pro-independence bloc, fearing that the might be accused of being responsible of the \u201cwatering down\u201d of the secessionist demands. However, despite the termination of the Catalan conflict being far away, it is very likely that its resolution involves institutional changes in the Spanish State of Autonomies. A large majority of citizens in Catalonia support a modification of the \u201cstatu-quo\u201d, such as some form of symbolic recognition of the Catalan \u201cnationhood\u201d, a modification of fiscal intergovernmental arrangements (revenue powers) and further executive powers transferred to the Catalan government. It might also involve changes that deepen the federal nature of the Spanish State of Autonomies. A majority of Spanish citizens support a Constitutional reform as a way to appease conflict in Catalonia (but we ignore which types of constitutional reforms they specifically support). Although institutional arrangements will be at the core of the intergovernmental bargaining process that might put an end to the Catalan political crisis, so far we lack a detailed analysis of the specific areas of the Spanish territorial model that both Spanish and Catalan citizens are willing to reform and in what direction. In addition, we know little about the preferences of the citizens of the state where secessionist pressures are developing, as studies on secessionism are usually focused on the drivers of the secessionist debate in the separatist region. This project advances the literature by exploring Catalan public opinion in comparison with Spanish public opinion. More specifically, the analysis is organized around two parts: a) Part 1: we explore preferences for a new constitutional territorial deal among Catalan and Spanish public opinion. We analyze preferences for different constitutional deals using a conjoint analysis. The dependent variable is support towards a new constitutional territorial deal based on specific institutional characteristics. b) Part 2: we analyze the level of polarization around the territorial issue in Spain and Catalonia. The \u201cstate\u201d of polarization in a given context is more difficult to define than the \u201ctrend\u201d in polarization (see Fiorina and Abrams (2008:567). A way to evaluate the \u201clevel\u201d of polarization is to explore the extent to which views can be moderated. This can be done using experimental evidence. In this project we analyze the \u201celasticity\u201d of preferences towards the territorial organization of both Spanish and Catalan public opinion when they are exposed to the political and economic costs of the current conflict. We will explore the impact of both political costs and economic costs upon the territorial organization of the state using a survey experiment.
