During this paradigm based on eye-tracking, two images, from different visual categories, are simultaneously displayed on a screen and participants are asked to make a saccade as fast as possible toward the image corresponding to a target category, for example a face and the other image is an animal or a vehicle (Crouzet et al., 2010; Kirchner and Thorpe, 2006; Guyader et al, 2017; Kauffmann et al. 2019). These studies investigated the extremely fast toward faces. \nOthers studies had also used this paradigm with two images of faces, one with an emotion and the other without emotion. Performances were found to be better (fewer errors and shorter latency) when participants were asked to saccade toward the emotional rather than the neutral face. Moreover, performances were even better when the emotional face was happy rather than fearful  (Entzmann et al., submitted; Bannermann et al., 2009; Calvo et al., 2011). These results were obtained when participants were explicitly asked to process the facial expressions as it was necessary to perform the task. Nevertheless, there are evidences suggesting that the emotional content of visual stimuli can captures visual attention even when the attention is focused on a non-emotional aspect of these stimuli (i.e., reflecting the implicit processing of the emotional content; Habel et al., 2007; Bayle et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2009; D\u2019Hondt et al., 2016). But to our knowledge none of this evidence were based on facial expressions and saccadic measures. And it is still unclear whether the preferential processing of emotional faces, and more specifically happy faces in saccadic choice tasks can be extended to tasks that doesn\u2019t require an explicit processing of emotion.\n\nGoal: The goal of the current experiment if to test whether the preferential processing of emotional faces, and more specifically happy faces in saccadic choice tasks, is preserved when participants are not explicitly asked to process facial expressions. To this aim, the paradigm is based on a  saccadic choice task with a neutral and an emotional face presented simultaneously (one male, one female); participants are asked to direct their gaze toward the male or the female face (the task does not imply the process of the emotion).\n\nHypothesis: Mainly, we expect that even in a task in which participants are not asked to process facial expressions, emotional faces are preferentially processed over neutral faces (higher accuracy, shorter latency). This would be in agreement with studies using either a manual response with faces (Bayle et al., 2011), or a saccadic response with emotional scenes (D\u2019Hondt et al., 2016). Concerning differences between happy and fearful faces, two alternative hypotheses can be assumed based on different models of emotion processing. First, from a perceptual point of view, happy faces are easier to recognize and to detect in a crowd of neutral face by both humans and artificial neural networks (Calvo et al., 2011, 2009; Mermillod et al., 2009). In this sense, if perceptual saliency is more important to capture visual attention happy faces could be more likely to attract the gaze compared to fearful faces (Calvo et al., 2011, 2009). On the other hand, fearful faces are known to be related to a faster activation in the amygdala, which have been explained by their higher relevance for survival (Ledoux, 2000).

The patients of COVID-19 usually present with fever, cough, while about 23.7% of patients are accompanied by at least one coexisting disease. The disease is highly contagious with a R0 value about 3-4. The rapid increase in the number of patients put great pressure on the health care system. With the aggravation of the shortage of medical treatment, the mortality rate of the disease increases. As of 15:00 on March 31, 2020, 793278 people were diagnosed with the disease and at least 38545 died. At present, there is no specific cure for this disease, and the clinical management mainly depends on supportive treatment. Lopinavir-Ritonavir was once thought to be a promising medicine on COVID-19, but a recently published clinical trial found that the effect was limited. As excessive immune response is an important reason for the progression of the patient's condition, the researchers turned their attention to immunosuppressants. In a small sample clinical trial, the researchers found that Hydroxychloroquine could improve the state of patients' lungs and increase the probability of the virus turning negative. However, the sample size of this study is small, and there may be some defects in the research design. In a case report, Remdesivir has shown good efficacy in patients with COVID-19, and larger clinical trials are currently under way. Therefore, it is an important and urgent task to explore new therapeutic agents. In the fourth edition of the diagnosis and treatment guideline of COVID-19 in China, Lianhuaqingwen capsule was listed as one of the recommended medicines. In addition, traditional Chinese medicines (CHM), including Qingfei Paidu decoction, Huanglian Jiedu decoction etc., are also widely used in the adjuvant treatment of COVID-19. In terms of clinical research, many scholars have carried out clinical trials on the efficacy of CHM in treating COVID-19. However, these studies are only carried out in local areas, so they fail to provide definite evidence to prove the effectiveness of CHM. In this study, we aim to summarize the current evidence of CHM in treating COVID-19 through systematic review and meta-analysis. This study is necessary before further large-scale clinical studies being carried out. For clinicians, this study can provide some direction and guidance for clinical practice.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-04T09:16:41.347417", "date_modified": "2020-04-04T07:52:28.387942", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["no"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "cb416a9be87c4087522bd8184eb55d3832c97ed890eb288f050ed109ad87c6e5a34bf1f442a635ad1cd2002552cb662b8b60c3f8ddaf94aa0563e3aa38f21c1ea2e05e6913a923a3e4ef139fe1f802ffb0a3469a5e7b4f11ea7c66401cb4daae4fd69a28ec4c7fef6b13a6083a06efcde23e3af5e6ced27eb060a7a2b58e53b3f1dacf08ee9666373ff71194475430fe", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-04T09:16:41.330523", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "MaoyiYang, Rensong Yue, ZhipengHu"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "This study aims to investigate the effects of Chinese herbal medicine in treating COVID-19."}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": ["No blinding is involved in this study."]}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q6": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can provide evidence about efficacy of intervention, so they will be included in this systematic review.

Thus, it is important to study potential mechanisms that contribute to the anxiety \u2013 attentional control (AC) link during this period. \nStress, which is also highly prevalent in young adults, specifically college undergraduates, is a well-known risk factor for anxiety (Sarafino &amp; Ewing, 1999) and has also been correlated with impaired AC (Bardeen &amp; Daniel, 2017; Gulley et al., 2016; Jonsdottir et al., 2017; Kushner &amp; Tackett, 2017; Laceulle et al., 2015; Liston et al., 2006, 2009; Orem et al., 2008; Shields et al., 2016; Skosnik et al., 2000).

alterations due to misleading post-event information [8]. While research has examined this robust effect in laboratory settings, this phenomenon can be observed in real-world settings. A prominent criminal case involved the wrongful conviction of Ivan Henry, who was sentenced to 27 years in prison for multiple counts of rape [11]. Evidence presented during the trial included a falsified photograph of a physical line-up, which portrayed three officers putting the supposed suspect in a headlock while smiling with surrounding men handcuffed and dressed in plain clothing. This photograph was the driving force which led to his conviction, along with a lack of medical and forensic evidence and faulty instructions to the jury. Victims in this case were misinformed by the exposure to this photograph, and 6 of 11 women identified Henry as the rapist [2]. Moreover, the trial judge incorrectly told the jury that Henry\u2019s reluctance to participate in this police line-up implied guilt [11]. These errors would not have occurred in the presence of an amicus curiae, or a lawyer to facilitate Henry with the legal process. Not only is this case a solid exemplar of the misinformation effect, but is also a threat to Henry\u2019s Charter rights. \nThe ME paradigm commonly consists of three phases: individuals first witness an event, receive post-event misinformation, and are then tested on their memory of the event [6]. Seminal research conducted by Loftus and Palmer (1974) demonstrated this effect by asking participants to watch a scene of a car accident before answering questions regarding their recollection of the event. Researchers found that participants who were asked about the two cars that \u201csmashed\u201d into each other were more likely to report seeing non-existent broken glass than those who were asked about the two cars that \u201cbumped\u201d into each other [10]. Similar findings have further supported ME, with people mistaking stop signs as yield signs, hammers as screwdrivers, straight hair as curly and a clean-shaven man as having a mustache, all as a result of suggestive post-event misinformation [10]. These findings provide compelling evidence that memories can be altered with relatively simple ME manipulations.\n\tConventional methods of assessing the ME have involved the use of photographs [5] and standard two-dimensional (2-D) videos [4]. However, not much research has looked at the potential effects of presentation modality (e.g., photographs vs. videos) on the ME. One recent study sought to determine whether memory accuracy for videos and slideshows was differentially affected by misinformation [6]. Although results indicated a ME in both formats, susceptibility to the ME was similar across formats. Considering that encoding for details is typically stronger for a live event (i.e., real objects) compared to a video or photographs [12], effects observed with conventional ME stimuli may not accurately represent the ME in real life contexts. Virtual Reality (VR), which allows individuals to view and interact with detailed simulated environments, may allow researchers to examine the ME with greater ecological validity. However, it is unclear whether and how the ME manifests in VR? Kenchel (2019) noted that certain informative features which may be present in real-life contexts may not have been visible on a computer screen. Thus, we need research involving the ME in Virtual Reality. \n\tVirtual Reality (VR) is a computer-based environment that allows one to explore and interact with a simulated world [13]. In its most common form, individuals experience a 360\u00b0 view of a virtual environment while wearing a Head Mounted Display (HMD). Recent work from an unpublished honours thesis has investigated a classic ME paradigm [9] using a 3-D setting in VR [7]. In this study, participants explored a 3-D environment of the Loftus car accident scenario and were then asked questions about the speed of the cars, the presence of broken glass, etc. Replicating the original result, participants who received misinformation (the cars \u201csmashed\u201d) reported higher speed estimates.  However, no other significant differences were found for the presence of broken glass, or for which car was at fault. While the ME was not found to increase in VR, the author notes that these findings were based on an underpowered and non-diverse sample [7]. Aside from this, only one other study has investigated the ME with VR, and though this study found a ME, it was also likely underpowered [4]. These inconclusive results warrant further investigation of the ME in VR. Additionally, no studies have compared the ME in VR in other formats.\nPast research has relied on materials that may lack ecological validity (i.e., slideshows, 2-D videos). Establishing an ecologically valid measure of VR on the ME may provide a better representation of ME in real life. Additionally, if the vividness of VR reduces ME relative to photos and videos, there may be practical real-world applications (e.g., police interviewing via reconstruction of scenes in VR). The present study seeks to investigate the viability of a VR-ME paradigm, as well as differences in the ME between three modalities: slideshow, two-dimensional (2-D) video and 360\u00b0 VR video in an HMD. The proposed study will consist of three pilot experiments and one main experiment.\nThe proposed study has implications for both eyewitness memory researchers (i.e., the development of materials with higher ecological validity). In criminal cases, misinformation (e.g., leading questions, co-witness contamination) may lead to a false eyewitness testimony. Hence, examining how the differences between stimuli affect an eyewitness\u2019 susceptibility to memory error is important. On a theoretical level, many studies rely on pallid materials in laboratory settings [7]. In comparison to two-dimensional videos and slideshows, VR could be a proxy for a real-life setting and serve as an additional modality to future research with ME paradigms. This study will serve as potential validation for the use of VR with the ME paradigm, and will introduce opportunities for further exploration in this field of research. Practical applications from this research could establish a new method of assessing ME using an ecologically valid scenario, such as recreating crime and accident scenes, or demonstrating an eyewitness\u2019s ability to recognize perpetrators in a police line-up [1].\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "The following hypotheses apply to the main experiment for this study:\n\nH1: Main effect of stimulus on memory errors: Slideshow &gt; 2-D video &gt; 360-degree video..  \n\nH2: Main effect of post-event information, where memory errors due to misinformation will be greater than no information.\n\nH3: Interaction between stimulus and post-event information; the difference between misinformation and no information will be largest in the slideshow condition, and smallest in the 360-degree video condition.

We will supplement all NHST analyses with Bayesian analogues (i.e., Bayesian ANOVAs and t tests using \u201cdefault\u201d priors). We will also consider later exploratory analyses using more complicated models (i.e., multilevel models to examine item-level effects). Finally, we may also conduct exploratory analyses including the \u201cConsistent information\u201d statements (though these are not of primary interest for our main analyses)\n\nExploratory Analyses:\n\nWe may also conduct exploratory ROC curve analyses, plotting correct answers against errors (misinformation vs. other errors) across multiple levels of response bias (represented by different levels of confidence given with answers), in order to see whether the stimulus conditions differentially promote ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect answers. \n\nTo examine the relationship between memory accuracy and presence in VR, we will correlate mean test scores with scores from the ITC-Sense of Presence Inventory (ITC-SOPI). \n\nWe will also compare scores of ecological validity, engagement, negative effects and sense of physical space across formats, and tentatively predict a main effect of format, such that \n360-degree presence&gt; 2-D video presence&gt; slideshow presence. This analysis will serve as a quasi-manipulation check that the formats we used do indeed differ in the kind of experience they offer participants.\n\nRegardless of whether the effect of format on memory errors/ME is significant, we may also conduct exploratory mediation analyses of Format -&gt; X -&gt; Memory errors/ME, where X will be each of the subscales of the ITC (Presence, Engagement, Ecological Validity, Negative Effects). These analyses will be exploratory for two reasons: First, though we broadly hypothesize that some aspect of VR might explain our predicted results, we have no predictions as to the specific mechanism. Second, mediation analyses typically require larger sample sizes, and it is unlikely that we will achieve adequate power for such analyses with our planned sample size.\n\nBecause the ITC-SOPI applies more directly to VR formats, we may conduct an additional mediation analysis identical to the above, but only in the 360-degree video condition. Again, we have no predictions as to the specific mechanism.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q21": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q23": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "References \n\n[1] Bailenson, J.

Additionally, no studies have compared the ME in VR in other formats.\nPast research has relied on materials that may lack ecological validity (i.e., slideshows, 2-D videos). Establishing an ecologically valid measure of VR on the ME may provide a better representation of ME in real life. Additionally, if the vividness of VR reduces ME relative to photos and videos, there may be practical real-world applications (e.g., police interviewing via reconstruction of scenes in VR). The present study seeks to investigate the viability of a VR-ME paradigm, as well as differences in the ME between three modalities: slideshow, two-dimensional (2-D) video and 360\u00b0 VR video in an HMD. The proposed study will consist of three pilot experiments and one main experiment.\nThe proposed study has implications for both eyewitness memory researchers (i.e., the development of materials with higher ecological validity). In criminal cases, misinformation (e.g., leading questions, co-witness contamination) may lead to a false eyewitness testimony. Hence, examining how the differences between stimuli affect an eyewitness\u2019 susceptibility to memory error is important. On a theoretical level, many studies rely on pallid materials in laboratory settings [7]. In comparison to two-dimensional videos and slideshows, VR could be a proxy for a real-life setting and serve as an additional modality to future research with ME paradigms. This study will serve as potential validation for the use of VR with the ME paradigm, and will introduce opportunities for further exploration in this field of research. Practical applications from this research could establish a new method of assessing ME using an ecologically valid scenario, such as recreating crime and accident scenes, or demonstrating an eyewitness\u2019s ability to recognize perpetrators in a police line-up [1].\n", "q4": "The following hypotheses apply to the main experiment for this study:\n\nH1: Main effect of stimulus on memory errors: Slideshow &gt; 2-D video &gt; 360-degree video..  \n\nH2: Main effect of post-event information, where memory errors due to misinformation will be greater than no information.\n\nH3: Interaction between stimulus and post-event information; the difference between misinformation and no information will be largest in the slideshow condition, and smallest in the 360-degree video condition.

We intend to determine which critical video details are most appropriate for use in our main study. By \u201cappropriate,\u201d we mean items for which memory performance is average (i.e., away from floor and ceiling to permit observable effects in either direction). The secondary objective of this pilot is to test for differences in memory between pictures and two-dimensional (2-D) video. \nPilot Experiment 2: This pilot will be identical to the first, except that instead of viewing a slideshow or 2-D video, participants will view a 360\u00b0 video in a HMD. The goal will be the same\u2014to determine which critical details elicit an appropriate level of memory performance. \nPilot experiment 3: The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether our new stimuli can be used to elicit a misinformation effect using the standard 2-D video paradigm. For each participant, a \u201cmisinformation effect score\u201d will be calculated as the difference in memory performance on misinformed items and items for which no information (correct or incorrect) was presented. \nMain experiment: The main experiment will compare the ME in VR to conventional materials using a 3 (Stimulus: 360-degree video, standard 2-D video, slideshow) by 2 (Post-event information: misinformation, no misinformation) between-within subjects design. Post-event information will be presented as a vignette, which includes a series of 36 statements (final # to be determined via pilot testing for appropriate critical details). These statements will consist of 2/3 consistent (correct) information, 1/3 misinformation (incorrect), and no information (i.e. no statement for a critical detail will appear, and will later appear on a memory test). Statements will appear consecutively in the same order as the events presented in the recording, although the consistency of the statements will be counterbalanced. Statements with consistent information and no information will have an equal chance of appearing with misinformation appearing one third of the time. The purpose of the consistent information condition is to provide a more realistic scenario of another person\u2019s recollection of the recording. However, data will only be analyzed based on the difference score between misinformation and no information.  \n", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Pilot Experiment 1:\nParticipants will be recruited online via MTurk, where they will receive $3.00 USD for their participation.

Like Pilot Study 1, Pilot Study 2 will serve to ensure that memory items are within an acceptable range of memory performance for 360-degree video.\nPilot experiment 3: A one sample t-test will be conducted on misinformation effect scores to assess whether there is an overall ME.\nMain study: We will assess the magnitude of the ME in each condition, and potential differences in the ME, by analyzing memory errors using a 3 (Stimulus condition: Slideshow, 2D Video, 360-degree video) X 2 (Post-event information: No information, misinformation) mixed ANOVA. If a significant interaction is observed, we will compare the ME (Misinformed item memory errors \u2013 No information item memory errors) across stimulus conditions via pairwise independent-samples t tests. If there is a main effect of Post-event information or an interaction, we will also conduct one-sample t tests in each stimulus condition comparing the misinformation effect in each condition with 0. \n\nFor all pairwise/follow-up comparisons, we will control for familywise Type I error rates by using Holm-Bonferroni correction. We will supplement all NHST analyses with Bayesian analogues (i.e., Bayesian ANOVAs and t tests using \u201cdefault\u201d priors). We will also consider later exploratory analyses using more complicated models (i.e., multilevel models to examine item-level effects). Finally, we may also conduct exploratory analyses including the \u201cConsistent information\u201d statements (though these are not of primary interest for our main analyses)\n\nExploratory Analyses:\n\nWe may also conduct exploratory ROC curve analyses, plotting correct answers against errors (misinformation vs. other errors) across multiple levels of response bias (represented by different levels of confidence given with answers), in order to see whether the stimulus conditions differentially promote ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect answers. \n\nTo examine the relationship between memory accuracy and presence in VR, we will correlate mean test scores with scores from the ITC-Sense of Presence Inventory (ITC-SOPI). \n\nWe will also compare scores of ecological validity, engagement, negative effects and sense of physical space across formats, and tentatively predict a main effect of format, such that \n360-degree presence&gt; 2-D video presence&gt; slideshow presence. This analysis will serve as a quasi-manipulation check that the formats we used do indeed differ in the kind of experience they offer participants.\n\nRegardless of whether the effect of format on memory errors/ME is significant, we may also conduct exploratory mediation analyses of Format -&gt; X -&gt; Memory errors/ME, where X will be each of the subscales of the ITC (Presence, Engagement, Ecological Validity, Negative Effects). These analyses will be exploratory for two reasons: First, though we broadly hypothesize that some aspect of VR might explain our predicted results, we have no predictions as to the specific mechanism. Second, mediation analyses typically require larger sample sizes, and it is unlikely that we will achieve adequate power for such analyses with our planned sample size.\n\nBecause the ITC-SOPI applies more directly to VR formats, we may conduct an additional mediation analysis identical to the above, but only in the 360-degree video condition.
