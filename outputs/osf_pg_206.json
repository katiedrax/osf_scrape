mistrust a scientist. For instance, do members of the public have a high opinion of female, liberal, or ethnic minority scientists? Do they tend to have a higher opinion of scientists working for the university than scientists working for the industry? Or does their trust depend on the scientific field that a scientist is engaged with? Last but not least, the study will shed light on how the public preferences for certain attributes of scientists interact with the tendency towards conspiratorial thinking and the appreciation of science in general. These questions have been relatively overlooked by the relevant experimental literature, in which the studies often neglect the multidimensionality of trust in science.\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "The main hypotheses of the study test how certain profile attributes contribute to the different dimensions of public trust in scientists. The respondents will receive the legend asking them to assess the credibility of the scientists\u2019 profiles running for the made-up position of the scientific councilors\u2019 board in their city/town. For each pair of profiles, the respondents will be asked to pick the one most credible and then assess both profiles on the different dimensions of trust.\n\nH1. Drawing on the theory of social identity (Tajfel, 1974) and acknowledging the stereotypes about the educational achievements and knowledgeability of different racial/ethnical groups, we hypothesise that in all sub-dimensions of trust:\n\n\u2022\tAsian scientists will be perceived as more trustworthy than other racial/ethnic groups (H1.1.)\n\u2022\tBlack and Hispanic scientists will be perceived as less trustworthy compared to white and Asian scientists. (H1.2.)\n\nH2. Drawing on the same theory and building upon the gender-related stereotypes in science, we expect that:\n\n\u2022\tMale scientists will be perceived as more trustworthy than female, and that this will be especially so in the context of epistemic trust.\n\nH3. Considering the perceived prestige of the scientific fields (e.g. Gauchat and Andrews 2018), we expect to show that:\n\n\u2022\tScientists coming from the field of physics will be viewed as more trustworthy than those from other scientific fields, and this will be especially so in the context of epistemic trust (H3.1).\n\n\u2022\tScientists coming from the fields of physics, medical and environmental science will be viewed as more trustworthy than those from economics, and this will be especially so in the context of epistemic trust (H3.2).\n\nH4. Looking at the domain of work attribute, we expect that:\n\n\u2022\tScientists coming from the industry will be viewed as less trustworthy in terms of the normative trust than those working for the university or the government (H4.1).\n\n\u2022\tScientists coming from the university will be regarded as more trustworthy in terms of the epistemic trust than those working for the industry or the government (H4.2).\n\nH5.

Given that science-related conspiratorial theories consolidate more around the different scientific fields (e.g. medicine or environmental research) and domains of expert knowledge (e.g. government laboratories or industry) rather than the sociodemographic traits of the scientists, we hypothesise that:\n\n\u2022\tFor those scoring higher on the conspiracy mentality scale, the effect of medical science and environmental science on trust in scientists will be more negative than for those scoring lower on the conspiracy mentality scale (H6.1).\n\nFor those scoring higher on the conspiracy mentality scale, the effect of government and industry on trust in scientists will be more negative than for those scoring lower on the conspiracy mentality scale (H6.2).\n\nExploratory part of the analysis\n\nThe Belief in Science Scale measures public attitude to science as the superior form of knowledge about the world.

For instance, do members of the public have a high opinion of female, liberal, or ethnic minority scientists? Do they tend to have a higher opinion of scientists working for the university than scientists working for the industry? Or does their trust depend on the scientific field that a scientist is engaged with? Last but not least, the study will shed light on how the public preferences for certain attributes of scientists interact with the tendency towards conspiratorial thinking and the appreciation of science in general. These questions have been relatively overlooked by the relevant experimental literature, in which the studies often neglect the multidimensionality of trust in science.\n", "q4": "The main hypotheses of the study test how certain profile attributes contribute to the different dimensions of public trust in scientists. The respondents will receive the legend asking them to assess the credibility of the scientists\u2019 profiles running for the made-up position of the scientific councilors\u2019 board in their city/town. For each pair of profiles, the respondents will be asked to pick the one most credible and then assess both profiles on the different dimensions of trust.\n\nH1. Drawing on the theory of social identity (Tajfel, 1974) and acknowledging the stereotypes about the educational achievements and knowledgeability of different racial/ethnical groups, we hypothesise that in all sub-dimensions of trust:\n\n\u2022\tAsian scientists will be perceived as more trustworthy than other racial/ethnic groups (H1.1.)\n\u2022\tBlack and Hispanic scientists will be perceived as less trustworthy compared to white and Asian scientists.

Considering the perceived prestige of the scientific fields (e.g. Gauchat and Andrews 2018), we expect to show that:\n\n\u2022\tScientists coming from the field of physics will be viewed as more trustworthy than those from other scientific fields, and this will be especially so in the context of epistemic trust (H3.1).\n\n\u2022\tScientists coming from the fields of physics, medical and environmental science will be viewed as more trustworthy than those from economics, and this will be especially so in the context of epistemic trust (H3.2).\n\nH4.

It was translated into German, and slightly modified in order to provide unique retrieval cues. There are 16 behaviors for each combination of feedback type and feedback valence.\n\n\nProcedure:\nThis study consists of two parts: An online questionnaire and a lab experiment. In the first part, participants will take an online questionnaire consisting of the German versions of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI-d; von Collani, 2014), the Communal Narcissism Inventory (CNI; Gebauer et al., 2012) and the Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RSES; von Collani &amp; Herzberg, 2003). For each participant, the questionnaires are administered in a randomized order. The online questionnaire ends with demographic questions. In order to match the responses in the online questionnaire to the responses in the lab experiment, participants will receive an e-mail after finishing the online questionnaire. This e-mail contains a unique code they have to bring to the second part which takes place in the lab. After arriving in the lab, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two feedback referents (Self vs. Chris). Both groups will be presented with 64 hypothetical behaviors in a randomized order. Each behavior will be presented for a minimum of 6 s on the computer screen. After 6 s, an instruction appears, that participants can now use the space bar to move on to the next behavior (cf. Study 4 by Zengel, Wells, &amp; Skowronski, 2018). Participants in the self-condition will be asked to \u201cconsider the following description of yourself. Think of the description as being based on actual knowledge of people who know you well. Think of the description as real.\u201d (Sedikides &amp; Green, 2000, p. 913) In contrast, participants in the other-condition (Chris) will be asked to \u201cconsider the description of a person named Chris. Think of the description as being based on actual knowledge of people who know Chris well. Think of the description as real.\u201d (Sedikides &amp; Green, 2000, p. 913). The learning phase will be followed by a distractor task in which participants are asked to write down as many European capitals as possible within 2.5 min. After completion of this task, participants will perform a surprise free recall task. In this task, participants will have 5 min to enter as many behaviors as they can remember. Following previous studies, participants have to enter the behaviors one at a time in a response box that is cleared after the answer was submitted (cf. Newman et al., 2014; Study 2 by Zengel et al., 2018). The free recall task is followed by a cued recall task in which participants will be presented with a cue word (e.g., plant) and have to remember the respective behavior (e.g., X takes care of a colleague\u2019s plants during vacations). The cue words will be presented in a randomized order. After completion of the cued recall task, participants will play Sudoku for 5 min as a distractor task. Thereafter, they will perform a second surprise free recall task and a second cued recall task. The second free and cued recall task resembles the first free and cued recall task. After completion of the cued recall task, they answer control questions (\u201cHow well could you imagine that the descriptions of X are real and based on the knowledge of people who know X well?\u201d, \u201cWhen reading the descriptions, did you expect to remember them later?\u201d, \u201cIf yes, have you made special efforts to memorize the descriptions?\u201d, \u201cWhat do you think the study was about?\u201d). Finally, participants are thanked and debriefed.\n\nNote: The focus of the study lies on the first free and cued recall task. The second free and cued recall task are included for the model-based analysis (for more information see section exploratory analysis). We expect the result pattern of the first free and cued recall tasks to be similar to the second free and cued recall task, respectively. In each recall task, participants will be asked \u201cto try to be accurate without worrying about recalling the behaviors verbatim.\u201d (Sedikides &amp; Green, 2000). In each free recall task, participants will also be instructed to recall as many behaviors as possible in any order they come to mind and to enter behaviors multiple times, wherever they are unsure whether they have already entered them. Participants will also be asked to enter parts of a behavior description if they don\u2019t remember the complete description.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": "Participants are assigned to the two conditions via simple randomization."}, "q10": {"extra": [], "value": "Registration prior to creation of data"}, "q11": {"extra": [], "value": "No data exists."}, "q12": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Participants will be recruited at the University of Mannheim through advertisements at the university, on social media, and via personal contacts.

According to this explanation, people shift attention away from self-concept-threatening information, thereby encoding this information only on the surface. The second explanation states that mnemic neglect is caused by difficulties to retrieve self-concept-threatening information. In order to investigate the question, whether encoding, retrieval or both processes contribute to mnemic neglect, we propose the Encoding-Maintenance-Retrieval (EMR) model (K\u00fcpper-Tetzel &amp; Erdfelder, 2012). This model is tailored to a free-then-cued-recall-paradigm and provides separate measures for successful encoding of behavior descriptions (e), maintaining encoded descriptions (m), and retrieving stored behavior descriptions in a free recall task (rf). In order to apply the model, a second free and cued recall task are included in the study. This is the first attempt to fit the EMR-model on mnemic neglect data. Because only 16 behaviors for each combination of feedback type and feedback valence are used in this study, no hierarchical analysis can be performed to account for individual differences. Therefore, we will only fit the aggregated model in this study. If the application of the model is successful, we will conduct another study in which we use only central negative and positive behaviors to fit the hierarchical model in addition to the aggregated model in order to investigate the impact of individual differences on the underlying cognitive mechanisms. \n\nFor the model-based analysis we have the following predictions:\nEncoding parameter (e): According to the first explanation, mnemic neglect is (partially) due to weak encoding. If this explanation holds, the probability of encoding a central negative behavior successfully (parameter e) will be lower in the self- than in the other-condition (Chris). There will be no substantial differences in the encoding parameter e between the feedback referents (self vs. other) for central positive behaviors and for peripheral negative and peripheral positive behaviors.\nMaintenance parameter (m): According to the two assumptions thought to underlie mnemic neglect (weak encoding, retrieval difficulties), the probability of storing a successfully encoded central negative behavior (parameter m) should not substantially differ between the self- and other-condition (Chris). It should be comparable with the maintenance of peripheral negative behaviors as well as central and peripheral positive behaviors in the self and other-condition. \nRetrieval parameter for the free recall task (rf): According to the second explanation, mnemic neglect is (partially) due to retrieval difficulties. If this explanation holds, the probability of successfully retrieving a central negative behavior in the free recall task (parameter rf) will be lower in the self- than in the other-condition (Chris). There will be no substantial differences in the free recall retrieval parameter rf between the feedback referents (self vs. other) for central positive behaviors and for peripheral negative and peripheral positive behaviors. \n\nFor the model-based analysis we will exclude participants who did not recall any behaviors or correctly recalled all behaviors in the first cued recall task. If necessary, we will increase the rigorousness of the criterion by restricting the range, for example including only participants with equal to or more than 20% and equal to or less than 80% correct answers in the first cued recall task. This criterion is necessary in order to prevent problems with fitting the MPT model. We plan to fit the model with 5,000 iterations (default in multiTree). However, we will increase the number of iterations if necessary. Model fit is assessed by the goodness of fit statistic G^2. In order to evaluate differences between the self- and other-condition (Chris), the difference in the goodness of fit statistic between a baseline model and an alternative model is used (\u2206G^2).\n\n\nPossible further exploratory analyses:\n\nIf there are many dropouts between the first part (online questionnaire) and the second part of the study (lab experiment), we will investigate the characteristics of the participants who dropped out (e.g., whether they are low in self-esteem). \nWe will also investigate the impact of narcissism and self-esteem on the mnemic neglect effect by using a median split in order to include agentic narcissism, communal narcissism and self-esteem in a mixed ANOVA.\nFurthermore, we will explore whether there are differences in recalling central positive behaviors referring to the self or to another person (Chris) and whether this is associated for example with communal narcissism.\n\n\n"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "When the self is in protection mode: Investigating moderators of the mnemic neglect effect", "q2": "Sabrina Berres, Jana Berkessel", "q3": "A positive self-concept is essential for well-being and mental health (Taylor &amp; Brown, 1988).

To verify the self-protective nature of mnemic neglect and to better understand the underlying cognitive processes, we investigate three potential moderators: (a) narcissism, (b) self-esteem, and (c) type of recall task (free vs. cued recall). By investigating individual differences and the type of the recall task we aim to contribute to a better understanding of the mnemic neglect effect.", "q4": "In the free recall task, \na)\tcentral negative behaviors will be recalled less frequently when referring to the self than to another person (Chris; replication of the mnemic neglect effect).

To get a rough impression of the sample size needed, we also conducted an a priori power analysis with G*Power 3.1 (Faul et al., 2009). Assuming an ANOVA with a median split as analysis method, this analysis results in a total sample size of 128 participants given a medium effect size (f = .25), a conventional \u03b1-level of .05, and a target-power of 1 \u2212 \u03b2 = .80. We expect that it will be difficult to find participants due to the low participation incentive and the two parts of the study. Furthermore, due to spatial restrictions, and organizational constraints, we are only able to use the lab for three weeks. Therefore, we won\u2019t be able to recruit more than approximately 128 participants.", "q15": "Because of spatial restrictions, and organizational constraints, we will stop recruiting after three weeks. We will stop recruiting even if we have not reached the sample size of 128 participants for which we aim.", "q20": "For mixed ANOVAs, effect coding will be used for categorical variables (e.g., feedback referent: -1 = self, 1 = other; feedback type: -1 = central, 1 = peripheral; feedback valence: -1 = negative, 1 = positive).

Dichotomous categorical variables will be coded with 0 and 1 for regression analyses (i.e., dummy coding for feedback referent: 0 = self, 1 = other; feedback type: 0 = central, 1 = peripheral; feedback valence: 0 = negative, 1 = positive, gender: 0 = male, 1 = female).

Otherwise, the case is excluded from the analysis.", "q24": "Model-based analysis:\n\nCurrently, there are two explanations for mnemic neglect: The first explanation states that mnemic neglect is caused by weak encoding of self-concept-threatening information. According to this explanation, people shift attention away from self-concept-threatening information, thereby encoding this information only on the surface. The second explanation states that mnemic neglect is caused by difficulties to retrieve self-concept-threatening information. In order to investigate the question, whether encoding, retrieval or both processes contribute to mnemic neglect, we propose the Encoding-Maintenance-Retrieval (EMR) model (K\u00fcpper-Tetzel &amp; Erdfelder, 2012). This model is tailored to a free-then-cued-recall-paradigm and provides separate measures for successful encoding of behavior descriptions (e), maintaining encoded descriptions (m), and retrieving stored behavior descriptions in a free recall task (rf). In order to apply the model, a second free and cued recall task are included in the study. This is the first attempt to fit the EMR-model on mnemic neglect data. Because only 16 behaviors for each combination of feedback type and feedback valence are used in this study, no hierarchical analysis can be performed to account for individual differences. Therefore, we will only fit the aggregated model in this study. If the application of the model is successful, we will conduct another study in which we use only central negative and positive behaviors to fit the hierarchical model in addition to the aggregated model in order to investigate the impact of individual differences on the underlying cognitive mechanisms. \n\nFor the model-based analysis we have the following predictions:\nEncoding parameter (e): According to the first explanation, mnemic neglect is (partially) due to weak encoding. If this explanation holds, the probability of encoding a central negative behavior successfully (parameter e) will be lower in the self- than in the other-condition (Chris). There will be no substantial differences in the encoding parameter e between the feedback referents (self vs. other) for central positive behaviors and for peripheral negative and peripheral positive behaviors.\nMaintenance parameter (m): According to the two assumptions thought to underlie mnemic neglect (weak encoding, retrieval difficulties), the probability of storing a successfully encoded central negative behavior (parameter m) should not substantially differ between the self- and other-condition (Chris). It should be comparable with the maintenance of peripheral negative behaviors as well as central and peripheral positive behaviors in the self and other-condition. \nRetrieval parameter for the free recall task (rf): According to the second explanation, mnemic neglect is (partially) due to retrieval difficulties. If this explanation holds, the probability of successfully retrieving a central negative behavior in the free recall task (parameter rf) will be lower in the self- than in the other-condition (Chris). There will be no substantial differences in the free recall retrieval parameter rf between the feedback referents (self vs. other) for central positive behaviors and for peripheral negative and peripheral positive behaviors. \n\nFor the model-based analysis we will exclude participants who did not recall any behaviors or correctly recalled all behaviors in the first cued recall task. If necessary, we will increase the rigorousness of the criterion by restricting the range, for example including only participants with equal to or more than 20% and equal to or less than 80% correct answers in the first cued recall task. This criterion is necessary in order to prevent problems with fitting the MPT model. We plan to fit the model with 5,000 iterations (default in multiTree). However, we will increase the number of iterations if necessary. Model fit is assessed by the goodness of fit statistic G^2. In order to evaluate differences between the self- and other-condition (Chris), the difference in the goodness of fit statistic between a baseline model and an alternative model is used (\u2206G^2).\n\n\nPossible further exploratory analyses:\n\nIf there are many dropouts between the first part (online questionnaire) and the second part of the study (lab experiment), we will investigate the characteristics of the participants who dropped out (e.g., whether they are low in self-esteem). \nWe will also investigate the impact of narcissism and self-esteem on the mnemic neglect effect by using a median split in order to include agentic narcissism, communal narcissism and self-esteem in a mixed ANOVA.\nFurthermore, we will explore whether there are differences in recalling central positive behaviors referring to the self or to another person (Chris) and whether this is associated for example with communal narcissism.\n\n\n", "q25": "", "q8.question": "Design:\nWe will use a 2 (feedback referent: Self vs. Chris; between-subjects manipulation) x 2 (feedback type: central vs. peripheral; within-subjects manipulation) x 2 (feedback valence: negative vs. positive, within-subjects manipulation) mixed factorial design.\n\n\nMaterial:\nThe material (64 hypothetical behaviors) is adapted from Sedikides and Green (2000). It was translated into German, and slightly modified in order to provide unique retrieval cues. There are 16 behaviors for each combination of feedback type and feedback valence.\n\n\nProcedure:\nThis study consists of two parts: An online questionnaire and a lab experiment. In the first part, participants will take an online questionnaire consisting of the German versions of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI-d; von Collani, 2014), the Communal Narcissism Inventory (CNI; Gebauer et al., 2012) and the Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RSES; von Collani &amp; Herzberg, 2003). For each participant, the questionnaires are administered in a randomized order. The online questionnaire ends with demographic questions. In order to match the responses in the online questionnaire to the responses in the lab experiment, participants will receive an e-mail after finishing the online questionnaire. This e-mail contains a unique code they have to bring to the second part which takes place in the lab. After arriving in the lab, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two feedback referents (Self vs. Chris). Both groups will be presented with 64 hypothetical behaviors in a randomized order. Each behavior will be presented for a minimum of 6 s on the computer screen. After 6 s, an instruction appears, that participants can now use the space bar to move on to the next behavior (cf. Study 4 by Zengel, Wells, &amp; Skowronski, 2018). Participants in the self-condition will be asked to \u201cconsider the following description of yourself. Think of the description as being based on actual knowledge of people who know you well. Think of the description as real.\u201d (Sedikides &amp; Green, 2000, p. 913) In contrast, participants in the other-condition (Chris) will be asked to \u201cconsider the description of a person named Chris. Think of the description as being based on actual knowledge of people who know Chris well. Think of the description as real.\u201d (Sedikides &amp; Green, 2000, p. 913). The learning phase will be followed by a distractor task in which participants are asked to write down as many European capitals as possible within 2.5 min. After completion of this task, participants will perform a surprise free recall task. In this task, participants will have 5 min to enter as many behaviors as they can remember. Following previous studies, participants have to enter the behaviors one at a time in a response box that is cleared after the answer was submitted (cf. Newman et al., 2014; Study 2 by Zengel et al., 2018). The free recall task is followed by a cued recall task in which participants will be presented with a cue word (e.g., plant) and have to remember the respective behavior (e.g., X takes care of a colleague\u2019s plants during vacations). The cue words will be presented in a randomized order. After completion of the cued recall task, participants will play Sudoku for 5 min as a distractor task. Thereafter, they will perform a second surprise free recall task and a second cued recall task. The second free and cued recall task resembles the first free and cued recall task. After completion of the cued recall task, they answer control questions (\u201cHow well could you imagine that the descriptions of X are real and based on the knowledge of people who know X well?\u201d, \u201cWhen reading the descriptions, did you expect to remember them later?\u201d, \u201cIf yes, have you made special efforts to memorize the descriptions?\u201d, \u201cWhat do you think the study was about?\u201d). Finally, participants are thanked and debriefed.\n\nNote: The focus of the study lies on the first free and cued recall task. The second free and cued recall task are included for the model-based analysis (for more information see section exploratory analysis). We expect the result pattern of the first free and cued recall tasks to be similar to the second free and cued recall task, respectively. In each recall task, participants will be asked \u201cto try to be accurate without worrying about recalling the behaviors verbatim.\u201d (Sedikides &amp; Green, 2000). In each free recall task, participants will also be instructed to recall as many behaviors as possible in any order they come to mind and to enter behaviors multiple times, wherever they are unsure whether they have already entered them. Participants will also be asked to enter parts of a behavior description if they don\u2019t remember the complete description.\n", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Participants will be recruited at the University of Mannheim through advertisements at the university, on social media, and via personal contacts. The sample will include 18 to 35-year-old German-speaking young adults. Participation will be rewarded with snacks, nonalcoholic drinks or small gifts. Data collection will probably start in March 2020.", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "We will manipulate the feedback referent (self vs. Chris) between participants, and both the feedback type (central vs. peripheral) and feedback valence (negative vs. positive) within participants. ", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "As outcome measures we will assess the number of correctly recalled behaviors in free and cued recall. Following previous research, two raters will determine independently from each other whether the gist of the recalled behavior matches the originally presented behavior. If the gist of the recalled and the original behavior matches, it is coded with 1, otherwise with 0. Specifically, intrusions \u2013 recalling a behavior that was not present, recalling the same behavior more than one time, and recalling the behavior but with the opposite valence \u2013 will be coded with 0 (cf. Sedikides &amp; Green, 2000). Correctly remembered cues in the free recall task will also be coded with 1, otherwise with 0.\nAdditionally, for the moderator variables agentic narcissism, communal narcissism, and self-esteem, we will calculate the respective sum scores based on the assessed answers in the three questionnaires (NPI-d, CNI, RSES).\nAs control variables we will assess the gender of the participants.\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "No indices will be computed.", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "In order to replicate the mnemic neglect effect, we will conduct a mixed ANOVA which is the commonly used method in previous research. We will conduct a mixed ANOVA on the first free and cued recall task as outcome variables. Both mixed ANOVAs will have three factors: One factor manipulated between participants (feedback referent) and two factors manipulated within participants (feedback type, feedback valence). A significant three-way interaction of feedback referent, feedback type, and feedback valence indicates the presence of the mnemic neglect effect. \nTo investigate individual differences, we will perform hierarchical regression analyses with an ordinary least square regression model for the first free and cued recall task, respectively. In the first step we will include gender as a control variable. In a second step we will include the predictors feedback type, feedback valence, and feedback referent. The moderator variables agentic narcissism, communal narcissism, and self-esteem follow in a third step. Next, all two-way interactions are included in a fourth step. In a fifth step, all three-way interactions are included. The four-way interactions are included in a sixth and final step. Especially the four-way interaction of feedback referent, feedback type, feedback valence and personality trait is of interest. We will also explore interactions that are relevant for our hypotheses by simulating quantities of interest.\nAlthough not in the focus of our study, we will perform the mixed ANOVAs and hierarchical regression analyses with the second free and cued recall task as outcome variables.\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href":
