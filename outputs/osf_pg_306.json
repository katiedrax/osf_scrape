Hypothesis 2 (causal inference - origin): The FA has been a mass party at its inception and during its first stage of development (1971-1986), because 1) the FA needed a mass organization to achieve significant electoral mobilization in the territory, and because of its need to articulate base activists from different sectors\u2014organizations that antedate the FA\u2014and independents; and 2) a popular movement, which preceding the FA and which was not organized by any of the sectors that created the FA, supported the creation of a mass-based party and claimed their place within this new organization. Hypothesis 3 (descriptive inference - reproduction): In the present, the FA is a mass organic leftist party (Levitsky and Roberts 2011). This means that the four attributes that define this type of party organization are observable at the FA at the time of our fieldwork. Hypothesis 4 (causal inference - reproduction): The FA did not oligarchize because of the political role granted to grassroots activists; they have always had representatives in the decision-making levels of the organization. This was granted to a level that ensured their ability to block changes in the organization\u00b4s statutes, engendering a lock-in effect. As a result (intermediate outcome), the FA combines organizers (base activists) and mobilizers (leaders from factions) within its structure (Han 2014). Hypothesis 5 (descriptive inference grassroots organization): The bases did not oligarchize. They still have an open democratic structure. Hypothesis 6 (causal inference of the non oligarchization of the bases): The bases do not oligarchize because they maintain a non-professional structure and they are not the first step in a political career to elective office; they are also not necessary to obtain a designated position in government. Hypothesis 7 (result, the FA in opposition and in government): The mass party organization restricts the decisions of the party elite while in opposition and in government: it limits the party leaders\u00b4 incentives to moderate.

Type frequency influences variation in general: Inflection classes with low type frequency lose their members to type frequent classes. Type frequency also interacts with regularity. Mostly, classes with high type frequency show a regular conjugation pattern whereas classes with low type frequency show an irregular conjugation pattern (Goldberg 2019: 66-68).\n\nWithin the classes with low type frequency, token frequency influences whether a member will stay in the class or change to the type frequent class: token frequent members stay in the type infrequent class, while token infrequent members change to the type frequent class (Bybee and Thompson 1997). This principle has been studied in several corpus studies (e.g., Nowak 2015, Sch\u00e4fer 2016). However, psycholinguistic studies on frequency and variation do not exist. \n\nIn the past, psycholinguistic studies focussed on the difference between the processing of regular and irregular morphology and on the question whether token frequency only influences the processing of irregular conjugation, but not of regular conjugation (dual mechanism model by Pinker and Prince 1991; see Bornkessel-Schlesewsky 2009: 47-68 for an overview over the studies). Token frequency influences reaction times with regard to irregular verbs in general: Clahsen et al. (2001) report that preterite forms of irregular German verbs with a low frequency of preterite forms elicit slower reaction times in a lexical decision task than preterite forms of verbs with a high frequency of preterite forms. \nHowever, it has not been studied so far whether variation caused by low frequency might affect reaction times. It would be interesting to test whether the results of Clahsen et al. (2001) also hold for regular forms of irregular verbs with differing token frequencies. Additionally, it has not been examined whether variation can be detected in reaction times before it is visible in corpora. Here, irregular verbs are of interest that do not vary in corpora yet but have similar token frequencies as verbs that already show variation. Again, not only the reaction times elicited by irregular forms but also by regular forms of the verbs are of interest.\n\nThis study aims to answer the research questions with the help of a lexical decision task. For the task, verbs are used that belong to the type infrequent irregular (strong) conjugation class in German. The verbs have differing participle frequencies and show different degrees of variation in corpora. Participants are asked to judge the participle forms of the test verbs which are presented with strong (irregular) as well as weak (regular) inflection."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "1. reaction times\n\nfrequent vs. infrequent\n\nThe reaction times depend on the frequency of the test verbs: Reaction times are lower for frequent strong verbs (over 13 hits per million tokens), whereas reaction times are higher for infrequent strong verbs (up to 2 hits per million tokens). This can be observed for weak as well as strong forms and for the acceptance as well as the rejection of forms. The relative frequency of the test verbs is determined with the help of the word frequencies provided by the digital dictionary of the German language (Digitales W\u00f6rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache, Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften).\n\nWith the help of the design, reaction times can be interpreted as an indicator for variation. From a frequency-based view, reaction times should be shorter for frequent verbs than for infrequent verbs (Clahsen et al. 2001). The design allows to control for the general influence of frequency: Weak forms of token frequent verbs (e.g., \"gezieht\" instead of \"gezogen\" 'pulled') occur extremly seldom in language use and are thus not token frequent. A fast rejection of these forms can therefore not be traced back to the frequency of the forms. The same logic holds for weak forms of infrequent verbs (\"gefechtet\" instead of \"gefochten\" 'fenced') that are not attested in corpora yet (ratio of more than 100 strong forms to one weak form).  \nDifferences in reaction times can thus be interpreted as an indicator for variants:  entrenched forms are accepted fast and forms that are unlikely to be produced are rejected fast whereas the judgement of variants takes longer because two forms with equal function exist. Hence, the form \"gezieht\" should be rejected fast, but not \"geflechtet\": \"geflechtet\" is not attested in corpora yet, but the strong participle of \"flechten\" is similar frequent as the participles of other verbs that already show variation (e.g., \"salzen\" 'to salt'). Crucially, the hypothesised difference in reaction times cannot be traced back to differences in token frequency between the verb forms, as the token frequency of both forms (\"geflechtet\" and \"gezieht\") is equally low because both forms are nearly inexistent. \n\nattested vs. not attested\n\nThe infrequent verbs are divided into the categories variation attested in corpora and variation not attested in corpora. Based on a usage-based framework, it is hypothesised that no difference can be measured in the reaction times between forms that are attested in corpora and forms that are not attested in corpora. This holds for strong and weak forms as well as the acceptance and the rejection of forms. As the verbs are infrequent, the strong forms of the verbs are infrequent as well and thus cannot dominate the weak forms in frequency. Hence, the statistical pre-emption (Goldberg 2019: 75-84) of strong forms is impaired. Strong and weak forms can be considered variants for infrequent strong verbs. Reaction times are therefore higher as two forms with equal function exists. A prestudy supports this hypothesis (see https://osf.io/ypw95 for the preregistration of the prestudy, data_prestudy_frequency.csv for the data and prestudy_frequency.R for the code analysing the data).\nNote that it is also possible to expect differences in reaction time within a usage-based framework. As the weak forms are more seldom for verbs without attested variation and strong forms are in turn more frequent, a slight difference in reaction times might be observable between verbs with attested and verbs without attested variation. If weak forms occur only seldom, these forms should be rejected fast and the correspondent strong form should be accepted fast, as this is the only entrenched form. In contrast, longer reaction times are expected if weak forms occur more often as now there are two competing forms. However, this difference should be more subtle than the difference between frequent and infrequent test verbs because the strong forms of infrequent verbs cannot dominate the weak forms in frequency as much as strong forms of frequent verbs can.  \nThe design allows testing both hypotheses. The test verbs are selected by calculating the ratio of strong and weak participle forms using the corpus w-public of the archive W for written language (W-\u00f6ffentlich - alle \u00f6ffentlichen Korpora des Archivs W) which is part of the German Reference Corpus (Deutsches Referenzkorpus, Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Deutsche Sprache). The search was carried out with Cosmas 2 (Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Deutsche Sprache). A form is defined to be attested in corpora if the ratio of strong to weak forms is smaller than 100/1. If no differences in reaction times can be measured between verbs with and without attested variation, this can be taken as an indicator that variation is already measurable before it is attested in corpora. \n\n2. acceptability and consistency of answers\n\nfrequent vs. infrequent\n\nThe acceptability of weak and strong forms depends on the token frequency of strong verbs. Strong forms are accepted for frequent strong verbs, whereas weak forms are not accepted. For infrequent strong verbs, both forms are accepted. \nFor frequent verbs, a clearly distributed response behaviour is expected: predominantly rejection for weak forms and predominantly acceptance for strong forms. This is not expected for infrequent verbs: while acceptance is expected for strong forms, a mixed response behaviour is expected for weak forms. Additionally, the response behaviour of individual participants is expected to be consistent for frequent verbs (rejection of the weak form of a verb, acceptance of the strong form) but not for infrequent verbs (rejection/acceptance of both forms). \n\nvariation attested in corpora vs. not attested in corpora\n\nFor infrequent test verbs, it is hypothesized that the acceptability of weak forms is influenced by the occurrence of weak forms in corpora. Although a corpus cannot picture language use as a whole, it can nonetheless give a hint on how likely it is that a certain form has been produced by speakers and hence perceived by other speakers. If weak forms are already attested in corpora, it is more likely that participants already encountered these forms and that the forms are more entrenchend. The opposite is to be expected for forms that are not attested in corpora. Weak forms are therefore more likely to be accepted if they already have been witnessed in corpora.  A prestudy supports this hypothesis (see https://osf.io/ypw95 for the preregistration of the prestudy, data_prestudy_frequency.csv for the data and prestudy_frequency.R for the code analysing the data).\nNote that this hypothesis is not the only possible hypothesis from a usage-based perspective. Comparable acceptance rates can also be expected: As the frequency of the strong participles is low for verbs with attested as well as without attested variation, the verbs could be treated in the same way. Hence, it is also possible that the infrequent verbs with and without attested variation show comparable acceptance and rejection rates of the weak and strong participle forms. The study design allows testing both hypotheses."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled trials."}, "q6": {"extra": [], "value": ["For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to which they have been assigned."]}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q8": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "A within subject design is used with two factors (frequency and inflection), that have three (frequent, infrequent without variation, infrequent with variation) and two levels (weak, strong), respectively. Per level of frequency, eight test words are used.  The participants are shown test words with weak as well as strong inflection and are asked to decide whether they know the word (\"Kennen Sie dieses Wort bzw. diese Wortabfolge?\" 'Do you know this word/word sequence?'). The answer (yes/no) as well as the reaction times are used for data analysis. \nSo called weak masculine nouns with weak and strong inflection are used as fillers. They serve as test nouns for a study on the influence of schematicity on variation. Additionally,  strong genitive forms ending with -es are used as fillers. The genitive form -es is used for nouns that normally have -s as genitive ending as they do not allow -es phonotactically (*des Abendes 'the evening.GEN') (Szczepaniak 2010). \nTo test the design, the reaction times elicited by long (-es) and short (-s) genitive endings of two nouns not allowing long genitive endings are contrasted (Ultimatum, Internet) as well as the reaction times elicited by regular and irregular forms of the irregular verbs \"gehen\" ('to go') and \"bringen\" ('to bring'). These items will only be relevant if the statistical analysis of the test items does not hint to differences in reaction times. The items allow to test whether the design can elicit differences in reaction times in general. The following mixed linear model will be used if the design needs to be tested: reaction time ~ acceptance + (1|item)+(1+acceptance |participant). Acceptance is the manipulated variable. The variable has two levels: accepted (short ending/irregular form) and not accepted (long ending/regular form). Additionally, the response behaviour (yes/no) of the participants will be analysed with the following logistic mixed linear model: response ~ acceptance + (1|item)+(1+form|participant). \n\nPsychoPy3, version 3.1.5, (Peirce 2019) is used to implement the study.\n\nTest items\nSee the attached file (testverbs.csv) for an overview over the test verbs. The selection of the test verbs is based on the relative frequency of the test verbs' strong participles in the year 2018. The relative frequencies of the participles are taken from the word frequencies provided by the digital dictionary of the German language (Digitales W\u00f6rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache, Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften). Test verbs with a participle frequency of 13 and more hits per million token are considered frequent. Test verbs with a participle frequency of up to 2 hits per million token are considered infrequent. \n\nWithin the infrequent test verbs, verbs with a ratio of more than 100 strong participle forms to one weak form are considered not to vary in corpora, test verbs with a ratio of less than 100 strong participle forms to one weak form are considered to vary in corpora. The counts for the strong and weak participle forms are based on the corpus w-public of the archive W for written language (W-\u00f6ffentlich - alle \u00f6ffentlichen Korpora des Archivs W) which is part of the German Reference Corpus (Deutsches Referenzkorpus, Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Deutsche Sprache). Only the hits for the weak forms of the frequent test verbs have been searched for false positives. Note that only hits with lower case for \"gefahren\" ('driven')  were included into the search in order to avoid false positives as \"gefahren\" in upper case is homographic to the dative plural of \"Gefahr\" \u2018danger\u2019.   \n\nThe attached file (stimulus file.csv) gives an overview over all test items as well as fillers.

Type frequency influences variation in general: Inflection classes with low type frequency lose their members to type frequent classes. Type frequency also interacts with regularity. Mostly, classes with high type frequency show a regular conjugation pattern whereas classes with low type frequency show an irregular conjugation pattern (Goldberg 2019: 66-68).\n\nWithin the classes with low type frequency, token frequency influences whether a member will stay in the class or change to the type frequent class: token frequent members stay in the type infrequent class, while token infrequent members change to the type frequent class (Bybee and Thompson 1997). This principle has been studied in several corpus studies (e.g., Nowak 2015, Sch\u00e4fer 2016). However, psycholinguistic studies on frequency and variation do not exist. \n\nIn the past, psycholinguistic studies focussed on the difference between the processing of regular and irregular morphology and on the question whether token frequency only influences the processing of irregular conjugation, but not of regular conjugation (dual mechanism model by Pinker and Prince 1991; see Bornkessel-Schlesewsky 2009: 47-68 for an overview over the studies). Token frequency influences reaction times with regard to irregular verbs in general: Clahsen et al. (2001) report that preterite forms of irregular German verbs with a low frequency of preterite forms elicit slower reaction times in a lexical decision task than preterite forms of verbs with a high frequency of preterite forms. \nHowever, it has not been studied so far whether variation caused by low frequency might affect reaction times. It would be interesting to test whether the results of Clahsen et al. (2001) also hold for regular forms of irregular verbs with differing token frequencies. Additionally, it has not been examined whether variation can be detected in reaction times before it is visible in corpora. Here, irregular verbs are of interest that do not vary in corpora yet but have similar token frequencies as verbs that already show variation. Again, not only the reaction times elicited by irregular forms but also by regular forms of the verbs are of interest.\n\nThis study aims to answer the research questions with the help of a lexical decision task. For the task, verbs are used that belong to the type infrequent irregular (strong) conjugation class in German. The verbs have differing participle frequencies and show different degrees of variation in corpora. Participants are asked to judge the participle forms of the test verbs which are presented with strong (irregular) as well as weak (regular) inflection.", "q4": "1. reaction times\n\nfrequent vs. infrequent\n\nThe reaction times depend on the frequency of the test verbs: Reaction times are lower for frequent strong verbs (over 13 hits per million tokens), whereas reaction times are higher for infrequent strong verbs (up to 2 hits per million tokens). This can be observed for weak as well as strong forms and for the acceptance as well as the rejection of forms. The relative frequency of the test verbs is determined with the help of the word frequencies provided by the digital dictionary of the German language (Digitales W\u00f6rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache, Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften).\n\nWith the help of the design, reaction times can be interpreted as an indicator for variation. From a frequency-based view, reaction times should be shorter for frequent verbs than for infrequent verbs (Clahsen et al. 2001). The design allows to control for the general influence of frequency: Weak forms of token frequent verbs (e.g., \"gezieht\" instead of \"gezogen\" 'pulled') occur extremly seldom in language use and are thus not token frequent. A fast rejection of these forms can therefore not be traced back to the frequency of the forms. The same logic holds for weak forms of infrequent verbs (\"gefechtet\" instead of \"gefochten\" 'fenced') that are not attested in corpora yet (ratio of more than 100 strong forms to one weak form).  \nDifferences in reaction times can thus be interpreted as an indicator for variants:  entrenched forms are accepted fast and forms that are unlikely to be produced are rejected fast whereas the judgement of variants takes longer because two forms with equal function exist. Hence, the form \"gezieht\" should be rejected fast, but not \"geflechtet\": \"geflechtet\" is not attested in corpora yet, but the strong participle of \"flechten\" is similar frequent as the participles of other verbs that already show variation (e.g., \"salzen\" 'to salt'). Crucially, the hypothesised difference in reaction times cannot be traced back to differences in token frequency between the verb forms, as the token frequency of both forms (\"geflechtet\" and \"gezieht\") is equally low because both forms are nearly inexistent. \n\nattested vs. not attested\n\nThe infrequent verbs are divided into the categories variation attested in corpora and variation not attested in corpora. Based on a usage-based framework, it is hypothesised that no difference can be measured in the reaction times between forms that are attested in corpora and forms that are not attested in corpora. This holds for strong and weak forms as well as the acceptance and the rejection of forms. As the verbs are infrequent, the strong forms of the verbs are infrequent as well and thus cannot dominate the weak forms in frequency. Hence, the statistical pre-emption (Goldberg 2019: 75-84) of strong forms is impaired. Strong and weak forms can be considered variants for infrequent strong verbs. Reaction times are therefore higher as two forms with equal function exists. A prestudy supports this hypothesis (see https://osf.io/ypw95 for the preregistration of the prestudy, data_prestudy_frequency.csv for the data and prestudy_frequency.R for the code analysing the data).\nNote that it is also possible to expect differences in reaction time within a usage-based framework. As the weak forms are more seldom for verbs without attested variation and strong forms are in turn more frequent, a slight difference in reaction times might be observable between verbs with attested and verbs without attested variation. If weak forms occur only seldom, these forms should be rejected fast and the correspondent strong form should be accepted fast, as this is the only entrenched form. In contrast, longer reaction times are expected if weak forms occur more often as now there are two competing forms. However, this difference should be more subtle than the difference between frequent and infrequent test verbs because the strong forms of infrequent verbs cannot dominate the weak forms in frequency as much as strong forms of frequent verbs can.  \nThe design allows testing both hypotheses. The test verbs are selected by calculating the ratio of strong and weak participle forms using the corpus w-public of the archive W for written language (W-\u00f6ffentlich - alle \u00f6ffentlichen Korpora des Archivs W) which is part of the German Reference Corpus (Deutsches Referenzkorpus, Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Deutsche Sprache). The search was carried out with Cosmas 2 (Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Deutsche Sprache). A form is defined to be attested in corpora if the ratio of strong to weak forms is smaller than 100/1. If no differences in reaction times can be measured between verbs with and without attested variation, this can be taken as an indicator that variation is already measurable before it is attested in corpora. \n\n2. acceptability and consistency of answers\n\nfrequent vs. infrequent\n\nThe acceptability of weak and strong forms depends on the token frequency of strong verbs. Strong forms are accepted for frequent strong verbs, whereas weak forms are not accepted. For infrequent strong verbs, both forms are accepted. \nFor frequent verbs, a clearly distributed response behaviour is expected: predominantly rejection for weak forms and predominantly acceptance for strong forms. This is not expected for infrequent verbs: while acceptance is expected for strong forms, a mixed response behaviour is expected for weak forms. Additionally, the response behaviour of individual participants is expected to be consistent for frequent verbs (rejection of the weak form of a verb, acceptance of the strong form) but not for infrequent verbs (rejection/acceptance of both forms). \n\nvariation attested in corpora vs. not attested in corpora\n\nFor infrequent test verbs, it is hypothesized that the acceptability of weak forms is influenced by the occurrence of weak forms in corpora. Although a corpus cannot picture language use as a whole, it can nonetheless give a hint on how likely it is that a certain form has been produced by speakers and hence perceived by other speakers. If weak forms are already attested in corpora, it is more likely that participants already encountered these forms and that the forms are more entrenchend. The opposite is to be expected for forms that are not attested in corpora. Weak forms are therefore more likely to be accepted if they already have been witnessed in corpora.  A prestudy supports this hypothesis (see https://osf.io/ypw95 for the preregistration of the prestudy, data_prestudy_frequency.csv for the data and prestudy_frequency.R for the code analysing the data).\nNote that this hypothesis is not the only possible hypothesis from a usage-based perspective. Comparable acceptance rates can also be expected: As the frequency of the strong participles is low for verbs with attested as well as without attested variation, the verbs could be treated in the same way. Hence, it is also possible that the infrequent verbs with and without attested variation show comparable acceptance and rejection rates of the weak and strong participle forms. The study design allows testing both hypotheses.", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Per level of frequency, eight test words are used.  The participants are shown test words with weak as well as strong inflection and are asked to decide whether they know the word (\"Kennen Sie dieses Wort bzw. diese Wortabfolge?\" 'Do you know this word/word sequence?'). The answer (yes/no) as well as the reaction times are used for data analysis. \nSo called weak masculine nouns with weak and strong inflection are used as fillers. They serve as test nouns for a study on the influence of schematicity on variation. Additionally,  strong genitive forms ending with -es are used as fillers. The genitive form -es is used for nouns that normally have -s as genitive ending as they do not allow -es phonotactically (*des Abendes 'the evening.GEN') (Szczepaniak 2010). \nTo test the design, the reaction times elicited by long (-es) and short (-s) genitive endings of two nouns not allowing long genitive endings are contrasted (Ultimatum, Internet) as well as the reaction times elicited by regular and irregular forms of the irregular verbs \"gehen\" ('to go') and \"bringen\" ('to bring'). These items will only be relevant if the statistical analysis of the test items does not hint to differences in reaction times. The items allow to test whether the design can elicit differences in reaction times in general. The following mixed linear model will be used if the design needs to be tested: reaction time ~ acceptance + (1|item)+(1+acceptance |participant). Acceptance is the manipulated variable. The variable has two levels: accepted (short ending/irregular form) and not accepted (long ending/regular form). Additionally, the response behaviour (yes/no) of the participants will be analysed with the following logistic mixed linear model: response ~ acceptance + (1|item)+(1+form|participant). \n\nPsychoPy3, version 3.1.5, (Peirce 2019) is used to implement the study.\n\nTest items\nSee the attached file (testverbs.csv) for an overview over the test verbs. The selection of the test verbs is based on the relative frequency of the test verbs' strong participles in the year 2018. The relative frequencies of the participles are taken from the word frequencies provided by the digital dictionary of the German language (Digitales W\u00f6rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache, Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften). Test verbs with a participle frequency of 13 and more hits per million token are considered frequent. Test verbs with a participle frequency of up to 2 hits per million token are considered infrequent. \n\nWithin the infrequent test verbs, verbs with a ratio of more than 100 strong participle forms to one weak form are considered not to vary in corpora, test verbs with a ratio of less than 100 strong participle forms to one weak form are considered to vary in corpora. The counts for the strong and weak participle forms are based on the corpus w-public of the archive W for written language (W-\u00f6ffentlich - alle \u00f6ffentlichen Korpora des Archivs W) which is part of the German Reference Corpus (Deutsches Referenzkorpus, Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Deutsche Sprache). Only the hits for the weak forms of the frequent test verbs have been searched for false positives. Note that only hits with lower case for \"gefahren\" ('driven')  were included into the search in order to avoid false positives as \"gefahren\" in upper case is homographic to the dative plural of \"Gefahr\" \u2018danger\u2019.   \n\nThe attached file (stimulus file.csv) gives an overview over all test items as well as fillers. The file contains the following columns:\n\nStimulus_Art: unique coding for each stimulus \t\nStimulus: the stimulus as presented to the participant\t\nSchema: coding for the masculine test nouns; levels: Schema, Peripherie, nichtschwach (not relevant for this study)\nFrequenz: coding for the test verbs; levels: frequent, infrequ_m, infrequ_o\nAkzeptanz: coding for the items testing the design; levels: nichtakzeptiert, akzeptiert\t\nEvaluation: \"ev\" highlights the items evaluating the concentration of the participants (if over 10 % of the items have been answered wrong, participant will be excluded)\t\nFlexion: coding for the test verbs and nouns; levels: stark/schwach\t\nItem: naming the test items in their base form (test verbs as well as masculine test nouns that are not relevant for this study)\nFormakzeptiert: (expected) acceptence/inacceptance of the forms, j (yes), n (no), b (both)\ncorrectKey: correct response key (based on Formakzeptiert); levels: f (no), j (yes, both)\nBlock: block in which the item is presented\t\nPositionimBlock: position within the block\n\nFurther explanation for the columns \"Formakzeptiert\" and \"correctKey\": Concerning the test verbs, the coding followed the hypotheses: for frequent verbs, weak forms are coded as rejected and strong forms as accepted. For infrequent verbs without attested variation (infrequ_o), the same coding scheme was used. For infrequent verbs with attested variation (infrequ_m), both forms were coded as accepted. \n", "q8.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e15d7ac754584028bf9c335", "file_name": "stimulus file.csv", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/ynvb5/files/osfstorage/5e15d7ac754584028bf9c335", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e15d7ac754584028bf9c335"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "c67ddb3d7f2c010bce94a1d7b2e2980793c035ffd4ea504226c97feb881cde7c"}}, {"file_id": "5e15d7ac754584028bf9c337", "file_name": "testverbs.csv", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/ynvb5/files/osfstorage/5e15d7ac754584028bf9c337", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e15d7ac754584028bf9c337"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "e5aba2a07ae9775d4811f5e171d62d69e7f9d30369b06500aded3bb35b933d39"}}], "q12.question": "Participants will be recruited by asking teachers at German universities to distribute the study among their students. If necessary, participants will be addionally recruited out of the personal sphere of the author. The participation in the study is voluntary. The participants will not be paid for participating in the study. Participants are informed that their data is stored and analysed anonymously. Participants that are bilingual (defined as having acquired more than one language before the twelfth year of life), do not speak German as their L1 or have dyslexia will be excluded from the study. Additionally, participants will be excluded whose response behaviour points to them not focussing on the task. This evaluation will be based on 31 items. For these items, participants should not vary in their answers (the 31 items are fillers as well as words that are used in the example block and words that are used to evaluate the design of the study). The cut-off point is set to 10 %. Hence, participants that answer three items or more in the opposite way will be excluded from the study. In addition, participants, whose reaction times are above 3 sd of the mean reaction times of a level of the category frequency (e.g., frequent/infrequent with variation) are excluded from the sample.\nIf the design has to be tested (see study design for further explanations), only the filler items as well as the items from the example block will be used to evaluate the participants' reponse behaviour. These are 23 items, hence, the cut-off point will be set to two or more items that have been answered in the opposite way in this case. \n\nThe study is carried out online using the platform pavlovia.org.

Participants can only choose between yes and no. Additionally to the response behaviour, the time elapsing from the stimulus onset to the response will be measured. \n\n\nMeta data (age, gender, dyslexia, educational level, handedness, mother tongue, predominantly speaking dialect or standard, speaking dialect in general, if dialect, which dialect, origin (county, city), current place of residence, intensity of reading (daily, weekly, monthly) is collected.

For the prestudy and the main study, the same version of R and Rstudio are used.\n\nReaction Times\nTo calculate the differences in reaction times, a mixed linear model is used. The frequency class of the verbs (frequent, infrequent without variation, infrequent with variation) and the forms (strong, weak) will be included as fixed effects. Item and participant are included as random effects. For participants, random slopes and random intercepts are used. For items, only random intercepts are used as the items vary across categories.

Forms (strong, weak) as well as frequency class (frequent, infrequent without variation, infrequent with variation) are included as fixed effects that may interact (rejection of weak inflection for a frequent verb but not for an infrequent verb). Item and participant are included as random effects. Again, random intercepts and random slopes are used for the participants, but only random intercepts for the items as they vary across categories.

This will also be used in the main study if the same problems arise for the generalized mixed linear model.\n\nWithin the tree and the forest, frequency as well as inflection will be included as factors:\n\nKey ~ Frequency + Inflection\n\nFor the tree, the same code will be used as indicated in the file prestudy_frequency.R.\n", "q19.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e15d7ac754584028bf9c333",
