In the current study, the data will be structured such that judgements of profiles (level one) will be nested within individuals (level 2). In this hierarchically structured data, a proportion of the variance in the criterion (judgements in the current research) is attributable to the nesting structure. The nested structure and two levels of analysis justify using MLM as the analysis method in a policy capturing study (Bonaccio &amp; Dalal, 2010). \nThe hypotheses and research questions will be tested for each judgement separately.  For H1 and RQ1 we will investigate the relative importance of the cues in making different judgements. Since H1 and RQ1 are focused on within-subject data, they will be addressed at level one analysis. RQ2 is also focused on the within-subject level of analysis but it will investigate the more complex relationships (interactions and non-linear relationship) between the cues and the outcome variables (i.e. judgements). To test the mediation proposed in H2 (also at the within-subject level), we will use PROCESS model or multilevel SEM analysis. \nJealousy, sociosexual orientation, attachment, gender, personality, implicit theories of relationships, justice sensitivity, relationship quality, and perspective taking will potentially predict how individuals make judgements concerning whether the ambiguous extradyadic behaviour is an infidelity, the extent to which the actor has the intention to cheat, the extent to which the ambiguous extradyadic behaviour causes emotional distress in the participant and whether they would break up with the actor following ambiguous extradyadic behaviour. The relationship between individual difference variables and judgements will be addressed by H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H11, RQ4, and RQ5, at a between-subject level (and, therefore, individual difference variables are predictors at level two). \nFinally, cross-level interactions will be investigated to answer RQ3.

5) We will explore the influence of perspective taking on the judgements concerning whether the ambiguous extradyadic behaviour is an infidelity, the extent to which the actor has the intention to cheat, the extent to which the extradyadic behaviour causes emotional distress in the participant and whether they would break up with the actor following ambiguous extradyadic behaviour.\n\n\nHypothesis 11) Higher levels of honesty humility will be associated with higher scores on judgements concerning whether the ambiguous extradyadic behaviour is an infidelity, the extent to which the actor has the intention to cheat, the extent to which the ambiguous extradyadic behaviour causes emotional distress in the participant and whether they would break up with the actor following ambiguous extradyadic behaviour. \n", "study_type": "Survey"}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href":
