Our central research question is under what conditions do people demand protection in the form of restrictive trade and immigration policies, rather than protection in the form of the welfare state? We experimentally test whether compensatory mechanisms increase public support for economic openness in the contemporary US context. Unlike previous experimental work on the topic, our study examines a range of different compensatory mechanisms (social insurance, social assistance, social investment, and welfare chauvinist policies), with the expectation that support for embedded liberalism depends on the type of compensatory policy offered. Drawing on a strong scholarly consensus that education is of central importance in explaining support for both compensatory government spending and economic openness, we also examine how education affects support for embedded liberalism. We expect on the whole that education increases the likelihood that an individual seeks economic protection through compensatory state spending rather than through restrictive trade or immigration policies. Furthermore, we test separate exploratory hypotheses about what type of compensatory spending is most important at different levels of education. Finally, we examine whether individual support for embedded liberalism is sensitive to different sources of economic threat. Notwithstanding recent work highlighting how people tend to misattribute threats from automation to globalization, we expect policy preferences to respond rationally to the source of economic risk. In other words, we expect that people are more likely to prefer protectionist trade and immigration policies to compensatory spending when primed with the threat of immigration, rather than when primed with the threat of automation."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1a Protectionist trade and immigration policies are stronger predictors of policy package choice when they form part of a policy package alongside less compensatory social policies.

This points to a trade-off between deficits and austerity in fiscal policymaking.

In April, 2018 the Brazilian Congress is expected to vote a new bill that will regulate lobbying activity.

For instance, it will be mandatory for deputies and senators to disclose any meetings with representatives from the private sector, expenditures related to those meetings, or presents and donations received. After several meetings, the NGO Movement Brazil Competitive - which assembles 51 of the largest companies in the country - has agreed to participate in the experiment.
