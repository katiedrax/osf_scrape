understand a given speaker over time. For second language- (L2-) accented speech, this perceptual adaptation can be facilitated by exposure to a single accented speaker, by exposure to multiple speakers with the same accent, or even by exposure to a variety of speakers with different accents (Bradlow &amp; Bent, 2008; Sidaras, Alexander, &amp; Nygaard, 2009; Baese-Berk, Bradlow, &amp; Wright, 2013). In addition to improving listener recognition of speech (i.e., intelligibility), cognitive processing load also rapidly decreases with exposure to L2-accented speech (Brown, McLaughlin, Strand, &amp; Van Engen, under review). \n\nThe present study aims to measure adaptation to unfamiliar accented speech over multiple days using a dual-task paradigm to measure cognitive processing load. Days 1 and 5 will be pre- and post-test days, respectively, and Days 2, 3, and 4 will be training days. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: control (no exposure to accent or feedback during training), exposure (exposure to accent but no feedback during training), and feedback (exposure to accent and feedback during training).
