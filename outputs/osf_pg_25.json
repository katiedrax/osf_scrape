Khalsa"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a condition that is characterized by persistent worry and anxiety about numerous events that is disproportionate to their likely impact (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Barlow et al., 1986). Individuals with GAD find that this anxiety is difficult to control, and that their worries are commonly associated with heightened physiological arousal, muscle tension, fatigue, headaches, and/or sleep disturbances (Hoge et al., 2012). However, the neurobiology underlying GAD is poorly understood, and the role of specific brain networks in relation to the disorder has received little attention.  \nIn the following we will outline what networks and parts of the brain we consider as worthwhile to include in our analysis of functional correlativity (FC; also commonly referred to as \u2018functional connectivity\u2019) in GAD. We subsequently list specific hypotheses deriving from the available literature that can be tested.\n\n\nResting state networks implicated in GAD\n\nDefault mode network\n\nThe default mode network (DMN) is hypothesized to be active during resting-states of mind, when there is no specific mental task to complete. It is considered to be responsible for mind wandering, daydreaming or generating stimulus-independent thoughts, while being deactivated during stimulus-driven cognitive tasks (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010). The DMN is commonly considered to include the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) with adjacent precuneus and lateral parietal cortices (Gusnard et al., 2001; Raichle, 2015; Raichle et al., 2001). In GAD the functional correlativity at rest within the DMN has not been extensively investigated. To our knowledge only one study has reported decreased FC between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the vmPFC (Andreescu et al., 2014). \n\nSalience network\n\nAnother well-described resting-state functional network in the human brain is the salience network (SN). Anatomically it consists of the anterior insula (AI), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), as well as three subcortical structures: the amygdala, ventral striatum and the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (Seeley et al., 2007). The SN shows activation across conditions that require perceptual awareness, acting \u201clike a switch\u201d to focus the attention on behaviorally relevant stimuli which are necessary for a wide range of cognitive tasks (Menon, 2015). In this paper Menon et al. suggest the inclusion of the posterior insula (PI) to the SN, although a separate \u2018posterior salience network\u2019 involving the posterior insula and somatosensory cortices has also been suggested (Shirer et al., 2012).\nMany studies of GAD have examined FC within individual regions in the SN, reporting decreased FC between the amygdala and (i) lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC; encompassing both the ventral and dorsal aspects) and (ii) anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (Hilbert et al., 2014; Mochcovitch et al., 2014). Few studies have examined the SN as a whole, with only one GAD study showing no aberrant connectivity (Rabany et al., 2017). Though not comprehensively examined in GAD, recent findings suggest that the SN is tightly linked both anatomically and functionally to networks of executive control (e.g. the cingulo-opercular network) (Seeley, 2019). It is therefore plausible that a difficulty of regulating anxiety in individuals with GAD could be linked dysfunction within components of a network (such as the SN) and that dysfunction could also be spread across other networks (Menon, 2011).\n\nCentral Executive Network\n\nThe Central Executive Network (CEN) is hypothesized to include the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as well as the posterior parietal cortex (PPC; Menon, 2011). Other authors also include the ventrolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex as parts of the CEN (Seeley et al., 2007).\nThe CEN is reported to be activated during tasks that are cognitively demanding (e.g. working memory, attention) and it\u2019s activation is additionally coupled with a decrease in activation in the DMN (Bressler &amp; Menon, 2010; Greicius et al., 2003; Sridharan et al., 2008). Studies have shown greater task-related dlPFC activation in individuals with high trait anxiety, a characteristic of GAD, than in healthy comparisons, suggesting a greater effort is necessary to carry out cognitively demanding tasks in such individuals (Basten et al., 2011).\nDuring resting conditions, Etkin and collaborators found increased FC between the dlPFC and amygdala in individuals with GAD relative to HCs while reporting no differences in FC of the amygdala to the PPC (Etkin et al., 2009). Given the difficulty controlling anxiety and worry in individuals with GAD, it is conceivable that the CEN as a core resting-state network for this function could exhibit impaired functional connectivity at rest.\n\n\nIndividual brain regions implicated in GAD\n\nInsular cortex\n\nThe insular cortex is a region of the brain that has been increasingly investigated in recent years. The insular cortex serves as a primary hub connecting large-scale brain networks due to its wide-range structural connectivity across brain areas like the parietal lobe (most importantly angular gyrus, precuneus, superior parietal lobule, somatosensory cortex) and limbic areas (gyrus parahippocampalis, ACC, PCC; Ghaziri et al., 2017).\nFunctionally, the human insula appears to play a central role in the sensing and perception of internal bodily states (i.e., interoception) (Craig, 2002; Hassanpour et al., 2018a; Khalsa et al., 2009). Zaki and colleagues suggest a role of the anterior insula (AI) during interoception and emotional experience (Zaki et al., 2012). Another publication suggests a role of the mid-posterior insula in stimulus-driven interoceptive awareness, comparing an anticipated interoceptive signal from the AI with the actual interoceptive sensations and relaying the result of this comparison as a \u201cprediction-error\u201d back to visceromotor regions, including the AI (Barrett &amp; Simmons, 2015).\nSeveral studies investigating the FC of the human insular cortex have suggested a tripartite parcellation, with an \u201cemotional\u201d ventral anterior insula (vAI), a \u201ccognitive\u201d dorsal anterior insula (dAI), and a \u201csomato-sensory\u201d posterior insula (PI) \u2013 although this simple model is admittedly overly general (Deen et al., 2011; Gogolla, 2017; Uddin et al., 2014).\nAnother way to parcellate the insular cortex is by its underlying cellular architecture. This is reasonable as the homologous histological separation has been described in monkeys recurrently (Evrard, 2019; Mesulam &amp; Mufson, 1982; Strigo &amp; Craig, 2016). In humans it is suggested that the posterior part of the insula can be divided in two granular subregions in the dorsal posterior area and a dysgranular area located in the ventral posterior area (Uddin et al., 2017). The \u201cBrainnetome\u201d, an atlas recently made available, allows for a more detailed \u2013 but probabilistic \u2013 cytoarchitectonic distinction of the human insula, additionally describing a ventral agranular part and a \u201cmid\u201d-insula with a dysgranular/granular part (Fan et al., 2016).\nIn GAD, studies have shown that the entire insula exhibits increased FC with the amygdala and mostly decreased FC with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Kolesar et al., 2019; Qiao et al., 2017). A recent publication that has examined the role of the insula in GAD identified lateralized reduced FC of the left AI to the left medial PFC and the left PI to the right medial PFC. Further, the left AI showed reduced FC to bilateral putamen, whereas the right AI had reduced FC to bilateral precentral gyrus, right lingual gyrus, left supplementary motor cortex, left superior temporal cortex and the brain stem (Cui et al., 2020). Given the described abnormality of interoception in individuals with GAD (Khalsa et al., 2018; Pang et al., 2019; Paulus &amp; Stein, 2010) and the insula playing a key role in interoceptive processing as outlined above, it is plausible that in individuals with GAD will show aberrant insula FC at rest. Thus, a better understanding of functional networks in GAD may emerge by examining insular FC to numerous regions across the brain.\n\nAmygdala\n\nThe role of the amygdala in anxiety, response to fear and detection of potential threats has been well described. (Di et al., 2017; Feinstein et al., 2011; LeDoux, 2000). And because of the amygdala\u2019s role in processing homeostatic threat and relaying sensory inputs, it has been thoroughly investigated in GAD. The results have been conflicting however. A meta-analysis of task-based fMRI studies in GAD found increased, decreased, or no different activation in individuals with GAD in reaction to exteroceptive emotional stimuli (e.g. fearful faces; Mochcovitch et al., 2014). In two other meta-analyses considering the FC of the amygdala, mixed results for FC at rest were shown to several regions (Hilbert et al., 2014; Kolesar et al., 2019). For example, increased and decreased amygdala FC were reported for the dlPFC, ventrolateral PFC, ACC, cerebellum and insula, amongst others. However, in individual studies the amygdala has been reported to have increased FC with the medial PFC and the insula in adolescents (Roy et al., 2013), as well as with the temporal pole in adults (Li et al., 2016). The temporal pole is hypothesized to play a role in theory of mind, in visual processing, and in remembering events from the personal past (Olson et al., 2007; Wong &amp; Gallate, 2012).\nOn a different note, several studies of individuals with bilateral amygdala lesions show evidence that the amygdala is not required for experiencing interoceptively driven anxiety (Feinstein et al., 2013; Khalsa et al., 2016). This raises questions about which interoceptive versus exteroceptive pathways produce anxiety and panic in the human brain, and the extent to which the amygdala is involved. \nIt also suggests that examining amygdala FC in relation to interoceptive as well as exteroceptive processes may refine our understanding of its precise contributions to different fear states.\n\nDorsal anterior cingulate cortex\n\nAs the clinical picture of GAD contains the inability to properly execute top-down attentional control, the underlying neural signal supporting such functions are of interest. In this regard, determining whether the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC; another part of the SN) is abnormal in GAD is of interest. Decreased activation in the dACC during emotion regulation tasks validate this connection (Blair et al., 2012). Other task-based studies in GAD have shown activation in the ACC during worry-induction which was persistent even in resting state (Paulesu et al., 2010). In a recent meta-analysis results for FC between the ACC and other brain regions have been mixed, showing both increased and decreased FC, with a tendency towards reduced FC between the ACC and the amygdala in individuals with GAD (Kolesar et al., 2019).\n\nVentromedial and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex\n\nThe ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) has been described as a brain region central to the generation and regulation of emotion, social cognition and value-based decision making (Delgado et al., 2016; Hiser &amp; Koenigs, 2018). The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) has been hypothesized to play a key role in processing psychological states (Mitchell et al., 2005). When considering the vmPFC and dmPFC in a hierarchical structure (Smith et al., 2017), they are connected to both interoceptive systems as well as networks of executive control. If the insula acts as a \u201cdysfunctional hub\u201d (Menon, 2011) in GAD this would also be expected to have impact on the connectivity of related brain regions like the vmPFC and the dmPFC. \nTask-based fMRI studies of GAD have found reduced activation of the dmPFC during cognitive modulation of emotion (Mochcovitch et al., 2014), as well as the suggestion of a role of fear inhibition for the vmPFC, which has showed increased activity during generalized stimuli (i.e. inhibiting fear) in comparison to conditioned fear stimuli (i.e. not inhibiting fear; Greenberg et al., 2013). A very recent resting-state study observed increased FC between the vmPFC and the left basolateral amygdala (Porta-Caster\u00e0s et al., 2020) in line with previous findings (Etkin et al., 2009). These findings suggest that individuals with GAD are not able to properly execute fear-inhibition and cognitive modulation due to impaired functionality of the vmPFC and the dmPFC respectively. Examining the FC of these regions at rest can improve our understanding of their role in GAD. \n\n\nPrimary hypotheses regarding brain regions and resting state networks in GAD\n\n\n1.\tAberrant functional correlativity within the Default Mode Network\nWe hypothesize that functional correlativity (FC) between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the (i) ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and (ii) the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is going to be significantly reduced in individuals with GAD versus healthy comparisons. \n\n2.\tAberrant functional correlativity within the Salience Network\nWe expect to find decreased FC between the agranular insula and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC).\n\n3.\tAberrant functional correlativity within the Central Executive Network\nWe expect to see increased FC between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the amygdala.\n\n4.\tAberrant functional correlativity in the insular cortex\nWe expect to observe decreased FC of both the (i) agranular insula (ii) granular insula with the vmPFC. Our analysis of bilateral relationships for the insula will be judiciously supplemented with a lateralized approach as indicated by a recent study (Cui et al., 2020) and our own, unpublished data.\n\n5.\tAberrant functional correlativity in the amygdala\nWe hypothesize that FC of the amygdala with the dACC will be decreased, but that FC will be increased between the amygdala and (i) bilateral temporal pole, (ii) vmPFC, (iii) agranular insula and (iv) granular insula.\n\n\nPrimary hypotheses regarding influence of amygdala lesions on resting state brain networks\n\nIn an individual in our sample with bilateral amygdala lesion (described in detail in Feinstein et al., 2013; Khalsa et al., 2016) we expect to find an increased functional correlativity between the (i) agranular and granular insula and (ii) between the vmPFC and the (a) agranular insula as well as (b) granular insula in contrast to healthy comparisons. We consider further exploration of these hypotheses in relation to individuals with GAD as well, because these follow-up analyses could provide added interpretability to our results.\n\nSecondary hypotheses regarding brain regions and resting state networks in GAD\n\nUsing a secondary, exploratory approach, we hypothesize that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the granular and agranular insula and the caudate will show aberrant FC in a seed-base whole brain voxelwise analysis. We hypothesize that the seeds generated from significant clusters from our task-based fMRI-analysis (see Methods-section for further explanation) will also show aberrant FC in seed-based whole brain voxelwise analyses.\n"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

This data has been previously collected as part of an ongoing series of experiments (methodology as summarized in Hassanpour et al., 2018).\nFor our primary analysis we focus on hypothesis-derived regions of interest (ROI) in the brain (for ROIs see hypotheses section). In addition to using widespread null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) we will further validate our results by calculating a correlation matrix with Bayesian statistics (Chen, B\u00fcrkner, et al., 2019) and compare the results. From this approach we expect to improve the interpretability of our results by overcoming common issues with null hypothesis testing (NHST) such as high susceptibility to false positives under multiple comparisons, \u201chiding\u201d results (e.g. not reporting results that are just above the significance-threshold), the inability to provide evidence of a null result, and the generally questionable informative power of the p-value (Chen, Xiao, et al., 2019).\nAfter analyzing our hypothesis-derived correlations and comparisons we will follow up with a secondary analysis using a seed-based, whole-brain, voxel-wise correlation approach. For this analysis we will employ pre-defined specific ROIs as seeds, namely the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, granular and agranular insula. These pre-defined ROIs will be supplemented by seeds generated from significant clusters from task-based analysis (described in detail in of data collected during the same experimental session. These secondary exploratory analyses will allow us to test for relationships that may have been overlooked with our hypothesis-driven approach in the first analysis.\nWe will subsequently examine relationships between FC variables and GAD symptom severity (e.g. GAD-7 scores)."}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Tables_hypotheses_online.PNG"}, "nodeId": "vf7s4", "sha256": "cb1e0b1b10f401311a9628c884801ea58557c54602716c5441e8fcf5555709be", "viewUrl": "/project/j29qv/files/osfstorage/5e98c3444301660548a0a053/", "selectedFileName": "Tables_hypotheses_online.PNG"}, {"data": {"name": "Visualized_hypotheses_online.PNG"}, "nodeId": "vf7s4", "sha256": "dbbe1d5cac6903b937dc029594873afa59f4a350b8d21975306cce3a4278bdab", "viewUrl": "/project/j29qv/files/osfstorage/5e98c3434301660548a0a050/", "selectedFileName": "Visualized_hypotheses_online.PNG"}, {"data": {"name": "04_08_20_Correlated activity in generalized anxiety disorder - a resting-state fMRI approach - Preregistration.pdf"}, "nodeId": "vf7s4", "sha256": "4f991a9aa2dfc758fa0a196aff4fe65bd4ae9368cae2d395f3ff9413e2614c8a", "viewUrl": "/project/j29qv/files/osfstorage/5e98c3434301660548a0a04e/", "selectedFileName": "04_08_20_Correlated activity in generalized anxiety disorder - a resting-state fMRI approach - Preregistration.pdf"}], "value": ""}}}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": "All study participants received randomized double-blinded and placebo controlled bolus infusions of isoproterenol (0.5 and 2 micrograms) and saline, after completing the resting state fMRI scan with the eyes open.

Khalsa", "q2": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a condition that is characterized by persistent worry and anxiety about numerous events that is disproportionate to their likely impact (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Barlow et al., 1986). Individuals with GAD find that this anxiety is difficult to control, and that their worries are commonly associated with heightened physiological arousal, muscle tension, fatigue, headaches, and/or sleep disturbances (Hoge et al., 2012). However, the neurobiology underlying GAD is poorly understood, and the role of specific brain networks in relation to the disorder has received little attention.  \nIn the following we will outline what networks and parts of the brain we consider as worthwhile to include in our analysis of functional correlativity (FC; also commonly referred to as \u2018functional connectivity\u2019) in GAD. We subsequently list specific hypotheses deriving from the available literature that can be tested.\n\n\nResting state networks implicated in GAD\n\nDefault mode network\n\nThe default mode network (DMN) is hypothesized to be active during resting-states of mind, when there is no specific mental task to complete. It is considered to be responsible for mind wandering, daydreaming or generating stimulus-independent thoughts, while being deactivated during stimulus-driven cognitive tasks (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010). The DMN is commonly considered to include the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) with adjacent precuneus and lateral parietal cortices (Gusnard et al., 2001; Raichle, 2015; Raichle et al., 2001). In GAD the functional correlativity at rest within the DMN has not been extensively investigated. To our knowledge only one study has reported decreased FC between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the vmPFC (Andreescu et al., 2014). \n\nSalience network\n\nAnother well-described resting-state functional network in the human brain is the salience network (SN). Anatomically it consists of the anterior insula (AI), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), as well as three subcortical structures: the amygdala, ventral striatum and the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (Seeley et al., 2007). The SN shows activation across conditions that require perceptual awareness, acting \u201clike a switch\u201d to focus the attention on behaviorally relevant stimuli which are necessary for a wide range of cognitive tasks (Menon, 2015). In this paper Menon et al. suggest the inclusion of the posterior insula (PI) to the SN, although a separate \u2018posterior salience network\u2019 involving the posterior insula and somatosensory cortices has also been suggested (Shirer et al., 2012).\nMany studies of GAD have examined FC within individual regions in the SN, reporting decreased FC between the amygdala and (i) lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC; encompassing both the ventral and dorsal aspects) and (ii) anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (Hilbert et al., 2014; Mochcovitch et al., 2014). Few studies have examined the SN as a whole, with only one GAD study showing no aberrant connectivity (Rabany et al., 2017). Though not comprehensively examined in GAD, recent findings suggest that the SN is tightly linked both anatomically and functionally to networks of executive control (e.g. the cingulo-opercular network) (Seeley, 2019). It is therefore plausible that a difficulty of regulating anxiety in individuals with GAD could be linked dysfunction within components of a network (such as the SN) and that dysfunction could also be spread across other networks (Menon, 2011).\n\nCentral Executive Network\n\nThe Central Executive Network (CEN) is hypothesized to include the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as well as the posterior parietal cortex (PPC; Menon, 2011). Other authors also include the ventrolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex as parts of the CEN (Seeley et al., 2007).\nThe CEN is reported to be activated during tasks that are cognitively demanding (e.g. working memory, attention) and it\u2019s activation is additionally coupled with a decrease in activation in the DMN (Bressler &amp; Menon, 2010; Greicius et al., 2003; Sridharan et al., 2008). Studies have shown greater task-related dlPFC activation in individuals with high trait anxiety, a characteristic of GAD, than in healthy comparisons, suggesting a greater effort is necessary to carry out cognitively demanding tasks in such individuals (Basten et al., 2011).\nDuring resting conditions, Etkin and collaborators found increased FC between the dlPFC and amygdala in individuals with GAD relative to HCs while reporting no differences in FC of the amygdala to the PPC (Etkin et al., 2009). Given the difficulty controlling anxiety and worry in individuals with GAD, it is conceivable that the CEN as a core resting-state network for this function could exhibit impaired functional connectivity at rest.\n\n\nIndividual brain regions implicated in GAD\n\nInsular cortex\n\nThe insular cortex is a region of the brain that has been increasingly investigated in recent years. The insular cortex serves as a primary hub connecting large-scale brain networks due to its wide-range structural connectivity across brain areas like the parietal lobe (most importantly angular gyrus, precuneus, superior parietal lobule, somatosensory cortex) and limbic areas (gyrus parahippocampalis, ACC, PCC; Ghaziri et al., 2017).\nFunctionally, the human insula appears to play a central role in the sensing and perception of internal bodily states (i.e., interoception) (Craig, 2002; Hassanpour et al., 2018a; Khalsa et al., 2009). Zaki and colleagues suggest a role of the anterior insula (AI) during interoception and emotional experience (Zaki et al., 2012). Another publication suggests a role of the mid-posterior insula in stimulus-driven interoceptive awareness, comparing an anticipated interoceptive signal from the AI with the actual interoceptive sensations and relaying the result of this comparison as a \u201cprediction-error\u201d back to visceromotor regions, including the AI (Barrett &amp; Simmons, 2015).\nSeveral studies investigating the FC of the human insular cortex have suggested a tripartite parcellation, with an \u201cemotional\u201d ventral anterior insula (vAI), a \u201ccognitive\u201d dorsal anterior insula (dAI), and a \u201csomato-sensory\u201d posterior insula (PI) \u2013 although this simple model is admittedly overly general (Deen et al., 2011; Gogolla, 2017; Uddin et al., 2014).\nAnother way to parcellate the insular cortex is by its underlying cellular architecture. This is reasonable as the homologous histological separation has been described in monkeys recurrently (Evrard, 2019; Mesulam &amp; Mufson, 1982; Strigo &amp; Craig, 2016). In humans it is suggested that the posterior part of the insula can be divided in two granular subregions in the dorsal posterior area and a dysgranular area located in the ventral posterior area (Uddin et al., 2017). The \u201cBrainnetome\u201d, an atlas recently made available, allows for a more detailed \u2013 but probabilistic \u2013 cytoarchitectonic distinction of the human insula, additionally describing a ventral agranular part and a \u201cmid\u201d-insula with a dysgranular/granular part (Fan et al., 2016).\nIn GAD, studies have shown that the entire insula exhibits increased FC with the amygdala and mostly decreased FC with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Kolesar et al., 2019; Qiao et al., 2017). A recent publication that has examined the role of the insula in GAD identified lateralized reduced FC of the left AI to the left medial PFC and the left PI to the right medial PFC. Further, the left AI showed reduced FC to bilateral putamen, whereas the right AI had reduced FC to bilateral precentral gyrus, right lingual gyrus, left supplementary motor cortex, left superior temporal cortex and the brain stem (Cui et al., 2020). Given the described abnormality of interoception in individuals with GAD (Khalsa et al., 2018; Pang et al., 2019; Paulus &amp; Stein, 2010) and the insula playing a key role in interoceptive processing as outlined above, it is plausible that in individuals with GAD will show aberrant insula FC at rest. Thus, a better understanding of functional networks in GAD may emerge by examining insular FC to numerous regions across the brain.\n\nAmygdala\n\nThe role of the amygdala in anxiety, response to fear and detection of potential threats has been well described. (Di et al., 2017; Feinstein et al., 2011; LeDoux, 2000). And because of the amygdala\u2019s role in processing homeostatic threat and relaying sensory inputs, it has been thoroughly investigated in GAD. The results have been conflicting however. A meta-analysis of task-based fMRI studies in GAD found increased, decreased, or no different activation in individuals with GAD in reaction to exteroceptive emotional stimuli (e.g. fearful faces; Mochcovitch et al., 2014). In two other meta-analyses considering the FC of the amygdala, mixed results for FC at rest were shown to several regions (Hilbert et al., 2014; Kolesar et al., 2019). For example, increased and decreased amygdala FC were reported for the dlPFC, ventrolateral PFC, ACC, cerebellum and insula, amongst others. However, in individual studies the amygdala has been reported to have increased FC with the medial PFC and the insula in adolescents (Roy et al., 2013), as well as with the temporal pole in adults (Li et al., 2016). The temporal pole is hypothesized to play a role in theory of mind, in visual processing, and in remembering events from the personal past (Olson et al., 2007; Wong &amp; Gallate, 2012).\nOn a different note, several studies of individuals with bilateral amygdala lesions show evidence that the amygdala is not required for experiencing interoceptively driven anxiety (Feinstein et al., 2013; Khalsa et al., 2016). This raises questions about which interoceptive versus exteroceptive pathways produce anxiety and panic in the human brain, and the extent to which the amygdala is involved. \nIt also suggests that examining amygdala FC in relation to interoceptive as well as exteroceptive processes may refine our understanding of its precise contributions to different fear states.\n\nDorsal anterior cingulate cortex\n\nAs the clinical picture of GAD contains the inability to properly execute top-down attentional control, the underlying neural signal supporting such functions are of interest. In this regard, determining whether the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC; another part of the SN) is abnormal in GAD is of interest. Decreased activation in the dACC during emotion regulation tasks validate this connection (Blair et al., 2012). Other task-based studies in GAD have shown activation in the ACC during worry-induction which was persistent even in resting state (Paulesu et al., 2010). In a recent meta-analysis results for FC between the ACC and other brain regions have been mixed, showing both increased and decreased FC, with a tendency towards reduced FC between the ACC and the amygdala in individuals with GAD (Kolesar et al., 2019).\n\nVentromedial and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex\n\nThe ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) has been described as a brain region central to the generation and regulation of emotion, social cognition and value-based decision making (Delgado et al., 2016; Hiser &amp; Koenigs, 2018). The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) has been hypothesized to play a key role in processing psychological states (Mitchell et al., 2005). When considering the vmPFC and dmPFC in a hierarchical structure (Smith et al., 2017), they are connected to both interoceptive systems as well as networks of executive control. If the insula acts as a \u201cdysfunctional hub\u201d (Menon, 2011) in GAD this would also be expected to have impact on the connectivity of related brain regions like the vmPFC and the dmPFC. \nTask-based fMRI studies of GAD have found reduced activation of the dmPFC during cognitive modulation of emotion (Mochcovitch et al., 2014), as well as the suggestion of a role of fear inhibition for the vmPFC, which has showed increased activity during generalized stimuli (i.e. inhibiting fear) in comparison to conditioned fear stimuli (i.e. not inhibiting fear; Greenberg et al., 2013). A very recent resting-state study observed increased FC between the vmPFC and the left basolateral amygdala (Porta-Caster\u00e0s et al., 2020) in line with previous findings (Etkin et al., 2009). These findings suggest that individuals with GAD are not able to properly execute fear-inhibition and cognitive modulation due to impaired functionality of the vmPFC and the dmPFC respectively. Examining the FC of these regions at rest can improve our understanding of their role in GAD. \n\n\nPrimary hypotheses regarding brain regions and resting state networks in GAD\n\n\n1.\tAberrant functional correlativity within the Default Mode Network\nWe hypothesize that functional correlativity (FC) between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the (i) ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and (ii) the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is going to be significantly reduced in individuals with GAD versus healthy comparisons. \n\n2.\tAberrant functional correlativity within the Salience Network\nWe expect to find decreased FC between the agranular insula and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC).\n\n3.\tAberrant functional correlativity within the Central Executive Network\nWe expect to see increased FC between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the amygdala.\n\n4.\tAberrant functional correlativity in the insular cortex\nWe expect to observe decreased FC of both the (i) agranular insula (ii) granular insula with the vmPFC. Our analysis of bilateral relationships for the insula will be judiciously supplemented with a lateralized approach as indicated by a recent study (Cui et al., 2020) and our own, unpublished data.\n\n5.\tAberrant functional correlativity in the amygdala\nWe hypothesize that FC of the amygdala with the dACC will be decreased, but that FC will be increased between the amygdala and (i) bilateral temporal pole, (ii) vmPFC, (iii) agranular insula and (iv) granular insula.\n\n\nPrimary hypotheses regarding influence of amygdala lesions on resting state brain networks\n\nIn an individual in our sample with bilateral amygdala lesion (described in detail in Feinstein et al., 2013; Khalsa et al., 2016) we expect to find an increased functional correlativity between the (i) agranular and granular insula and (ii) between the vmPFC and the (a) agranular insula as well as (b) granular insula in contrast to healthy comparisons. We consider further exploration of these hypotheses in relation to individuals with GAD as well, because these follow-up analyses could provide added interpretability to our results.\n\nSecondary hypotheses regarding brain regions and resting state networks in GAD\n\nUsing a secondary, exploratory approach, we hypothesize that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the granular and agranular insula and the caudate will show aberrant FC in a seed-base whole brain voxelwise analysis. We hypothesize that the seeds generated from significant clusters from our task-based fMRI-analysis (see Methods-section for further explanation) will also show aberrant FC in seed-based whole brain voxelwise analyses.\n", "q3": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

This data has been previously collected as part of an ongoing series of experiments (methodology as summarized in Hassanpour et al., 2018).\nFor our primary analysis we focus on hypothesis-derived regions of interest (ROI) in the brain (for ROIs see hypotheses section). In addition to using widespread null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) we will further validate our results by calculating a correlation matrix with Bayesian statistics (Chen, B\u00fcrkner, et al., 2019) and compare the results. From this approach we expect to improve the interpretability of our results by overcoming common issues with null hypothesis testing (NHST) such as high susceptibility to false positives under multiple comparisons, \u201chiding\u201d results (e.g. not reporting results that are just above the significance-threshold), the inability to provide evidence of a null result, and the generally questionable informative power of the p-value (Chen, Xiao, et al., 2019).\nAfter analyzing our hypothesis-derived correlations and comparisons we will follow up with a secondary analysis using a seed-based, whole-brain, voxel-wise correlation approach. For this analysis we will employ pre-defined specific ROIs as seeds, namely the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, granular and agranular insula. These pre-defined ROIs will be supplemented by seeds generated from significant clusters from task-based analysis (described in detail in of data collected during the same experimental session. These secondary exploratory analyses will allow us to test for relationships that may have been overlooked with our hypothesis-driven approach in the first analysis.\nWe will subsequently examine relationships between FC variables and GAD symptom severity (e.g. GAD-7 scores).", "q6.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e98c3444301660548a0a053", "file_name": "Tables_hypotheses_online.PNG", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/j29qv/files/osfstorage/5e98c3444301660548a0a053", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e98c3444301660548a0a053"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "cb1e0b1b10f401311a9628c884801ea58557c54602716c5441e8fcf5555709be"}}, {"file_id": "5e98c3434301660548a0a050", "file_name": "Visualized_hypotheses_online.PNG", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/j29qv/files/osfstorage/5e98c3434301660548a0a050", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e98c3434301660548a0a050"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "dbbe1d5cac6903b937dc029594873afa59f4a350b8d21975306cce3a4278bdab"}}, {"file_id": "5e98c3434301660548a0a04e", "file_name": "04_08_20_Correlated activity in generalized anxiety disorder - a resting-state fMRI approach - Preregistration.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/j29qv/files/osfstorage/5e98c3434301660548a0a04e", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e98c3434301660548a0a04e"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "4f991a9aa2dfc758fa0a196aff4fe65bd4ae9368cae2d395f3ff9413e2614c8a"}}], "q10.question": "Participants were recruited from the local community through advertisements as well as the LIBR study participant database.

their children?", "description": "Nurseries, kindergartens, and schools are shut down until further notice in many countries. Many parents are forced to work from home and are additionally burdened by home-schooling and supervising their children full-time next to their regular workload and managing the household. Furthermore, there is the fear of the future, financially struggling, and health-related anxiety that stresses many people. COVID-19 affects the life of parents worldwide. Therefore, we would like to assess how the experience and the behaviour of parents and their children are affected by the current corona pandemic. Using an online questionnaire we want to evaluate the magnitude of stress in the parent-child system (using the German version of the Parenting Stress Index; EBI; Tr\u00f6ster, 2010) and identifying the frequency of conflicts in the family (FKS, Familien-Klima-Skalen, Engfer, Schneewind, Klaus, Hinderer, 1977). Besides, we would like to asses how everyday life of children in social-distancing times is influenced (occupations, worries, what they look forward to after Corona). We are particularly interested in the progression of those variables over time. We, therefore, plan to contact the parents once a week and answer the same questions. We hope that this survey will make a valuable contribution to understanding the current challenges induced by the corona pandemic and thereby laying the foundations for the following preventive measures.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-06T08:35:34.798655", "date_modified": "2020-04-19T05:04:42.343700", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "0f3c388082c55e9503d8da2cf5b7f2a7869cab5ff5ab27d5470c902ecb2a324d4e5adf139b84c904de7373305669a98d9aa0386e57b830fa9532815482928d07ac77e5a8f4abee847350efac946b606e7708d0c30e30160c3608fd0cd8744a4a6fe3f5baf8cdac0f88af2da309463967e4da11e67b137c2e5f79ddb673854d8d8cee97bea4a7b4ce7287ec2a07794c89", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-06T08:35:34.781800", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Samantha Ehli, Dr. Babett Voigt"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Parental stress is higher in COVID-19 crisis compared to a norm sample before Corona crisis.\nParental stress is increasing over time during COVID-19 crisis.\nConflict frequency in families increases over time during COVID-19 crisis.\nChildren spent their free time differently since COVID-19 started.\n"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

Background\n\nGenetic or environmental stressors may cause a breakdown in developmental homeostasis, which can result (amongst other things) in a departure from perfect symmetry in the morphology of paired traits.  These random deviations, known as \u2018fluctuating asymmetry\u2019, are typically of small magnitude, and are frequently utilised by researchers as a proxy measure of developmental instability.  Evidence in support of this idea comes from the observation that elevated levels of fluctuating asymmetry are associated with clinical conditions for which atypical developmental trajectories are implicated (e.g. schizophrenia [Reilly et al., 2001]; autism [de Bruin, Graham, Louwerse, &amp; Huizink, 2014]).  A better understanding of the developmental origins of fluctuating asymmetry may therefore provide useful insights into a wide range of important phenotypic outcomes.\n\nVariations in hormonal exposure have been implicated in the development of fluctuating asymmetry (Benderlioglu, 2010), though many gaps in our knowledge of the relevant processes remain.  However, considering that high levels of stress during pregnancy are detrimental to various developmental processes, elevated foetal stress hormone exposure can be predicted to result in the subsequent emergence of an asymmetrical phenotype, and indeed experimental animal research (Eriksen, Haug, Torjesen, &amp; Bakken, 2003; Newell-Morris, Fahrenbruch, &amp; Sackett, 1989; Satterlee, Hester, LeRay, &amp; Schmidt, 2008) supports this premise.  Although research of this nature cannot be conducted in humans for obvious ethical reasons, preliminary data to suggest that similar processes may be at work have been provided by King et al. (2009).  These researchers demonstrated that prenatal stress introduced by a natural disaster (the 1998 Quebec Ice Storm) was associated with greater levels of dermatoglyphic asymmetry in fingertip ridge counts of infants whose mothers were exposed during gestational weeks 14-22 compare to those whose mothers were exposed during non-target (other) gestational weeks.  Additionally, those infants within the target group whose mothers had a higher subjective stress response to the ice storm showed significantly greater dermatoglyphic asymmetry than those whose mothers reported a less severe response.\n\nAlthough elevated prenatal exposure to stress hormones is implicated in the development of an asymmetrical phenotype, no published studies have yet examined whether typical variations in foetal cortisol exposure are associated with subsequent variance in fluctuating asymmetry in humans.  The proposed study will therefore examine whether mid-trimester amniotic cortisol levels are associated with subsequent fluctuating asymmetry in finger lengths within three cohorts of children from the UK, Portugal, and Germany.\n\n\n2. Methods\n\nThe current project aims to investigate whether fluctuating asymmetry in finger lengths is correlated with prenatal cortisol exposure as measured via amniocentesis.  To this end, we will analyse three separate cohorts spanning three countries: the UK, Portugal, and Germany.  While some heterogeneity exists between the three cohorts, similar measures were recorded, so meta-analysis of the effect sizes observed in each should yield a robust study of the relationship between amniotic cortisol exposure and fluctuating asymmetry.\n\n2.1 Sample 1: D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany\n\nFor the German dataset, digit lengths were tracked longitudinally in infants initially from around 5 months of age to 70 months of age.  All finger length measurements (2D, 3D, 4D, and 5D) were measured from photocopies by two independent raters using Autometric (DeBruine, 2006).  Covariates collected for this cohort include maternal age, and sex of the infant.  Further details relating to this cohort can be found in K\u00f6rner et al. (2019) and K\u00f6rner, Schaper, Pause, and Heil (2020).\n\n2.2 Sample 2: London, UK\n\nWithin the UK dataset, all measurements of digit length (2D and 4D) were taken between 473 and 568 days post-partum.  Digit lengths were taken by two separate researchers, and provided as an average of the two.  Alongside these key variables, a number of covariates were recorded, which include maternal age, gestational age of the infant at amniocentesis, sex of the infant, birth weight, ethnicity of the mother, BMI of the mother, cigarette and alcohol intake during pregnancy, antenatal stressful life events, and the presence of several medical conditions (anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, eating disorders, and metabolic disorders).  Further details relating to this cohort are provided in Bergman, Glover, Sarkar, Abbott, and O\u2019Connor (2010).\n\n2.3 Sample 3: Lisbon, Portugal\n\nWithin the Portuguese dataset, digit lengths (2D and 4D) were measured from photocopies created shortly after birth (range = 2.35-541.32 hours post-partum), with average values being calculated from the measurements of two researchers.  Other covariates recorded include maternal age, gestational age of partum, gestational age of the infant at amniocentesis, ethnicity of mother, infant weight, and sex of the infant.  Further details relating to this cohort can be found in Ventura, Gomes, and Carreira (2012) and Ventura, Gomes, Pita, Neto, and Taylor (2013).\n\n2.4 Fluctuating asymmetry\n\nComposite standardised fluctuating asymmetry of 2D and 4D (and additionally 3D and 5D for the German dataset) will be calculated for each cohort as described by Voracek (2009, p .107).\n\n\n3. Hypotheses and analysis plan\n\nThe normality of distribution for the digit length and amniotic cortisol measures will be tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test for each cohort.  Assuming p is greater than 0.05, parametric hypothesis testing can be applied.  If p is smaller than 0.05, log transformation of the data will be applied, and normality will be retested on the log transformed data.  If the data are still considerably non-normally distributed, bootstrapped (10,000 samples) parametric analyses will be conducted using the original (i.e. non-transformed) variables.\n\nH1: Within the German data set, levels of composite fluctuating asymmetry measured longitudinally will increase over time, with measurements taken at 5M, 9M, 20M, 40M and 70M\n\uf0a7\tWe will apply repeated measures testing to investigate the within-individual comparisons across the months of recording.  As outlined by Palestis and Trivers (2016), a repeated-measures general linear model (GLM) analysis with level of fluctuating asymmetry recorded as the key outcome variable will be conducted for all individuals recorded over at least two different time points.  Assuming the repeated measure (months post-partum of recording) is statistically significant (i.e. p is smaller than 0.05), this will be taken as evidence of within-individual changes in fluctuating asymmetry with age.  Within the GLM, the interaction between amniotic cortisol and age at fluctuating asymmetry measurement (i.e. 5M, 9M, 20M, 40M, and 70M) will also be investigated, as theoretically it seems logical that if fluctuating asymmetry is to increase over time, high cortisol exposure could increase the rate of that change.  These relationships will initially be investigated at the univariate level, and then with maternal age and sex of the infant included as covariates.\n\nH2: Mid-trimester amniotic cortisol exposure will correlate positively with composite fluctuating asymmetry within the German dataset\n\uf0a7\tIf no evidence for H1 is found, average fluctuating asymmetry scores for 2D, 3D, 4D, and 5D across 5M, 9M, 20M, 40M, and 70M will be calculated for each individual.  Not all participants were measured at all time points, so only applicable measurements can be summated.  Average fluctuating asymmetry scores will then be calculated by dividing the fluctuating asymmetry scores for each digit by the number of time-points at which it was measured.  Composite fluctuating asymmetry will then be calculated from these measurements using the formula specified by Voracek (2009).\n\uf0a7\tIf H1 is supported by the prior analysis and fluctuating asymmetry does appear to increase with time, the cross-section of age of measurement with the largest available sample size will be used to calculate composite fluctuating asymmetry using the formula specified by Voracek (2009).\n\uf0a7\tA Pearson\u2019s correlational analysis will be performed to examine the strength of the relationship between amniotic cortisol exposure and composite fluctuating asymmetry.\n\uf0a7\tA multiple linear regression model will be fitted with amniotic cortisol exposure as the predictor, composite fluctuating asymmetry as the outcome, and the following as covariates: maternal age, and sex of the infant (male or female).\n\nH3: Mid-trimester amniotic cortisol exposure will correlate positively with composite fluctuating asymmetry within the UK dataset\n\uf0a7\tA Pearson\u2019s correlational analysis will be performed to examine the strength of the relationship between amniotic cortisol exposure and composite fluctuating asymmetry.\n\uf0a7\tA multiple linear regression analysis will be fitted with amniotic cortisol exposure as the predictor, composite fluctuating asymmetry as the outcome, and the following as covariates: maternal age, gestational age of the infant at amniocentesis, sex of the infant (male or female), birth weight, ethnicity of the mother (White/Caucasian or not White/Caucasian), BMI of the mother, cigarette and alcohol intake during pregnancy (any intake or none), antenatal stressful life events (any or none), and the presence of several medical conditions (anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, eating disorders and metabolic disorders [presence of any or presence of none]).\n\nH4: Mid-trimester amniotic cortisol exposure will correlate positively with composite fluctuating asymmetry within the Portuguese dataset\n\uf0a7\tA Pearson\u2019s correlational analysis will be performed to examine the strength of the relationship between amniotic cortisol exposure and composite fluctuating asymmetry.\n\uf0a7\tA multiple linear regression analysis will be fitted with amniotic cortisol exposure as the predictor, composite fluctuating asymmetry as the outcome, and the following as covariates: maternal age, gestational age of partum, gestational age of the infant at amniocentesis, ethnicity of mother (White/Caucasian or not White/Caucasian), infant weight, and sex of the infant (male or female).\n\nH5: Meta-analysis of the effect size estimates for each cohort will provide robust evidence of a positive correlation between amniotic cortisol exposure and composite fluctuating asymmetry\n\uf0a7\tAs fluctuating asymmetry is a proximate measure of developmental instability and not the causal variable itself, the correlation between fluctuating asymmetry and amniotic cortisol exposure is expected to systematically underestimate the true strength of correlation between developmental instability and amniotic cortisol exposure.  Thus, it is imperative to use an appropriately powered study to investigate this hypothesised relationship.  We therefore intend to meta-analyse the individual effect sizes observed for each of the three cohorts.\n\uf0a7\tAssuming there is no major change when covariates are entered into the models for any of Study 1, 2, and 3, unadjusted effect sizes will be used.  If significant covariate effects are observed for any of Study 1, 2 or 3, Cohen\u2019s f2 will be calculated as the effect size from each of the multivariate analyses listed above for each cohort.\n\uf0a7\tA random-effects meta-analysis will be conducted using the R package metafor (Viechtbauer, 2010) to investigate the overall relationship between amniotic cortisol exposure and composite fluctuating asymmetry across the three cohorts.\n\n\nReferences\n\nBenderlioglu, Z.
