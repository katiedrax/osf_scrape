The primary outcome was the proportion of 12-month questionnaires returned. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of questionnaires completed and time to questionnaire return. Binary data were analysed using logistic regression and time to return using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) are presented, with associated 95% confidence intervals and p-values. \nResults: In total, 2308 participants were randomised into the SWAT. In the pen group, 1020/1146 (89.0%) of participants returned a questionnaire, compared to 982/1147 (85.6%) in the no pen group. The absolute difference in questionnaire return rate was 3.4% (95% CI: 0.7% to 6.1%; p=0.01). There were statistically significant differences in questionnaire return rate (OR 1.34; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.72; p=0.02), questionnaire completion rate (OR 1.39; 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.76; p&lt;0.01) and time to questionnaire return (HR 1.16; 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.27; p&lt;0.01) favouring the pen group.\nConclusion: This SWAT adds to the growing evidence base for whether pens are effective as an incentive for

Exploring a possible pathway by explaining the addictive components of Maladaptive Daydreaming. \n\nAuthors:\nGeorgia Lucassen, Tilburg University\nprof. dr. Stefan Bogaerts, Tilburg University\nprof. dr. Eli Somer, University of Haifa\n\nDescription + Research Questions:\nMaladaptive daydreaming (MD) is an excessive and vivid fantasy activity that interferes with individual\u2019s normal functioning and often both emerges from and results in severe distress (Schimmenti, Somer, &amp; Regis, 2019). Daydreaming provides individuals with the opportunity to reduce stress by creating idealized self-images (i.e., the grandiose self), compensating for daily life failures and can help process trauma, all without required social interaction. For some individuals, this elevating experience together with repetitive use can result in addictive behavior, where a tremendous amount in daydreaming is spend without being able to stop. The link between daydreaming and addiction can be made when individuals cannot stop daydreaming and become addicted to daydreams. In addition, daily life must become disturbed and at set of problems can arise, such as problems at work, psychological problems, problems with others and in the intimate relationship. Meaning, when daydreaming is exclusively used as an escape and source of enjoyment, excessive use can initiate a negative vicious cycle, eventually leading to addiction. Daydreams then are used to escape and seek comfort from stressors, only to result in further experience of distress including emotional and social difficulties. In turn, the emerged distress is counteracted with more daydreaming and goes paired with high indulgence to engage in fantasies and excitement, but also with irritation when being disturbed and frustration associated with avoiding confrontation with problems. These symptoms of tolerance, preoccupation, mood modification, withdrawal and conflict are similar to and often observed in other behavioral addictions (Pietkiewicz, N\u0119cki, Ba\u0144bura &amp; Tomalski, 2018). All in all, not surprisingly, MD-sufferers describe MD as an example of a behavioral addiction (Bigelsen &amp; Schupak, 2011). Despite this classification as mentioned by MD-sufferers, MD is currently lacking a clear description and little is known about possible developmental trajectories leading to MD. How could it be that for some individuals daydreaming is a harmless experience, while for others it evolves in the development of a behavioral addiction? This study will contribute to clearer definition, conceptualization and categorization of the maladaptive daydreaming phenomenon. In addition, this study will examine a possible pathway that might lead to MD by seeking to explain the evoking (e.g., individual characteristics and stress) and sustaining (e.g. habit formation and flow experience) mechanisms of MD.  \n\u2022\tCan MD be classified as behavioural addiction?\n\u2022\tWhich individual characteristics contribute to the development of MD?\n\u2022\tWhat sustains the repetition of MD while it clearly causes harm to the individual?\n\nDesign plan:\nThis study will use a mixed-methods approach of cross-sectional research. In this preregistration, both parts (quantitative and qualitative) will be described in detail separately. \n\nPART 1 : QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS\nHypotheses\nIn this research, in which we see maladaptive daydreaming as behavioural addiction, we predict that repetition of daydreaming activities, the flow experience and their combined interaction as an ultimate daydreaming experience, and an escape from stress would be positively associated with maladaptive daydreaming (MD). Furthermore, we also assume a positive association between narcissism, alexithymia, and childhood trauma with maladaptive daydreaming.\n\nModel 1:\nH1: The MDS-16 and the behavioural addiction scale can measure both the construct MD\n\nModel 2:\nH2: Repetition of daydreaming activities shows a positive association with MD\nH3: Flow experience in daydreaming activities shows a positive association with repetition and MD\nH4: Flow experience in daydreaming activities acts as the intermediary that allows for repetition to activate MD.\nH5: The flow experience during daydreaming is higher for MD-ers compared to non-MDers\n\nModel 3:\nH6: Flow experience acts as the intermediary between the individual differences, childhood trauma, alexithymia and covert narcissism MD\nH7a: Childhood trauma is positively associated with MD \nH7b: Alexithymia is positively associated with MD\nH7c: Covert narcissism is positively associated with MD\n\nMethods / Design plan \nIndependent variables:\n-\tCovert narcissism, trait alexithymia, childhood trauma, flow experience, behavioural repetition, all between-subjects. \n\nDependent variable:\n-\tMaladaptive daydreaming (both measured by the MDS-16 and by the addiction scale). \n\nPlanned Sample\nPre-selection rules:\nData will be collected from 2 groups, the maladaptive daydreaming group and a control group (non-MDers). To verify their condition, they are asked the following screening text at the start of the online questionnaire: \u201cDaydreaming is a universal human phenomenon that a majority of the individuals engage in on a daily basis. In this study, daydreaming is defined as fantastical mental images and visual stories/narratives that are not necessarily part of real life. Therefore, it does not refer to acts such as reminiscing over past events, planning for future activities such as a meeting with your boss, or thinking about your mental \u2018to do\u2019 list. Pure sexual fantasies are not included in this study. Examples of daydreams that can be included would be hanging out with a favourite celebrity, winning the Nobel Prize, telling off your boss after winning the lottery, having an affair with an attractive co-worker who isn\u2019t the slightest bit interested in you, living in a parallel fantasy world, engaging in heroic or rescue actions, speaking with historical figures, etc. Any daydreams involving fictional characters or plots can also be included. MD is defined as extensive daydreaming that replaces human interaction and/or interferes with academic, interpersonal or vocational functioning and/or creates emotional distress. According to this definition, is your daydreaming (a) normal or (b) maladaptive?\u201d (Somer et al. 2017; pp. 180\u2013181). The participant\u2019s subjective answers will determine whether there is presence of MD or not. Only participants answering (b) to this question are included in the MD group. Participants answering (a) are included in the non-MD-group. \n\nData collection \nFirst the participants in the MD group will be recruited. They will be recruited from online support groups, such as Daydream In Blue , Wild Minds Network, and the Facebook group of Maladaptive daydreaming. In these communities a call for participants will be posted and will additionally be sent out as an email invitation to members of MD listservs : Yahoo MD Forum. These email invitations will be done using systematic sampling (an email will be sent to each fifth subject in the list).  After data selection in this group is complete, the data collection for the non-MD group will start, aimed to include the same characteristics as the MD-group, including age, gender, and continent of residence. Data will be collected online using questionnaires in Qualtrics for both groups. \n\nSample size:\nAimed is to have an equal sample size per group with N= 200, in order to reach a total sample of N=400. Usually for conducting SEM analysis, N = 100-150 is considered the minimum sample size. For a reasonable simple EFA/CFA model, sample size is about N = 150 is required to perform a meaningful analysis (Muth\u00e9n &amp; Muth\u00e9n, 2002). Additionally, previous studies already show correlations of .22 with childhood trauma (Somer, Abu-Raya &amp; Simaan, 2019) and .39 with alexithymia (Schimmenti et al., 2019). A power analysis performed in G*power for regression with correlation coefficients of .22 and .39 also resulted in similar required sample sizes.  \n\nExclusion criteria\nFor the quantitative data, only any abnormal responses (e.g., extreme responses; only either low/high responses, the same answers on all the questions, short completion time or responses from the same individual) will be excluded. \n\nProcedure:\nAt the beginning of the online questionnaire, participants are informed about the study and they have to give active consent before participation. Then all questions about the variables will be presented (127 in total). Starting with demographic questions, followed by questions about individual characteristics (covert narcissism, alexithymia and childhood trauma) and ending with the questions about daydreaming experiences and the addictive components. At the end, the email address of the main researcher will be given in case participants have any questions or remarks. \n\nOrder of presentation: \nBackground variables: Gender (male, female, other), age (number) and continent of residence. \n\nCovert narcissism: Measured with the 23-item maladaptive covert narcissism scale (MCNS; Cheek, Hendin, &amp; Wink, 2013). Participants have to rate on a 5-point scale to what extent each item is true for them, ranging from (1) very untrue to (5) very true.\n\nAlexithymia: Measured with the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20; Bagby, Parker &amp;, Taylor, 1994). Participants have to rate on a 5-point scale to what extent each item is true for them, ranging from (1) strongly disagree to (5) strongly agree. \n\nChildhood trauma: Measured with the 28-item childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ;  Bernstein et al., 2003). Participants have to rate on a 5-point scale to what extent each item is true for them, ranging from (1) never true to (5) very often true. \n\nAddiction: Measured with a 10-item scale composed addiction scale (Gold &amp; Heffner, 1998; Griffiths, 1998). Participants have to rate on a 5-point scale to what extent the item fits their experience, ranging from (1) totally disagree to (5) totally agree. \n\nFlow experience: Measured with a 28-item composed flow experience scale (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975; Chou &amp; Ting, 2003; Ghani &amp; Deshpande, 1994; Holbrook, Chestnut, Oliva, &amp; Greenleaf, 1984; Novak, Hoffman, &amp; Yung, 2000). Participants have to rate on a -point scale to what extent the item fits their experience, ranging from (1) totally disagree to (5) totally agree. \n\nRepetition: Measured with 2 items (Chou &amp; Ting, 2003). Participants have to indicate to what extent they have been daydreaming actively. Measured by how many hours per day and for how many years. Reliability and validity of these items has not been addressed by the original authors. We will test this with test-retest as indicated in the analysis section of this pre-registration.   \n\nMaladaptive daydreaming: Measured with the 16-item maladaptive daydreaming scale (MDS-16; Somer, Lehrfeld, Jopp, &amp; Bigelsen, 2016). Participants have to rate on a 5-point scale to what extent the item fits their experience, ranging from (1) never to (5) very often. \n\nFor recruiting participants for the follow-up interviews, an additional question will be asked to participants in the MD-group only: \u201cPart of this study are additional in-depth interviews about the process behind daydreaming and the content of your daydreams. In case of interest in these interviews please sent me an email\u201d. \n\nIndices:\nIn model 3, for the variables covert narcissism, alexithymia, childhood trauma, addiction repetition and flow experience  a sum score of the items will be computed.\n\nAnalysis Plan\nStatistical models and hypothesis testing:\nA full structural equation model (SEM) analysis will be performed to estimate a fit of the proposed model(s). First, for model 1, a CFA will be performed to test hypothesis 1. Maladaptive daydreaming often has been described comparable to a behavioral addiction (Bigelsen &amp; Schupak, 2011), and therefore suggested to follow the pathway from stress and habit formation to behavioural addiction. According to this pathway, MD measured by the MDS-16 should measure the same latent construct as measured by the daydreaming addiction scale. Expected is that the latent variable (MD) will equally load on the two distinct measurement instruments (MDS-16 and the daydreaming addiction scale). When loadings are similar (same CI range), hypothesis one is confirmed.\n\nSecondly, to test the other hypotheses, SEM will be used to test two nested models. The first model will test the original pathway from Chou and Ting (2003), adjusted to maladaptive daydreaming. The second model includes the full model with additional individual characteristics. Childhood trauma, alexithymia and covert narcissism are all expected to be positively associated with MD and with the exception of alexithymia, are shown to be associated with addiction (Abu-Rayya, Somer &amp; Knane, 2019; Schimmenti, Sideli, La Marca, Gori &amp; Terrone, 2019). Therefore, expected is that the full model will have a better fit compared to the original model. Conclusions will be made based on model fit. \nModel fit will be examined using the chi-square test, with p-value &lt; 0.05. CFI, RMSEA and SRMR will be reported. Indices of a good fit are CFI values greater than .95, RMSEA values less than .05 and SRMR value less than .08. \n\nTo compare the models the AIC/BIC values will be examined. The lower these values, the better the predictive model. A model is considered to be a good model when it meets all the threshold criteria of the CFI, RMSEA and SRMR. The best model is the model with the lowest AIC and BIC values and with the best threshold criteria.  \n\nStatistical technique:\nAnalyses will be performed with LAVAAN package in R. The method of model estimation will be determined based on the properties of the collected data (e.g., multivariate normality). Normality is assumed when skewness &lt; 2 and kurtosis is &lt; 7 for all variables. If the data is normal, the maximum likelihood method (ML) is used. If the data is not normal, the asymptotic distribution free of estimations is used.   \n\nBefore cleaning the data, and thus before looking at the data, a script for data analysis in R will be made on the basis of the first 10 respondents. The R script will be uploaded after the first 10 respondents. These respondents will then be excluded from the main analysis.   \n\nEach variable\u2019s role in the technique:\nAll variables are exploratory factors. \n\nRecommended Elements\nThe method of missing data handling:\nMissing data will be treated as pairwise and list-wise deletion by LAVAAN. \n\nReliability criteria for item inclusion in scale:\nThe reliability of variables and instruments in the model will be examined using item analysis and factor analysis. Additionally, a test-retest reliability will be performed to particularly test the reliability of the MD addiction scale. A random sample of N = 50 from the total sample will participate in a retest with a 6-week interval (Cronbach\u2019s alpha). Convergent validity will be assessed via average variance extracted (&lt;.50), and composite reliability (&lt;.70). No inter-correlation between constructs should be more than 0.9. Items with an inter-correlation above 0.9 or with a negative correlation will be deleted from the scale. All items should have the highest loadings with its corresponding construct.\n\nAnticipated data transformations:\nBackground variables: \nGender will be recoded as male = 0 and female = 1. \nContinent of residence will be treated as categories (1= Europe, 2= US, etc.)\nChildhood trauma: items 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 26, 28 will be reverse coded. \nAlexithymia: items 4, 8, 10, 18, 19 will be reverse coded.\n \nAssumptions of analyses, and plans for alternative/corrected analyses if each assumption is violated:\nThe overall results for the hypothetical models will be reported and the hypotheses will be explained case by case whether they are supported or not. \nIn case of empirical under-identification (e.g., negative error variances) the model will be restricted if necessary. Only modification indices &gt; 10  will be examined to possibly increase model fit. \nAdditionally, the data will be tested for common method bias. \n\nPART 2: QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS\nAbstract + research question:\nThis study aims to contribute to a clearer definition of the maladaptive daydreaming phenomenon. Nowadays, MD is described as an excessive and vivid fantasy activity that interferes with individual\u2019s normal functioning and often both emerges from and results in severe distress (Schimmenti, Somer, &amp; Regis, 2019). However, little is known about the repetitive and sustaining character of MD. Meaning, why do they still excessively engage in daydreaming while they experience an extreme amount of distress and why are they not able to stop or control it? Therefore, this qualitative approach aims to provide new insights into the addictive and compulsive components of MD. \n\nHypotheses:\nSimilar to the hypothesized models, we expect to see a relation between childhood trauma, alexithymia, cover narcissism and MD. Together with the repetitive use and high flow, we expect these individual characteristics to contribute to both the development and sustainment of MD. \n\nMethods / design plan\n\nData collection:\nAfter the quantitative data collection, follow-up data will be collected via semi-structured interviews. Participants from the MD group during the quantitative data collection who indicated to have an interest in this follow-up interview will be randomly selected. Interviews will primarily be done via Skype and will take around 30 to 60 minutes. The only inclusion criteria to participate in the interview is to have a minimum score of 50 on the MDS-16. \n\nSample size:\nWe use the saturation principle to decide when sufficient respondents have been interviewed. We aim to include at least five semi-structured follow-up interviews per group. This N is expected to be sufficient following the saturation principle and previous publication using the same topic and methods (Somer, 2002; Somer, 2018; Somer, Somer, &amp; Jopp, 2016).  \n\nTarget group:\nThe study will include subjects (self-)diagnosed with MD, their age will approximately be between 18 and 45 years. \n\nProcedure: \nThe interviews will take around 30 to 60 minutes, and will be conducted in English. \nParticipants will be recruited through the online questionnaire and via personal contacts. Information letters and consent forms will be sent to the participants who have expressed interest. These also contain information about the anonymity of responses. Participants will be interviewed via Skype. All interviews will then be transcribed and analysed using for content analysis. \n\nInterview guide:\nInterviews will be guided by the protocol of the SMICD, an 11-item structured interview designed to clarify and gain additional information of the symptoms of MD (Somer, Soffer-Dudek, Ross, &amp; Halpern, 2017). During the interviews, the interviewer will try to seek for further details about addictive components of MD if necessary. The same interviewer will do all interviews. This interviewer will try to be neutral, non-judgemental and supportive of the interviewee\u2019s responses. \n\nAnalysis plan\nThe interviews will be transcribed and coded using ATLAS-TI. The data will be analysed using thematic content analysis (narrative approach). Data will be coded for addiction (e.g., withdrawal symptoms, taking in a longer period than intended, conflict, tolerance, relapse, repeated unsuccessful attempts to stop and salience), flow experience and behavioural repetition. The data analysis will be performed independently by two researchers. \n\nFinal Questions\n1.\tHas data collection begun for this project? \nNo. \n\n2.\tThe (estimated) start and end dates for this project are:\nData collection will start as soon as the study is approved by the ERB. Data collection is expected to start in April 2020 and the end of the project is expected to be in June 2020.\n\nThis study has been approved by the Ethics Review Board of Tilburg University.\n  \n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Pre-registration thesis.docx"}, "nodeId": "72xbv", "sha256": "5c84653e375af194cdd33e3fff43722e4ea9d6f8a52c4a483b124f20b3a8f122", "viewUrl": "/project/72xbv/files/osfstorage/5e8c76174301660132a04ff8", "selectedFileName": "Pre-registration thesis.docx"}], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"summary": "This pre-registration is based on the template for pre-registration in social psychology as suggested here: https://osf.io/56g8e/  by van \u2018t Veer &amp; Giner-Sorolla (2016) and on the pre-registration template for SEM studies (Williams, 2018).\n\nStudy Information\nTitle:\nMaladaptive Daydreaming and behavioural addiction?

In this preregistration, both parts (quantitative and qualitative) will be described in detail separately. \n\nPART 1 : QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS\nHypotheses\nIn this research, in which we see maladaptive daydreaming as behavioural addiction, we predict that repetition of daydreaming activities, the flow experience and their combined interaction as an ultimate daydreaming experience, and an escape from stress would be positively associated with maladaptive daydreaming (MD). Furthermore, we also assume a positive association between narcissism, alexithymia, and childhood trauma with maladaptive daydreaming.\n\nModel 1:\nH1: The MDS-16 and the behavioural addiction scale can measure both the construct MD\n\nModel 2:\nH2: Repetition of daydreaming activities shows a positive association with MD\nH3: Flow experience in daydreaming activities shows a positive association with repetition and MD\nH4: Flow experience in daydreaming activities acts as the intermediary that allows for repetition to activate MD.\nH5: The flow experience during daydreaming is higher for MD-ers compared to non-MDers\n\nModel 3:\nH6: Flow experience acts as the intermediary between the individual differences, childhood trauma, alexithymia and covert narcissism MD\nH7a: Childhood trauma is positively associated with MD \nH7b: Alexithymia is positively associated with MD\nH7c: Covert narcissism is positively associated with MD\n\nMethods / Design plan \nIndependent variables:\n-\tCovert narcissism, trait alexithymia, childhood trauma, flow experience, behavioural repetition, all between-subjects. \n\nDependent variable:\n-\tMaladaptive daydreaming (both measured by the MDS-16 and by the addiction scale). \n\nPlanned Sample\nPre-selection rules:\nData will be collected from 2 groups, the maladaptive daydreaming group and a control group (non-MDers). To verify their condition, they are asked the following screening text at the start of the online questionnaire: \u201cDaydreaming is a universal human phenomenon that a majority of the individuals engage in on a daily basis. In this study, daydreaming is defined as fantastical mental images and visual stories/narratives that are not necessarily part of real life. Therefore, it does not refer to acts such as reminiscing over past events, planning for future activities such as a meeting with your boss, or thinking about your mental \u2018to do\u2019 list. Pure sexual fantasies are not included in this study. Examples of daydreams that can be included would be hanging out with a favourite celebrity, winning the Nobel Prize, telling off your boss after winning the lottery, having an affair with an attractive co-worker who isn\u2019t the slightest bit interested in you, living in a parallel fantasy world, engaging in heroic or rescue actions, speaking with historical figures, etc. Any daydreams involving fictional characters or plots can also be included. MD is defined as extensive daydreaming that replaces human interaction and/or interferes with academic, interpersonal or vocational functioning and/or creates emotional distress. According to this definition, is your daydreaming (a) normal or (b) maladaptive?\u201d (Somer et al. 2017; pp. 180\u2013181). The participant\u2019s subjective answers will determine whether there is presence of MD or not. Only participants answering (b) to this question are included in the MD group. Participants answering (a) are included in the non-MD-group. \n\nData collection \nFirst the participants in the MD group will be recruited. They will be recruited from online support groups, such as Daydream In Blue , Wild Minds Network, and the Facebook group of Maladaptive daydreaming. In these communities a call for participants will be posted and will additionally be sent out as an email invitation to members of MD listservs : Yahoo MD Forum. These email invitations will be done using systematic sampling (an email will be sent to each fifth subject in the list).  After data selection in this group is complete, the data collection for the non-MD group will start, aimed to include the same characteristics as the MD-group, including age, gender, and continent of residence. Data will be collected online using questionnaires in Qualtrics for both groups. \n\nSample size:\nAimed is to have an equal sample size per group with N= 200, in order to reach a total sample of N=400. Usually for conducting SEM analysis, N = 100-150 is considered the minimum sample size. For a reasonable simple EFA/CFA model, sample size is about N = 150 is required to perform a meaningful analysis (Muth\u00e9n &amp; Muth\u00e9n, 2002). Additionally, previous studies already show correlations of .22 with childhood trauma (Somer, Abu-Raya &amp; Simaan, 2019) and .39 with alexithymia (Schimmenti et al., 2019). A power analysis performed in G*power for regression with correlation coefficients of .22 and .39 also resulted in similar required sample sizes.  \n\nExclusion criteria\nFor the quantitative data, only any abnormal responses (e.g., extreme responses; only either low/high responses, the same answers on all the questions, short completion time or responses from the same individual) will be excluded. \n\nProcedure:\nAt the beginning of the online questionnaire, participants are informed about the study and they have to give active consent before participation. Then all questions about the variables will be presented (127 in total). Starting with demographic questions, followed by questions about individual characteristics (covert narcissism, alexithymia and childhood trauma) and ending with the questions about daydreaming experiences and the addictive components. At the end, the email address of the main researcher will be given in case participants have any questions or remarks. \n\nOrder of presentation: \nBackground variables: Gender (male, female, other), age (number) and continent of residence. \n\nCovert narcissism: Measured with the 23-item maladaptive covert narcissism scale (MCNS; Cheek, Hendin, &amp; Wink, 2013). Participants have to rate on a 5-point scale to what extent each item is true for them, ranging from (1) very untrue to (5) very true.\n\nAlexithymia: Measured with the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20; Bagby, Parker &amp;, Taylor, 1994). Participants have to rate on a 5-point scale to what extent each item is true for them, ranging from (1) strongly disagree to (5) strongly agree. \n\nChildhood trauma: Measured with the 28-item childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ;  Bernstein et al., 2003). Participants have to rate on a 5-point scale to what extent each item is true for them, ranging from (1) never true to (5) very often true. \n\nAddiction: Measured with a 10-item scale composed addiction scale (Gold &amp; Heffner, 1998; Griffiths, 1998). Participants have to rate on a 5-point scale to what extent the item fits their experience, ranging from (1) totally disagree to (5) totally agree. \n\nFlow experience: Measured with a 28-item composed flow experience scale (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975; Chou &amp; Ting, 2003; Ghani &amp; Deshpande, 1994; Holbrook, Chestnut, Oliva, &amp; Greenleaf, 1984; Novak, Hoffman, &amp; Yung, 2000). Participants have to rate on a -point scale to what extent the item fits their experience, ranging from (1) totally disagree to (5) totally agree. \n\nRepetition: Measured with 2 items (Chou &amp; Ting, 2003). Participants have to indicate to what extent they have been daydreaming actively. Measured by how many hours per day and for how many years. Reliability and validity of these items has not been addressed by the original authors. We will test this with test-retest as indicated in the analysis section of this pre-registration.   \n\nMaladaptive daydreaming: Measured with the 16-item maladaptive daydreaming scale (MDS-16; Somer, Lehrfeld, Jopp, &amp; Bigelsen, 2016). Participants have to rate on a 5-point scale to what extent the item fits their experience, ranging from (1) never to (5) very often. \n\nFor recruiting participants for the follow-up interviews, an additional question will be asked to participants in the MD-group only: \u201cPart of this study are additional in-depth interviews about the process behind daydreaming and the content of your daydreams. In case of interest in these interviews please sent me an email\u201d. \n\nIndices:\nIn model 3, for the variables covert narcissism, alexithymia, childhood trauma, addiction repetition and flow experience  a sum score of the items will be computed.\n\nAnalysis Plan\nStatistical models and hypothesis testing:\nA full structural equation model (SEM) analysis will be performed to estimate a fit of the proposed model(s). First, for model 1, a CFA will be performed to test hypothesis 1. Maladaptive daydreaming often has been described comparable to a behavioral addiction (Bigelsen &amp; Schupak, 2011), and therefore suggested to follow the pathway from stress and habit formation to behavioural addiction. According to this pathway, MD measured by the MDS-16 should measure the same latent construct as measured by the daydreaming addiction scale. Expected is that the latent variable (MD) will equally load on the two distinct measurement instruments (MDS-16 and the daydreaming addiction scale). When loadings are similar (same CI range), hypothesis one is confirmed.\n\nSecondly, to test the other hypotheses, SEM will be used to test two nested models. The first model will test the original pathway from Chou and Ting (2003), adjusted to maladaptive daydreaming. The second model includes the full model with additional individual characteristics. Childhood trauma, alexithymia and covert narcissism are all expected to be positively associated with MD and with the exception of alexithymia, are shown to be associated with addiction (Abu-Rayya, Somer &amp; Knane, 2019; Schimmenti, Sideli, La Marca, Gori &amp; Terrone, 2019). Therefore, expected is that the full model will have a better fit compared to the original model. Conclusions will be made based on model fit. \nModel fit will be examined using the chi-square test, with p-value &lt; 0.05. CFI, RMSEA and SRMR will be reported. Indices of a good fit are CFI values greater than .95, RMSEA values less than .05 and SRMR value less than .08. \n\nTo compare the models the AIC/BIC values will be examined. The lower these values, the better the predictive model. A model is considered to be a good model when it meets all the threshold criteria of the CFI, RMSEA and SRMR. The best model is the model with the lowest AIC and BIC values and with the best threshold criteria.  \n\nStatistical technique:\nAnalyses will be performed with LAVAAN package in R. The method of model estimation will be determined based on the properties of the collected data (e.g., multivariate normality). Normality is assumed when skewness &lt; 2 and kurtosis is &lt; 7 for all variables. If the data is normal, the maximum likelihood method (ML) is used. If the data is not normal, the asymptotic distribution free of estimations is used.   \n\nBefore cleaning the data, and thus before looking at the data, a script for data analysis in R will be made on the basis of the first 10 respondents. The R script will be uploaded after the first 10 respondents. These respondents will then be excluded from the main analysis.   \n\nEach variable\u2019s role in the technique:\nAll variables are exploratory factors. \n\nRecommended Elements\nThe method of missing data handling:\nMissing data will be treated as pairwise and list-wise deletion by LAVAAN. \n\nReliability criteria for item inclusion in scale:\nThe reliability of variables and instruments in the model will be examined using item analysis and factor analysis. Additionally, a test-retest reliability will be performed to particularly test the reliability of the MD addiction scale. A random sample of N = 50 from the total sample will participate in a retest with a 6-week interval (Cronbach\u2019s alpha). Convergent validity will be assessed via average variance extracted (&lt;.50), and composite reliability (&lt;.70). No inter-correlation between constructs should be more than 0.9. Items with an inter-correlation above 0.9 or with a negative correlation will be deleted from the scale. All items should have the highest loadings with its corresponding construct.\n\nAnticipated data transformations:\nBackground variables: \nGender will be recoded as male = 0 and female = 1. \nContinent of residence will be treated as categories (1= Europe, 2= US, etc.)\nChildhood trauma: items 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 26, 28 will be reverse coded. \nAlexithymia: items 4, 8, 10, 18, 19 will be reverse coded.\n \nAssumptions of analyses, and plans for alternative/corrected analyses if each assumption is violated:\nThe overall results for the hypothetical models will be reported and the hypotheses will be explained case by case whether they are supported or not. \nIn case of empirical under-identification (e.g., negative error variances) the model will be restricted if necessary. Only modification indices &gt; 10  will be examined to possibly increase model fit. \nAdditionally, the data will be tested for common method bias. \n\nPART 2: QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS\nAbstract + research question:\nThis study aims to contribute to a clearer definition of the maladaptive daydreaming phenomenon. Nowadays, MD is described as an excessive and vivid fantasy activity that interferes with individual\u2019s normal functioning and often both emerges from and results in severe distress (Schimmenti, Somer, &amp; Regis, 2019). However, little is known about the repetitive and sustaining character of MD. Meaning, why do they still excessively engage in daydreaming while they experience an extreme amount of distress and why are they not able to stop or control it? Therefore, this qualitative approach aims to provide new insights into the addictive and compulsive components of MD. \n\nHypotheses:\nSimilar to the hypothesized models, we expect to see a relation between childhood trauma, alexithymia, cover narcissism and MD. Together with the repetitive use and high flow, we expect these individual characteristics to contribute to both the development and sustainment of MD. \n\nMethods / design plan\n\nData collection:\nAfter the quantitative data collection, follow-up data will be collected via semi-structured interviews. Participants from the MD group during the quantitative data collection who indicated to have an interest in this follow-up interview will be randomly selected. Interviews will primarily be done via Skype and will take around 30 to 60 minutes. The only inclusion criteria to participate in the interview is to have a minimum score of 50 on the MDS-16. \n\nSample size:\nWe use the saturation principle to decide when sufficient respondents have been interviewed. We aim to include at least five semi-structured follow-up interviews per group. This N is expected to be sufficient following the saturation principle and previous publication using the same topic and methods (Somer, 2002; Somer, 2018; Somer, Somer, &amp; Jopp, 2016).  \n\nTarget group:\nThe study will include subjects (self-)diagnosed with MD, their age will approximately be between 18 and 45 years. \n\nProcedure: \nThe interviews will take around 30 to 60 minutes, and will be conducted in English. \nParticipants will be recruited through the online questionnaire and via personal contacts. Information letters and consent forms will be sent to the participants who have expressed interest. These also contain information about the anonymity of responses. Participants will be interviewed via Skype. All interviews will then be transcribed and analysed using for content analysis. \n\nInterview guide:\nInterviews will be guided by the protocol of the SMICD, an 11-item structured interview designed to clarify and gain additional information of the symptoms of MD (Somer, Soffer-Dudek, Ross, &amp; Halpern, 2017). During the interviews, the interviewer will try to seek for further details about addictive components of MD if necessary. The same interviewer will do all interviews. This interviewer will try to be neutral, non-judgemental and supportive of the interviewee\u2019s responses. \n\nAnalysis plan\nThe interviews will be transcribed and coded using ATLAS-TI. The data will be analysed using thematic content analysis (narrative approach). Data will be coded for addiction (e.g., withdrawal symptoms, taking in a longer period than intended, conflict, tolerance, relapse, repeated unsuccessful attempts to stop and salience), flow experience and behavioural repetition. The data analysis will be performed independently by two researchers. \n\nFinal Questions\n1.\tHas data collection begun for this project? \nNo. \n\n2.\tThe (estimated) start and end dates for this project are:\nData collection will start as soon as the study is approved by the ERB. Data collection is expected to start in April 2020 and the end of the project is expected to be in June 2020.\n\nThis study has been approved by the Ethics Review Board of Tilburg University.\n
