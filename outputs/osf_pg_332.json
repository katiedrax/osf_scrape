For each individual\u2019s time series, each of the key EMA variables will be lagged by one observation, in order to provide values for time point (t) and the preceding time point (t-1). Lag-1 block-Toeplitz covariance matrices will be generated for each individual. These individual covariance matrices will be averaged to create a group aggregated covariance matrix for nomothetic analyses. Furthermore, before conducting all analyses, variables will be plotted to assess for normality. Prior to the main analyses, the contemporaneous relationships among the variables will be assessed using correlational analyses.\n\nPrimary Analyses:\nHypothesis 1: \nNomothetic models. To assess the lagged hypothesis that increased Instagram use at one time point predicts increased negative affect at the nomothetic level, a lagged vector-autoregressive model will be tested for its fit to the group aggregated covariance matrix, using the structural equation modeling \u2018lavaan\u2019 package in R (Roseel, 2012; R Core Team, 2016). To construct this model, all autoregressive paths will be specified (e.g. Instagram use at t-1 predicting Instagram use at t, affect at t -1 predicting affect at t); to specifically test the hypothesized relationships, paths will be specified for Instagram use at t -1 predicting affect at t. In addition, we will specify the path to test the competing directional hypothesis, affect at t -1 predicting Instagram use at t (See Figure 1). Three indices will be used to examine fit: the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) &lt; 0.08, the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) &gt; 0.95, and the Non-normed Fit Index (NNFI) &gt; 0.95. This model will be ran using three different variables; affect, as described above, as well as jealousy and social comparison, both of which will be measured using the same EMA question structure. \n\nIdiographic models. After testing the hypothesized relationships at the group level, we will test the theoretical model at the individual level. To do this, the raw survey data from each individual dataset will be inputted into R and the lagged vector-autoregressive model described above will be tested for its fit to each individual dataset using separate, person-specific models. As each person will be fit to three models (for affect, jealousy, and social comparison), a total of 900 models will be conducted (as we have 300 participants). As previously noted, a model for a given individual will be determined to be well-fit on the basis of the RMSEA, SRMR, and NFFI; a well-fitting model for a single individual for one variable tested indicates that the structural relationships in that individual\u2019s time series data is structurally consistent with the proposed lagged regression model. Each beta path between the hypothesized relationship paths will be combined into a dataset for moderation analyses.\n\nHypothesis 2:\nModeration analyses. To assess whether theoretically-relevant group-level characteristics of the sample (measured at baseline) moderate the relationships between Instagram use and affect, jealousy, and social comparison, we will examine whether a number of theoretically important variables (including social comparison orientation, female gender, internalizing disorder diagnoses, self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety, and level of Instagram and Facebook addiction) interact with Instagram use to predict changes in the three outcome variables assessed in the idiographic models described above (affect, jealousy, social comparison). All models will be run in R.\n\nHypothesis 3:\nNomothetic models. To examine the contemporaneous correlations between Instagram use and avoidance at the nomothetic level, data from each individual\u2019s time series will be combined into a larger nomothetic dataset. We will run a Pearson correlation between the contemporaneous (Time t) avoidance and contemporaneous (Time t) Instagram use, using the R package \u2018Hmics\u2019 (Harrell, 2019).\n\nIdiographic models.

To assess the lagged hypothesis that increased Instagram use at one time point predicts increased negative affect at the nomothetic level, a lagged vector-autoregressive model will be tested for its fit to the group aggregated covariance matrix, using the structural equation modeling \u2018lavaan\u2019 package in R (Roseel, 2012; R Core Team, 2016). To construct this model, all autoregressive paths will be specified (e.g. Instagram use at t-1 predicting Instagram use at t, affect at t -1 predicting affect at t); to specifically test the hypothesized relationships, paths will be specified for Instagram use at t -1 predicting affect at t. In addition, we will specify the path to test the competing directional hypothesis, affect at t -1 predicting Instagram use at t (See Figure 1). Three indices will be used to examine fit: the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) &lt; 0.08, the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) &gt; 0.95, and the Non-normed Fit Index (NNFI) &gt; 0.95. This model will be ran using three different variables; affect, as described above, as well as jealousy and social comparison, both of which will be measured using the same EMA question structure. \n\nIdiographic models. After testing the hypothesized relationships at the group level, we will test the theoretical model at the individual level. To do this, the raw survey data from each individual dataset will be inputted into R and the lagged vector-autoregressive model described above will be tested for its fit to each individual dataset using separate, person-specific models. As each person will be fit to three models (for affect, jealousy, and social comparison), a total of 900 models will be conducted (as we have 300 participants). As previously noted, a model for a given individual will be determined to be well-fit on the basis of the RMSEA, SRMR, and NFFI; a well-fitting model for a single individual for one variable tested indicates that the structural relationships in that individual\u2019s time series data is structurally consistent with the proposed lagged regression model. Each beta path between the hypothesized relationship paths will be combined into a dataset for moderation analyses.\n\nHypothesis 2:\nModeration analyses. To assess whether theoretically-relevant group-level characteristics of the sample (measured at baseline) moderate the relationships between Instagram use and affect, jealousy, and social comparison, we will examine whether a number of theoretically important variables (including social comparison orientation, female gender, internalizing disorder diagnoses, self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety, and level of Instagram and Facebook addiction) interact with Instagram use to predict changes in the three outcome variables assessed in the idiographic models described above (affect, jealousy, social comparison). All models will be run in R.\n\nHypothesis 3:\nNomothetic models. To examine the contemporaneous correlations between Instagram use and avoidance at the nomothetic level, data from each individual\u2019s time series will be combined into a larger nomothetic dataset. We will run a Pearson correlation between the contemporaneous (Time t) avoidance and contemporaneous (Time t) Instagram use, using the R package \u2018Hmics\u2019 (Harrell, 2019).\n\nIdiographic models. After testing the hypothesized correlational relationship at the group level, we will test the model at the individual level. To do this, each individual\u2019s time series data will be inputted into R, and, as described above, we will run Pearson correlations between the contemporaneous (Time t) avoidance and contemporaneous (Time t) Instagram use, using the R package \u2018Hmics\u2019 (Harrell, 2019). Individual correlation coefficients will be combined into a dataset for moderation analyses.\n\nHypothesis 4.\nModeration analyses. To assess whether theoretically-relevant group-level characteristics of the sample (measured at baseline) moderate the strength of the correlation between avoidance and Instagram use, we will examine whether psychopathological variables (including anxiety disorder diagnosis as measured by the M.I.N.I., and symptoms of anxiety as measured by the PSWQ) interact with the correlation coefficient between avoidance and Instagram use.

Moreover, they will be given the option to enter their name in a draw to win one of four Amazon gift cards each valued at $50 for each EMA alert they complete within 60 minutes of receiving the alert. Community participants will receive the same compensation as ISPR participants, with the exception that they will receive a ticket in the draw for their participation on Days 1 and 4 (instead of ISPR credit).\n\nDay 1\nIn-person testing will occur at the INSPIRE Laboratory at the University of Ottawa. On Day 1, participants will be told that the purpose of this study is to better understand how people perform during speeches on controversial topics and explore how this is related to their thoughts and feelings. Participants will read the consent form describing the tasks, and potential positive and negative consequences and then indicate their consent (or lack of consent) by signing the document. Then, they will give a rating of their anxiety level using Subjective Units of Distress, after which they will complete a sociodemographic questionnaire and four randomly presented symptom questionnaires using the online survey platform Qualtrics (Qualtrics, 2020). The four questionnaires will be the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales \u2013 21 (DASS-21; Osman et al., 2012), which will assess depressive symptoms within the sample, the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN; Connor et al., 2000), which will measure social anxiety symptom severity, the Post-Event Processing Inventory \u2013 Trait Version (PEPI-T; Blackie &amp; Kocovski, 2017), which will assess general tendencies to engage in PEP, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES; Rosenberg, 1965), which will assess participants\u2019 self-esteem. \n\nParticipants will give a 5-minute speech on one of two topics (\u201cDiscuss the voting rate in Canada and its implications\u201d and \u201cDiscuss the cost of university tuition and its implications\u201d), counterbalanced across participants, in front of the research assistant and a video camera that will be filming them. They will have three minutes to prepare this speech without access to pen or paper. Participants will be informed that their speech will be evaluated by the research assistant and that experts on public speaking will view the recording to score and rank them compared to other students. To increase anxiety about the speech task, the research assistant will present the coding sheet that will supposedly be used by the experts to rank their performance on the speech and will tell participants that, following the second speech, they will receive the written feedback from the experts. Participants will be instructed that they can end their speech at any time, but that they must wait in silence until the 5 minutes is up. Right before the speech, participants will provide a second SUDS rating. Participants will give their speech and the experimenter will take note of speech duration. \n\nFollowing the speech, participants will provide a third SUDS rating and rate their performance using the Modified Perception of Speech Performance (MPSP; Cody &amp; Teachman, 2011). Participants will then take a 5-minute break, which will let time pass before the assessment of their memory of the speech. They will then complete the Speech-Related Memory Experiences Questionnaire (SR-MEQ; modified from Luchetti &amp; Sutin, 2016), which will assess the phenomenological qualities of participants\u2019 memory for Speech 1. The experimenter will then explain the EMA procedure to participants (see Days 2 and 3). The experimenter will also take note of the 9-hour period during which participants are open to receiving alerts (e.g., from 9am to 6 pm or 12pm to 9pm). Participants will also complete a sample text message alert with the experimenter to ensure that the system works correctly and to answer any questions the participants may have. Lastly, participants will be reminded that they will have a second laboratory session on Day 4 where they will give another recorded speech.\n\nDays 2 and 3\nThe following EMA procedure is adapted from Connolly and Alloy (2018). On each of the two days following the first laboratory session, participants will receive three text message alerts (for a total of six alerts) from the online reminder service OhDontForget.com. Alerts will be sent at pseudo-random times during the selected 9-hour period, with the constraint that a minimum of 90 minutes occur between each alert and that one alert occur during the first, middle, and last 3 hours of the 9-hour period. The alerts will contain a link to a Qualtrics survey. Participants will be asked to complete the survey within 60 minutes of receiving the alert. The survey will contain items assessing affect, PEP, and AP. \n\nDay 4\nParticipants will return to the laboratory on Day 4 and will first give a baseline SUDS rating and rate their performance on Speech 1 once again. They will then complete the SR-MEQ using Qualtrics and provide a second SUDS rating. They will prepare and give a second 5-minute speech on the second counterbalanced topic described above, using the same procedure as for Speech 1. Following the speech, participants will provide a third SUDS rating and rate their performance. Participants will then be debriefed. At this time, participants will be informed of the entirety of the research goals and hypotheses. Additionally, participants will be provided with contact information for the primary researchers in case they have any questions about the experiment. They will also be provided with contact information for the ethics office in case they have any concerns about the research protocol. Finally, in the course of completing the study, participants may become aware of difficulties they are experiencing with anxiety and/or depression. As such, all participants will be provided with a list of self-help resources and mental health practitioners in the area.\n \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "Our target sample size is 90 participants.

In addition, participants from the community will be recruited through printed advertisements posted on the University of Ottawa campus and through Facebook. ISPR undergraduate students will be compensated with one course credit on Day 1 and one course credit on Day 4 of the study. Moreover, they will be given the option to enter their name in a draw to win one of four Amazon gift cards each valued at $50 for each EMA alert they complete within 60 minutes of receiving the alert. Community participants will receive the same compensation as ISPR participants, with the exception that they will receive a ticket in the draw for their participation on Days 1 and 4 (instead of ISPR credit).\n\nDay 1\nIn-person testing will occur at the INSPIRE Laboratory at the University of Ottawa. On Day 1, participants will be told that the purpose of this study is to better understand how people perform during speeches on controversial topics and explore how this is related to their thoughts and feelings. Participants will read the consent form describing the tasks, and potential positive and negative consequences and then indicate their consent (or lack of consent) by signing the document. Then, they will give a rating of their anxiety level using Subjective Units of Distress, after which they will complete a sociodemographic questionnaire and four randomly presented symptom questionnaires using the online survey platform Qualtrics (Qualtrics, 2020). The four questionnaires will be the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales \u2013 21 (DASS-21; Osman et al., 2012), which will assess depressive symptoms within the sample, the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN; Connor et al., 2000), which will measure social anxiety symptom severity, the Post-Event Processing Inventory \u2013 Trait Version (PEPI-T; Blackie &amp; Kocovski, 2017), which will assess general tendencies to engage in PEP, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES; Rosenberg, 1965), which will assess participants\u2019 self-esteem. \n\nParticipants will give a 5-minute speech on one of two topics (\u201cDiscuss the voting rate in Canada and its implications\u201d and \u201cDiscuss the cost of university tuition and its implications\u201d), counterbalanced across participants, in front of the research assistant and a video camera that will be filming them. They will have three minutes to prepare this speech without access to pen or paper. Participants will be informed that their speech will be evaluated by the research assistant and that experts on public speaking will view the recording to score and rank them compared to other students. To increase anxiety about the speech task, the research assistant will present the coding sheet that will supposedly be used by the experts to rank their performance on the speech and will tell participants that, following the second speech, they will receive the written feedback from the experts. Participants will be instructed that they can end their speech at any time, but that they must wait in silence until the 5 minutes is up. Right before the speech, participants will provide a second SUDS rating. Participants will give their speech and the experimenter will take note of speech duration. \n\nFollowing the speech, participants will provide a third SUDS rating and rate their performance using the Modified Perception of Speech Performance (MPSP; Cody &amp; Teachman, 2011). Participants will then take a 5-minute break, which will let time pass before the assessment of their memory of the speech. They will then complete the Speech-Related Memory Experiences Questionnaire (SR-MEQ; modified from Luchetti &amp; Sutin, 2016), which will assess the phenomenological qualities of participants\u2019 memory for Speech 1. The experimenter will then explain the EMA procedure to participants (see Days 2 and 3). The experimenter will also take note of the 9-hour period during which participants are open to receiving alerts (e.g., from 9am to 6 pm or 12pm to 9pm). Participants will also complete a sample text message alert with the experimenter to ensure that the system works correctly and to answer any questions the participants may have. Lastly, participants will be reminded that they will have a second laboratory session on Day 4 where they will give another recorded speech.\n\nDays 2 and 3\nThe following EMA procedure is adapted from Connolly and Alloy (2018). On each of the two days following the first laboratory session, participants will receive three text message alerts (for a total of six alerts) from the online reminder service OhDontForget.com. Alerts will be sent at pseudo-random times during the selected 9-hour period, with the constraint that a minimum of 90 minutes occur between each alert and that one alert occur during the first, middle, and last 3 hours of the 9-hour period. The alerts will contain a link to a Qualtrics survey. Participants will be asked to complete the survey within 60 minutes of receiving the alert. The survey will contain items assessing affect, PEP, and AP. \n\nDay 4\nParticipants will return to the laboratory on Day 4 and will first give a baseline SUDS rating and rate their performance on Speech 1 once again. They will then complete the SR-MEQ using Qualtrics and provide a second SUDS rating. They will prepare and give a second 5-minute speech on the second counterbalanced topic described above, using the same procedure as for Speech 1. Following the speech, participants will provide a third SUDS rating and rate their performance. Participants will then be debriefed. At this time, participants will be informed of the entirety of the research goals and hypotheses. Additionally, participants will be provided with contact information for the primary researchers in case they have any questions about the experiment. They will also be provided with contact information for the ethics office in case they have any concerns about the research protocol.

address violence against women in Mumbai, India", "description": "A growing number of public health interventions involve community members in activism to prevent violence against women (VAW), but the psychological drivers of participation are poorly understood. In this project, we developed a new scale for measuring three proposed drivers of participation in collective action to address VAW in the context of urban informal settlements in Mumbai, India: perceived legitimacy, perceived efficacy, and collective action norms. Using a household survey of over 2,500 men and women, we examined its item, construct, and criterion validity. A valid scale would provide useful insight into modifiable beliefs and attitudes that community mobilisation interventions can address to inspire activism in low-resource contexts.", "category":
