The SD4 is a recently developed personality questionnaire that measures the four antagonistic personality traits narcissism, Machiavellianism (Mach), psychopathy and sadism. Grandiose narcissism is characterized by a sense of entitlement, grandiose exhibition, and an overestimation of own skills and achievements. It must be distinguished from vulnerable narcissism which is neither part of the Dark Tetrad nor of this study. Grandiose narcissism is nonpathological whereas vulnerable narcissism describes a clinical pattern (Krizan &amp; Herlache, 2017; Wink, 1991). Psychopathy consists of callous, highly impulsive, thrill-seeking behavior and low anxiety. Further features are lack of remorse, a tendency of lying and deceiving, an antisocial orientation, egocentricity and violence. Central characteristics of Mach are coldness and manipulativeness. It can be understood as an exploitive, unprincipled, reasoned and calculat-ing trait, including planning or forming coalitions in order to achieve one\u2019s goals. Sadism is characterized by the pleasure derived from distress or harm of others. It includes cruelty in daily actions and entertainment in general, e.g., violent films, sports or video games (cf.

The SD4 is a recently developed personality questionnaire that measures the four antagonistic personality traits narcissism, Machiavellianism (Mach), psychopathy and sadism. Grandiose narcissism is characterized by a sense of entitlement, grandiose exhibition, and an overestimation of own skills and achievements. It must be distinguished from vulnerable narcissism which is neither part of the Dark Tetrad nor of this study. Grandiose narcissism is nonpathological whereas vulnerable narcissism describes a clinical pattern (Krizan &amp; Herlache, 2017; Wink, 1991). Psychopathy consists of callous, highly impulsive, thrill-seeking behavior and low anxiety. Further features are lack of remorse, a tendency of lying and deceiving, an antisocial orientation, egocentricity and violence. Central characteristics of Mach are coldness and manipulativeness. It can be understood as an exploitive, unprincipled, reasoned and calculat-ing trait, including planning or forming coalitions in order to achieve one\u2019s goals. Sadism is characterized by the pleasure derived from distress or harm of others. It includes cruelty in daily actions and entertainment in general, e.g., violent films, sports or video games (cf. Baumeister &amp; Campbell, 1999; Book, Visser &amp; Volk, 2015; Book et al., 2016; Chabrol, van Leeuwen, Rodgers &amp; S\u00e9journ\u00e9, 2009; Paulhus &amp; Williams, 2002).
