intention, knowledge, desire, etc.) to other agents, an ability that has been termed \u201cTheory of mind\u201d (Premack and Woodruff, 1978). For example, if we see a child stretching out while trying to reach for a high shelf with her hand, we assume that she wants her favourite toy, which is on the shelf. Hence, we constantly engage in the so-called mindreading, explaining others\u2019 behaviour in terms of mental states. \n   Theory of mind is one of the hallmarks of social cognition. Indeed, having a theory of mind enables complex social behaviours such as cooperation, tactical deception, communication and social learning (Heyes 1998; Lurz 2011).\n   The possession of a theory of mind can be tested with several different tasks, but a large amount of research attention has been devoted to the so-called false belief task (Wimmer &amp; Perner, 1983). In this paradigm, participants are first familiarised with an agent\u2019s goal (e.g. reaching a desired object). In the crucial false belief condition, the agent\u2019s state of knowledge contrasts with the state of reality (e.g. because the object has been displaced to a different location out of the agent\u2019s view). If participants are capable of attributing a false belief to the agent, they should expect the agent to act according to this false belief and not according to the state of reality.  \n   Traditionally, it has been held that children possess a fully developed theory of mind only from the age of 4 years. This limit has been set because it is only from 4 years of age that children can pass verbal false belief tasks, such as the change of location, change of identity and change of content tasks. However recent research has shown that even infants as young as 13 months (Surian et al., 2007) and some non-human animals (Buttelmann et al., 2017; Krupenye et al., 2016), when tested with suitable non-verbal paradigms, can show false beliefs understanding. \n\nReferences\n1.\tPremack, David, and Guy Woodruff. \u2018Does the Chimpanzee Have a Theory of Mind?\u2019 Behavioral and Brain Sciences 1, no. 4 (December 1978): 515\u201326. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00076512.\n\n2.\tButtelmann, David, Frances Buttelmann, Malinda Carpenter, Josep Call, and Michael Tomasello. \u2018Great Apes Distinguish True from False Beliefs in an Interactive Helping Task\u2019.

Given the process of domestication and the long history of human-dog cohabitation, dogs represent a particularly interesting model for the study of comparative social cognition. In particular, it has been suggested that, as far as social cognition is concerned, dogs and humans might have undergone a process of convergent evolution throughout phylogeny (Mikl\u00f3si, 2014). Therefore, we expect to find similarities between the two species in the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying mental state attribution. Previous tests about the dog\u2019s ability to take the perspective of humans in the knower/guesser task using geometrical gaze following have revealed promising results (Catala et al. 2017). This has encouraged us to go a step further and test whether this species is also able to discriminate between a knowledgeable and an ignorant person in the false-belief task. \n    We intend to adapt for dogs a hiding-finding paradigm that has already been used with children and apes (Call and Tomasello, 1999). We hypothesize that dogs will be more inclined to follow the communicator\u2019s hint (reference) to (and hence approach) the empty container in the true belief condition, relative to the false belief condition. On the contrary, when the communicator has a false belief about the location of food, we expect dogs to ignore her reference signals (and hence approach the baited container) more often than in the true belief condition. Regarding the latency to approach the container, we expect that dogs will find the true belief event more puzzling (because the communicator is behaving \u201cirrationally\u201d) and hence we predict that they will have a longer latency to approach the signaled container. \n   During the familiarisation phase, we expect that most dogs will be able to choose the baited container using their memory about the hiding and, in the next phase, following the communicator\u2019s reference signals (i.e. without having witnessed the hiding). \n During test trials, we expect dogs will remember where food has been hidden last. Therefore, we predict that they will gaze at the baited container longer than at the empty one, prior to the choice. \n\nReferences\n1.\tMiklosi, Adam. Dog Behaviour, Evolution, and Cognition.

At the beginning of each trial, the dog, held by its owner, will watch one or two experimenters entering the room and hiding a high-value food bait in one of two opaque containers (box A or box B). Depending on the condition of the experiment, the order of events and the final location of the reward will vary but towards the end of each trial, once the hiding of food is completed, the owner will always be asked to release the dog, who will be free to approach one of the containers and retrieve its content (if any). At the end of each trial, owners will remove the blindfold and recall their dogs to the starting position. Three cameras will record the room from different angles.\n      In detail, the experiment will consist of three familiarisation phases and a subsequent test. The familiarisation aims at introducing the dog to the set-up and the experimenters. These are the \u201chider\u201d (a person who hides food in one of the two containers and displaces the food visibly during displacement trials) and the \u201ccommunicator\u201d (a person who witnesses the hiding and sometimes the displacement of food and who informs the dog of the location of the bait). \nThe first familiarisation phase, called \u201chider only\u201d, will include two trials. In this phase, only the dog, the owner and the hider will be in the room. The first trial will be a \u201cno displacement\u201d, in which the hider will show to the dog that she has food and she will hide it in box A. Then, she will close the box before leaving the room. In the second trial, dogs will additionally witness a displacement of the food. Immediately after closing box A, the hider will retrieve the food from there and visibly transfer it into box B. Then, after closing the box, she will leave the room. In both cases, owners will be instructed to wait just one second after hearing the closing door and then to release the dog. The dog will be free to approach one of the containers.\nIf dogs do not move after 10 seconds, owners can give verbal encouragement in the form of releasing commands (e.g. \u201cok\u201d or \u201cyou can go\u201d). If dogs still do not move, we will score the trial as \u201cno choice\u201d. \nWe expect that dogs will approach the baited container first. If instead they choose the empty (wrong) container, the hider will go back into the room and remove the food in the other container. \n   The second familiarisation phase, called \u201ccommunicator only\u201d will also include two trials. This phase serves also as a control condition because it should show that dogs are able to use the communicator\u2019s cue to find food even when they have not witnessed the hiding themselves. The order of displacement and no displacement trials in this condition will be counterbalanced across dogs. Hider and communicator will enter the room while dog and owner will wait outside. From the corridor, dog and owner will have no visual access to the baiting of the containers (the door of the experimental room will be closed). The communicator will start the trial inside the room and therefore she will know in which bucket the food has been hidden. In this phase, the hider will make sure to hide food without making any noise. Then she will leave the room and tell the owner to enter and take the usual seat. When entering the room, the owner will hold the dog so that he/she cannot approach the containers yet. Once the dog will be in the initial position and the owner will be seated and wearing the blindfold again, the communicator will suggest to the dog where to look for food (approach, manipulation of the container, voice and gaze alternation). The communicator will then go back to her neutral starting position and say \u201cok\u201d. \n   The third and last familiarisation phase, called \u201chider and communicator\u201d will again involve two trials; the first one will be a no displacement, the second one will be a displacement trial. In this phase, every trial will start with the dog and the owner inside the room. The hider and communicator will enter the room together (with the communicator closely following the hider). The hider will approach the first box to be baited (box A) while the communicator will crouch down facing the dog, in a position equidistant from the two containers, and will (ostensibly) witness the hiding procedure. In the first trial (\u201cno displacement\u201d) the hider will show to the dog that she has food and she will hide it in box A. Then, she will close the box before leaving the room. In the second trial (\u201cdisplacement\u201d), dogs will additionally witness a displacement of the food. Immediately after closing box A, the hider will retrieve the food from there and visibly transfer it into box B. Then, after closing the box, she will leave the room. In both trials, once the hider has left the room, the communicator will approach the baited container, crouch down close to it, pick it up, alternate gaze three times between it and the dog while saying \u201clook, this is good, this is very good\u201d. Then she will walk back to her starting, neutral, position and she will signal to the owner to release the dog. \n   The test phase will consist of either a true belief (group TRUE) or a false belief trial (group FALSE) (between-subjects design). In this phase, the communicator\u2019s knowledge of the food location will be manipulated. In the false belief condition, the communicator, after witnessing the baiting event, will walk outside of the room, closing the door behind her, pretending not to know what is happening in the experimental room. At this point, the hider will visibly (for the dog) transfer the food from one container to the other, making sure that the dog is watching. Upon returning, the (ignorant) communicator will crouch down on the initial, neutral position and she will wait 2 seconds looking to the floor. Then she will mark the location where she (falsely) believes the food to be (the one which was baited first). In contrast, in the true belief condition, the communicator will leave the room after the first hiding; but while she will be absent (for the same duration as in the false belief condition), nothing will happen in the experimental room, and only upon her returning will the hider translocate the food visibly from one container to the other. Once the hider has left the room closing the door behind her, the communicator will pause again for 2 seconds (looking to the floor) before marking the empty location (the one which was baited first), even though she has (ostensibly) witnessed the transfer of the reward to the other container. \n   Dogs\u2019 first choice, looking times to the containers, and latency to approach the container will be coded offline from video recordings. \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "We aim at a final sample size of 120 pure-bred dogs.

For example, if we see a child stretching out while trying to reach for a high shelf with her hand, we assume that she wants her favourite toy, which is on the shelf. Hence, we constantly engage in the so-called mindreading, explaining others\u2019 behaviour in terms of mental states. \n   Theory of mind is one of the hallmarks of social cognition. Indeed, having a theory of mind enables complex social behaviours such as cooperation, tactical deception, communication and social learning (Heyes 1998; Lurz 2011).\n   The possession of a theory of mind can be tested with several different tasks, but a large amount of research attention has been devoted to the so-called false belief task (Wimmer &amp; Perner, 1983). In this paradigm, participants are first familiarised with an agent\u2019s goal (e.g. reaching a desired object). In the crucial false belief condition, the agent\u2019s state of knowledge contrasts with the state of reality (e.g. because the object has been displaced to a different location out of the agent\u2019s view). If participants are capable of attributing a false belief to the agent, they should expect the agent to act according to this false belief and not according to the state of reality.  \n   Traditionally, it has been held that children possess a fully developed theory of mind only from the age of 4 years. This limit has been set because it is only from 4 years of age that children can pass verbal false belief tasks, such as the change of location, change of identity and change of content tasks. However recent research has shown that even infants as young as 13 months (Surian et al., 2007) and some non-human animals (Buttelmann et al., 2017; Krupenye et al., 2016), when tested with suitable non-verbal paradigms, can show false beliefs understanding. \n\nReferences\n1.\tPremack, David, and Guy Woodruff. \u2018Does the Chimpanzee Have a Theory of Mind?\u2019 Behavioral and Brain Sciences 1, no. 4 (December 1978): 515\u201326. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00076512.\n\n2.\tButtelmann, David, Frances Buttelmann, Malinda Carpenter, Josep Call, and Michael Tomasello. \u2018Great Apes Distinguish True from False Beliefs in an Interactive Helping Task\u2019.

Given the process of domestication and the long history of human-dog cohabitation, dogs represent a particularly interesting model for the study of comparative social cognition. In particular, it has been suggested that, as far as social cognition is concerned, dogs and humans might have undergone a process of convergent evolution throughout phylogeny (Mikl\u00f3si, 2014). Therefore, we expect to find similarities between the two species in the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying mental state attribution. Previous tests about the dog\u2019s ability to take the perspective of humans in the knower/guesser task using geometrical gaze following have revealed promising results (Catala et al. 2017). This has encouraged us to go a step further and test whether this species is also able to discriminate between a knowledgeable and an ignorant person in the false-belief task. \n    We intend to adapt for dogs a hiding-finding paradigm that has already been used with children and apes (Call and Tomasello, 1999). We hypothesize that dogs will be more inclined to follow the communicator\u2019s hint (reference) to (and hence approach) the empty container in the true belief condition, relative to the false belief condition. On the contrary, when the communicator has a false belief about the location of food, we expect dogs to ignore her reference signals (and hence approach the baited container) more often than in the true belief condition. Regarding the latency to approach the container, we expect that dogs will find the true belief event more puzzling (because the communicator is behaving \u201cirrationally\u201d) and hence we predict that they will have a longer latency to approach the signaled container. \n   During the familiarisation phase, we expect that most dogs will be able to choose the baited container using their memory about the hiding and, in the next phase, following the communicator\u2019s reference signals (i.e. without having witnessed the hiding). \n During test trials, we expect dogs will remember where food has been hidden last. Therefore, we predict that they will gaze at the baited container longer than at the empty one, prior to the choice. \n\nReferences\n1.\tMiklosi, Adam. Dog Behaviour, Evolution, and Cognition.

", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "The experiment will take place in one of the Clever Dog Lab rooms, during a single session of approximately half an hour (including explanations to the owner and breaks for the dog). At the beginning of each trial, the dog, held by its owner, will watch one or two experimenters entering the room and hiding a high-value food bait in one of two opaque containers (box A or box B). Depending on the condition of the experiment, the order of events and the final location of the reward will vary but towards the end of each trial, once the hiding of food is completed, the owner will always be asked to release the dog, who will be free to approach one of the containers and retrieve its content (if any). At the end of each trial, owners will remove the blindfold and recall their dogs to the starting position. Three cameras will record the room from different angles.\n      In detail, the experiment will consist of three familiarisation phases and a subsequent test. The familiarisation aims at introducing the dog to the set-up and the experimenters. These are the \u201chider\u201d (a person who hides food in one of the two containers and displaces the food visibly during displacement trials) and the \u201ccommunicator\u201d (a person who witnesses the hiding and sometimes the displacement of food and who informs the dog of the location of the bait). \nThe first familiarisation phase, called \u201chider only\u201d, will include two trials. In this phase, only the dog, the owner and the hider will be in the room. The first trial will be a \u201cno displacement\u201d, in which the hider will show to the dog that she has food and she will hide it in box A. Then, she will close the box before leaving the room. In the second trial, dogs will additionally witness a displacement of the food. Immediately after closing box A, the hider will retrieve the food from there and visibly transfer it into box B. Then, after closing the box, she will leave the room. In both cases, owners will be instructed to wait just one second after hearing the closing door and then to release the dog. The dog will be free to approach one of the containers.\nIf dogs do not move after 10 seconds, owners can give verbal encouragement in the form of releasing commands (e.g. \u201cok\u201d or \u201cyou can go\u201d). If dogs still do not move, we will score the trial as \u201cno choice\u201d. \nWe expect that dogs will approach the baited container first. If instead they choose the empty (wrong) container, the hider will go back into the room and remove the food in the other container. \n   The second familiarisation phase, called \u201ccommunicator only\u201d will also include two trials. This phase serves also as a control condition because it should show that dogs are able to use the communicator\u2019s cue to find food even when they have not witnessed the hiding themselves. The order of displacement and no displacement trials in this condition will be counterbalanced across dogs. Hider and communicator will enter the room while dog and owner will wait outside. From the corridor, dog and owner will have no visual access to the baiting of the containers (the door of the experimental room will be closed). The communicator will start the trial inside the room and therefore she will know in which bucket the food has been hidden. In this phase, the hider will make sure to hide food without making any noise. Then she will leave the room and tell the owner to enter and take the usual seat. When entering the room, the owner will hold the dog so that he/she cannot approach the containers yet. Once the dog will be in the initial position and the owner will be seated and wearing the blindfold again, the communicator will suggest to the dog where to look for food (approach, manipulation of the container, voice and gaze alternation). The communicator will then go back to her neutral starting position and say \u201cok\u201d. \n   The third and last familiarisation phase, called \u201chider and communicator\u201d will again involve two trials; the first one will be a no displacement, the second one will be a displacement trial. In this phase, every trial will start with the dog and the owner inside the room. The hider and communicator will enter the room together (with the communicator closely following the hider). The hider will approach the first box to be baited (box A) while the communicator will crouch down facing the dog, in a position equidistant from the two containers, and will (ostensibly) witness the hiding procedure. In the first trial (\u201cno displacement\u201d) the hider will show to the dog that she has food and she will hide it in box A. Then, she will close the box before leaving the room. In the second trial (\u201cdisplacement\u201d), dogs will additionally witness a displacement of the food. Immediately after closing box A, the hider will retrieve the food from there and visibly transfer it into box B. Then, after closing the box, she will leave the room. In both trials, once the hider has left the room, the communicator will approach the baited container, crouch down close to it, pick it up, alternate gaze three times between it and the dog while saying \u201clook, this is good, this is very good\u201d. Then she will walk back to her starting, neutral, position and she will signal to the owner to release the dog. \n   The test phase will consist of either a true belief (group TRUE) or a false belief trial (group FALSE) (between-subjects design). In this phase, the communicator\u2019s knowledge of the food location will be manipulated. In the false belief condition, the communicator, after witnessing the baiting event, will walk outside of the room, closing the door behind her, pretending not to know what is happening in the experimental room. At this point, the hider will visibly (for the dog) transfer the food from one container to the other, making sure that the dog is watching. Upon returning, the (ignorant) communicator will crouch down on the initial, neutral position and she will wait 2 seconds looking to the floor. Then she will mark the location where she (falsely) believes the food to be (the one which was baited first). In contrast, in the true belief condition, the communicator will leave the room after the first hiding; but while she will be absent (for the same duration as in the false belief condition), nothing will happen in the experimental room, and only upon her returning will the hider translocate the food visibly from one container to the other. Once the hider has left the room closing the door behind her, the communicator will pause again for 2 seconds (looking to the floor) before marking the empty location (the one which was baited first), even though she has (ostensibly) witnessed the transfer of the reward to the other container. \n   Dogs\u2019 first choice, looking times to the containers, and latency to approach the container will be coded offline from video recordings. \n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "We will manipulate the communicator\u2019s knowledge state during the test trial.

Therefore, we will code each dog\u00b4s choice on the first trial of the second familiarisation (\u201chider only\u201d) phase and we will run a binomial test with chance level equal to 0.5, including all the dogs that were tested in the first trial of the second familiarisation phase (even those that were excluded before the final test). \n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=g75km", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/de-1/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "de-1", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "g75km", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "g75km", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/r463f/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "r463f", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ta93r/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "ta93r", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/g75km/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g75km/"}}, {"id": "48u5t", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "A study on Mete-analysis about gender related to implicit attitudes about math vs. arts?

"description": "The hippocampus, which is involved in learning and memory, is one of the few structures in the brain that demonstrates neurogenesis across the lifespan (Eriksson et al., 1998; Spalding et al., 2013). This neurogenesis is hypothesized to support the ability to flexibly navigate novel situations and environments (Kempermann, 2008). In humans, the extent of navigational abilities has been related to hippocampal volume (Maguire et al., 2000; Maguire, Woollett, &amp; Spiers, 2006), and in genetically identical mice greater hippocampal neurogenesis was related to a greater range of territory explored independent of total amount of movement (termed \u201croaming entropy\u201d; Freund et al., 2013). Hippocampal volume, then, may be a marker of exposure to and engagement with novel events and environments. Activity diversity, or the range and evenness of participation in daily activities, has previously been associated with better executive functioning in humans (Lee, Charles, &amp; Almeida, in press), which is characterized by the ability to adapt cognitively to different situations, but has not yet been examined in relation to hippocampal structure. The present research will examine how hippocampal volume relates to activity diversity, above and beyond total activity time, in two samples of US adults across the span of 8 days. Furthermore, the relationship between hippocampal volume, activity diversity, and cognitive functioning will be explored.

MIDUS consists of several projects, including Survey, Daily Diary, Cognitive, Biomarkers, Neuroscience, and Genetics projects. The original MIDUS sample was assessed between 1995-1997 (MIDUS 1), again between 2004-2009 (MIDUS 2), and again starting in 2013 (data collection ongoing; MIDUS 3). To replenish the original sample, new participants were added to the protocol between 2011-2014 (MIDUS Refresher). Data will be used from participants who took part in both the Daily Diary and the Neuroscience projects at MIDUS 2 and MIDUS Refresher. There is a slight time lag between the Daily Diary and the Neuroscience project (Daily Diary data collection started before the Neuroscience data collection). Time between studies will be used as a covariate, but because analyses are cross-sectional, time between projects will likely not influence results. \n\nDemographic variables:\nEducation: scale of 1 to 12:\n1=No school/some grade school, 2=8th grade/junior high, 3=some high school, 4=GED, 5=graduated high school, 6=1-2 years college no degree, 7=3+ years college, no degree, 8=Grad from 2-year college, 9=grad from 4 year college, 10=some grad school, 11=master's degree, 12=PhD, EdD, MD, or other professional degree.\nAge: Age at the time of the neuroscience project will be used. \nGender: coded 1=Male, 2=Female (although will be recoded so that values are interpretable in regression analysis (0 and 1). \nRace: Participants self-identify as being White (1), Black and/or African American (2), Native American or Alaska Native Aleutian Islander/Eskimo (3), Asian (4), Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (5), or Other (6). These identifications may be dichotomized into White or Non-White depending on the number of subjects who identify with each category. \nTwins: MIDUS 2 includes data from some twin pairs, which introduces dependencies into the data. These dependencies will be accounted for either using mixed models. \nTime between studies: Total months between participation in the diary study and the neuroscience study. \n\nMIDUS Daily Diary Study (same for MIDUS 2 and MIDUS Refresher)\nDuring one subproject of MIDUS, participants took part in a daily diary study. Each day for 8 consecutive days participants reported the events of that day over the phone. During each diary interview, participants responded to questions about daily activities: \u201cSince this time yesterday, how much time did you spend (1) in paid work, (2) with children, (3) doing chores, (4) on leisure, (5) in physical activities, (6) on formal volunteering, and (7) giving informal help to people not living with you (e.g., friends, neighbor, parent, other relatives, etc.)?\u201d Responses were coded as hours and minutes for each activity on a given day, and times were converted to a set of time-varying binary variables (1=participated vs. 0=not participated). The seven binary, daily activity engagement indicators can be used to construct activity diversity score, calculated as Shannon's (1948) entropy: \n \nwhere m=7 is the number of activity types, and pij is the proportion of individual i\u2019s total activities that were in each activity type, j=1 to m. Resulting activity diversity scores can range from 0 (no diversity) to 1 (complete diversity). Total activity time can be calculated as the mean total time spent in the seven activities. \n\nMIDUS Cognitive Study\nExecutive functioning. Overall executive functioning was measured using the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone (BTACT; Lachman, Agrigoroaei, Tun, &amp; Weaver, 2014; Lachman &amp; Tun, 2008) during the cognitive project of MIDUS. The mean of five BTACT sub-tasks assessing working memory, executive function, semantic memory, inductive reasoning, processing speed, reaction time, attention, task switching, and inhibitory control will be z-scored and averaged across each sample to create a composite measure of executive functioning. The tasks included the Backward Digit Span, Category Verbal Fluency, Number Series, Backwards Counting, and the Stop and Go Switch Task (SGST). In MIDUS Refresher, the latency of the SGST values differed depending on the phone type of the respondent, thus we will use the z-scored composite measure that corrected for the latency difference in phone type. The executive functioning composite will then be z-scored to equate the mean to 0 and the standard deviation 1 as in past research using these measures (Lachman et al., 2014; Lachman &amp; Tun, 2008). \nEpisodic memory. Another portion of the BTACT measured episodic verbal memory. A list of 15 words was read over the phone to the participant. After the list was recited, participants were given 1.5 minutes to recall as many of the words as possible (immediate recall). At the end of the phone call, participants were again asked to recall as many of the words as possible over 1 minute (delayed recall). The total number of correct, unique responses was recorded for the immediate and delayed recall measures, which will then be z-scored and averaged together across each sample. The episodic memory score will then z-scored again such that the mean was 0 and the standard deviation was 1.  \n\tOverall cognitive function. The overall cognitive functioning score is calculated by averaging the z-scores for five of the subtests mentioned above: Episodic Memory, Backward Digit Span, Category Verbal Fluency, Number Series, Backwards Counting. The composite is then standardized for each sample such that the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. \n\nMIDUS Neuroscience Study\nMIDUS 2: Images were acquired on a General Electric (Fairfield, CT) SIGNA 3.0 tesla high-speed MRI scanner with a standard clinical whole-head transmit-receive quadrature head coil. A high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical image was acquired (T1-weighted inversion recovery fast gradient echo; flip angle = 30, 256 \u00d7 256 in-plane resolution; 240 mm FOV; 124 \u00d7 1.1 mm axial slices). Raw T1-weighted images were reconstructed using in-house software. \nThe following description of how hippocampal volume was extracted is from the description in Peschke, Schaefer, Stodola, Kirkland-Caldwell, &amp; Davidson, 2010): Volume of interest (VOI) drawing of the hippocampus was done using in-house software (Spamalize; available at: http://brainimaging.waisman.wisc.edu /~oakes/spam/spam_frames.htm) that allows for simultaneous visualization in the three cardinal planes. Before tracing, images were skull stripped using AFNI\u2019s 3dSkullStrip (Cox, 1996), inhomogeneities were smoothed with a multispectral segmentation/bias correction algorithm (FAST; Zhang, Brady, &amp; Smith 2001), and images underwent skull and vessel correction, contrast-adjustment, and reorientation to the pathological plane in accordance with previously published work (e.g. Nacewicz et al., 2006).\nTo avoid a visual tracing bias all volumes were drawn on the right side of the MRI image. Traditionally, the left hemisphere appears on the tracer\u2019s right and right hemisphere appears on the tracer\u2019s left. We flipped half of the MRI images so that the right hippocampus volumes would also appear on the right side of the MRI image. \nHippocampal VOI Definition. Hand tracing of the whole hippocampal volume, as well as the three hippocampal segments (head, body, and tail), were completed by trained research staff, after extensive training in hippocampal neuroanatomy. VOI definition of the hippocampus and its segments were completed according to protocols established in-house. Our HC VOI protocol was informed by comparison with the Duvernoy (1995) hippocampal and Mai et al. (2008) atlases. The hippoocampus was defined as including the cornu Ammon, gyrus dentatus, subiculum and presubiculum, alveus, and fimbria, but excluding the fornix. Tracing began in the sagittal plane where the gray matter of the entire hippocampus was easily identified running inferiorly to the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle, and otherwise surrounded by white matter. Axial and coronal views were used to refine the initial VOI, though final corrections were done in the coronal plane.\nStarting in the sagittal view, the anterior hippocampal head (HH) was differentiated from the amygdala by the white matter of the alveus. The superior border was defined by the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle (THLV) and white matter superior to temporal cortex provided an inferior border. The posterior border was defined by the trigone of the lateral ventricle and white matter immediately inferior to the ventricle. This initial VOI was refined on an individual pixel-by-pixel basis in all three views, with the coronal view providing the most informative comparison with the atlases. \nIn the coronal plane, the anterior HH was drawn either inferior to or adjacent to the anterior portion of the THLV, which also provided the lateral border. The medial border was identified by the shape of the white matter of the parahippocampal gyrus, forming a \u201cV\u201d inferior to the hippocampus. The uncus was included in the hippocampal VOI when the uncul sulcus began to extend medially into the ambient cistern. The superior border of the HH was differentiated from the amygdala by following, medially, the arch of lateral ventricle. The superior border was also informed by either following (and including) the white matter of the alveus or using an approximated horizontal line starting at the superior edge of the THLV extending medially through to the ambient cistern. The inferior border was identified by white matter differentiating hippocampus from the parahippocampal gyrus.\nWhen identifying the most posterior aspect of the hippocampus, the hippocampal tail (HT), the crus of the fornix, fasciolar gyrus, Andreas Retzius gyrus, fasciola cinerea, and gyrus fasciolaris were included. These structures were differentiated from the pulvinar complex of the thalamus by the difference in gray scale, as the thalamus is a paler shade of gray, interlaced by many fibers. \nHippocampal Sub-region VOI segmentation. The hippocampus was segmented into the HH, hippocampal body (HB), and HT. The protocol for the delineation of HH/HB and HB/HT borders was informed by relevant literature (Pruessner et al., 2000; Malykhin et al., 2007) and neuroanatomical atlases (Duvernoy, 1995; Mai et al., 2008). The HH is the anterior-most segment of the hippocampus followed posteriorly by the HB and HT, respectively. Our HH/HB and HB/HT borders are based on numerous landmarks in the coronal plane identified primarily anterior- posterior, but also reconfirmed through posterior- anterior, navigation; the sagittal plane was used as a reference during border identification. \nHead/Body Border Identification. In accordance with previously outlined criteria for whole hippocampus VOI segmentation, the most anterior aspect of the HH was defined as the coronal slice where the THLV appeared and/or the alveus was present. Navigating posteriorly from the most anterior HH slice, we defined the head/body border based on five aggregate criteria due to individual differences in MRI that made it difficult to differentiate some neuroanatomical landmarks across all brains. \nBased on two primary criteria, the most anterior slice of the HB was defined as the coronal slice in which the uncus was no longer present and the ventricle was clear of tissue. The uncus forms a medial hump in the HH, but separates from the hippocampus as one nears the HB. Uncal sulcus or other tissue can be visualized in the ambient cistern, located inferior and medial to the hippocampus, or the THLV, located superior and lateral to the hippocampus. Until navigating posteriorly to a slice in which the \u201cventricle\u201d (ambient cistern and THLV) is clear of tissue, the hippocampal sub-region was defined as the HH. It is important to note that the uncus takes many forms when separating from the hippocampus. It may appear as a clearly separate ball of tissue or a peninsula-like extension, or arm, of the superomedial hippocampus. Identification of the uncus is facilitated by following its posterior progression beginning in the anterior slices of the HH. \nThe shape of the hippocampus is also valuable to identify HH and HB slices. The HH is generally wide and shaped like a kidney bean, indented slightly on its superior border due to the medial separation of the uncal sulcus. The superomedial border could also be described as stair-shaped in contrast with a smooth, straight, and angled superomedial border in the HB. The HB is located more laterally within the medial temporal lobe and generally possesses a circular shape. The change in shape is, in part, to the thinning of the inferomedial grey matter, which can be visualized and used as a neuroanatomical reference. Finally, the sagittal slice can be referenced to verify correct identification of the HH/HB border based on whether the border slice of interest falls within the large, bulbous HH, or narrowed, long HB. Strict attention was given to the superior HB border in order to avoid inclusion of the tail of the caudate, lateral geniculate and stria terminalis. \nBody/Tail Border Identification. Based on the protocol used in Maylykhin et al. (2007), we used a single criterion to identify the HB/HT border in the coronal plane. Navigating posteriorly from the HB, we defined the most anterior HT slice as that in which the tracer could visualize the crus of the fonix in full profile (Fig. 3). The fornix emerges superior to the HT. In the coronal plane, the crus of the fornix (full profile) is formed by a merging of fornix tissues superolateral and inferolateral to the pulvinar complex of the thalamus. Due to anatomical differences and differences in MRI quality, we considered the anterior border of the HT as the most anterior slice in which at least 75% of the crus of the fornix is visualized. The HT is bordered laterally by the lateral ventricle, medially by either CSF or white matter, inferiorly by white matter, and superiorly by either lateral ventricle or white matter. Care was taken to avoid including the pulvinar complex of the thalamus and tail of caudate on the superior border. White matter of the fornix was generally excluded, whereas the Fasciolar gyrus and Andreas Retzius gyrus were included (Amaral &amp; Lavenex, 2007). The posterior slice of the HT was identified as the most posterior coronal slice in which grey could be visualized inferomedial to the lateral ventricle (Pruessner et al., 2000).\n\nMIDUS Refresher: A 3T MR750 GE Healthcare MRI scanner (Waukesha, WI) and an 8-channel head coil were used to perform imaging. A three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence (Mugler and Brookeman, 1990) was used to acquire a T1-weighted anatomical image for functional data registration (TR = 8.2, TE = 3.2, flip angle = 12, field of view = 256mm, 256 X 256 matrix, 160 axial slices, inversion time = 450 ms). \nCortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation was performed with the FreeSurfer image analysis suite (v. 5.3.0), which is documented and freely available for download online (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). This processing includes motion correction and averaging (Reuter et al. 2010) of multiple volumetric T1-weighted images (when more than one is available), removal of non-brain tissue using a hybrid watershed/surface deformation procedure (Segonne et al., 2004), automated Talairach transformation, segmentation of the subcortical white matter and deep gray matter volumetric structures (including hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, putamen, ventricles) (Fischl et al., 2002; Fischl et al., 2004) intensity normalization (Sled et al., 1998), tessellation of the gray matter white matter boundary, automated topology correction (Fischl et al., 2001; Segonne et al., 2007), and surface deformation following intensity gradients to optimally place the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid borders at the location where the greatest shift in intensity defines the transition to the other tissue class (Dale et al., 1999; Dale and Sereno, 1993; Fischl and Dale, 2000). Once the cortical models are complete, a number of deformable procedures can be performed for further data processing and analysis including surface inflation (Fischl et al., 1999a), registration to a spherical atlas which is based on individual cortical folding patterns to match cortical geometry across subjects (Fischl et al., 1999b), parcellation of the cerebral cortex into units with respect to gyral and sulcal structure (Desikan et al., 2006; Fischl et al., 2004b), and creation of a variety of surface based data including maps of curvature and sulcal depth. This method uses both intensity and continuity information from the entire three-dimensional MR volume in segmentation and deformation procedures to produce representations of cortical thickness, calculated as the closest distance from the gray/white boundary to the gray/CSF boundary at each vertex on the tessellated surface (Fischl and Dale, 2000). The maps are created using spatial intensity gradients across tissue classes and are therefore not simply reliant on absolute signal intensity. The maps produced are not restricted to the voxel resolution of the original data thus are capable of detecting submillimeter differences between groups.

MIDUS consists of several projects, including Survey, Daily Diary, Cognitive, Biomarkers, Neuroscience, and Genetics projects. The original MIDUS sample was assessed between 1995-1997 (MIDUS 1), again between 2004-2009 (MIDUS 2), and again starting in 2013 (data collection ongoing; MIDUS 3). To replenish the original sample, new participants were added to the protocol between 2011-2014 (MIDUS Refresher). Data will be used from participants who took part in both the Daily Diary and the Neuroscience projects at MIDUS 2 and MIDUS Refresher. There is a slight time lag between the Daily Diary and the Neuroscience project (Daily Diary data collection started before the Neuroscience data collection). Time between studies will be used as a covariate, but because analyses are cross-sectional, time between projects will likely not influence results. \n\nDemographic variables:\nEducation: scale of 1 to 12:\n1=No school/some grade school, 2=8th grade/junior high, 3=some high school, 4=GED, 5=graduated high school, 6=1-2 years college no degree, 7=3+ years college, no degree, 8=Grad from 2-year college, 9=grad from 4 year college, 10=some grad school, 11=master's degree, 12=PhD, EdD, MD, or other professional degree.\nAge: Age at the time of the neuroscience project will be used. \nGender: coded 1=Male, 2=Female (although will be recoded so that values are interpretable in regression analysis (0 and 1). \nRace: Participants self-identify as being White (1), Black and/or African American (2), Native American or Alaska Native Aleutian Islander/Eskimo (3), Asian (4), Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (5), or Other (6). These identifications may be dichotomized into White or Non-White depending on the number of subjects who identify with each category. \nTwins: MIDUS 2 includes data from some twin pairs, which introduces dependencies into the data. These dependencies will be accounted for either using mixed models. \nTime between studies: Total months between participation in the diary study and the neuroscience study. \n\nMIDUS Daily Diary Study (same for MIDUS 2 and MIDUS Refresher)\nDuring one subproject of MIDUS, participants took part in a daily diary study. Each day for 8 consecutive days participants reported the events of that day over the phone. During each diary interview, participants responded to questions about daily activities: \u201cSince this time yesterday, how much time did you spend (1) in paid work, (2) with children, (3) doing chores, (4) on leisure, (5) in physical activities, (6) on formal volunteering, and (7) giving informal help to people not living with you (e.g., friends, neighbor, parent, other relatives, etc.)?\u201d Responses were coded as hours and minutes for each activity on a given day, and times were converted to a set of time-varying binary variables (1=participated vs. 0=not participated). The seven binary, daily activity engagement indicators can be used to construct activity diversity score, calculated as Shannon's (1948) entropy: \n \nwhere m=7 is the number of activity types, and pij is the proportion of individual i\u2019s total activities that were in each activity type, j=1 to m. Resulting activity diversity scores can range from 0 (no diversity) to 1 (complete diversity). Total activity time can be calculated as the mean total time spent in the seven activities. \n\nMIDUS Cognitive Study\nExecutive functioning. Overall executive functioning was measured using the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone (BTACT; Lachman, Agrigoroaei, Tun, &amp; Weaver, 2014; Lachman &amp; Tun, 2008) during the cognitive project of MIDUS. The mean of five BTACT sub-tasks assessing working memory, executive function, semantic memory, inductive reasoning, processing speed, reaction time, attention, task switching, and inhibitory control will be z-scored and averaged across each sample to create a composite measure of executive functioning. The tasks included the Backward Digit Span, Category Verbal Fluency, Number Series, Backwards Counting, and the Stop and Go Switch Task (SGST). In MIDUS Refresher, the latency of the SGST values differed depending on the phone type of the respondent, thus we will use the z-scored composite measure that corrected for the latency difference in phone type. The executive functioning composite will then be z-scored to equate the mean to 0 and the standard deviation 1 as in past research using these measures (Lachman et al., 2014; Lachman &amp; Tun, 2008). \nEpisodic memory. Another portion of the BTACT measured episodic verbal memory. A list of 15 words was read over the phone to the participant. After the list was recited, participants were given 1.5 minutes to recall as many of the words as possible (immediate recall). At the end of the phone call, participants were again asked to recall as many of the words as possible over 1 minute (delayed recall). The total number of correct, unique responses was recorded for the immediate and delayed recall measures, which will then be z-scored and averaged together across each sample. The episodic memory score will then z-scored again such that the mean was 0 and the standard deviation was 1.  \n\tOverall cognitive function. The overall cognitive functioning score is calculated by averaging the z-scores for five of the subtests mentioned above: Episodic Memory, Backward Digit Span, Category Verbal Fluency, Number Series, Backwards Counting. The composite is then standardized for each sample such that the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. \n\nMIDUS Neuroscience Study\nMIDUS 2: Images were acquired on a General Electric (Fairfield, CT) SIGNA 3.0 tesla high-speed MRI scanner with a standard clinical whole-head transmit-receive quadrature head coil. A high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical image was acquired (T1-weighted inversion recovery fast gradient echo; flip angle = 30, 256 \u00d7 256 in-plane resolution; 240 mm FOV; 124 \u00d7 1.1 mm axial slices). Raw T1-weighted images were reconstructed using in-house software. \nThe following description of how hippocampal volume was extracted is from the description in Peschke, Schaefer, Stodola, Kirkland-Caldwell, &amp; Davidson, 2010): Volume of interest (VOI) drawing of the hippocampus was done using in-house software (Spamalize; available at: http://brainimaging.waisman.wisc.edu /~oakes/spam/spam_frames.htm) that allows for simultaneous visualization in the three cardinal planes. Before tracing, images were skull stripped using AFNI\u2019s 3dSkullStrip (Cox, 1996), inhomogeneities were smoothed with a multispectral segmentation/bias correction algorithm (FAST; Zhang, Brady, &amp; Smith 2001), and images underwent skull and vessel correction, contrast-adjustment, and reorientation to the pathological plane in accordance with previously published work (e.g. Nacewicz et al., 2006).\nTo avoid a visual tracing bias all volumes were drawn on the right side of the MRI image. Traditionally, the left hemisphere appears on the tracer\u2019s right and right hemisphere appears on the tracer\u2019s left. We flipped half of the MRI images so that the right hippocampus volumes would also appear on the right side of the MRI image. \nHippocampal VOI Definition. Hand tracing of the whole hippocampal volume, as well as the three hippocampal segments (head, body, and tail), were completed by trained research staff, after extensive training in hippocampal neuroanatomy. VOI definition of the hippocampus and its segments were completed according to protocols established in-house. Our HC VOI protocol was informed by comparison with the Duvernoy (1995) hippocampal and Mai et al. (2008) atlases. The hippoocampus was defined as including the cornu Ammon, gyrus dentatus, subiculum and presubiculum, alveus, and fimbria, but excluding the fornix. Tracing began in the sagittal plane where the gray matter of the entire hippocampus was easily identified running inferiorly to the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle, and otherwise surrounded by white matter. Axial and coronal views were used to refine the initial VOI, though final corrections were done in the coronal plane.\nStarting in the sagittal view, the anterior hippocampal head (HH) was differentiated from the amygdala by the white matter of the alveus. The superior border was defined by the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle (THLV) and white matter superior to temporal cortex provided an inferior border. The posterior border was defined by the trigone of the lateral ventricle and white matter immediately inferior to the ventricle. This initial VOI was refined on an individual pixel-by-pixel basis in all three views, with the coronal view providing the most informative comparison with the atlases. \nIn the coronal plane, the anterior HH was drawn either inferior to or adjacent to the anterior portion of the THLV, which also provided the lateral border. The medial border was identified by the shape of the white matter of the parahippocampal gyrus, forming a \u201cV\u201d inferior to the hippocampus. The uncus was included in the hippocampal VOI when the uncul sulcus began to extend medially into the ambient cistern. The superior border of the HH was differentiated from the amygdala by following, medially, the arch of lateral ventricle. The superior border was also informed by either following (and including) the white matter of the alveus or using an approximated horizontal line starting at the superior edge of the THLV extending medially through to the ambient cistern. The inferior border was identified by white matter differentiating hippocampus from the parahippocampal gyrus.\nWhen identifying the most posterior aspect of the hippocampus, the hippocampal tail (HT), the crus of the fornix, fasciolar gyrus, Andreas Retzius gyrus, fasciola cinerea, and gyrus fasciolaris were included. These structures were differentiated from the pulvinar complex of the thalamus by the difference in gray scale, as the thalamus is a paler shade of gray, interlaced by many fibers. \nHippocampal Sub-region VOI segmentation. The hippocampus was segmented into the HH, hippocampal body (HB), and HT. The protocol for the delineation of HH/HB and HB/HT borders was informed by relevant literature (Pruessner et al., 2000; Malykhin et al., 2007) and neuroanatomical atlases (Duvernoy, 1995; Mai et al., 2008). The HH is the anterior-most segment of the hippocampus followed posteriorly by the HB and HT, respectively. Our HH/HB and HB/HT borders are based on numerous landmarks in the coronal plane identified primarily anterior- posterior, but also reconfirmed through posterior- anterior, navigation; the sagittal plane was used as a reference during border identification. \nHead/Body Border Identification. In accordance with previously outlined criteria for whole hippocampus VOI segmentation, the most anterior aspect of the HH was defined as the coronal slice where the THLV appeared and/or the alveus was present. Navigating posteriorly from the most anterior HH slice, we defined the head/body border based on five aggregate criteria due to individual differences in MRI that made it difficult to differentiate some neuroanatomical landmarks across all brains. \nBased on two primary criteria, the most anterior slice of the HB was defined as the coronal slice in which the uncus was no longer present and the ventricle was clear of tissue. The uncus forms a medial hump in the HH, but separates from the hippocampus as one nears the HB. Uncal sulcus or other tissue can be visualized in the ambient cistern, located inferior and medial to the hippocampus, or the THLV, located superior and lateral to the hippocampus. Until navigating posteriorly to a slice in which the \u201cventricle\u201d (ambient cistern and THLV) is clear of tissue, the hippocampal sub-region was defined as the HH. It is important to note that the uncus takes many forms when separating from the hippocampus. It may appear as a clearly separate ball of tissue or a peninsula-like extension, or arm, of the superomedial hippocampus. Identification of the uncus is facilitated by following its posterior progression beginning in the anterior slices of the HH. \nThe shape of the hippocampus is also valuable to identify HH and HB slices. The HH is generally wide and shaped like a kidney bean, indented slightly on its superior border due to the medial separation of the uncal sulcus. The superomedial border could also be described as stair-shaped in contrast with a smooth, straight, and angled superomedial border in the HB. The HB is located more laterally within the medial temporal lobe and generally possesses a circular shape. The change in shape is, in part, to the thinning of the inferomedial grey matter, which can be visualized and used as a neuroanatomical reference. Finally, the sagittal slice can be referenced to verify correct identification of the HH/HB border based on whether the border slice of interest falls within the large, bulbous HH, or narrowed, long HB. Strict attention was given to the superior HB border in order to avoid inclusion of the tail of the caudate, lateral geniculate and stria terminalis. \nBody/Tail Border Identification. Based on the protocol used in Maylykhin et al. (2007), we used a single criterion to identify the HB/HT border in the coronal plane. Navigating posteriorly from the HB, we defined the most anterior HT slice as that in which the tracer could visualize the crus of the fonix in full profile (Fig. 3). The fornix emerges superior to the HT. In the coronal plane, the crus of the fornix (full profile) is formed by a merging of fornix tissues superolateral and inferolateral to the pulvinar complex of the thalamus. Due to anatomical differences and differences in MRI quality, we considered the anterior border of the HT as the most anterior slice in which at least 75% of the crus of the fornix is visualized. The HT is bordered laterally by the lateral ventricle, medially by either CSF or white matter, inferiorly by white matter, and superiorly by either lateral ventricle or white matter. Care was taken to avoid including the pulvinar complex of the thalamus and tail of caudate on the superior border. White matter of the fornix was generally excluded, whereas the Fasciolar gyrus and Andreas Retzius gyrus were included (Amaral &amp; Lavenex, 2007). The posterior slice of the HT was identified as the most posterior coronal slice in which grey could be visualized inferomedial to the lateral ventricle (Pruessner et al., 2000).\n\nMIDUS Refresher: A 3T MR750 GE Healthcare MRI scanner (Waukesha, WI) and an 8-channel head coil were used to perform imaging. A three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence (Mugler and Brookeman, 1990) was used to acquire a T1-weighted anatomical image for functional data registration (TR = 8.2, TE = 3.2, flip angle = 12, field of view = 256mm, 256 X 256 matrix, 160 axial slices, inversion time = 450 ms). \nCortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation was performed with the FreeSurfer image analysis suite (v. 5.3.0), which is documented and freely available for download online (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). This processing includes motion correction and averaging (Reuter et al. 2010) of multiple volumetric T1-weighted images (when more than one is available), removal of non-brain tissue using a hybrid watershed/surface deformation procedure (Segonne et al., 2004), automated Talairach transformation, segmentation of the subcortical white matter and deep gray matter volumetric structures (including hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, putamen, ventricles) (Fischl et al., 2002; Fischl et al., 2004) intensity normalization (Sled et al., 1998), tessellation of the gray matter white matter boundary, automated topology correction (Fischl et al., 2001; Segonne et al., 2007), and surface deformation following intensity gradients to optimally place the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid borders at the location where the greatest shift in intensity defines the transition to the other tissue class (Dale et al., 1999; Dale and Sereno, 1993; Fischl and Dale, 2000). Once the cortical models are complete, a number of deformable procedures can be performed for further data processing and analysis including surface inflation (Fischl et al., 1999a), registration to a spherical atlas which is based on individual cortical folding patterns to match cortical geometry across subjects (Fischl et al., 1999b), parcellation of the cerebral cortex into units with respect to gyral and sulcal structure (Desikan et al., 2006; Fischl et al., 2004b), and creation of a variety of surface based data including maps of curvature and sulcal depth. This method uses both intensity and continuity information from the entire three-dimensional MR volume in segmentation and deformation procedures to produce representations of cortical thickness, calculated as the closest distance from the gray/white boundary to the gray/CSF boundary at each vertex on the tessellated surface (Fischl and Dale, 2000). The maps are created using spatial intensity gradients across tissue classes and are therefore not simply reliant on absolute signal intensity. The maps produced are not restricted to the voxel resolution of the original data thus are capable of detecting submillimeter differences between groups.
