Each of these variables will be assessed by its own question, which will follow the following structure, with \u201c[food]\u201d serving as a placeholder for each of the 8 foods to be assessed: \u201cHow often do you eat [food]?\u201d with responses (and how they will be scored in parentheses; not shown to participants) including never (1), a few times per year (2), once per month (3), a few times per month (4), once per week (5), 2 to 3 days per week (6), 4 to 6 days per week (7), 1 meal per day (8), 2 meals per day (9), and 3 or more meals per day (10). For example, for beef, this question will read, \u201cHow often do you eat beef?\u201d For coffee and soda this question will read, \u201cdrink\u201d instead of \u201ceat,\u201d and the 8th, 9th, and 10th responses will read, \u201ccup(s) per day\u201d instead of \u201cmeal(s) per day.\u201d\n\nOur 8 disgust independent variables are disgust toward fish, pork, oatmeal, tofu, soda, chicken, beef, and coffee. Each of these variables will be assessed by its own set of 3 items, which will follow the following structure, with \u201c[food]\u201d serving as a placeholder for each of the 8 foods to be assessed: \u201c[Food] is disgusting,\u201d \u201cThe thought of eating [food] makes me nauseous,\u201d and \u201c[Food] is gross,\u201d measured via a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).

Participants will complete the association scale respective to their own gender, with women completing the cleanliness=femininity association and men completing the risk-taking=masculinity association. For women participants, the scale will lead with the following prompt: \u201cCompared to men, women are expected to be more\u2026\u201d and will follow with 4 items on separate lines below, each presenting a Likert-type from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree): \u201cclean,\u201d \u201chygienic,\u201d \u201csanitary,\u201d and \u201cpristine.\u201d For men participants, the scale will lead with the following prompt: \u201cCompared to women, men are expected to be more\u2026\u201d and will follow with 4 items on separate lines below, each presenting a Likert-type from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree): \u201crisk-taking,\u201d \u201cbrave,\u201d \u201ccourageous,\u201d and \u201cadventurous.\u201d\n\nEndorsement of gender roles in eating will be assessed by 5 items.

how people extract structure from their environments (commonly called \u201cStatistical Learning\u201d) have shown that the statistical structure of the environment affects how learners allocate their attention: Infants selectively attend to parts of their input that are neither highly predictable nor highly unpredictable (Kidd, Piantadosi, &amp; Aslin, 2012), and adults allocate attention to regular rather than irregular sequences (Zhao, Al-Aidroos, &amp; Turk-Browne, 2013). This raises two questions, which are the focus of the current project: (1) Do children and adults show different attention allocation profiles in response to the structure of the environment such that children show a stronger preference than adults do to preferentially attend to more or less predictable aspects of their environment, and (2) How does attention allocation vary across learners (within age group), and what are the relations between individual differences in attention allocation and learning outcomes.\nThis is a follow-up preregistration to a nearly identical preregistration submitted for an earlier version of this project. The exposure phase described below will be identical to the previous version. The test phase will the differ slightly, as described below.\n\nThis study and the previous version of this study address the question of \u201cHow does attention allocation vary across learners?\u201d and focuses on adult learners. We will use a modified version of the paradigm introduced by Zhao et al. (2013). Four statistical streams each constructed from four pairs of stimuli will be presented simultaneously in four locations on the screen (at a rate of 1 shape from each stream/sec). Each stream will be characterized by different levels of predictability/information quantity: A random stream (Rate of information = 0.9bits), a highly unpredictable stream (4 pairs with within-pair transitional probabilities (TPs) = 0.4; Rate of information = 0.68), a semi-predictable stream (4 pairs with within-pair TPs = 0.8; Rate of information = 0.48), and a fully predictable stream (4 pairs with within-pair TPs = 1; Rate of information = 0.3; note: all Rate of information are calculated using log10). Each stream will consist of 60 repetitions of each pair (8 shapes*60 rep = 480 shapes per stream overall). \nAs in Zhao et al., we will use a visual search task to examine attention allocation. Every 5 trials on average (with a range from 3 non-search trials to 8 non-search trials, with 96 search trials overall, 24 per location) a search trial will appear in place of another set of shapes from the four streams (and in the same locations as the streams), and the subject will have to identify a unique item from the 4 presented options. We will adapt the Zhao et al task slightly, such that the search task will change from asking participants to indicate the direction of the tail of a \u201cT\u201d character amongst \u201cL\u201d characters, to asking participants to indicate whether the stem of a four-leaf clover (amongst three-leaf clovers) was a line or a circle. \nWe will also track participants eye movements during the course of exposure to get additional measures (fixations to each stream, looking away probability) of what participants were attending to on each of the learning trials. \n\nAfter the exposure and search task, participants will complete a second, novel, statistical learning exposure phase of a totally new structure of different objects. Then, after watching these shapes, they will complete a test with both alternative-forced-choice (AFC) trials and pattern recognition trials to assess learning of that new stream. The design of this task will be based on Siegelman et al. 2017.  \n\nWe will run a total of 48 adult subjects, from the University of Toronto subject pool. This number was chosen based off the results of a power analysis using data previously collected in the same design (without eye tracking \u2013 based only on the search task data). We used those data to carry out a sensitivity analysis of the interaction between entropy and trial (post-hoc power from that experiment (n = 75) was 1.0). Then, to calculate the number of participants we would need for 90% power in the study described here, we randomly sampled a subset of our participants across a range of sample sizes (n = 10-75) and carried out a new sensitivity analysis at each sample size (total of 1000 bootstrapped iterations at each N). This gave us an expected power value at each sample size from 10-75, which allowed us to determine that after about 35 participants we will continuously be above 90% power. Because our design involves counterbalancing the location of each predictability level, we chose a sample size of 48 to ensure the same number of participants in each counterbalance. \nTo ensure our participants are paying attention to our task and following instructions, we will not include participants who fail to respond correctly to 80% or more of the search trials. We also will not include participants for whom the eye tracker fails to collect reliable data (completely missing data on more than 25% of trials). These subjects will be replaced with additional participants until we have collected useable data from 48 people.\n\nData pre-processing and outlier removal: Prior to all analysis, RTs in the search trials will be log-transformed. Trials in which log-RTs are 2 SDs slower/faster from the subject mean will be removed. Fixations shorter than 80msec will be excluded from the analysis. Remaining fixation durations will be log-transformed and an identical outlier removal procedure to the one of search trials RT will be applied (cutoff: mean+-2SD).\n\nVariables and analysis: \n1.\tEffect of rate of information on attention allocation: here we will examine the relation between rate of information and mean RTs in the search trials. First, we will run a mixed effect model to see whether there is a significant effect of condition/rate of information on search trials RT. A significant effect of condition on search trials response latencies will be interpreted as evidence for learning \u2013 differential attention allocation behavior to streams with different information quantity.  We will then further examine the shape of the RT by rate of information function (whether it shows a U-shape function, as suggested by Kidd et al, or another consistent curvature). Since we only have 4 conditions, examination of the exact shape will not be based on comparison of linear/non-linear models. Instead, we will compare all pairs of conditions to one another (using contrasts in mixed models) to see what is the rank-order of the different conditions and what is conditions have significant faster/slower responses than others. Parallel models will be used to examine the effect of rate of information on fixation duration and looking away probabilities. \n2.\tAttention allocation across time: Here we will examine whether attention allocation shifts over time to less/more predictable locations. To do so we will run a mixed effect model analysis predicting search task RTs from trial number, rate of information, and their interaction. We predict a significant interaction, again to be interpreted as evidence for learning that each location includes a different level of structure \u2013 differential attention allocation over time as a function of the information to be processed from the stream. We will explore contrasts of this interaction (i.e., whether over time participants attend more/less to more/less predictable streams). Again, parallel models will be used with the same predictors but with fixation durations and looking away probabilities as dependent variables.  \n3.\tModeling information extraction across time: To further explore changes in attention allocation across time, we will continuously quantify the amount of information in each of the four streams at each point during exposure. This will be based on a continuous entropy estimation at each step based on the items presented in each of the four streams. The rationale behind this analysis is that during the exposure phase participants do not have access yet to the overall rate of information at each stream; instead, they can only rely on the stimuli that they actually observed up until each time point. We will therefore use this \"continuous entropy\" measure as a predictor in the models in (2) (replacing the overall rate of information in the stream), examining its effect on both search trials RT and fixation durations, and its interaction with trial number. This will test for differential attention allocation over time as a function of the amount of information available in each stream at each time point. \n4.\tBasic analysis of statistical learning performance: As a first step, we will examine whether there is a significant learning effect in the second statistical learning task at the group-level (using t-tests comparing mean performance on the Alternative Force Choice and pattern completion tests to chance). We expect to find significant group-level learning with substantial individual differences, in line with previous data on the same task (e.g. Siegelman, Bogaerts, &amp; Frost, 2017).\n5.\tGroup-level relation between attention allocation and learning: here we will examine whether subjects who were better learners relative to the group show a different attentional allocation profile than worse learners. To do so, we will median-split the performance of learners on the second statistical learning task. Good vs. Bad learners will then be included as a factor in the models described above to determine if learning qualifies the effect of rate of information or its interaction with time. \n \nReferences:\n \nKidd, C., Piantadosi, S.

This raises two questions, which are the focus of the current project: (1) Do children and adults show different attention allocation profiles in response to the structure of the environment such that children show a stronger preference than adults do to preferentially attend to more or less predictable aspects of their environment, and (2) How does attention allocation vary across learners (within age group), and what are the relations between individual differences in attention allocation and learning outcomes.\nThis is a follow-up preregistration to a nearly identical preregistration submitted for an earlier version of this project. The exposure phase described below will be identical to the previous version. The test phase will the differ slightly, as described below.\n\nThis study and the previous version of this study address the question of \u201cHow does attention allocation vary across learners?\u201d and focuses on adult learners.

This is a case of scalar implicature.

In particular, we ask whether the use of numerals in the same context can affect offline processing of scalar implicature, by making comprehenders more aware of the more natural  alternative labels (e.g., Two of the books were interesting).", "q4": "We predict that the knowledgeability effect reported by Goodman and Stuhlmuller (2013) should be reduced when the surrounding context contains numerals.

Children suffered multiple forms of abuse before Kempes work, yet medical professionals and politicians were ignorant of the issue. Defense attorneys and prosecuting attorneys adopted the term for different legal reasons, including the use of battered child syndrome (BCS) evidence to prove child abuse, and, alternatively, as a self-defense claim in cases where children killed their abusive parents (i.e., adolescent parricide), presumably in self-defense. Thus, the criminal law pertaining to children accused of patricide was ripe for developments in self-defense law that came with the emergence of the then new, battered woman syndrome (Walker, 1984). As in BWS cases, defense attorneys commonly introduce BCS evidence to satisfy the element of imminent harm in self-defense claims (State v. Young, 1991; State v. Gachot, 1992; State v. Janes, 1993). Specifically, some courts allow the admittance of BCS testimony to assist the trier of fact in determining whether the belief in imminent harm was reasonable. When battered children kill their parents in a non-confrontational manner, defense attorneys proffer BCS testimony to demonstrate how years of abuse can distort childrens perceptions in two ways: through increased arousal (i.e., hypervigilance) and through re-traumatization (e.g., recurring, stressful dreams of the event) (Goldman, 1994). Thus, expert testimony can help explain why a child reasonably believed she or he was in danger and needed to use deadly force even in the absence of an immediate threat to her or himself (Goldman, 1994). Although BWS evidence is widely accepted as a self-defense claim, BCS evidence has had limited success. Instead of questioning whether BCS evidence should be admitted into evidence, the current project questions how jurors respond to BCS evidence, specifically in cases involving adolescent parricide. Will BCS testimony result in verdicts that are more lenient? Could this effect depend on various characteristics of the case? While initial research concerning the influence of BWS expert testimony evidence on guilty verdicts revealed few differences in verdict choices between the presence and absence of BWS testimony (Finkel, Meister, &amp; Lightfoot, 1991; Kasian, Spanos, Terrance, &amp; Peebles, 1993), subsequent investigations demonstrated an increased likelihood of lenient rulings when expert witnesses offer BWS testimony (Terrance, Plumm, &amp; Rhyner, 2012). This research shows that different types of testimony may be more successful for self-defense pleas than are other types and that evaluator gender may moderate this effect (Plumm &amp; Terrance, 2009; Terrance, Plumm, &amp; Rhyner, 2012). The purpose of the current research proposal is to extend the findings for BWS expert testimony to BCS expert testimony.

In the previous study, Feiman and Barner used a \u201cGive a Quantifier\u201d task, asking children to give \u201ca\u201d, \u201call\u201d, \u201cevery\u201d, \u201ceach\u201d, \u201csome\u201d or \u201cdax\u201d of the small toy objects in front of them. We found that children below age 6 gave random quantities for \u201csome\u201d and \u201cdax\u201d \u2013 anywhere from 1 to 5 toys. However, while 6- and 7-year-old children gave 2, 3 or 4 fish, they avoided giving 1 or 5 when asked for \u201csome\u201d, but not when asked for \u201cdax\u201d, suggesting that they treated \u201call\u201d and \u201ca\u201d as alternatives to \u201csome\u201d, but did not think of \u201cdax\u201d as having the same alternatives.\n\nIn Experiment 1, we eliminate the \"each\" and \"every\" quantifiers from the other experiment, testing only \"a\", \"all\", \"some\" and \"dax\", to ask whether 6- and 7-year-olds, but not younger children will assume that a request for \"some\" implies a request to give neither all (i.e. 5) of the objects, nor to give /a/ (i.e. 1) of them, while a request for \"dax\" does not similarly imply anything.\n\nIn Experiment 2, we ask whether having \u201call\u201d as a lexically stored alternative to \u201csome\u201d is sufficient for children to draw this implicature, or whether they also require the alternatives to be present in the experimental context itself. While Experiment 1 contains the relevant lexical alternatives on other trials (\u201ca\u201d and \u201call\u201d), Experiment 2 replaces these with a different pair of alternatives (\u201ctwo\u201d and \u201cthree\u201d).

We will then compare Experiment 1 to Experiment 2, as described below.\n\nExperiment 1\nStep 1: Manipulation (sanity) checks\nIndependent of the analyses of theoretical interest described below (concerning the difference between \"some\" and \"dax\"), we want sanity checks on the other quantifiers (\"all\" and \"a\" in Exp 1., \"two\" and \"three\" in Exp 2). I.e. we want to make sure that kids are understanding what they\u2019re being asked to do on the task in general, across all ages.\n\nSo, for \u201cAll\u201d, we want to check whether kids give 5/5 at all ages.\n\nStep 1, Analysis 1\n\u201cAll\u201d\nData: Only \u201cAll\u201d trials\nDV: Binary: 1 if giving 5/5; 0 if giving anything else\nRandom IV:  Intercept by subject\nFixed IVs: Age (Continuous) + Intercept\nType of analysis: Logistic Regression\n\nStep 1, Analysis 2\n\u201cA\u201d\nData: Only \u201cA\u201d trials \nDV: Binary: 1 if giving 1/5; 0 if giving anything else\nFixed IVs: Age (Continuous) + Intercept \nRandom IV:  Intercept by subject\nType of analysis: Logistic Regression\n\nFor both of these analyses, based on prior work (our own previous experiment, as well as, e.g. Barner, Chow, Yang (2009), we expect Age to not be significant, and the intercept to be highly significant -- i.e. across ages, all kids should be getting it right. If we do find an effect of age, we will follow up with a Johnson-Neyman analysis to see if there is an age range where the intercept is not significant. This would give us an age at which kids fail, and a boundary age, after which they succeed.\n\nOne reasonable possibility is to restrict subsequent analyses of whether kids avoid giving, e.g. 5/5 for \u201csome\u201d or for \u201cdax\u201d, only to those kids who do give 5/5 when asked to give \u201call\u201d (since, theoretically, they should be avoiding giving 5/5 for \u201csome\u201d due to competition with \u201call\u201d). However, excluding such children threatens  the validity of our age estimate. If, e.g. younger kids do understand the meaning of \u201call\u201d, but are just individually noisier givers than older kids in general, by excluding such kids we would have a priori prevented ourselves from finding any average difference between their responses to \u201csome\u201d and \u201cdax\u201d at that younger age. We therefore will not exclude any children in subsequent analyses on the basis of incorrect responding to \u201call\u201d or \u201ca\u201d.\n\nStep 2: looking for a difference between Some and Dax\nStep 2, Analysis 1\nThe question of theoretical interest in Experiment 1 is whether children give 1 object out of 5 (1/5), 5 objects out of 5 (5/5), or else some other number (2/5, 3/5, or 4/5) in response to different prompts. Although the amounts of objects children can give are inherently physically ordered (giving 2 is more than giving 1 and less than giving 4 or 5), we do not have any theoretical reason to think that children\u2019s responses would be ordered in the same way. That is, we don\u2019t think that giving 1/5 is in any way \u2018closer\u2019 to giving the next number up, 2/5, than it is to giving some other number like 4/5 or 5/5. Therefore, we treat the dependent variable in Experiment 1 as categorical rather than ordinal, with three mutually exclusive categories: giving 1/5, giving 5/5, or giving anything else (2/5, 3/5, or 4/5).\n\nThe basic analytic approach is therefore multinomial logistic regression, with the DV coded into 3 categories, (1/5, 5/5, or anything else), as above. We code \u201cgiving anything else\u201d as the reference level, and so compare two DVs: the rate of giving 1/5 more than the \u2018anything else\u2019 category, and the rate of giving 5/5 more than the \u2018anything else\u2019 category.\n\nData: Only the \"Some\" and \"Dax\" trials.\nFixed IVs: Age (continuous) * Quantifier (2 levels: Some vs. Dax)\nRandom IVs: (1) Subject intercept; (2) random slope of Quantifier by subject; (3) correlation between the two. If this maximal model converges, great; if not, remove correlation between the two variables; If still no convergence, remove random slope of Quantifier by subject. (this follows the maximal-first recommendation from Barr, et al., 2013)\nDVs: Multinomial (ternary, categorical with 3 levels): giving 1/5, giving 5/5, or giving anything else (2/5, 3/5, or 4/5)\nType of analysis: Multinomial Logistic Regression\n\n-------\nThe overall model specification in GLMER syntax here is:\n\nHowManyGiven ~ Age * Quantifier + (Quantifier|Subject)\n\n\nStep 2, Analysis 2+\nThe second analysis is contingent on there being a significant interaction in Analysis 1 of this step (Step 2). In the case that there is, we will run the corresponding Johnson-Neyman analysis to pinpoint the age at which children begin to differentiate \"some\" trials from \"dax\" trials. Note that this is contingent on the availability of adaptations of Johnson-Neyman to multinomial regression, of which we are at present uncertain. If no such adaptation exists, we will run Johnson-Neyman on two separate logistic regressions, coding two separate DVs (giving 1/5 vs. anything else; giving 5/5 vs. anything else).\n\nStep 2, Analysis 3\nThe third analysis will look at the correlation between the rate of 1/5 and 5/5 responses as a dependent variable, with Quantifier and Age as IVs. We still need to figure out a good way to implement this analysis.\n\nOn many different accounts, acquiring \"a\" as an alternative and acquiring \"all\" as an alternative should be fairly independent from each other. However, a dependency between them would be predicted by a model where the limiting factor is not knowing the individual alternatives, but a common ability to derive scalar implicatures (relative to either alternative). This analysis is of lesser importance because we may not have the power to estimate whether the effects of the IVs on the two DVs is correlated, and the effect of the IVs on each DV is independently interpretable regardless of whether there is sufficient power to look for this correlation.\n\nStep 3: looking at the simple effects within each quantifier request\nThis step is contingent on there being either a significant effect of Quantifier, or a significant interaction of Quantifier by Age (or both) in Step 2. This analysis looks at the \u2018simple effects\u2019 -- whether kids avoid giving 5/5 and 1/5 relative to anything else within each quantifier separately, and whether there is an effect of age within each quantifier.\n\nThere is one major notable difference between the analyses in Step 2 and Step 3. In Step 2, we do not care about the baseline rate of giving \u2018anything else\u2019 \u2013 we only care about whether it is different in response to requests for \u201csome\u201d than for \u201cdax\u201d. However, in Step 3, we do care about the specific rates \u2013 we want to know whether kids give 5/5 less than, e.g. 2/5 or 3/5. This means that we can\u2019t simply group all of the \u2018anything else\u2019 trials into a single outcome, since we\u2019d predict triple the number of responses summing across 2/5, 3/5 and 4/5 than we would expect for each of these responses separately.\n\nWe will consider two approaches to this problem, depending on which works with the assumptions of multinomial regression. The first and conceptually ideal option is to divide all responses of 2/5, 3/5 and 4/5 by 3, while still grouping the three types of responses into a single category. Effectively, each such responses would weigh 1/3 as much as a responses of 5/5. However, we are not sure at present whether a multinomial regression allows this kind of coding scheme for the DVs. In the case that it doesn\u2019t, we will solve this problem just by coding every level of the DV into a separate category, creating a 5-level DV. We would then run these models twice: once with giving 5/5 coded as the reference level, and once with 1/5 coded as the reference level, and compare these to each other response individually.\n\nAnalyses 1 and 2\nWhatever the approach taken above, the rest is the same. Analyses 1 and 2 will be two separate but identical multinomial regressions, one for just \u201csome\u201d trials, and one for just \u201cdax\u201d trials.\n\nAnalysis 3+\nFinally, contingent on there being significant effects of age, up to four separate analyses will look at the age at which the effect becomes significantly different from zero, using the Johnson-Neyman technique. This will use 2 analyses over each multinomial regression, if possible. However, if there is no implementation of J-N for multinomial regressions, we will use up to 4 separate logistic regressions, for 2 levels of the Quantifier IV (\u201csome\u201d; \u201cdax\u201d) by the 2 DVs of interests (1/5 vs. anything else; 5/5 vs. anything else)\n\nExperiment 2\nStep 1: Manipulation (sanity) checks\nFirst, we want to do the same manipulation checks on kids\u2019 giving in response to requests for \u201ctwo\u201d and \u201cthree\u201d as we did for \u201ca\u201d and \u201call\u201d in Experiment 1. Note, however, that the prediction here is different \u2013 we do not necessarily expect all 3-year-olds to be \u20182-knowers\u2019 or \u20183-knowers\u2019, per much existing literature on the Give-a-Number task.\n\nStep 1, Analysis 1\n\u201cTwo\u201d\nData: Only \u201cTwo\u201d trials\nDV: Binary: 1 if giving 2/5; 0 if giving anything else\nRandom IV:  Intercept by subject\nFixed IVs: Age (Continuous) + Intercept\nType of analysis: Logistic Regression\n\nStep 1, Analysis 2\n\u201cThree\u201d\nData: Only \u201cThree\u201d trials \nDV: Binary: 1 if giving 3/5; 0 if giving anything else\nFixed IVs: Age (Continuous) + Intercept \nRandom IV:  Intercept by subject\nType of analysis: Logistic Regression\n\nStep 2: looking for a difference between Some and Dax\nWe use the same general approach in this experiment, with one significant modification: instead of always lumping 2/5, 3/5 and 4/5 responses into a single category of \u2018giving anything else\u2019, we are going to use multiple different coding schemes of this DV to answer different questions. The model specification is the same in all of these cases:\n\nHowManyGiven ~ Age * Quantifier + (Quantifier|Subject)\n\nWhat changes is how the \u2018HowManyGiven\u2019 variable is coded.\n\nStep 2, Analysis 1\nOne question is the same as in Experiment 1 \u2013 do kids avoid giving 1/5 and 5/5 when asked for \u201csome\u201d more than for \u201cDax\u201d, and whether this interacts with Age. However, we can no longer use the same ternary coding scheme as before, of 1/5, 5/5, or anything else, because the \u2018anything else\u2019 category includes 2/5 and 3/5, which might themselves be avoided due to competition with the other requests. The only really meaningful comparison to a \u2018baseline\u2019 is to 4/5.\n\nAnother, related question is whether children avoid giving the correct responses for the mentioned alternatives (2/5 and 3/5) relative to a response that is never mentioned (4/5).\n\nWe try to answer both of these questions with a single analysis. We treat each possible response as a separate level of our categorical DV. In total, this means there are now 5 levels of the categorical DV \u2013 one for each number given. The only response that we theoretically expect to be a \u2018baseline\u2019 is giving 4/5, since this is neither one of the mentioned alternative requests (\u201ctwo\u201d, \u201cthree\u201d), nor one of the hypothesized scalar alternatives (\u201ca\u201d, \u201call\u201d). We therefore code giving 4/5 as the baseline reference level of the DV, and compare all other responses to this baseline.\n\nOur Quantifier IV is the same as before \u2013 we care about the difference between \u201cSome\u201d and \u201cDax\u201d, but we now care about it relative to 4 different DVs \u2013 the rates of giving each of 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 5/5, relative to the rate of giving 4/5.\n\nStep 2, Analysis 2\nWe also want to know whether children avoid giving both of 1/5 and 5/5 more than both 2/5 and 3/5 (again for \u201csome\u201d, more than for \u201cdax\u201d, again interacting with Age). For this analysis we exclude trials where children gave 4/5, and run a logistic regression with just one binary DV: coding giving 1/5 and 5/5 as 1 and coding giving 2/5 and 3/5 as 0.\n\nIf there is a significant difference, we may also want to look at each of the 5/5 and 1/5 responses individually, relative to both 2/5 and 3/5 lumped together (as in Step 3 of Experiment 1).\n\nStep 2, Analysis 3+\nAs in Experiment 1, wherever there are significant interactions between Quantifier and Age, we will want to run a Johnson-Neyman analysis on the same regression models to identify the age at which the number of objects children give begins to depend on whether they were asked to give \u201csome\u201d or \u201cdax\u201d.\n\nStep 3: looking at the simple effects within each quantifier\nAs in Experiment 1, this step is contingent on there being either a significant effect of Quantifier, or a significant interaction of Quantifier by Age (or both) in Step 2. This analysis looks at the \u2018simple effects\u2019: whether kids avoid giving 5/5 and 1/5 \u2013 and now also 2/5 and 3/5 -- relative to 4/5 within each quantifier separately, and whether there is an effect of age within each quantifier.\n\nSince we care about exactly the same DVs as in Step 2, we will simply repeat all of the 3 analyses in Step 2 separately for \u201csome\u201d and for \u201cdax\u201d trials. The issue with a baseline no longer arises, since we are coding each number given separately, into a 5-level DV (in Analysis 1 and into a simple binary DV (using a binary logistic regression) in Analysis 2. Analysis 3 will again apply Johnson-Neyman to whichever effects are significant (as in Experiment 1), comparing the baseline of no differences between the rates of giving different quantities of objects.\n\nComparing Experiment 1 and Experiment 2\nStep 1: We want to know if the number of toys children gave in response to requests for \u201csome\u201d and for \u201cdax\u201d differed depending on the Experiment, both relative to each other, and in absolute terms.\n\nDVs: To make the experiments comparable, we will use the same coding scheme as in Experiment 1 alone: a ternary DV: giving 1/5, 5/5, or anything else. This again leads to using a multinomial regression.\n\nAnalysis 1: Omnibus comparison of Q * Exp * Age\nWe first ask whether \u201csome\u201d and \u201cdax\u201d differ relative to each other. We select just the data from the \u201csome\u201d and \u201cdax\u201d trials, from both Experiments.\n\nIVs: The fixed effects of interest here are Quantifier (\u201csome\u201d or \u201cdax\u201d), Experiment (1 or 2), and Age, and the full set of interaction terms. If the presence of different alternative requests (in Exp 1 vs 2) makes a difference to children\u2019s giving behavior, we expect that to be the case at older, but not younger ages. In other words, on this hypothesis we expect a 3-way interaction. On the alternative hypothesis, where the presence of alternative requests doesn\u2019t make a difference, we expect no interactions or effects involving Exp 1 vs. 2, but the same interaction of Age with Quantifier as we would see in Exps 1 and 2 alone.\n\nAnalyses 2 and 3: Simple effects of each Quantifier\nHere we ask whether children\u2019s giving behavior on \u201csome\u201d requests alone, and on \u201cdax\u201d requests alone differs depending on the Experiment. We break down the analysis above into two identical analyses, one for \u201cdax\u201d and one for \u201csome\u201d. This means removing the effect of Quantifier from the IVs, so that the IV specification is now Experiment * Age.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q21": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "- Any child who gives exactly the same number of toys in response to every single question (i.e. all 16 requests within the experiment) will be excluded under the assumption that such a child does not understand the game.\n- Any child who does not complete the entire experiment will be excluded.

We found that children below age 6 gave random quantities for \u201csome\u201d and \u201cdax\u201d \u2013 anywhere from 1 to 5 toys. However, while 6- and 7-year-old children gave 2, 3 or 4 fish, they avoided giving 1 or 5 when asked for \u201csome\u201d, but not when asked for \u201cdax\u201d, suggesting that they treated \u201call\u201d and \u201ca\u201d as alternatives to \u201csome\u201d, but did not think of \u201cdax\u201d as having the same alternatives.\n\nIn Experiment 1, we eliminate the \"each\" and \"every\" quantifiers from the other experiment, testing only \"a\", \"all\", \"some\" and \"dax\", to ask whether 6- and 7-year-olds, but not younger children will assume that a request for \"some\" implies a request to give neither all (i.e. 5) of the objects, nor to give /a/ (i.e. 1) of them, while a request for \"dax\" does not similarly imply anything.\n\nIn Experiment 2, we ask whether having \u201call\u201d as a lexically stored alternative to \u201csome\u201d is sufficient for children to draw this implicature, or whether they also require the alternatives to be present in the experimental context itself.

To keep the experiment lively, the experimenter will alternate between asking for objects in an Elmo voice, and having Elmo \u201cwhisper\u201d in the experimenter\u2019s ear, so the experimenter would then relay the request to the child. Whether Elmo or the experimenter are saying it, children will always be asked to give objects in the same frame: Can you give Elmo  fruit/sheep/fish? On each trial, the determiner is one of the following: some, dax, a, and all.\n\nExperiment 2: Identical to Experiment 1, except the determiner will be one of the following: some, dax, two, and three\n\nVariables:\nThis is a mixed design, involving both between and within subject variables.\n\nBetween subjects:\n-  Alternative Requests: whether the other requests made in the study are \"a\" and \"all\", or \"two\" and \"three\" is between subjects.

We will then compare Experiment 1 to Experiment 2, as described below.\n\nExperiment 1\nStep 1: Manipulation (sanity) checks\nIndependent of the analyses of theoretical interest described below (concerning the difference between \"some\" and \"dax\"), we want sanity checks on the other quantifiers (\"all\" and \"a\" in Exp 1., \"two\" and \"three\" in Exp 2). I.e. we want to make sure that kids are understanding what they\u2019re being asked to do on the task in general, across all ages.\n\nSo, for \u201cAll\u201d, we want to check whether kids give 5/5 at all ages.\n\nStep 1, Analysis 1\n\u201cAll\u201d\nData: Only \u201cAll\u201d trials\nDV: Binary: 1 if giving 5/5; 0 if giving anything else\nRandom IV:  Intercept by subject\nFixed IVs: Age (Continuous) + Intercept\nType of analysis: Logistic Regression\n\nStep 1, Analysis 2\n\u201cA\u201d\nData: Only \u201cA\u201d trials \nDV: Binary: 1 if giving 1/5; 0 if giving anything else\nFixed IVs: Age (Continuous) + Intercept \nRandom IV:  Intercept by subject\nType of analysis: Logistic Regression\n\nFor both of these analyses, based on prior work (our own previous experiment, as well as, e.g. Barner, Chow, Yang (2009), we expect Age to not be significant, and the intercept to be highly significant -- i.e. across ages, all kids should be getting it right. If we do find an effect of age, we will follow up with a Johnson-Neyman analysis to see if there is an age range where the intercept is not significant. This would give us an age at which kids fail, and a boundary age, after which they succeed.\n\nOne reasonable possibility is to restrict subsequent analyses of whether kids avoid giving, e.g. 5/5 for \u201csome\u201d or for \u201cdax\u201d, only to those kids who do give 5/5 when asked to give \u201call\u201d (since, theoretically, they should be avoiding giving 5/5 for \u201csome\u201d due to competition with \u201call\u201d). However, excluding such children threatens  the validity of our age estimate. If, e.g. younger kids do understand the meaning of \u201call\u201d, but are just individually noisier givers than older kids in general, by excluding such kids we would have a priori prevented ourselves from finding any average difference between their responses to \u201csome\u201d and \u201cdax\u201d at that younger age. We therefore will not exclude any children in subsequent analyses on the basis of incorrect responding to \u201call\u201d or \u201ca\u201d.\n\nStep 2: looking for a difference between Some and Dax\nStep 2, Analysis 1\nThe question of theoretical interest in Experiment 1 is whether children give 1 object out of 5 (1/5), 5 objects out of 5 (5/5), or else some other number (2/5, 3/5, or 4/5) in response to different prompts. Although the amounts of objects children can give are inherently physically ordered (giving 2 is more than giving 1 and less than giving 4 or 5), we do not have any theoretical reason to think that children\u2019s responses would be ordered in the same way. That is, we don\u2019t think that giving 1/5 is in any way \u2018closer\u2019 to giving the next number up, 2/5, than it is to giving some other number like 4/5 or 5/5. Therefore, we treat the dependent variable in Experiment 1 as categorical rather than ordinal, with three mutually exclusive categories: giving 1/5, giving 5/5, or giving anything else (2/5, 3/5, or 4/5).\n\nThe basic analytic approach is therefore multinomial logistic regression, with the DV coded into 3 categories, (1/5, 5/5, or anything else), as above. We code \u201cgiving anything else\u201d as the reference level, and so compare two DVs: the rate of giving 1/5 more than the \u2018anything else\u2019 category, and the rate of giving 5/5 more than the \u2018anything else\u2019 category.\n\nData: Only the \"Some\" and \"Dax\" trials.\nFixed IVs: Age (continuous) * Quantifier (2 levels: Some vs. Dax)\nRandom IVs: (1) Subject intercept; (2) random slope of Quantifier by subject; (3) correlation between the two. If this maximal model converges, great; if not, remove correlation between the two variables; If still no convergence, remove random slope of Quantifier by subject. (this follows the maximal-first recommendation from Barr, et al., 2013)\nDVs: Multinomial (ternary, categorical with 3 levels): giving 1/5, giving 5/5, or giving anything else (2/5, 3/5, or 4/5)\nType of analysis: Multinomial Logistic Regression\n\n-------\nThe overall model specification in GLMER syntax here is:\n\nHowManyGiven ~ Age * Quantifier + (Quantifier|Subject)\n\n\nStep 2, Analysis 2+\nThe second analysis is contingent on there being a significant interaction in Analysis 1 of this step (Step 2). In the case that there is, we will run the corresponding Johnson-Neyman analysis to pinpoint the age at which children begin to differentiate \"some\" trials from \"dax\" trials. Note that this is contingent on the availability of adaptations of Johnson-Neyman to multinomial regression, of which we are at present uncertain. If no such adaptation exists, we will run Johnson-Neyman on two separate logistic regressions, coding two separate DVs (giving 1/5 vs. anything else; giving 5/5 vs. anything else).\n\nStep 2, Analysis 3\nThe third analysis will look at the correlation between the rate of 1/5 and 5/5 responses as a dependent variable, with Quantifier and Age as IVs. We still need to figure out a good way to implement this analysis.\n\nOn many different accounts, acquiring \"a\" as an alternative and acquiring \"all\" as an alternative should be fairly independent from each other. However, a dependency between them would be predicted by a model where the limiting factor is not knowing the individual alternatives, but a common ability to derive scalar implicatures (relative to either alternative). This analysis is of lesser importance because we may not have the power to estimate whether the effects of the IVs on the two DVs is correlated, and the effect of the IVs on each DV is independently interpretable regardless of whether there is sufficient power to look for this correlation.\n\nStep 3: looking at the simple effects within each quantifier request\nThis step is contingent on there being either a significant effect of Quantifier, or a significant interaction of Quantifier by Age (or both) in Step 2. This analysis looks at the \u2018simple effects\u2019 -- whether kids avoid giving 5/5 and 1/5 relative to anything else within each quantifier separately, and whether there is an effect of age within each quantifier.\n\nThere is one major notable difference between the analyses in Step 2 and Step 3. In Step 2, we do not care about the baseline rate of giving \u2018anything else\u2019 \u2013 we only care about whether it is different in response to requests for \u201csome\u201d than for \u201cdax\u201d. However, in Step 3, we do care about the specific rates \u2013 we want to know whether kids give 5/5 less than, e.g. 2/5 or 3/5. This means that we can\u2019t simply group all of the \u2018anything else\u2019 trials into a single outcome, since we\u2019d predict triple the number of responses summing across 2/5, 3/5 and 4/5 than we would expect for each of these responses separately.\n\nWe will consider two approaches to this problem, depending on which works with the assumptions of multinomial regression. The first and conceptually ideal option is to divide all responses of 2/5, 3/5 and 4/5 by 3, while still grouping the three types of responses into a single category. Effectively, each such responses would weigh 1/3 as much as a responses of 5/5. However, we are not sure at present whether a multinomial regression allows this kind of coding scheme for the DVs. In the case that it doesn\u2019t, we will solve this problem just by coding every level of the DV into a separate category, creating a 5-level DV. We would then run these models twice: once with giving 5/5 coded as the reference level, and once with 1/5 coded as the reference level, and compare these to each other response individually.\n\nAnalyses 1 and 2\nWhatever the approach taken above, the rest is the same. Analyses 1 and 2 will be two separate but identical multinomial regressions, one for just \u201csome\u201d trials, and one for just \u201cdax\u201d trials.\n\nAnalysis 3+\nFinally, contingent on there being significant effects of age, up to four separate analyses will look at the age at which the effect becomes significantly different from zero, using the Johnson-Neyman technique. This will use 2 analyses over each multinomial regression, if possible. However, if there is no implementation of J-N for multinomial regressions, we will use up to 4 separate logistic regressions, for 2 levels of the Quantifier IV (\u201csome\u201d; \u201cdax\u201d) by the 2 DVs of interests (1/5 vs. anything else; 5/5 vs. anything else)\n\nExperiment 2\nStep 1: Manipulation (sanity) checks\nFirst, we want to do the same manipulation checks on kids\u2019 giving in response to requests for \u201ctwo\u201d and \u201cthree\u201d as we did for \u201ca\u201d and \u201call\u201d in Experiment 1. Note, however, that the prediction here is different \u2013 we do not necessarily expect all 3-year-olds to be \u20182-knowers\u2019 or \u20183-knowers\u2019, per much existing literature on the Give-a-Number task.\n\nStep 1, Analysis 1\n\u201cTwo\u201d\nData: Only \u201cTwo\u201d trials\nDV: Binary: 1 if giving 2/5; 0 if giving anything else\nRandom IV:  Intercept by subject\nFixed IVs: Age (Continuous) + Intercept\nType of analysis: Logistic Regression\n\nStep 1, Analysis 2\n\u201cThree\u201d\nData: Only \u201cThree\u201d trials \nDV: Binary: 1 if giving 3/5; 0 if giving anything else\nFixed IVs: Age (Continuous) + Intercept \nRandom IV:  Intercept by subject\nType of analysis: Logistic Regression\n\nStep 2: looking for a difference between Some and Dax\nWe use the same general approach in this experiment, with one significant modification: instead of always lumping 2/5, 3/5 and 4/5 responses into a single category of \u2018giving anything else\u2019, we are going to use multiple different coding schemes of this DV to answer different questions. The model specification is the same in all of these cases:\n\nHowManyGiven ~ Age * Quantifier + (Quantifier|Subject)\n\nWhat changes is how the \u2018HowManyGiven\u2019 variable is coded.\n\nStep 2, Analysis 1\nOne question is the same as in Experiment 1 \u2013 do kids avoid giving 1/5 and 5/5 when asked for \u201csome\u201d more than for \u201cDax\u201d, and whether this interacts with Age. However, we can no longer use the same ternary coding scheme as before, of 1/5, 5/5, or anything else, because the \u2018anything else\u2019 category includes 2/5 and 3/5, which might themselves be avoided due to competition with the other requests. The only really meaningful comparison to a \u2018baseline\u2019 is to 4/5.\n\nAnother, related question is whether children avoid giving the correct responses for the mentioned alternatives (2/5 and 3/5) relative to a response that is never mentioned (4/5).\n\nWe try to answer both of these questions with a single analysis. We treat each possible response as a separate level of our categorical DV. In total, this means there are now 5 levels of the categorical DV \u2013 one for each number given. The only response that we theoretically expect to be a \u2018baseline\u2019 is giving 4/5, since this is neither one of the mentioned alternative requests (\u201ctwo\u201d, \u201cthree\u201d), nor one of the hypothesized scalar alternatives (\u201ca\u201d, \u201call\u201d). We therefore code giving 4/5 as the baseline reference level of the DV, and compare all other responses to this baseline.\n\nOur Quantifier IV is the same as before \u2013 we care about the difference between \u201cSome\u201d and \u201cDax\u201d, but we now care about it relative to 4 different DVs \u2013 the rates of giving each of 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 5/5, relative to the rate of giving 4/5.\n\nStep 2, Analysis 2\nWe also want to know whether children avoid giving both of 1/5 and 5/5 more than both 2/5 and 3/5 (again for \u201csome\u201d, more than for \u201cdax\u201d, again interacting with Age). For this analysis we exclude trials where children gave 4/5, and run a logistic regression with just one binary DV: coding giving 1/5 and 5/5 as 1 and coding giving 2/5 and 3/5 as 0.\n\nIf there is a significant difference, we may also want to look at each of the 5/5 and 1/5 responses individually, relative to both 2/5 and 3/5 lumped together (as in Step 3 of Experiment 1).\n\nStep 2, Analysis 3+\nAs in Experiment 1, wherever there are significant interactions between Quantifier and Age, we will want to run a Johnson-Neyman analysis on the same regression models to identify the age at which the number of objects children give begins to depend on whether they were asked to give \u201csome\u201d or \u201cdax\u201d.\n\nStep 3: looking at the simple effects within each quantifier\nAs in Experiment 1, this step is contingent on there being either a significant effect of Quantifier, or a significant interaction of Quantifier by Age (or both) in Step 2. This analysis looks at the \u2018simple effects\u2019: whether kids avoid giving 5/5 and 1/5 \u2013 and now also 2/5 and 3/5 -- relative to 4/5 within each quantifier separately, and whether there is an effect of age within each quantifier.\n\nSince we care about exactly the same DVs as in Step 2, we will simply repeat all of the 3 analyses in Step 2 separately for \u201csome\u201d and for \u201cdax\u201d trials. The issue with a baseline no longer arises, since we are coding each number given separately, into a 5-level DV (in Analysis 1 and into a simple binary DV (using a binary logistic regression) in Analysis 2. Analysis 3 will again apply Johnson-Neyman to whichever effects are significant (as in Experiment 1), comparing the baseline of no differences between the rates of giving different quantities of objects.\n\nComparing Experiment 1 and Experiment 2\nStep 1: We want to know if the number of toys children gave in response to requests for \u201csome\u201d and for \u201cdax\u201d differed depending on the Experiment, both relative to each other, and in absolute terms.\n\nDVs: To make the experiments comparable, we will use the same coding scheme as in Experiment 1 alone: a ternary DV: giving 1/5, 5/5, or anything else. This again leads to using a multinomial regression.\n\nAnalysis 1: Omnibus comparison of Q * Exp * Age\nWe first ask whether \u201csome\u201d and \u201cdax\u201d differ relative to each other. We select just the data from the \u201csome\u201d and \u201cdax\u201d trials, from both Experiments.\n\nIVs: The fixed effects of interest here are Quantifier (\u201csome\u201d or \u201cdax\u201d), Experiment (1 or 2), and Age, and the full set of interaction terms. If the presence of different alternative requests (in Exp 1 vs 2) makes a difference to children\u2019s giving behavior, we expect that to be the case at older, but not younger ages. In other words, on this hypothesis we expect a 3-way interaction. On the alternative hypothesis, where the presence of alternative requests doesn\u2019t make a difference, we expect no interactions or effects involving Exp 1 vs. 2, but the same interaction of Age with Quantifier as we would see in Exps 1 and 2 alone.\n\nAnalyses 2 and 3: Simple effects of each Quantifier\nHere we ask whether children\u2019s giving behavior on \u201csome\u201d requests alone, and on \u201cdax\u201d requests alone differs depending on the Experiment. We break down the analysis above into two identical analyses, one for \u201cdax\u201d and one for \u201csome\u201d. This means removing the effect of Quantifier from the IVs, so that the IV specification is now Experiment * Age.\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links":
