We would like to answer the question how specific agile project management practices predict job demands and job resources as well as positive and negative occupational wellbeing and attitudinal outcomes. It is expected that agile practices as a new work approach explains additional variance in the named relationships controlling for rather traditional high performance work systems characteristics. Furthermore it is expected that organizational as well as individual aspects strongly influence the relationships and effects of agile practices on job characteristics and wellbeing.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-09T11:32:26.192878", "date_modified": "2020-04-08T19:10:48.526453", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Sarah Rietze"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "0335b51a2d685aaf3d099975abd89c756f413f2bb957b0f30dd19669080dafc083052d5b34cfb620e21bd0511dd77b1ddd315d814c5da2382b3ffacafc11e29f0766acc677d0494ac1ef58ded5792e9291655a2ac0a7f8d4898bc209cc2a0a8856d4ccf228ed42019f14eb6c0fb6b6c06de5221476f7660b594fcd6625a4e5c5e3bc499463fd41010961a107e87bca55", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-09T11:32:26.151304", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Sarah Rietze, Hannes Zacher"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Direct effects \n\n1.

Partisan conflict frames describe political events as sites for conflict between the two parties (Han and Federico 2017). Partisan game frames take this a step further, describing political events in terms of who \u201cwon\u201d or \u201clost,\u201d instead of in terms of the events\u2019 substantive importance (Patterson 1993). This coverage, sometimes referred to as \u201chorse-race\u201d coverage in the context of political campaigns, is thought to reflect a reflex among journalists to see politics as a game played by key individuals to gain personal power and advancement (Weaver 1972). While game-frame coverage is most studied in political campaigns, it is a common element of most political news, including coverage of Congress, the President, and even the bureaucracy (Lichter and Amundonson 1994, Lawrence 2000, Cohen 2008). Game frame coverage has been blamed for producing a less-informed public, creating cynicism and reducing public interest in government, and of warping the issue agenda by emphasizing issues that are controversial over those that are substantively important. Frames that emphasize partisan wins and losses also exacerbate affective polarization by turning politics into a game played by two side trying to win rather than an attempt by disagreeing actors to arrive at good public policy (Han and Federico 2017, 2018). Apologists for game frame coverage argue that emphasizing the competitive aspects of politics increases political interest by producing journalism that is more compelling.\n\nWhat happens, however, when the journalistic instinct to frame issues as in terms of conflict runs into a global public health crisis such as the one created by COVID-19? Conflict and game frame coverage of political campaigns can be justified by the fact that elections are, in fact, contests with winners and losers. This can hardly be said about the response to COVID-19, where we might hope that policy response will be guided by scientific experts to minimize harm to the public. Yet, while the federal government\u2019s legislative response to COVID-19 has been characterized by a previously unthinkable amount of partisan unity, the pandemic has been the occasion for considerable partisan in-fighting as well. Democrats\u2019 messaging strategy around the pandemic has emphasized quick action to stem the pandemic, but also sharp criticism of Republican officeholders\u2019 response to this threat. Some Republicans, on the other hand, have attempted to downplay the threat posed by COVID-19, while criticizing Democrats for either politicizing the pandemic or fumbling the response in states with Democratic governors. These conflicts provide the opportunity for journalists to employ game or partisan conflict frames in their coverage of the pandemic, turning the issue from a global health threat into a partisan issue. Indeed, polling shows sizable gaps between Republicans and Democrats in concern about the COVID-19, as well as health behaviors and policy preferences in response to the pandemic (Gadarian, Goodman, and Pepinsky 2020).\n\nIn this article we evaluate the effect of game or conflict frames on public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesize that conflict framing, and especially game framing, will exacerbate the partisan divide in concern about the pandemic, support for drastic action to reduce its spread, and willingness to engage in personal actions to avoid contracting or disseminating the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Further, we test whether these frames increase cynicism about and reduce trust in the government\u2019s ability to respond to the pandemic. Finally, we test the hypothesis, suggested by defenders of game framing in political campaigns, that these frames increase interest in the issue, as compared to coverage that does not frame the pandemic in game or conflict terms. We evaluate these using a framing experiment in which individuals are randomly assigned to read newspaper articles that frame legislative action in response to the pandemic using game frames, conflict frames, or a substantive frame that emphasizes the substantive effects of the policy.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-11T20:07:19.128451", "date_modified": "2020-04-11T20:06:30.234184", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "ebdbd1a334c9595f5888f0ea12e8abbf7b0204f4ae2d0979d571a4aa93d971ba24415a4c74fd0312251229b90383e3aa4b4afbeb095c90f3437c76200a34fb4b87a7176f7ed19c3f6b51d692ef38eab81ff59d7f7fd5a843de6e797dca3b0f17bec085e64352948bb7a414bb0a5cb8a22a7dce3deb6eb1c87f6f399522d3cb460c8923eafaa5904d2c2d1cd951894548", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-11T20:07:19.101085", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "C.

In each condition participants read three news stories about the pandemic that were framed in non-partisan, partisan conflict, or partisan game frames. There were two partisan game-frame conditions; in one, Democrats were portrayed as winning in two of the three stories, in the other Republicans were portrayed as winning in two of the three stories. After reading these stories, participants answered several batteries of questions measuring concern about the pandemic, support for mitigation strategies, approval of various actors\u2019 responses to the pandemic, personal health behaviors adopted in response to the pandemic, beliefs about the effects of the pandemic, trust in political actors to manage the pandemic going forward, cynicism about the government response, and interest in consuming news about the pandemic.\n\nAll participants first read a short article describing a brief timeline of COVID-19 related events going back to the first detection of the disease in Wuhan, China. This article was intended to set common expectations about the purpose of the experiment; further, time spent on this article served as a pre-treatment attention check, since all participants read the same article. After this article, participants read three articles about different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. One article was about Senate negotiations over the two trillion dollar \u201cphase three\u201d stimulus bill signed into law on March 27th, one about the lack of testing available in parts of the United States, and one about\u2026? All articles were based on actual articles in the New York Times or Washington Post and were shortened considerably to 250-300 words.

In each condition participants read three news stories about the pandemic that were framed in non-partisan, partisan conflict, or partisan game frames. There were two partisan game-frame conditions; in one, Democrats were portrayed as winning in two of the three stories, in the other Republicans were portrayed as winning in two of the three stories. After reading these stories, participants answered several batteries of questions measuring concern about the pandemic, support for mitigation strategies, approval of various actors\u2019 responses to the pandemic, personal health behaviors adopted in response to the pandemic, beliefs about the effects of the pandemic, trust in political actors to manage the pandemic going forward, cynicism about the government response, and interest in consuming news about the pandemic.\n\nAll participants first read a short article describing a brief timeline of COVID-19 related events going back to the first detection of the disease in Wuhan, China. This article was intended to set common expectations about the purpose of the experiment; further, time spent on this article served as a pre-treatment attention check, since all participants read the same article. After this article, participants read three articles about different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. One article was about Senate negotiations over the two trillion dollar \u201cphase three\u201d stimulus bill signed into law on March 27th, one about the lack of testing available in parts of the United States, and one about\u2026? All articles were based on actual articles in the New York Times or Washington Post and were shortened considerably to 250-300 words. In the non-partisan condition, the headline and text of these articles were adapted to emphasis the substantive impact of the legislation and to remove direct references to partisanship or partisan conflict. In the partisan conflict condition the headlines and text were altered to emphasize partisan disagreement and fighting over the issue. In the game frame condition the headlines and text were adapted to advance a claim that one party was \u201cwinning\u201d and another \u201closing\u201d because of the issue; one article portrayed the Democrats as winning, one the Republicans, and one that both sides claimed victory.

There is the hypothesis, that the two types of manipulation have a differential effect on those processes.\nIn this study, we will manipulate participants attitudes towards squares and rectangles either with repeated evaluative pairings (REP) or with evaluative statements (ES) and measure the changes in implicit attitudes by using the ReAL-IAT.
