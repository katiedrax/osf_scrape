The aim of the current study is to find out whether the size of the UFOV is sensitive to the search task observers have to perform. That is, whether UFOV would be different when Os search for different target on the same search display. Traditionally, the UFOV has also been treated as if it were a single entity of fixed size. Clearly, that is na\u00efve since the UFOV must depend on what is being looked for and on the nature of the background. However, this has not been systematically studied. Another aim of this study is to see if more than one UFOV can operates during a single search task. This question arises in two forms that are easier to explain if we explain the actual task. The visual display consists of BIG L distractors and the occasional BIG T target intermixed with SMALL Consonant distractors among SMALL Vowel targets (A E I O U) . Observers can be instructed to search for T or Vowel or both. We hypothesize that the UFOV, revealed by eye movements, will differ across the three tasks.\n\nAnother question that would be interesting to examine in this experiment is whether observers are able to efficiently switch between search templates. In the one-target blocks, observers should have a clear template in their mind about the item they have to search for. However, this might be not the case in the mixed-target condition. By comparing the fixation duration on the distractors \u201cbelonging\u201d to the opposite search category (i.e., on small distractor letters when searching for the T and on Ls when searching for the vowel) between one-target and mixed-target blocks we will be able to determine if observers can switch easily between templates within a display. For instance, if the fixation duration on small distractor letters is shorter in the one-target blocks when searching for the T as compared to the mixed-target blocks, we can say that the template vowel is disrupting the search for the T in the mixed-target blocks. Thus, the two templates might be in competition with each other. If the fixation duration on distractors belonging to the opposite search category was the same in the one-target and mixed-target block, observers might be able to switch between the vowel and the T template efficiently without costs.\n\nWithin a given task, there are three types of UFOV that can be measured. One UFOV defines where the eyes will move next. Where will I explore with my next fixation? This UFOV is defined by the size of saccades that do not land on a target. A related UFOV is based on what objects selected once the eyes have fixated on one location. This UFOV is defined by the distribution of final saccades that land on a target. We assume that you would not usually move the eyes to a target if you had not covertly selected and identified that target peripherally first. The third UFOV, not directly relevant here, is defined by the eccentricity function for these stimuli. That is, if attention is cued to a location, can you identify a target at that location? For the present task, we hypothesize that the exploration UFOV will have about 2X the radius of the selection UFOV, because the eyes will move beyond the selection UFOV to explore new items if no target was found.\n"}, "study_type": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment"}, "study_type_other": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"data": "No, no data have been collected for this study yet.", "name": "UFOV Hybrid Foraging Exp. 2.5 (SMI) ", "other": "RT and accuracy data between condition can be analyzed with paired t-test and repeated measured ANOVA.

We will additionally test whether the interaction term (Decision rule x Group size ratio) explains additional variance. \n\nWe expect that there might be a difference between perceived fairness at T1 between the 12:8 conditions and the 16:4 conditions. In the voting conditions, if participants assume fixed preferences along group lines, then they may assume that voting is less fair in the 16:4 condition, given that the minority group is more outnumbered here than in the 12:8 condition. In the coin flip condition, participants may compare the odds of the coin (50/50) to the group numerical size ratio. As the coin\u2019s probability is closer to the 12:8 scenario, participants may view flipping a coin as fairer in this case. \n\nWe expect that there will be a main effect of Decision rule at T3 (such that voting is viewed as less fair than flipping a coin) and that there will be a main effect of Group size ratio, and that this effect will be driven by a difference between the two Voting conditions.

We also expect that there will be a main effect of Group size ratio, as described above. \n\nHow likely is the decision rule to yield the same outcome: We will compare how likely participants think the decision rule is to yield the same outcome (popcorn) across the conditions by constructing a generalized linear model with perceived voting outcome as the outcome variable and Decision-rule and Group size ratio as predictor variables. We predict that there will be a main effect of Decision-rule such that participants will think the procedure is more likely to yield popcorn in the Voting conditions than in the Coin flip conditions.

We predict that the more likely participants are to think that voting will yield popcorn as the outcome, the more participants\u2019 fairness evaluation will decrease from T2 to T3. We predict that this relation will be stronger in the Voting conditions (though likely present in both conditions). \n\nDesire difference: We will compute a difference score between participants\u2019 judgments of the two groups\u2019 desires to vote again.

We introduced adults to a classroom of five kids who were split into two social groups\u2014Blues and Greens. One group comprised the majority of the class (e.g., 3 Blues) and one group comprised the minority of the class (e.g., 2 Greens). Participants saw this class vote across three iterations (here, different days) for what snack they would eat for snack time. Each time, the majority social group voted for their desired outcome; thus, each time, the majority social group won their preference and the minority social group did not win their preference. Over iteration (across days of voting), participants viewed voting as increasingly less fair. We found that although iteration affected the perceived fairness of voting as a procedure, it did not affect fairness evaluations of an impartial procedure like flipping a coin.  \n\nIn this past study, the number of majority to minority members in the group was always 3 to 2. The present study examines the role of relative group size on how fair people perceive voting to be. We will ask whether varying the ratio between the groups\u2019 numerical sizes impacts adults\u2019 perceptions of fairness across iterated trials. Past work from our lab demonstrates that children and adults consider groups\u2019 relative sizes when making judgments about inter- and intra-group relations, suggesting that relative group size might be a salient factor in judging decision-making processes between groups. \n\nIn the present study, participants will see a brief scenario about a classroom of 20 kids who are making a decision about whether to eat popcorn or chips for snack time. This is a 2x2 design in which we will manipulate the decision-rule (2: Voting or Coin Flip) and the relative numerical size (i.e., ratio) of the majority and minority groups in the class (2: 12 kids vs. 8 kids or 16 kids vs 4 kids). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the four conditions. All participants will see the class vote across three iterations, such that the outcome preferred by the majority group wins three times (i.e., three days) in a row. \n\nWe hypothesize that there will be a main effect of Decision-rule (Voting or Coin flip). Replicating our previous findings, we expect that the decision-rule will be evaluated as increasingly less fair across iterated trials when the class votes, but not when the class flips a coin. \n\nSecond, we will investigate if there will be an effect of relative numerical group size (ratio) on participants\u2019 judgments of fairness within the Voting conditions. Regarding the direction of this effect, we have two competing hypotheses, which we aim to compare in the present study:\n\nH1: Across iterated trials, participants view voting as relatively more unfair when the majority and minority groups are closer in size (smaller group size ratio). \n\nOne possibility is that participants\u2019 judgments of voting are based on a comparison between the minority group\u2019s proportion of the total population, and the percentage of times that they win:\n\t\n\t(% of group) \u2014 (% time winning) = Perceived (un)fairness\n\n\t8 (vs. 12) \t(40%) \u2014 (0%) = 40\n\t4 (vs. 16)\t(20%) \u2014 (0%) = 20 \t\n\nUnder this framework, we expect the following: across iterated trials, participants will view voting as less fair when two groups are closer in numerical size than when the ratio between two groups is larger (i.e., 12:8 &lt; 16:4). \n\n\nH2: Across iterated trials, participants will view voting as relatively more unfair when the majority and minority groups are further in size (larger group size ratio). \n\nAn alternative possibility is that participants\u2019 judgments of voting are based on how likely they think the procedure is to yield the same outcome (i.e., the majority group\u2019s preference).

Infants\u2019 Perception of Pointing Gestures "}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Maxine de Ven, Stephanie Wermelinger, Ebru Ger, Moritz M. Daum"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Pointing is a communicative gesture and has a social function. It is used to refer to an external entity. On this entity lies the attention of both, the pointer and the observer (Cochet &amp; Vauclair, 2010; Leavens, Hopkins, &amp; Bard, 2005). Therefore, following the point of others is crucial for learning and communication (Carpenter, Nagell, &amp; Tomasello, 1998). Some earlier studies found that infants were able to follow pointing around the same time as the prouction of pointing emerges, at about 12 months (Gredeb\u00e4ck, Melinder, &amp; Daum, 2010; Rohlfing, Longo, &amp; Bertenthal, 2012). Using a spatial cueing paradigm, Bertenthal, Boyer and Harding (2014) showed that infants actually followed pointing as early as 4 months of age. In a trial they showed either a hand with index finger pointing or a foil hand in the same shape as the index finger pointing hand, pointing to either left or right hand side of the screen. As soon as the participant looked at the pointing index finger/pointing foil hand, a target (a colorful moving picture with sound) appeared on either the congruent or the incongruent side. Infants\u2019 saccadic response times (SRT) was measured, i.e. the time it took to look from the index finger/foil hand to the target, as soon as the target appeared. Mean SRTs were compared between the two conditions, namely the congruent and incongruent. If there is an understanding of pointing, one would expect that the SRT of the congruent trials would be faster than the ones in the incongruent trials, thus showing a cueing effect.  Bertenthal, Boyer and Harding (2014) found such cueing effect with 4-month-old infants for both, the index finger and the foil hand, meaning that both showed shorter SRTs in congruent trials than in incongruent trials. With 6-month-old infants they found the cueing effect, shorter SRTs for congruent than incongruent trials, for the index finger but not the foil hand. In sum, they showed that infants, at least by 6 months, follow only real human points but not foil or arrows (as they tested in the same study in experiment 3), suggesting that it is not only the directionality but the humanness that evokes the cueing effect. However, all the reviewed studies used the canonical index-finger shape for examining point following in infants. We still do not know if infants follow different pointing hand shapes as they do with the index finger point. Ariga and Watanabe (2009) showed that different hand forms are perceived differently by adults. None of the shapes they presented (index + middle finger, little finger and fist), showed a cueing effect as large as the index finger (SRT is smaller for the congruent trials than the incongruent trials). However, we still do not know whether the same is true for infants and if they follow different pointing hand shapes as they do with the index finger point.\n In this study, we want to examine whether 12-month-old infants are cued by pointing with different hand forms, in our case the index finger pointing, the whole hand pointing and the pinky finger pointing. Because infants learn pointing and its\u2019 conventions from adults and because they already produce pointing, including index finger pointing, themselves at the age of 12 months, we expect them to orient faster toward the index finger pointing, compared to the pinky finger or the whole hand, just as adults do (Ariga &amp; Watanabe, 2009; Cochet &amp; Vauclair, 2010; Gredeb\u00e4ck, Melinder, &amp; Daum, 2010; Rohlfing, Longo, &amp; Bertenthal, 2012). \nWe also want to test adults to see if we can replicate the findings of Ariga and Watanabe (2009) that adults show a greater cueing effect for the index finger pointing.\n\n\nOur research questions are as the following:\n1) Can we replicate and extend the findings of Ariga and Watanabe (2009)? Namely, do adults differentiate between different forms of pointing gestures? \n\n1a) Do adults show a cueing effect for all three pointing gestures (index finger, pinky finger and whole hand)?\n\n1b) Does the form of the pointing gesture influence adult\u2019s extent of the cueing effect? \n\n2) Do infants differentiate between different forms of pointing gestures at 12 months?\n\n2a) Do infants show a cueing effect for all three pointing gestures (index finger, pinky finger and whole hand)?\n\n2b) Does the form of the pointing gesture influence infant\u2019s extent of the cueing effect? \n\nExploratory analysis: \nWe also would like to exploratorily investigate the mechanism of whether and how infants learn gestures from their parents (Cochet &amp; Vauclair, 2010). \n\u2022\tWe will investigate whether there is an influence from how parents perceive pointing gestures to their infants\u2019 perception of pointing gestures.\n\u2022\tWe will investigate whether there is an influence from the infants\u2019 reported pointing behavior (reported by the parent) on the infants\u2019 perception of pointing gestures.\n\u2022\tWe will investigate whether parents' gesture frequency influences infants\u2019 perception of gestures.\nWe would further like to exploratorily investigate whether the infants differentiate the perception of the whole hand and the pinky finger and if there is a significant difference in the cueing effects of the whole hand and the pinky finger. \n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypothesis 1a: We expect that adults show a shorter mean SRT in congruent pointing trials than incongruent trials for all pointing gestures, therefore showing a cueing effect for all the hand forms.\n\nHypothesis 1b: We expect that the adult\u2019s cueing effect for the index finger is stronger compared to the cueing effect for the whole hand or the extended pinky finger pointing.

Each infant and his or her parent will be escorted to a reception room. For approximately 10 min, the experimenter describes the test procedure to the parent and hand them a consent form to sign. In the first part of the study, a spatial cueing paradigm will be presented to the infant on an eye tracker (Eyelink 1000Plus, SR Research, sample rate: 500 Hz). The infant is seated in a car seat during the procedure. The parent will sit in behind the infant, but will face away from the screen and fill out the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised Very Short Form (IBQ-R VSF, Putnam, Helbig, Gartstein, Rothbart, &amp; Leerkes, 2014), translated to German by Susanne Kristen, Hannah Eisenbus, Claudia Thoermer, and Beate Sodian, on a tablet, while the spatial cueing paradigm is being played for the infant. Measures of the IBQ are not of interest for the current study and used only for distracting the parents as they will be tested on the same paradigm.\nThe spatial cueing paradigm consists of 8 blocks, each containing 12 trials, thus a total of 96 trials. We do not expect that every infant (if any) will complete all of the 96 trials (for the participant to be taken into the analysis, they have to complete six trials per hand form and congruence condition, this would equal 36). \nAt the beginning of every experiment an attention getter video with drawings of animals, will be presented on the screen, while the experimenter will adjust the eye tracking settings. A HV-5 calibration will be used for the infant as well as for the parent in the beginning of the experiment and if needed, manually activated, during the experiment. For the calibration a black and white disc expanding and contracting with an accompanying sound will be used.   \nAt the beginning of every trial an attention-getting stimulus (a static, colored pinwheel or a beach ball, without accompanying sounds) will appear, until the infant looks at the attention getter for 400ms or a key is pressed to proceed. The attention getting stimulus will be located, where later the palm of the hand pointing (stimulus cue) will be presented.   \nThen the stimulus cue in the form of a pointing gesture, (index finger pointing, whole hand pointing or pinky finger pointing) will appear beginning at the bottom of the screen centered on the screen. The pointing gestures all include the hand, in a horizontal position, and the forearm, in a vertical position. Once the infant looks at the stimulus cue for 100 ms or if the timer set to 5,000 ms runs out, a peripheral target will appear. The target will be 1 out of 12 different videos containing a colorful toy animal picture that is moving around in a white rectangular region with an accompanying melodic sound. The target will be located on either side of the stimulus cue. The target\u2019s midpoint will vertically aligning with the midpoint of the palm of the pointing hand. \nThe target will appear for a minimum of 2,500 ms and a maximum of 5,000ms depending on the infant\u2019s orientation towards the target. If the infant looks at the target for 500 ms during the time interval of 2,000-4,500 ms or the maximal time (5,000 ms) has passed, the target and the stimulus cue will disappear.\nFollowing the disappearance of the target and the stimulus cue, there will be an inter-trial interval (ITI) for 34 ms. After the ITI a new trial will begin. \nAfter every sixth trial a drift check will be made, to be sure that the calibration is still set well enough or if a recalibration needs to be done. \nFor the second part of the study we will use the decorated room paradigm by Liszkowski and Brown (2007) as a behavioral observation, which will not be considered for this study. Afterwards for the third part, while the infant will stay in the decorated room with a caregiver other than the parent, the parent will be brought back to the eye tracking room, where they will be asked a few demographic questions. Furthermore, the parents' gesture frequency will be assessed by asking them three questions that trigger gesture production using a procedure adapted from Feyereisen and Havard (1999) and translated to Swiss German by us. These three questions we will refer to as gesture proneness task, will be the following: \n1.\t\u201cCould you explain how to change the wheel of a car or to repair the tire of a bicycle?\" \n2.\t\"Could you explain how to cover a book or to wrap a box in a paper for a present?\"  \n3.\t\"Could you describe a recipe of a typical national dish or of a dish you appreciate?\" \nSubsequently they will proceed to the same spatial cueing paradigm on the eye tracker that their infant already went through. Finally, we will all return to the reception room, where the parent will fill out a last questionnaire, asking about the infant's pointing behavior (see appendix). These questions might be used in exploratory analyses.\nThe experimenter will prepare the certificate for the infant and present him the gifts from which the infant may choose one to take home. Participants will be debriefed in the end.  \n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "Our target sample is 80 participants. 40 infants at the age of 12 months and 40 adults (parents).

Infants\u2019 Perception of Pointing Gestures ", "q2": "Maxine de Ven, Stephanie Wermelinger, Ebru Ger, Moritz M. Daum", "q3": "Pointing is a communicative gesture and has a social function. It is used to refer to an external entity. On this entity lies the attention of both, the pointer and the observer (Cochet &amp; Vauclair, 2010; Leavens, Hopkins, &amp; Bard, 2005). Therefore, following the point of others is crucial for learning and communication (Carpenter, Nagell, &amp; Tomasello, 1998). Some earlier studies found that infants were able to follow pointing around the same time as the prouction of pointing emerges, at about 12 months (Gredeb\u00e4ck, Melinder, &amp; Daum, 2010; Rohlfing, Longo, &amp; Bertenthal, 2012). Using a spatial cueing paradigm, Bertenthal, Boyer and Harding (2014) showed that infants actually followed pointing as early as 4 months of age. In a trial they showed either a hand with index finger pointing or a foil hand in the same shape as the index finger pointing hand, pointing to either left or right hand side of the screen. As soon as the participant looked at the pointing index finger/pointing foil hand, a target (a colorful moving picture with sound) appeared on either the congruent or the incongruent side. Infants\u2019 saccadic response times (SRT) was measured, i.e. the time it took to look from the index finger/foil hand to the target, as soon as the target appeared. Mean SRTs were compared between the two conditions, namely the congruent and incongruent. If there is an understanding of pointing, one would expect that the SRT of the congruent trials would be faster than the ones in the incongruent trials, thus showing a cueing effect.  Bertenthal, Boyer and Harding (2014) found such cueing effect with 4-month-old infants for both, the index finger and the foil hand, meaning that both showed shorter SRTs in congruent trials than in incongruent trials. With 6-month-old infants they found the cueing effect, shorter SRTs for congruent than incongruent trials, for the index finger but not the foil hand. In sum, they showed that infants, at least by 6 months, follow only real human points but not foil or arrows (as they tested in the same study in experiment 3), suggesting that it is not only the directionality but the humanness that evokes the cueing effect. However, all the reviewed studies used the canonical index-finger shape for examining point following in infants. We still do not know if infants follow different pointing hand shapes as they do with the index finger point. Ariga and Watanabe (2009) showed that different hand forms are perceived differently by adults. None of the shapes they presented (index + middle finger, little finger and fist), showed a cueing effect as large as the index finger (SRT is smaller for the congruent trials than the incongruent trials). However, we still do not know whether the same is true for infants and if they follow different pointing hand shapes as they do with the index finger point.\n In this study, we want to examine whether 12-month-old infants are cued by pointing with different hand forms, in our case the index finger pointing, the whole hand pointing and the pinky finger pointing. Because infants learn pointing and its\u2019 conventions from adults and because they already produce pointing, including index finger pointing, themselves at the age of 12 months, we expect them to orient faster toward the index finger pointing, compared to the pinky finger or the whole hand, just as adults do (Ariga &amp; Watanabe, 2009; Cochet &amp; Vauclair, 2010; Gredeb\u00e4ck, Melinder, &amp; Daum, 2010; Rohlfing, Longo, &amp; Bertenthal, 2012). \nWe also want to test adults to see if we can replicate the findings of Ariga and Watanabe (2009) that adults show a greater cueing effect for the index finger pointing.\n\n\nOur research questions are as the following:\n1) Can we replicate and extend the findings of Ariga and Watanabe (2009)? Namely, do adults differentiate between different forms of pointing gestures? \n\n1a) Do adults show a cueing effect for all three pointing gestures (index finger, pinky finger and whole hand)?\n\n1b) Does the form of the pointing gesture influence adult\u2019s extent of the cueing effect? \n\n2) Do infants differentiate between different forms of pointing gestures at 12 months?\n\n2a) Do infants show a cueing effect for all three pointing gestures (index finger, pinky finger and whole hand)?\n\n2b) Does the form of the pointing gesture influence infant\u2019s extent of the cueing effect? \n\nExploratory analysis: \nWe also would like to exploratorily investigate the mechanism of whether and how infants learn gestures from their parents (Cochet &amp; Vauclair, 2010). \n\u2022\tWe will investigate whether there is an influence from how parents perceive pointing gestures to their infants\u2019 perception of pointing gestures.\n\u2022\tWe will investigate whether there is an influence from the infants\u2019 reported pointing behavior (reported by the parent) on the infants\u2019 perception of pointing gestures.\n\u2022\tWe will investigate whether parents' gesture frequency influences infants\u2019 perception of gestures.\nWe would further like to exploratorily investigate whether the infants differentiate the perception of the whole hand and the pinky finger and if there is a significant difference in the cueing effects of the whole hand and the pinky finger. \n", "q4": "Hypothesis 1a: We expect that adults show a shorter mean SRT in congruent pointing trials than incongruent trials for all pointing gestures, therefore showing a cueing effect for all the hand forms.\n\nHypothesis 1b: We expect that the adult\u2019s cueing effect for the index finger is stronger compared to the cueing effect for the whole hand or the extended pinky finger pointing.

[11;13] months/ [335;395] days) and 40 adults. The adults will be one parent of the infant, so there is no restrictive age range for the adults.\nThe infants will be Swiss German monolinguals (if the sample size does not appear to be reachable until mid-march we will also consider including infants being raised by parents that talk Swiss German and German to them). \nThe participants will be recruited by phone, using the databank from the Department of Psychology: Developmental Psychology: Infancy and Infanthood at the University of Zurich. The participation will be rewarded with a certificate for the infant as well as a small present.\nExclusion criteria:\n\u2022\timpaired sight\n\u2022\tpreterm birth (weeks [37;41]) \n\u2022\tdevelopmental disorder\n\u2022\tif the participant (infant or parent) fails to reach 36 trials (six trials per hand form and congruence condition)\n\u2022\ttrials in which participants fail to orient towards the hand (pointing gesture), will not be taken into account and neither will SRTs that are too fast (infants: &lt;200 ms, adults: &lt;90 ms) or too slow (infants: &lt;3,000ms, adults: &lt;1000 ms). \n\n\nAll infants will be tested individually with one parent present. Each infant and his or her parent will be escorted to a reception room. For approximately 10 min, the experimenter describes the test procedure to the parent and hand them a consent form to sign. In the first part of the study, a spatial cueing paradigm will be presented to the infant on an eye tracker (Eyelink 1000Plus, SR Research, sample rate: 500 Hz). The infant is seated in a car seat during the procedure. The parent will sit in behind the infant, but will face away from the screen and fill out the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised Very Short Form (IBQ-R VSF, Putnam, Helbig, Gartstein, Rothbart, &amp; Leerkes, 2014), translated to German by Susanne Kristen, Hannah Eisenbus, Claudia Thoermer, and Beate Sodian, on a tablet, while the spatial cueing paradigm is being played for the infant. Measures of the IBQ are not of interest for the current study and used only for distracting the parents as they will be tested on the same paradigm.\nThe spatial cueing paradigm consists of 8 blocks, each containing 12 trials, thus a total of 96 trials. We do not expect that every infant (if any) will complete all of the 96 trials (for the participant to be taken into the analysis, they have to complete six trials per hand form and congruence condition, this would equal 36). \nAt the beginning of every experiment an attention getter video with drawings of animals, will be presented on the screen, while the experimenter will adjust the eye tracking settings. A HV-5 calibration will be used for the infant as well as for the parent in the beginning of the experiment and if needed, manually activated, during the experiment. For the calibration a black and white disc expanding and contracting with an accompanying sound will be used.   \nAt the beginning of every trial an attention-getting stimulus (a static, colored pinwheel or a beach ball, without accompanying sounds) will appear, until the infant looks at the attention getter for 400ms or a key is pressed to proceed. The attention getting stimulus will be located, where later the palm of the hand pointing (stimulus cue) will be presented.   \nThen the stimulus cue in the form of a pointing gesture, (index finger pointing, whole hand pointing or pinky finger pointing) will appear beginning at the bottom of the screen centered on the screen. The pointing gestures all include the hand, in a horizontal position, and the forearm, in a vertical position. Once the infant looks at the stimulus cue for 100 ms or if the timer set to 5,000 ms runs out, a peripheral target will appear. The target will be 1 out of 12 different videos containing a colorful toy animal picture that is moving around in a white rectangular region with an accompanying melodic sound. The target will be located on either side of the stimulus cue. The target\u2019s midpoint will vertically aligning with the midpoint of the palm of the pointing hand. \nThe target will appear for a minimum of 2,500 ms and a maximum of 5,000ms depending on the infant\u2019s orientation towards the target. If the infant looks at the target for 500 ms during the time interval of 2,000-4,500 ms or the maximal time (5,000 ms) has passed, the target and the stimulus cue will disappear.\nFollowing the disappearance of the target and the stimulus cue, there will be an inter-trial interval (ITI) for 34 ms. After the ITI a new trial will begin. \nAfter every sixth trial a drift check will be made, to be sure that the calibration is still set well enough or if a recalibration needs to be done. \nFor the second part of the study we will use the decorated room paradigm by Liszkowski and Brown (2007) as a behavioral observation, which will not be considered for this study. Afterwards for the third part, while the infant will stay in the decorated room with a caregiver other than the parent, the parent will be brought back to the eye tracking room, where they will be asked a few demographic questions. Furthermore, the parents' gesture frequency will be assessed by asking them three questions that trigger gesture production using a procedure adapted from Feyereisen and Havard (1999) and translated to Swiss German by us. These three questions we will refer to as gesture proneness task, will be the following: \n1.\t\u201cCould you explain how to change the wheel of a car or to repair the tire of a bicycle?\" \n2.\t\"Could you explain how to cover a book or to wrap a box in a paper for a present?\"  \n3.\t\"Could you describe a recipe of a typical national dish or of a dish you appreciate?\" \nSubsequently they will proceed to the same spatial cueing paradigm on the eye tracker that their infant already went through. Finally, we will all return to the reception room, where the parent will fill out a last questionnaire, asking about the infant's pointing behavior (see appendix). These questions might be used in exploratory analyses.\nThe experimenter will prepare the certificate for the infant and present him the gifts from which the infant may choose one to take home. Participants will be debriefed in the end.  \n\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "We will manipulate the form of the pointing gestures: whole hand pointing, pinky finger pointing, index finger pointing. We chose the index finger pointing, because it is widely used as the canonical form of pointing (Carpendale &amp; Carpendale, 2012; Hannan and Fogler, 1987) as it is also used in Bertenthal, Boyer and Harding\u2019s (2014) study as well as for the fact that Ariga and Watanabe (2009) were able to show the superiority of the index finger point compared to other forms. The whole hand pointing was chosen, because it is usually the first form of pointing that infants produce themselves, before they start pointing with the index finger (Cochet &amp; Vauclair, 2010; Liszkowski &amp; Tomasello, 2011). The pinky finger pointing was chosen, so we would be able to further differentiate possible reasons for a cueing effect, as ostensivity. Ostensivity meaning the extendedness of the index finger or the pinky finger that would concentrate the attention stronger than the holistic appearance of the whole hand. Furthermore, we will also manipulate the direction the gestures are pointing at (left, right) and the side on which the target will appear in relation to the pointing direction (congruent with the pointing direction, incongruent with the pointing direction). ", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "We will measure the saccadic response time (SRT). The SRT is the time it takes for the gaze to move from the stimulus cue, as soon as the target appeared on the screen, to arrive on the target area of interest, which is the area surrounding the target video. \nWe will also measure in which direction the first saccade goes as soon as the stimulus cue is presented. \nTo assess parents\u2019 gesture frequency, the gesture proneness task will be filmed. The first minute of each answer will be divided into 5 second snippets that will be separately analyzed. If the participant fills the first minute with his explanation, there will be 12 snippets, if he doesn\u2019t the number of snippets that are generated up to this this point will be analyzed. If an explanation starts with a new 5 second snippet but the explanation ends before the 5 seconds expire, the respective snippet will not be considered for the analysis. The gestures per 5 second snippet can be categorized as follows:\n\u2022\tIconic-Form gestures: gestures that visually represent an object that represents the reality in a form; gestures that just imitate the form or an outline of an object\n\u2022\tIconic-Action gestures: gestures that visually represent an object that represents the reality in a form; gestures that just imitate an action\n\u2022\tMetaphoric gestures: visual representations of abstract ideas or categories, they represent metaphors. Including symbolic gestures. \n\u2022\tDeictic gestures: pointing gestures that point to real, implied or imagined people, objects or directions\n\u2022\tBeat gestures: gestures that underline the rhythm of a language. They do not possess a semantic meaning but are frequently used to underline something. \nFrom this we will assess parent\u2019s gesture frequency. Each 5 second snippet will be marked as \u201cgesturing\u201d or \u201cnot gesturing\u201d depending on whether one of the gestures mentioned above was coded or not. The total amount of snippets labeled \u201cgesturing\u201d per completed snippets will give us the frequency. All coding will be done by the first author, 25% will be re-coded by a trained intern. The interrater reliability will not be smaller than kappa 0.8.  \n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Parents\u2019 and infants\u2019 data will be analyzed separately. Mean SRT will be the dependent variable. First, we will establish that pointing direction does not influence SRTs. We will do this by conducting a t-test for all the conditions pointing to the right side versus all the conditions pointing to the left side and check for significance. If the t-test is significant direction will be assessed as a third factor in the ANOVAs.\nSecond, we will conduct 2 separate within subject 3 (hand form) x 2 (congruency) repeated-measures ANOVAs on infants\u2019 and parents\u2019 SRTs. Possible effects will be further explored using post-hoc Bonferroni corrected t-tests for both, infants and parents. \nWe expect to find a main effect of congruency for adults which would mean that they orient faster to the congruent targets (shorter SRT) than the incongruent targets (longer SRT). We also expect an interaction effect of hand form and congruency such that the difference between the SRTs of congruent and incongruent trials will be higher in the index finger condition compared to the whole hand and pinky finger. We expect the same effects for the infants because by 12 months we assume that they are already more sensitive to the canonical index finger shape than to the whole hand or the pinky finger.\n",

of vaccination. Vaccine skepticism tends to be geographically concentrated, leading some areas to fall below levels necessary for herd immunity and suffer outbreaks of previously contained diseases. Organizations have been actively trying to educate the public and correct misinformation about vaccines in an attempt to increase vaccination rates. Unfortunately, we know relatively little about how to effectively communicate about vaccines or the underlying factors that motivate vaccine skepticism. For instance, recent experimental research shows that common persuasive messages about the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine are ineffective and may even reduce intention to vaccinate among parents with the least favorable attitudes toward vaccines (Nyhan, Reifler, Richey, and Freed 2014). Similarly, a recent study of U.S. adults found that efforts to correct the myth that the influenza vaccine can give you the flu were similarly counterproductive among those with the strongest concerns about vaccine side effects (Nyhan and Reifler 2015). However, recent research suggests that vaccine skepticism might be motivated, in part, by disgust (Clifford and Wendell n.d.). The emotion of disgust serves as a behavioral immune system that helps protect us by motivating us to avoid situations, people, or objects that might cause illness. Many common disease vectors such as rodents, rotting food, and bodily fluids, elicit disgust and a corresponding aversive response. Another core trigger of disgust is breaking the skin via \u201c[e]nvelope violations\u201d such as gore or surgery, which also exposes the body to infection (Haidt, McCauley, Rozin 1994). Disgust is accordingly central to phobias regarding injections, needles, and related medical operations (Tolin, Lohr, Sawchuk, and Lee 1997; Sawchuk, Lohr, Tolin, Lee, and Kleinknecht 1997; Page 2003). These findings suggest that disgust may contribute to vaccine skepticism, particulary among people who are dispositionally more sensitive to the emotion. Many vaccines involve breaking the skin barrier via injection, which is an \u201cenvelope violation\u201d that can trigger disgust, and a number of them produce an immune response by introducing weakened or dead viruses to the body, another potential disgust trigger. While disgust reactions may be at least partly unavoidable given current vaccine technology, public health messages about vaccines often include stimuli that could elicit disgust such as images of injections and children with rashes and detailed descriptions of disease symptoms. Messages that trigger disgust in these sorts of ways may actually increase vaccine skepticism, particularly for those who are more sensitive to disgust and/or are already skeptical of vaccines.\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"Based on the discussion above, we expect that people who are more sensitive to disgust will be more skeptical of vaccination and less likely to state that they intend to vaccinate themselves and their family in the future. H1: Higher levels of disgust sensitivity will be associated with greater vaccine skepticism and weaker intentions to vaccinate. To test the role of disgust in the efficacy of vaccine communications, we have designed two similar educational messages about how vaccines work that are described further below \u2013 one that relies on standard language and imagery (\u201chigh disgust\u201d message) and one that avoids language and imagery that might elicit disgust (\u201clow disgust\u201d message). We expect that a message about vaccines that contain potential disgust triggers will increase skepticism and reduce vaccination intent relative to one that minimizes such triggers. H2: People exposed to the high disgust message will report higher vaccine skepticism and reduced intention to vaccinate compared with those exposed to the low disgust message. We are, however, agnostic about the main effects of each message relative to a control condition. Thus, we have two research questions: RQ1: Will exposure to the low disgust message change vaccine skepticism or intent to vaccinate compared with a control group? RQ2: Will exposure to the high disgust message change vaccine skepticism or intent to vaccinate compared with a control group? We expect that the effect of the high disgust message on vaccine skepticism and intent to vaccinate (relative to the low disgust message) will vary depending on disgust sensitivity and prior vaccine skepticism: H3a: The high disgust message will be less effective relative to the low disgust message among those high in disgust sensitivity than among those low in disgust sensitivity. H3b: The high disgust message will be less effective relative to the low disgust message among those who are already vaccine skeptics than among those are not. We are also agnostic about the marginal effect of each treatment on vaccine skepticism and intent to vaccinate relative to the control group across levels of disgust sensitivity and prior vaccine skepticism. Thus, we have eight final research questions: RQ3a: Will exposure to the low disgust message affect vaccine skepticism and intent to vaccinate among respondents low in disgust sensitivity?

After the unrelated questions, subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: control, high disgust, or low disgust. Introductory text Now we would like to ask some questions about a different topic. Control condition [No message] High disgust condition Please carefully read the following article about how vaccines work. We will then ask you some questions about your beliefs and attitudes about the issue. Vaccinations protect you from diseases that can make you very sick or even kill you. Vaccines work by stimulating our immune systems to produce antibodies (substances produced by the body to fight disease) without actually infecting us with the disease. Most vaccines contain a little bit of a disease germ that is weak or dead. Vaccines do NOT contain the type of germ that makes you sick. Having this little bit of the germ inside your body triggers the immune system to produce its own antibodies, as though the body has been infected with a disease. Low disgust condition Please carefully read the following article about how vaccines work. We will then ask you some questions about your beliefs and attitudes about the issue. Vaccinations protect you from diseases that can make you very sick or even kill you. They boost your body's natural defense system, which is called the immune system. Vaccines create immunity that protects you from infection without causing the disease itself. The way they do this is by helping your body to build antibodies that protect you from germs. Antibodies stay with you for a long time and remember how to fight off the disease if you encounter it in the future. By protecting yourself in this way, you can help keep your body healthy and free from disease. Immediately following the experiment, respondents will be asked a series of questions about their vaccine attitudes. Wave 2 vaccine skepticism How strongly do you agree or disagree with each of the following statements? [randomize order] Vaccines strengthen the immune system. It is better for children to get fewer vaccines at the same time. I am concerned that people\u2019s immune systems could be weakened by too many immunizations. It is safer to get a vaccine than to develop immunity by getting sick. I am concerned about serious side effects of vaccines. There is overwhelming evidence for the safety of vaccines. Children get more shots than are good for them. \u2022 Strongly agree \u2022 Agree \u2022 Neither agree no disagree \u2022 Disagree \u2022 Strongly disagree The Wave 2 vaccine skepticism scale will be operationalized as the mean response to the questions above (reversed items will be recoded so that higher values indicate greater vaccine skepticism). We will again estimate whether the items in the scale are highly correlated using via Cronbach\u2019s alpha or factor analysis. If not, we will drop items from the combined scale and/or analyze responses to the items separately. Intent to vaccinate Regardless of what you did this flu season, how likely is it that you will get a vaccine for the seasonal flu during the next flu season (autumn 2015 - spring 2016)? \u2022 Extremely likely \u2022 Very likely \u2022 Somewhat likely \u2022 Not very likely \u2022 Not at all likely How likely is it that you would choose to receive recommended vaccines for yourself and your family in the future? \u2022 Extremely likely \u2022 Very likely \u2022 Somewhat likely \u2022 Not very likely \u2022 Not at all likely Responses to these measures will be averaged to create a measure of intent to vaccinate if they are sufficiently intercorrelated (using factor analysis or Cronbach\u2019s alpha). If not, we will analyze the items separately. Manipulation check \u2013 vaccination disgust When you think about getting vaccinated, how grossed out do you feel? \u2022 Not grossed out at all \u2022 Not too grossed out \u2022 Somewhat grossed out \u2022 Very grossed out \u2022 Extremely grossed out Now I'd like to ask you about the good and bad points of getting vaccinated. Is there anything in particular about vaccines that might make you want to get yourself and your family vaccinated? [open-ends, ideally separate boxes 1-4 to make coding easier] Is there anything in particular about vaccines that might make you want to not get yourself or your family vaccinated? [open-ends, ideally separate boxes 1-4 to make coding easier] Analysis plan for the manipulation check We will first test whether the messages had the expected effects on the manipulation check. Responses towards the measure of disgust towards vaccination will be predicted using an ordered probit model as a function of Wave 1 vaccine skepticism, dummy variables for the control and high disgust conditions (the low disgust condition is the excluded category), and disgust sensitivity. We expect that Wave 1 vaccine skepticism and the high disgust condition will predict higher levels of vaccine disgust relative to the low disgust condition. We are agnostic about whether the low disgust condition will predict higher levels of disgust relative to the control condition. Vaccine Disgust = Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + Control Dummy + High Disgust Dummy + Disgust Sensitivity + [Constant] Analysis plan for H1 Our first hypothesis will be tested in three ways. First, wave 1 vaccine skepticism will be predicted as a function of disgust sensitivity and control variables using OLS with robust standard errors (the default model below unless otherwise specified). Second, wave 2 vaccine skepticism will be predicted using the same modeling approach among only respondents in the control condition. Third, intent to vaccinate will be predicted using the same modeling approach. Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism = Disgust Sensitivity + University attendance/graduate + Female + Age 45 or older + Black + [Constant] Wave 2 Vaccine Skepticism [Control condition only] = Disgust Sensitivity + University attendance/graduate + Female + Age 45 or older + Black + [Constant] Intent to Vaccinate = Disgust Sensitivity + University attendance/graduate + Female + Age 45 or older + Black + [Constant] Analysis plan for H2 and RQ1-2 H2 will be tested with the three models below, which estimate the effect of the high disgust message relative to the excluded low disgust condition. RQ1 will be examined with the Control Dummy, while RQ2 will be examined with a Wald test between the Control Dummy and High Disgust Dummy. Wave 2 vaccine skepticism = Control Dummy + High Disgust Dummy + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant] Intent to vaccinate = Control Dummy + High Disgust Dummy + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant] Analysis plan for H3a H3a will be tested with a similar model that includes our disgust sensitivity measure and an interaction between disgust sensitivity and the high disgust message. The control condition will be excluded from analysis to clarify the relative effect of the high disgust condition, which will be compared to the excluded category in these models. Wave 2 Vaccine Skepticism [Control Condition excluded] = High Disgust Dummy + Disgust Sensitivity + High Disgust Dummy X Disgust Sensitivity + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant] Intent to Vaccinate [Control Condition excluded] = High Disgust Dummy + Disgust Sensitivity + High Disgust Dummy X Disgust Sensitivity + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant] Analysis plan for H3b H3b will be tested with a similar model to above except Disgust Sensitivity terms will be dropped and an interaction will be added between Wave 1 vaccine skepticism and the high disgust message indicator. The control condition will again be excluded from analysis. Wave 2 Vaccine Skepticism [Control Condition excluded] = High Disgust Dummy + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + High Disgust Dummy X Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant] Flu Vaccination Likelihood [Control Condition excluded] = High Disgust Dummy + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + High Disgust Dummy X Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant] Family Vaccination Likelihood [Control Condition excluded] = High Disgust Dummy + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + High Disgust Dummy X Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant] Analysis plan for RQ3a-d To test RQ3a-d, we will estimate the following models on the full sample. We will then test whether the marginal effects of both treatment conditions, relative to the control, at one standard deviation below and one standard deviation above the mean level of disgust sensitivity are each significantly different from zero. Wave 2 Vaccine Skepticism = Low Disgust Dummy + High Disgust Dummy + Disgust Sensitivity + Low Disgust Dummy X Disgust Sensitivity + High Disgust Dummy X Disgust Sensitivity + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant] Flu Vaccination Likelihood = Low Disgust Dummy + High Disgust Dummy + Disgust Sensitivity + Low Disgust Dummy X Disgust Sensitivity + High Disgust Dummy X Disgust Sensitivity + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant] Family Vaccination Likelihood = Low Disgust Dummy + High Disgust Dummy + Disgust Sensitivity + Low Disgust Dummy X Disgust Sensitivity + High Disgust Dummy X Disgust Sensitivity + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant] Analysis plan for RQ4a-d To test RQ4a-d, we will estimate the following models on the full sample. We will then test whether the marginal effects of both treatment conditions relative to the control at one standard deviation below and above the mean level of Wave 1 vaccine skepticism are each significantly different from zero.

Intent to vaccinate Regardless of what you did this flu season, how likely is it that you will get a vaccine for the seasonal flu during the next flu season (autumn 2015 - spring 2016)? \u2022 Extremely likely \u2022 Very likely \u2022 Somewhat likely \u2022 Not very likely \u2022 Not at all likely How likely is it that you would choose to receive recommended vaccines for yourself and your family in the future? \u2022 Extremely likely \u2022 Very likely \u2022 Somewhat likely \u2022 Not very likely \u2022 Not at all likely Responses to these measures will be averaged to create a measure of intent to vaccinate if they are sufficiently intercorrelated (using factor analysis or Cronbach\u2019s alpha). If not, we will analyze the items separately. Manipulation check \u2013 vaccination disgust When you think about getting vaccinated, how grossed out do you feel? \u2022 Not grossed out at all \u2022 Not too grossed out \u2022 Somewhat grossed out \u2022 Very grossed out \u2022 Extremely grossed out Now I'd like to ask you about the good and bad points of getting vaccinated. Is there anything in particular about vaccines that might make you want to get yourself and your family vaccinated? [open-ends, ideally separate boxes 1-4 to make coding easier] Is there anything in particular about vaccines that might make you want to not get yourself or your family vaccinated? [open-ends, ideally separate boxes 1-4 to make coding easier] Analysis plan for the manipulation check We will first test whether the messages had the expected effects on the manipulation check. Responses towards the measure of disgust towards vaccination will be predicted using an ordered probit model as a function of Wave 1 vaccine skepticism, dummy variables for the control and high disgust conditions (the low disgust condition is the excluded category), and disgust sensitivity. We expect that Wave 1 vaccine skepticism and the high disgust condition will predict higher levels of vaccine disgust relative to the low disgust condition. We are agnostic about whether the low disgust condition will predict higher levels of disgust relative to the control condition. Vaccine Disgust = Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + Control Dummy + High Disgust Dummy + Disgust Sensitivity + [Constant] Analysis plan for H1 Our first hypothesis will be tested in three ways. First, wave 1 vaccine skepticism will be predicted as a function of disgust sensitivity and control variables using OLS with robust standard errors (the default model below unless otherwise specified). Second, wave 2 vaccine skepticism will be predicted using the same modeling approach among only respondents in the control condition. Third, intent to vaccinate will be predicted using the same modeling approach. Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism = Disgust Sensitivity + University attendance/graduate + Female + Age 45 or older + Black + [Constant] Wave 2 Vaccine Skepticism [Control condition only] = Disgust Sensitivity + University attendance/graduate + Female + Age 45 or older + Black + [Constant] Intent to Vaccinate = Disgust Sensitivity + University attendance/graduate + Female + Age 45 or older + Black + [Constant] Analysis plan for H2 and RQ1-2 H2 will be tested with the three models below, which estimate the effect of the high disgust message relative to the excluded low disgust condition. RQ1 will be examined with the Control Dummy, while RQ2 will be examined with a Wald test between the Control Dummy and High Disgust Dummy. Wave 2 vaccine skepticism = Control Dummy + High Disgust Dummy + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant] Intent to vaccinate = Control Dummy + High Disgust Dummy + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant] Analysis plan for H3a H3a will be tested with a similar model that includes our disgust sensitivity measure and an interaction between disgust sensitivity and the high disgust message. The control condition will be excluded from analysis to clarify the relative effect of the high disgust condition, which will be compared to the excluded category in these models. Wave 2 Vaccine Skepticism [Control Condition excluded] = High Disgust Dummy + Disgust Sensitivity + High Disgust Dummy X Disgust Sensitivity + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant] Intent to Vaccinate [Control Condition excluded] = High Disgust Dummy + Disgust Sensitivity + High Disgust Dummy X Disgust Sensitivity + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant] Analysis plan for H3b H3b will be tested with a similar model to above except Disgust Sensitivity terms will be dropped and an interaction will be added between Wave 1 vaccine skepticism and the high disgust message indicator. The control condition will again be excluded from analysis. Wave 2 Vaccine Skepticism [Control Condition excluded] = High Disgust Dummy + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + High Disgust Dummy X Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant] Flu Vaccination Likelihood [Control Condition excluded] = High Disgust Dummy + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + High Disgust Dummy X Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant] Family Vaccination Likelihood [Control Condition excluded] = High Disgust Dummy + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + High Disgust Dummy X Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant] Analysis plan for RQ3a-d To test RQ3a-d, we will estimate the following models on the full sample. We will then test whether the marginal effects of both treatment conditions, relative to the control, at one standard deviation below and one standard deviation above the mean level of disgust sensitivity are each significantly different from zero. Wave 2 Vaccine Skepticism = Low Disgust Dummy + High Disgust Dummy + Disgust Sensitivity + Low Disgust Dummy X Disgust Sensitivity + High Disgust Dummy X Disgust Sensitivity + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant] Flu Vaccination Likelihood = Low Disgust Dummy + High Disgust Dummy + Disgust Sensitivity + Low Disgust Dummy X Disgust Sensitivity + High Disgust Dummy X Disgust Sensitivity + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant] Family Vaccination Likelihood = Low Disgust Dummy + High Disgust Dummy + Disgust Sensitivity + Low Disgust Dummy X Disgust Sensitivity + High Disgust Dummy X Disgust Sensitivity + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + [Constant] Analysis plan for RQ4a-d To test RQ4a-d, we will estimate the following models on the full sample. We will then test whether the marginal effects of both treatment conditions relative to the control at one standard deviation below and above the mean level of Wave 1 vaccine skepticism are each significantly different from zero. Wave 2 Vaccine Skepticism = Low Disgust Dummy + High Disgust Dummy + Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + Low Disgust Dummy X Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism + High Disgust Dummy X Wave 1 Vaccine Skepticism +

frequently feature widespread belief in narratives that emphasize the uniqueness of group members\u2019 suffering and denigrate or ignore injustices suffered by the other group (Bar-Tal 2007; Noor et al. 2012). Along these lines, when conflicts between groups intensify, individuals are more likely to excuse or deny collective responsibility for their own group\u2019s past misdeeds (Roccas, Klar, and Liviatan 2006; Wohl and Branscombe 2008). These disputes over historical wrongdoing can contribute to the persistence of intergroup conflicts (Bar-Tal 2000) \u2013 a pattern that has frequently been observed in contexts such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the former Yugoslavia, and Northern Ireland as well as relations between states such as Japan and South Korea. By contrast, acknowledging wrongdoing against the other side can contribute to reconciliation (e.g., Ginges et al. 2007; Vollhardt, Mazur, and Lemahieu 2014). In many cases, denials of historical evidence in intergroup conflicts are paired with conspiracy theories attributing perceptions of an injustice to the power of the other group in the conflict. For instance, leaders in divided societies often promote conspiracy theories about the other side to try to achieve their own political goals (De Figueiredo and Weingast 1999). One reason these theories may resonate with ingroup members is the threat that conflict poses to people\u2019s feelings of control due to the occurrence of random or chaotic violence, minority group status, or power imbalances such as occupation. Previous research has shown that reduced perceptions of control can make people more prone to conspiracy theory beliefs (Whitson and Galinsky 2008; Sullivan, Landau, and Rothschild 2010). Specifically, we investigate the factors that contribute to historical (mis)perceptions in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one of the most intractable ongoing conflicts in the world. Our study considers an especially divisive historical misperception\u2014Jewish denial of the forced expulsion of Palestinians during the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. Palestinians refer to the expulsion as the \u201cNakba\u201d (Arabic for catastrophe), and commemorate it with protest marches. Most historians agree that Israeli soldiers expelled large numbers of Palestinians from their homes during the 1948 war and banned their return after the war. However, misperceptions about the Nakba or even denial of its veracity appear to be common among Jewish Israelis. In the most extreme version of the myth, Jewish forces played no role in the process; Palestinians are thought to have instead left their homes and villages on their own or at the direction of their leaders. Along the lines of the theory described above, feelings of a lack of control induced by the terrorist threat in Israel may contribute to Nakba denial and resistance. In addition, the effects of information exposure and feelings of control are likely to vary by ideology. Vulnerability to misperceptions \u2013 and resistance to corrective information \u2013 are likely to be highest among conservative Jewish Israelis. Previous research has found that misperceptions are typically higher and corrections are often ineffective or even increase misperceptions among the most vulnerable ideological groups (e.g., Nyhan and Reifler 2010; Nyhan, Reifler, and Ubel 2013). By contrast, non-conservative Jewish Israelis may be more vulnerable to the effects of a lack of control. First, perceptions of system instability and fears of threat and loss (Jost et al. 2003) are associated with conservatism, which may explain why liberals in the U.S. (Nail and McGregor 2009) and people exposed to the terrorist attacks (Bonanno and Jost 2006, Hersh 2013) moved in a conservative direction after 9/11. Similar results have been found using experimentally stimulated threats (Landau et al. 2004, Nail et al. 2009, Th\u00f3risd\u00f3ttir and Jost 2011; but see Greenberg et al. 1992, Kosloff et al. 2010). System justification theory explains this response as the result of a process of compensatory control \u2013 feelings of low control or uncertainty cause people to increase belief in the social and political status quo or reduce their support for change (Willer 2004, Kay et al. 2008, Banfield 2010, van der Toorn 20152, Whitson et al. 2015). These effects may be larger among ideologically moderate and left-leaning Israelis, who are otherwise less likely to believe in nationalist myths about Israel\u2019s history and past behavior. To test how feelings of control influence the persistence of misperceptions about the Nakba and the effectiveness of corrective historical information, we conduct an online survey experiment on 2,000 Jewish Israelis using the Midgam Project survey panel. We will randomly assign subjects to one of five conditions \u2013 either a pure control group or to one of four experimental groups in a 2x2 between-subjects design in which we independently manipulate level of control (low vs. high) and exposure to corrective information (Nakba denial vs. denial plus corrective information): 1. Pure control (no information) 2. Nakba denial; low control 3. Nakba denial + correction; low control 4. Nakba denial; high control 5. Nakba denial + correction; high control After the experimental manipulations, we will measure individual beliefs about the Nakba and Nakba denial (did the Nakba happen? what role did Jewish soldiers play in it? etc.) and also measure attitudes on other key issues related to the conflict (final status of settlements, Jerusalem, etc.) as well as more general views toward Israel and feelings toward Jewish Israelis, Arab Israelis, and Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. To measure how manipulating control and corrective information about Nakba influence a separate misperception involving Israeli military actions, we will also ask people\u2019s beliefs about the massacre of civilians at Sabra and Shatila. The massacre, which took place in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon during the 1982 war, was carried out by Lebanese Christian militias with the help of the Israeli Defense Forces. A common misperception is that the Palestinians that were killed were terrorists and not civilians. Our survey experiment will be able to provide policymakers and scholars a better understanding for why these historical misperceptions persist, how they can be corrected, and whether they influence key attitudes toward the conflict and the peace process.\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"We plan to test the following four experimental hypotheses. Hypotheses: H1: Individuals in the correction conditions will report lower misperceptions than those who receive only misleading information about the Nakba. H2: Respondents in the low control condition will report greater misperceptions about the Nakba and less critical views of Israel\u2019s behavior than those in the high control condition. H3: The effect of misinformation on misperceptions will be moderated by level of control. Specifically, misperceptions will increase more in response to exposure to Nakba denial among respondents in the low control condition than among those in the high control condition (relative to pure controls). H4: Right-wing respondents will be more resistant to the effects of corrective information than non-conservatives. Specifically, the misperception-reducing effect of the correction will be greater among right-wing respondents than among other participants (relative to respondents in each group who are only exposed to Nakba denial). We will plan to explore the following research questions, which raise important issues for which we do not have strong theoretical expectations: RQ1: Will the relationship between the effect of corrective information and ideology on misperceptions be moderated by level of control? It is possible, as we found in pilot data, that the difference in the effect of the correction between right-wing respondents and other respondents will vary by level of control. In particular, if other respondents\u2019 misperceptions increase more in response to Nakba denial when control is low, then the scope for negative correction effects is correspondingly larger. RQ2: Will exposure to corrective information change respondents\u2019 overall view of the extent to which Israel was founded in an ethical manner and acts in a manner consistent with its ideals? Respondents may, for instance, accept corrective information about the Nakba but interpret its implications in different ways (Gaines et al. 2007), causing their beliefs about Israel more generally not to change. RQ3: Do feelings of a lack of control or corrective information affect respondent beliefs about other misperceptions? A secondary outcome measure asks respondents whether Palestinian civilians (truth) or terrorists (misperception) were killed in the Sabra and Shatila massacre. Responses to this question will help us to disentangle the mechanism behind any level of control effect we find on our primary outcome measure. If Sabra/Shatila misperceptions increase in the low control conditions relative to high control conditions, then it would suggest that the control effect on misperceptions is not domain-specific. Alternatively, if Sabra/Shatila misperceptions do not change significantly, we would conclude that the level of control effect we observe relative to the control condition is conditional on the presence of information about Nakba denial. RQ4: An additional research question is whether corrective information about the Nakba influence attitudes towards Palestinians and Arab Israelis (Palestinian Citizens of Israel) as well as attitudes towards final status issues related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Scholars of intractable conflict would suggest that humanizing the outgroup by acknowledging their past victimization might make ingroup member view them more favorably and be more supportive of the peace process. RQ5: Past research suggests that those exposed to intergroup violence become more pro-ingroup, but little research considers whether this process extends to misperceptions about the outgroup. We will examine whether violence exposure moderates the effect of Nakba denial and corrective information on misperceptions.\""}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "\"Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants Subjects are Jewish Israelis over the age of 18 that are members of the Midgam online panel. Randomization approach We will randomly assign subjects to one of five treatment conditions: 1. Pure control (no information whatsoever) 2. Nakba denial; low control 3. Nakba denial + correction; low control 4. Nakba denial; high control 5. Nakba denial + correction; high control Data collection and blinding The Midgam Project will conduct the survey and data collection. Interventions and dates of administration Surveys will be made available on or around March 9, 2015 and will remain open until data collection is complete. Primary and secondary outcome measures Primary measures: Our principal outcome measure is average misperceptions and perceptions about Jewish military behavior during the Nakba in 1948. We will take the mean of the four questions about it in our survey where 5=the highest level of misperception and 1=the lowest level (reverse-coded as appropriate). Secondary measures include: o Misperceptions about the Sabra and Shatila massacre (mean after questions are reverse-coded as appropriate) o General beliefs about Israeli history and values (mean after questions are reverse-coded as appropriate) o Attitudes about acceptability of protests related to Nakba day (mean after questions are reverse-coded as appropriate) o Attitudes on final status agreement between Jews and Palestinians (mean after questions are reverse-coded as appropriate) o Feeling thermometer scores for Jewish Israelis, Arab Israelis, and Palestinians (difference between thermometer score for Jewish Israelis and mean score for Arab Israelis and Palestinians) If the questions used for our measures do not scale together, we may analyze responses to each question separately. Statistical analyses For H1-H3, we will use OLS with robust standard errors to estimate average treatment effects for our four experimental conditions relative to the control condition for our primary outcome measure (misperceptions about the Nakba) and the secondary dependent variables listed above. We will compute the appropriate differences in means between conditions to test the hypotheses above if the relevant test is not relative to the control group. For H4, we will interact the four experimental conditions with an indicator for right-wing self-identification (selecting the two most right-wing options on a seven-point scale: right or extreme right) and calculate the difference in correction effects between right-wing respondents and other participants in both the low and high control conditions. For RQ1, we will interact the experimental indicators with an indicator for right-wing self-identification and use a F-test to compare this model with a nested model that includes a conservative indicator. If it is, we will compute the relevant estimated marginal effects by comparing experimental means by cell. For RQ5, we will do the same with both an indicator for direct exposure to violence and (if possible) an indicator for recent violence in the area in which the respondent lives.

Along these lines, when conflicts between groups intensify, individuals are more likely to excuse or deny collective responsibility for their own group\u2019s past misdeeds (Roccas, Klar, and Liviatan 2006; Wohl and Branscombe 2008). These disputes over historical wrongdoing can contribute to the persistence of intergroup conflicts (Bar-Tal 2000) \u2013 a pattern that has frequently been observed in contexts such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the former Yugoslavia, and Northern Ireland as well as relations between states such as Japan and South Korea. By contrast, acknowledging wrongdoing against the other side can contribute to reconciliation (e.g., Ginges et al. 2007; Vollhardt, Mazur, and Lemahieu 2014). In many cases, denials of historical evidence in intergroup conflicts are paired with conspiracy theories attributing perceptions of an injustice to the power of the other group in the conflict. For instance, leaders in divided societies often promote conspiracy theories about the other side to try to achieve their own political goals (De Figueiredo and Weingast 1999). One reason these theories may resonate with ingroup members is the threat that conflict poses to people\u2019s feelings of control due to the occurrence of random or chaotic violence, minority group status, or power imbalances such as occupation. Previous research has shown that reduced perceptions of control can make people more prone to conspiracy theory beliefs (Whitson and Galinsky 2008; Sullivan, Landau, and Rothschild 2010). Specifically, we investigate the factors that contribute to historical (mis)perceptions in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one of the most intractable ongoing conflicts in the world. Our study considers an especially divisive historical misperception\u2014Jewish denial of the forced expulsion of Palestinians during the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. Palestinians refer to the expulsion as the \u201cNakba\u201d (Arabic for catastrophe), and commemorate it with protest marches. Most historians agree that Israeli soldiers expelled large numbers of Palestinians from their homes during the 1948 war and banned their return after the war. However, misperceptions about the Nakba or even denial of its veracity appear to be common among Jewish Israelis. In the most extreme version of the myth, Jewish forces played no role in the process; Palestinians are thought to have instead left their homes and villages on their own or at the direction of their leaders. Along the lines of the theory described above, feelings of a lack of control induced by the terrorist threat in Israel may contribute to Nakba denial and resistance. In addition, the effects of information exposure and feelings of control are likely to vary by ideology. Vulnerability to misperceptions \u2013 and resistance to corrective information \u2013 are likely to be highest among conservative Jewish Israelis. Previous research has found that misperceptions are typically higher and corrections are often ineffective or even increase misperceptions among the most vulnerable ideological groups (e.g., Nyhan and Reifler 2010; Nyhan, Reifler, and Ubel 2013). By contrast, non-conservative Jewish Israelis may be more vulnerable to the effects of a lack of control. First, perceptions of system instability and fears of threat and loss (Jost et al. 2003) are associated with conservatism, which may explain why liberals in the U.S. (Nail and McGregor 2009) and people exposed to the terrorist attacks (Bonanno and Jost 2006, Hersh 2013) moved in a conservative direction after 9/11. Similar results have been found using experimentally stimulated threats (Landau et al. 2004, Nail et al. 2009, Th\u00f3risd\u00f3ttir and Jost 2011; but see Greenberg et al. 1992, Kosloff et al. 2010). System justification theory explains this response as the result of a process of compensatory control \u2013 feelings of low control or uncertainty cause people to increase belief in the social and political status quo or reduce their support for change (Willer 2004, Kay et al. 2008, Banfield 2010, van der Toorn 20152, Whitson et al. 2015). These effects may be larger among ideologically moderate and left-leaning Israelis, who are otherwise less likely to believe in nationalist myths about Israel\u2019s history and past behavior. To test how feelings of control influence the persistence of misperceptions about the Nakba and the effectiveness of corrective historical information, we conduct an online survey experiment on 2,000 Jewish Israelis using the Midgam Project survey panel. We will randomly assign subjects to one of five conditions \u2013 either a pure control group or to one of four experimental groups in a 2x2 between-subjects design in which we independently manipulate level of control (low vs. high) and exposure to corrective information (Nakba denial vs. denial plus corrective information): 1. Pure control (no information) 2. Nakba denial; low control 3. Nakba denial + correction; low control 4. Nakba denial; high control 5. Nakba denial + correction; high control After the experimental manipulations, we will measure individual beliefs about the Nakba and Nakba denial (did the Nakba happen? what role did Jewish soldiers play in it? etc.) and also measure attitudes on other key issues related to the conflict (final status of settlements, Jerusalem, etc.) as well as more general views toward Israel and feelings toward Jewish Israelis, Arab Israelis, and Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. To measure how manipulating control and corrective information about Nakba influence a separate misperception involving Israeli military actions, we will also ask people\u2019s beliefs about the massacre of civilians at Sabra and Shatila. The massacre, which took place in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon during the 1982 war, was carried out by Lebanese Christian militias with the help of the Israeli Defense Forces. A common misperception is that the Palestinians that were killed were terrorists and not civilians. Our survey experiment will be able to provide policymakers and scholars a better understanding for why these historical misperceptions persist, how they can be corrected, and whether they influence key attitudes toward the conflict and the peace process.\"", "q16": "\"We plan to test the following four experimental hypotheses. Hypotheses: H1: Individuals in the correction conditions will report lower misperceptions than those who receive only misleading information about the Nakba. H2: Respondents in the low control condition will report greater misperceptions about the Nakba and less critical views of Israel\u2019s behavior than those in the high control condition. H3: The effect of misinformation on misperceptions will be moderated by level of control. Specifically, misperceptions will increase more in response to exposure to Nakba denial among respondents in the low control condition than among those in the high control condition (relative to pure controls). H4: Right-wing respondents will be more resistant to the effects of corrective information than non-conservatives. Specifically, the misperception-reducing effect of the correction will be greater among right-wing respondents than among other participants (relative to respondents in each group who are only exposed to Nakba denial). We will plan to explore the following research questions, which raise important issues for which we do not have strong theoretical expectations: RQ1: Will the relationship between the effect of corrective information and ideology on misperceptions be moderated by level of control? It is possible, as we found in pilot data, that the difference in the effect of the correction between right-wing respondents and other respondents will vary by level of control. In particular, if other respondents\u2019 misperceptions increase more in response to Nakba denial when control is low, then the scope for negative correction effects is correspondingly larger. RQ2: Will exposure to corrective information change respondents\u2019 overall view of the extent to which Israel was founded in an ethical manner and acts in a manner consistent with its ideals? Respondents may, for instance, accept corrective information about the Nakba but interpret its implications in different ways (Gaines et al. 2007), causing their beliefs about Israel more generally not to change. RQ3: Do feelings of a lack of control or corrective information affect respondent beliefs about other misperceptions? A secondary outcome measure asks respondents whether Palestinian civilians (truth) or terrorists (misperception) were killed in the Sabra and Shatila massacre. Responses to this question will help us to disentangle the mechanism behind any level of control effect we find on our primary outcome measure. If Sabra/Shatila misperceptions increase in the low control conditions relative to high control conditions, then it would suggest that the control effect on misperceptions is not domain-specific. Alternatively, if Sabra/Shatila misperceptions do not change significantly, we would conclude that the level of control effect we observe relative to the control condition is conditional on the presence of information about Nakba denial. RQ4: An additional research question is whether corrective information about the Nakba influence attitudes towards Palestinians and Arab Israelis (Palestinian Citizens of Israel) as well as attitudes towards final status issues related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Scholars of intractable conflict would suggest that humanizing the outgroup by acknowledging their past victimization might make ingroup member view them more favorably and be more supportive of the peace process. RQ5: Past research suggests that those exposed to intergroup violence become more pro-ingroup, but little research considers whether this process extends to misperceptions about the outgroup. We will examine whether violence exposure moderates the effect of Nakba denial and corrective information on misperceptions.\"", "q17": "\"Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants Subjects are Jewish Israelis over the age of 18 that are members of the Midgam online panel. Randomization approach We will randomly assign subjects to one of five treatment conditions: 1. Pure control (no information whatsoever) 2. Nakba denial; low control 3. Nakba denial + correction; low control 4. Nakba denial; high control 5. Nakba denial + correction; high control Data collection and blinding The Midgam Project will conduct the survey and data collection. Interventions and dates of administration Surveys will be made available on or around March 9, 2015 and will remain open until data collection is complete. Primary and secondary outcome measures Primary measures: Our principal outcome measure is average misperceptions and perceptions about Jewish military behavior during the Nakba in 1948. We will take the mean of the four questions about it in our survey where 5=the highest level of misperception and 1=the lowest level (reverse-coded as appropriate). Secondary measures include: o Misperceptions about the Sabra and Shatila massacre (mean after questions are reverse-coded as appropriate) o General beliefs about Israeli history and values (mean after questions are reverse-coded as appropriate) o Attitudes about acceptability of protests related to Nakba day (mean after questions are reverse-coded as appropriate) o Attitudes on final status agreement between Jews and Palestinians (mean after questions are reverse-coded as appropriate) o Feeling thermometer scores for Jewish Israelis, Arab Israelis, and Palestinians (difference between thermometer score for Jewish Israelis and mean score for Arab Israelis and Palestinians) If the questions used for our measures do not scale together, we may analyze responses to each question separately. Statistical analyses For H1-H3, we will use OLS with robust standard errors to estimate average treatment effects for our four experimental conditions relative to the control condition for our primary outcome measure (misperceptions about the Nakba) and the secondary dependent variables listed above. We will compute the appropriate differences in means between conditions to test the hypotheses above if the relevant test is not relative to the control group. For H4, we will interact the four experimental conditions with an indicator for right-wing self-identification (selecting the two most right-wing options on a seven-point scale: right or extreme right) and calculate the difference in correction effects between right-wing respondents and other participants in both the low and high control conditions. For RQ1, we will interact the experimental indicators with an indicator for right-wing self-identification and use a F-test to compare this model with a nested model that includes a conservative indicator. If it is, we will compute the relevant estimated marginal effects by comparing experimental means by cell. For RQ5, we will do the same with both an indicator for direct exposure to violence and (if possible) an indicator for recent violence in the area in which the respondent lives. For RQ2-RQ4, we will repeat the analysis approach from H1-H3 using appropriate secondary outcome measures (RQ2 corresponds to H1, RQ3 to H1-H3, and RQ4 to H1).
