We observed that participants gave more visual attention to the disfigurement location (compared to control face) and that eyes were the most internal expressive feature impaired. \nRegarding the previous work of Stone and Potton (2017), the aim of this study will be to show the emotional consequences in this shift of visual attention that we previously evidenced and to discuss it in regard to the objectification theory.", "recommended-hypothesis.question6a": "", "description-methods.design.question2a": "1.\tThe type of faces: categorical variable with 2 levels (control, disfigurement), mixed within- and between-participant\n2.\tThe AoI (area of interest): categorical variable with five levels (eyes, nose, cheek with or without burning scar, other cheek, mouth), within-participant\n3.\tEmotional scales: categorical variable with six levels (sorrow, fear, surprise, hate, disgust, neutral), within-participant", "description-methods.design.question2b": "1.\tIndicators of visual attention : eye tracking technology (Tobii pro) is recording: \n\u2022\tDwell time (total time spent fixating on a region over the course of a trial), \n\u2022\tFirst fixation time (how quickly a region was fixated relative to the onset of the image),\n\u2022\tTotal time spent visiting on a region over the course of a trial: A relative importance score of the disfigurement will be calculated by subtracting the rating of the target AoI (i.e., with the disfigurement) from each of the other areas resulting in 4 scores. \n\u2022\tVisit count : number of visits on a region over the course of a trial.\n\n2.\tEmotional state scale : \nThe questionnaire contains a list of 18 emotion related words.

Reports of the psychometric properties of the ADOS reveal high interrater reliability, internal consistency and test-retest reliability \n\nThe Social Orienting Continuum and Response Scale (SOC-RS)\nThe SOC-RS is an observational coding system of four social orienting behaviours; social referencing, orienting to name, social smiling and joint attention. The SOC-RS employs retrospective coding of social orienting behaviour applied to previously recorded ADOS assessments. This will enable us to capture dimensional ratings of social orienting behaviour using a standardised procedure, to provide richer information that the categorical ratings provided by the ADOS. \n\nMullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL)\nThe MSEL is an IQ assessment for children aged 0-68 months and provides standardised scores across five domains pertaining to gross motor, visual reception, fine motor, expressive language, and receptive language. The scale is widely used in experimental and developmental psychology in young children. Children in each group will be matched for developmental ability to ensure that any obtained differences in social cognition are not due to developmental ability in children born preterm.\n\nThe Early Social Cognitive Battery \nThe Early Social Cognition Battery will be used as a direct assessment of early social understanding. The Early Social Cognition Battery is a scaled, play-based assessment that allows for calculation of a total score of early social understanding. The battery includes seven tasks of social cognition, drawn from the existing child development literature and progressing beyond joint attention to assess diverse social cognitive skills. An example of these tasks is the \u2018Helping\u2019 assessment where the child watches the adult draw using a pen, and then \u2018accidentally\u2019 drop the pen and unsuccessfully reach for it. The child\u2019s response is coded to determine whether they can understand another person\u2019s intentions and unachieved goals. As these seven tasks scale in a known developmental trajectory with published norms, we will test whether children born mid-late preterm show deficits or divergent trajectories in these early social-cognitive skills compared to the term born cohort.\n\nEye-Tracking\nBrief eye-tracking paradigms will be used to evaluate implicit differences in social attention between the two groups. We  will compare children\u2019s attentional preferences when viewing static and dynamic social and non-social stimuli as well as biological motion stimuli. The eye-tracking tasks will capture differences in attention via measures of dwell time and first fixation latency elucidating fundamental attentional processes that may drive deficits or differences in social understanding.\n\nInterviews\nFollowing their assessment day, parents may be contacted to arrange a time convenient to them in the following 6-8 weeks to complete a telephone interview.

This will enable us to capture dimensional ratings of social orienting behaviour using a standardised procedure, to provide richer information that the categorical ratings provided by the ADOS. \n\nMullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL)\nThe MSEL is an IQ assessment for children aged 0-68 months and provides standardised scores across five domains pertaining to gross motor, visual reception, fine motor, expressive language, and receptive language.

The child\u2019s response is coded to determine whether they can understand another person\u2019s intentions and unachieved goals.

Previous data has shown that subjective clinical judgement of doctors and nurses correlates more closely with actual 3 month outcome after ICH than prognostic scales (The absolute value of the correlation coefficient for doctors predictions with respect to actual outcome  (Pearson r = 0.75) was higher (r= 0.62, p=0.057) than that of a prognostic scales (r=0.56, p=0.01).

Exploring ICH outcome after critical care and clinicians\u2019 perceptions of outcome aims to provide an in-depth understanding of caring for a group of patients who carry high mortality and morbidity rates. \nFindings will potentially contribute to the rational development of acute care pathways and help shape the organisation of hyperacute stroke critical care services and resources within the UK. Additionally new knowledge and understanding surrounding ICH patient outcome could help inform interprofessional collaborative complex decision making, improve the precision of prognostication, with the overall aim of providing care that is in the best interests of patients and their families. \n\n", "q4": "We predict that doctors and nurses will predict poor outcome (mRS 4-6)  more frequently and more accurately than good outcome after spontaneous ICH.

It is estimated that each eligible ICH patient will have approximately 4-7 subjective predictions by individual participating members of the direct care team. Final 6-month follow-up from admission to hospital is anticipated to be completed as described above by March 2020.  All patient identifiable data collected will be anonymised. To date, n=315 baseline predictions have been achieved, and the final sample will depend on the number of completed cases.\n\n", "q14": "Power calculation \n\n\nWe have modelled the power which would be achieved with n=315 observations on the basis of a number of assumed accuracy rates. Previous data has shown that subjective clinical judgement of doctors and nurses correlates more closely with actual 3 month outcome after ICH than prognostic scales (The absolute value of the correlation coefficient for doctors predictions with respect to actual outcome  (Pearson r = 0.75) was higher (r= 0.62, p=0.057) than that of a prognostic scales (r=0.56, p=0.01). Nurse\u2019s predictions of outcome (r= 0.72), also was more accurate than prognostic scales (r= 0.09, p=0.03)(Hwang et al 2016). An earlier study found doctors to have a high predictive accuracy (80%) in determining 6-month outcome in mechanically ventilated neurologic patients of which stroke patients were the largest group. Accuracy for predicting a good outcome (mRS 0-3) was 63% and poor outcome (mRS 4-6) 94%(Caulfield et al 2010). Accuracy for exact agreement between doctors mRS predictions and actual 6-month mRS was only 43% (Caulfield et al 2010).\n\n\n\nTo determine likely achieved power for the sample, we have modelled a number of  possible outcomes;\n\nAssuming that doctors are correct 80% of the time, and nurses correct 60% of the time, a chi-square with an n of 315 would achieve a power of .97, with an alpha of .05. Assuming that doctors are correct 50% of the time, and nurses correct 30% of the time, a chi-square with an n of 315 would achieve a power of .95, with an alpha of .05. \n\nAssuming that doctors are correct 75% of the time, and nurses correct 60% of the time, a chi-square with an n of 315 would achieve a power of .81, with an alpha of .05. \nIf this n in this sample dropped to 280 (representing higher than anticipated lost to follow on outcomes, this power falls to .76.\n\nIn summary, the sample should be capable of detecting accuracy differences of ~15% with a power ~.80.

The statistical plan that we wish to register refers to phase 3, which will address aim 3.\n\n1: Phase 1 Quantitative Phase \u2013 Secondary data analysis (completed)\nPhase 1 aimed to determine ICH patients\u2019 functional outcome using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at six months following management in critical care compared with that of ICH patients treated in other settings.  Anonymised ICH patient outcome data were analysed from a prospective observational cohort study: Clinical Relevance of Microbleeds in Stroke (CROMIS-2 ICH) study. Ethical approval for this study included patient consent for the use of patient data for future research studies.  \nPhase 2: Qualitative Phase (completed)\nUsing purposive sampling, members of the direct care team (n=21 doctors and nurses) who work in a neurocritical care setting where ICH patients are treated regularly, were interviewed using semi-structured interviews. Phase 2 aimed to explore the perceptions of the appropriateness of critical care for ICH patients and subsequent patient outcome.\nPhase 3: Quantitative Phase \u2013 Prospective (on-going)\nOver a 1 year period (September 2018-September 2019) members of the direct care team within a neurocritical care department in a neuroscience tertiary referral centre in a multi-site acute, central London teaching hospital will be invited by members of an audit team to subjectively predict ICH patient functional outcome at 6 months in the first 48 hours of an eligible ICH patient admission using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (Bonita and Beaglehole 1988).

In the United States and Europe, the prevalence has doubled over the last\nhalf-century with half of young adults now having myopia[1]. The consequence of myopia\nextends beyond the inconvenience of using optical correction. Myopia is associated with\nincreased incidence of diseases such as retinal damage, cataract, and glaucoma [1]. Increased\nlevels of near-work have commonly been associated with the onset of myopia [2]. It is therefore\nimportant to gain a better understanding of what is happening from a functional and anatomical\nstandpoint when subjects complete near-work tasks.\nThere are two different types of text, texts that have positive contrast (white text on a\ndarker background) and texts that have negative contrast (black text on a lighter background).\nAleman et. al (2018) found that negative contrast texts produced a thinning effect on the choroid\n(-16.13\u571f4.54 \u03bcm), and positive contrast produced a thickening effect on the choroid(9.96\u571f\n6.51\u03bcm) [3]. Aleman et. al interpreted these results in the context of ON and OFF pathways in\nthe visual system [4]. They suggested negative contrast texts stimulate the OFF pathway, while\npositive contrast texts stimulate the ON pathway. Choroidal thickening and thinning in both\nchicks and marmosets has been observed to be a precursor to a decrease or an increase in axial\ngrowth respectively [5, 6, 7]. The latter leading to the development of myopia. Trolio et. al\ndocumented 20 \u03bcm of choroidal thinning in myopia induced marmoset eyes and 12 \u03bcm of\nthickening in eyes induced with hyperopia [5]. It is hypothesized that the choroid either acts as a\nmechanical buffer or a diffusion barrier for the sclera [5].\nQualitatively, Aleman et al\u2019s data showed the thinning effect was more pronounced in\nmyopic individuals as compared to their emmetropic counterparts [3], but their sample size was\ninsufficient to draw quantitative conclusions. The plasticity of the human choroid is an important\nlink to animal models. For example, Read et. al found that among a group of 39 myopic\nindividuals subfoveal choroidal thickness was 50 \u03bcm thinner than nonmyopic age-matched\nchildren [8].\nRetinal Ganglion Cells are organized in an ON center OFF surround arrangement or vice\nversa [2]. ON cells become depolarized to an increment in light, while OFF depolarize in\nresponse to decrements in light. OFF retinal ganglion cells are twice as numerous and half the\nsize of ON rental ganglion cells in the fovea. Several studies such as Mazade et. al, Lu et. al, and\nTyler et. al corroborated the different spatial tuning and cortical connectivity of the ON and OFF\npathway [9, 10, 11]. Mazade et al showed maximal cortical responses for small fast stimuli in the\nOFF pathway and maximal cortical responses for slow slow global stimuli in the ON pathway\n[10]. Zhong-Lin et. al found negative stimuli (or decrements in light) to be 25% more effective\nthan equal magnitude positive stimuli (or increments in light) across eleven different types of\nstimuli [11]. Taken together, these studies support a distinct roles for the ON and OFF pathways\nin the visual system.\nThe goal of our study is threefold. We aim to replicate the changes in choroidal thickness\nin response to negative and positive contrast with a larger subject group. We aim to measure the\nsensitivity to positive and negative contrast tasks and compare the ratio of contrast sensitivity to\nthese two contrast types among refractive error/axial length. Finally, we will monitor the changes\nin sensitivity to positive and negative contrast as the session proceeds as to understand the\nfunctional implications choroidal thickness changes may have.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-01-17T17:06:50.987061", "date_modified": "2019-11-22T18:34:42.400807", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": null, "analytics_key": "131fffc07d65d9e0a791427301d5ffe0cc630f220327c77c7dfd4dab26427a7f3d2440cd57b10aabd2fa239fbbb7c7ff86ef9edac3459ec958a4d7be820f12aff6a94dcc2e9bcef85dc5cf62f070769926f08c9d0c1b078d5becdeb702c7de30bbe6a04e752d854ea033420b4056964944aacacea408a9420e9a5a0b11ae0edfe5f551b6e3205154f933ca68cc973a8e", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-01-17T17:06:50.963898", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Does Contrast Polarity Produce Changes in Choroid Thickness Moderated by Refractive Error?"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "William Hogue, Christopher Patrick Taylor"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Previous studies by Aleman et al. have shown a correlation between contrast polarity and changes in choroidal thickness with ON- retinal ganglion cell stimulation leading to choroidal thickening and OFF- retinal ganglion cells leading to choroidal thinning.
