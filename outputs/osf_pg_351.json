State appeals can shift formalization and tax compliance, especially if appeals shift the perceived costs and benefits of formalization and compliance. The understanding of the conditions under which these appeals are effective, however, remains incomplete. Since 2006, Lagos State Government in Nigeria has launched a number of initiatives to increase the registration of taxpayers and the payment of income tax. These initiatives have been successful, generating a more than 400 percent increase in tax revenue over this period, and they have been accompanied by a significant expansion of state services delivery, even in the poorest areas of Lagos. The majority of the informal sector, however, remains outside the state tax net. To this point, tax enforcement efforts in the informal sector have been minimal. Furthermore, most current income tax contributions by small businesses and vendors has occurred through indirect payment to the trade and marketplace associations to which many members of the informal sector belong. The aim of this study is to assess how the informational content and framing of formalization and tax appeals shape behavioral and attitudinal response."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Our pre-analysis plan lays out four main hypotheses families, as well as a set of secondary hypotheses. The three most important hypotheses are as follows. First, we seek to understand how the provision of information that affects the perceived costs and benefits of formalization impacts behavior. Our expectation is the impact of this informational treatment will be insufficient to significantly increase formalization rates in the absence of additional interventions. We hypothesize that the same is true for tax compliance. Second, we investigate how differential framing of tax appeals shifts both tax morale and tax payment. We expect that appeals will be more effective in shifting the perceived benefits of tax compliance, behavior, and tax morale when they are delivered by actors that are viewed to be more credible and when individuals' past experience is consistent with the message framing. Finally, we examine the effects of collective versus individualized receipt of tax appeals. Our expectation is that individuals will be more likely to change their compliance behavior and orientation toward tax when appeals are visibly delivered to other individuals as well."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "Our study proposes two interventions aimed at increasing formalization and tax payment by informal sector vendors located in Lagos marketplaces, the bulk of whom are operating small businesses with fewer than five employees. The two interventions generate six separate conditions, and treatment is assigned at the individual level. Vendors\u2019 knowledge of the tax registration process, benefits attached to registration, and their own potential income tax liability is low. The first intervention therefore examines how provision of information and registration assistance by a local NGO affects formalization. The second intervention then examines how the effectiveness of tax payment appeals varies based on the framing of those appeals and the identity of the agent delivering the appeal. One of the significant features of this research site is the importance of pre-existing institutions that already play a role in mediating the relationship between informal sector workers and the state. Thus, in the second intervention, an individual vendor will receive a visit that stresses either the potential costs of non-compliance (punishment) or the potential benefits of tax payment (more public goods), but we also vary the identity of the agent delivering these appeals. Individuals will be randomly assigned to delivery by staff of Lagos Internal Revenue or by representatives of the vendors\u2019 marketplace association."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Nigeria"},

State appeals can shift formalization and tax compliance, especially if appeals shift the perceived costs and benefits of formalization and compliance. The understanding of the conditions under which these appeals are effective, however, remains incomplete. Since 2006, Lagos State Government in Nigeria has launched a number of initiatives to increase the registration of taxpayers and the payment of income tax. These initiatives have been successful, generating a more than 400 percent increase in tax revenue over this period, and they have been accompanied by a significant expansion of state services delivery, even in the poorest areas of Lagos. The majority of the informal sector, however, remains outside the state tax net. To this point, tax enforcement efforts in the informal sector have been minimal. Furthermore, most current income tax contributions by small businesses and vendors has occurred through indirect payment to the trade and marketplace associations to which many members of the informal sector belong. The aim of this study is to assess how the informational content and framing of formalization and tax appeals shape behavioral and attitudinal response.", "q16": "Our pre-analysis plan lays out four main hypotheses families, as well as a set of secondary hypotheses. The three most important hypotheses are as follows. First, we seek to understand how the provision of information that affects the perceived costs and benefits of formalization impacts behavior. Our expectation is the impact of this informational treatment will be insufficient to significantly increase formalization rates in the absence of additional interventions. We hypothesize that the same is true for tax compliance. Second, we investigate how differential framing of tax appeals shifts both tax morale and tax payment. We expect that appeals will be more effective in shifting the perceived benefits of tax compliance, behavior, and tax morale when they are delivered by actors that are viewed to be more credible and when individuals' past experience is consistent with the message framing. Finally, we examine the effects of collective versus individualized receipt of tax appeals. Our expectation is that individuals will be more likely to change their compliance behavior and orientation toward tax when appeals are visibly delivered to other individuals as well.", "q17": "Our study proposes two interventions aimed at increasing formalization and tax payment by informal sector vendors located in Lagos marketplaces, the bulk of whom are operating small businesses with fewer than five employees. The two interventions generate six separate conditions, and treatment is assigned at the individual level. Vendors\u2019 knowledge of the tax registration process, benefits attached to registration, and their own potential income tax liability is low. The first intervention therefore examines how provision of information and registration assistance by a local NGO affects formalization. The second intervention then examines how the effectiveness of tax payment appeals varies based on the framing of those appeals and the identity of the agent delivering the appeal. One of the significant features of this research site is the importance of pre-existing institutions that already play a role in mediating the relationship between informal sector workers and the state. Thus, in the second intervention, an individual vendor will receive a visit that stresses either the potential costs of non-compliance (punishment) or the potential benefits of tax payment (more public goods), but we also vary the identity of the agent delivering these appeals. Individuals will be randomly assigned to delivery by staff of Lagos Internal Revenue or by representatives of the vendors\u2019 marketplace association.", "q18": "Nigeria", "q19": "3248", "q20":

However, marginalized group members do not always respond to group threats in concert. On the contrary, a threatening environment sometimes results in weakened group commitment. Through behavioural games in a laboratory setting in the field, this study explores how exclusion affects social identity choices among Muslims in India, as well as when group members respond to exclusion by deepening their group commitment, and when this is less likely. By randomly assigning a prime that highlights the symbolic exclusion suffered by Muslims in the context of rising Hindu nationalism, and by assigning participants to high- or low-status groups as a function of their family's monthly income, we study the role of socio-economic status in conditioning responses to group threat."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypotheses are included in the pre-analysis plan.

Additionally, these studies do not distinguish between 1) appropriate police action and excessive police force and 2) individuals' previous level of mobilization. Using a nationally representative survey of 2,000 Ugandans administered in July 2018, we investigate two questions: \ffirst, how different police actions affect citizens' support for the police and willingness to engage in collective action; and second, whether these effects are conditioned by whether individuals are already mobilized and engaging in collective action. We further examine heterogeneous treatment effects to explore whether these effects vary by respondents' support for the incumbent, prior police interactions, region, and gender. By examining the politics of policing in an authoritarian context, we hope to provide experimental evidence for when state-violence triggers political backlash, increasing collective action and decreasing support for the security apparatus."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "This study examines two theoretical priors relating to repression and collective actions.

But these studies are limited in their ability to address the thorny challenge of endogeneity (i.e., does repression a\u000bect mobilization or does collective action a\u000b repressive behavior?). Additionally, these studies do not distinguish between 1) appropriate police action and excessive police force and 2) individuals' previous level of mobilization. Using a nationally representative survey of 2,000 Ugandans administered in July 2018, we investigate two questions: \ffirst, how different police actions affect citizens' support for the police and willingness to engage in collective action; and second, whether these effects are conditioned by whether individuals are already mobilized and engaging in collective action. We further examine heterogeneous treatment effects to explore whether these effects vary by respondents' support for the incumbent, prior police interactions, region, and gender. By examining the politics of policing in an authoritarian context, we hope to provide experimental evidence for when state-violence triggers political backlash, increasing collective action and decreasing support for the security apparatus.", "q16": "This study examines two theoretical priors relating to repression and collective actions.

Since the late 1970s, Northern Nigeria has been the site of religious and ethnic conflicts that have led to substantial violence and instability. These conflicts are thought to be fueled by the region\u2019s high rates of poverty and unemployment, as well as its large population of marginalized urban youth. Particularly notable in this context are the Almajirai, children of poor families from rural areas who migrate to cities to study in Qur\u2019anic Schools. Observers of the region worry that, due to their lack of economic opportunities, these youths become easy targets for recruitment by violent groups and criminal organizations. This study will evaluate the impact of a unique vocational training program delivered through Community Skills Development Centers (COSDECs) to over 900 young men and women. The program is unique in targeting highly marginalized individuals, including many Almajiri. The intervention utilized a classroom-based approach in which fully equipped workshops and production facilities were used to train students in select trades. The COSDEC intervention recruited participants in two geographic areas: the states of Kaduna and Katsina. The program recruited from six categories of beneficiaries in the pilot period: Almajiri, Adolescent Girls in Islamic and Quranic Education (IQE), Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC), Early School Leavers (ESL), and Prison Inmates. Recruitment was based on two primary selection criteria: (i) being in the age bracket 15 to 24 years old, and (ii) living on less than N225.76 (about $0.65 in today\u2019s exchange rate) per day."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "The proposed impact evaluation seeks to answer three questions. 1.

Specifically, we will test the primary hypothesis for outcomes 2 and 6 (participation in political/religious violence, and anti-social behavior) only for the subsample of male participants. In addition, we will test the primary hypothesis for outcome 4 for the subsample of female respondents since the outcome is less relevant for men in this context.

Since the late 1970s, Northern Nigeria has been the site of religious and ethnic conflicts that have led to substantial violence and instability. These conflicts are thought to be fueled by the region\u2019s high rates of poverty and unemployment, as well as its large population of marginalized urban youth. Particularly notable in this context are the Almajirai, children of poor families from rural areas who migrate to cities to study in Qur\u2019anic Schools. Observers of the region worry that, due to their lack of economic opportunities, these youths become easy targets for recruitment by violent groups and criminal organizations. This study will evaluate the impact of a unique vocational training program delivered through Community Skills Development Centers (COSDECs) to over 900 young men and women. The program is unique in targeting highly marginalized individuals, including many Almajiri. The intervention utilized a classroom-based approach in which fully equipped workshops and production facilities were used to train students in select trades. The COSDEC intervention recruited participants in two geographic areas: the states of Kaduna and Katsina. The program recruited from six categories of beneficiaries in the pilot period: Almajiri, Adolescent Girls in Islamic and Quranic Education (IQE), Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC), Early School Leavers (ESL), and Prison Inmates. Recruitment was based on two primary selection criteria: (i) being in the age bracket 15 to 24 years old, and (ii) living on less than N225.76 (about $0.65 in today\u2019s exchange rate) per day.", "q16": "The proposed impact evaluation seeks to answer three questions. 1. Can the COSDEC training intervention delivered by the Mafita program increase the labor-market outcomes and economic well-being of marginalized youth? 2.

We will also report a robustness test using the method of Anderson (2008), which weights the index items by their inverse covariance matrix. We will also present estimates of individual indicators within each family to better gauge how various indicators contribute to overall effects within families. For certain outcomes, we will test the primary hypothesis only for the subsample of male or female respondents. Specifically, we will test the primary hypothesis for outcomes 2 and 6 (participation in political/religious violence, and anti-social behavior) only for the subsample of male participants. In addition, we will test the primary hypothesis for outcome 4 for the subsample of female respondents since the outcome is less relevant for men in this context. As part of the heterogeneity analysis, we will also report estimates for outcomes 2 and 6 for women and outcome 4 for men. For outcome 7, which is measured by a choice experiment, we will use the estimation procedure described in section 4.4 in the PAP attached.
