They face myriad socioeconomic and health burdens when compared with their non-Hispanic/Latinx White counterparts including less educational attainment, lower income, more workplace injury, less access to health care, less access to healthy food and spaces for physical activity, and greater rates of diabetes mellitus. Yet, despite this considerable hardship, they demonstrate lower age-adjusted all-cause mortality and lower atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality.\n\nThe reasons for this health paradox are not well understood. Many scholars have hypothesized that this paradox may be partially explained by Hispanics'/Latinxs' collectivist values that may facilitate protective family and social dynamics, or interpersonal social capital. However, little is known about the nature of these dynamics and how they may influence disease incidence, management, and progression- particularly, cardiometabolic disease such as diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. To address this gap in knowledge, the proposed scoping review will identify and explore studies that measure social environments among US dwelling Hispanics/Latinxs and their association with cardiometabolic disease incidence, management, and progression. Social environments include marital-like relationships, family dynamics surrounding support behaviors, social networks, neighborhood social factors such as integration and cohesion, etc. \n\nREVIEW QUESTIONS\n1.\tTo identify studies that measure aspects of interpersonal social capital in Hispanics/Latinx living in the US. \n2.\tDescribe and critically analyze how these constructs are measured. \n3.\tDescribe how these aspects of interpersonal social capital affect/influence incidence, management, and progression of cardiometabolic disease. \n4.\tIdentify gaps in the literature and make recommendations for future research.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-22T03:30:08.166591", "date_modified": "2020-04-22T03:24:02.754126", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["Cardiometabolic Disease", "Cardiovascular Disease", "Diabetes", "Hispanic", "Latina", "Latino", "Social Capital", "Social Environment", "Social Support"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [""], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "8502fb83156b41b2d43e7fe6462dce400258ce243b809ec5e51e747c4bc8243b069576ac895f8c3fea15f3d7f654383f6d1525db27f73cb779caf83d3613d4499746355f5b77a4c138d7faf7b64acc09bc552045a5470dd19937f7156f68f41c74bdb87b8bb2894ef8be64402af12f0b18747a9f94837068de84ed2b77e72029b7927788916b282509d19425ef1d6d99", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-22T03:30:08.147869", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Melissa Ann Flores, Jean McClelland"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "This scoping review is exploratory.

There is no age restriction for this study. Indeed, there may be studies where a diverse sample of individuals are included in a study (e.g. non-Hispanic Blacks/African Americans and other non-Hispanics groups, etc.) in addition to Hispanics. These studies will only be included if the effects within Hispanics are described separately from aggregate samples. \n\nRELEVANT PARTICIPANT CORRELATES\nThis scoping review will extract and incorporate if the following are reported:\n\u2022\tNativity\n\u2022\tAcculturation\n\u2022\tGender\n\u2022\tEducation\n\u2022\tIncome\n\u2022\tSES\n\u2022\tInsurance status\n\u2022\tUrban vs rural\n\u2022\tComorbidities\n\nTYPES OF OUTCOME MEASURES\nStudies will be included if the primary outcome is cardiometabolic disease incidence, management, or progression and a social environmental factor as defined above is included as a predictor. Cardiometabolic diseases include atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance or sensitivity, glucose control or management (HbA1c), diabetes (Type 2), obesity/overweight, and metabolic syndrome and its indicators (high blood pressure/hypertension, high blood sugar/glucose, high visceral fat/abdominal fat, waist-hip ration, low HDL cholesterol, high triglycerides, and insulin resistance), and fatty liver disease.  \n\nDATA COLLECTION, ANALYSIS AND RISK OF BIAS\nTwo researchers will independently assess quality of identified manuscripts. When disagreements arise regarding selection of papers for inclusion, an additional review author will be consulted for discussion. If data appears to be missing or in need of clarification, authors of identified manuscripts will be contacted. \n\nOnce the appropriate manuscripts are chosen and verified by both researchers, a narrative synthesis of this literature will be used to discuss how protective family and social dynamics, or interpersonal social capital is related to incidence, management and progression of cardiometabolic disease in Hispanics/Latinxs. A developmental approach (beginning with a synthesis of literature on young children to literature involving older adults) will be used to structure this scoping review. \n\nINCLUSION CRITERIA\n\u2022\tUS dwelling individuals with a self-reported ethnicity of Hispanic, Latino, Latina, Chicano, Chicana, Latinx, Chicanx (any race) at risk for or with cardiometabolic disease\n\u2022\tAny age\n\u2022\tAny studies that use quantitative methods to measure social environments (as defined above)\n", "q6.uploader": [], "q10.question": "SEARCHES\nSearches will included studies that were published in English only. The search will be carried out using six online databases: MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and PsycINFO.
