We will only consider the results from the first randomization period when with a crossover design. Quasi-randomized trials (e.g., sequence\u00a0based\u00a0on\u00a0date\u00a0or\u00a0day\u00a0of\u00a0admission) will be excluded. \nTypes of participants\nWe will include postmenopausal women, excluding those with surgically induced menopause. Trials where both naturally menopausal and surgically menopausal will be eligible for inclusion, if data on the naturally menopausal can be extracted separately, or obtained from trial authors. Postmenopausal women are characterized as menstrual cessation for at least 12 months prior to intervention. They can have dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome, or not. Participants taking hormones or lipid-lowering agents will be excluded.\nTypes of interventions\nRCTs comparing the effects of genistein with placebo will be included. Genistein is administered as an isolated active treatment, and not a composition of treatment (such as a soy diet, isoflavone mixtures) or a combination of treatment (such as genistein and probiotics). The comparison can only be inactive placebo. Supplement of the same dose of calcium and vitamin D, and equivalent exercises in both groups, will be allowed. Hormone replacement therapy is administered in neither group. \nTypes of outcome measures\n1.The primary outcomes\n  The primary outcome for lipid metabolism will be mean overall changed value of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from baseline to the end-point, and for glucose metabolism will be mean overall changed value of homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) from baseline to the end-point. HOMA-IR=fasting insulin (\u00b5IU/mL)*fating blood glucose (mg/dl)/22.5. \n2.The secondary outcomes\u3000\nThe secondary outcomes will be mean overall changed value of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting blood insulin (INS) and body mass index (BMI) from baseline to the end-point.\n\nSearch strategy\nAll published, unpublished, and ongoing randomized controlled trials that comparing genistein with placebo in the treatment of postmenopausal women will be included. We will identify relevant trials from systematic searches in the following electronic databases; PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. We will also hand-search reference lists of trials identified in the initial searches and relevant review papers. The search deadline will be from inception to March 2020. There will be no restrictions on language, publication year, or publication type. The following keywords will be used: menopaus*, postmenopaus*, climacteric, genistein. In addition, all relevant authors will be contacted to supplement incomplete information.\n\nStudy selection and data extraction\nSelection of trials\nTitles and abstracts identified from the search strategies will be independently examined by two reviewers (XYY and YW). If both reviewers judge that the trial does not meet eligibility criteria, we will exclude it. Then, we will obtain the full-texts of all remaining articles and determine whether to include them by the same eligibility criteria. Any disagreements were resolved by a third review author (ZHW). Besides, the references of relevant reviews and included trials will also be checked by XYY and YW. The reasons for exclusion of trials will be reported in the characteristics of excluded studies tables.\nQuality assessment\nThe methodological quality of the included studies will be independently assessed by two reviewers (XYY and YW). We will assess risk of bias as \u201clow risk\u201d, \u201cunclear risk\u201d, or \u201chigh risk\u201d, in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration\u2019s \u2018Risk of bias\u2019 tool as described in the Cochrane Hand book for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Any disagreements were resolved by a third review author (ZHW).\nData extraction\nTwo independent reviewers (XYY and YW) will extract the data from the original reports using standardized data extraction forms, including of study characteristics (such as first listed author, publication year, journal, country, and institution), patient characteristics (such as the number of patients, and patients\u2019 baseline), intervention details (such as the duration and dosage of treatment) and outcome measures. Any disagreements will be resolved by a third review author (ZHW).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3 software (Cochrane Information Management System). Efficacy was evaluated by change values from baseline to end point data on each outcomes in this meta-analysis. When standard error (SD) was missing in an article and could not contact the authors, it would be calculated from reported P values, t values, confidence intervals (CIs) or standard errors (SEs). A random-effects model was applied in this meta-analysis in order to get relatively robust results. Standardized mean differences (SMD) in continuous measure, as well as 95% CIs, were estimated by inverse variance models. Heterogeneity was evaluated with the test of inconsistency. It represented large, moderate and small heterogeneity when I2 statistic was higher than 75%, 50% and 25%, respectively. And we used subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses to find possible sources of the heterogeneity. The publication bias was assessed by Egger tests (Stata 13.0, Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA). A two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant if not specifically stated. \nSubgroup analysis\nWhere possible, the following subgroups analysis will be performed: (i) for the BMI of participants (e.g. BMI\u226730 vs. &lt;30); (ii) for the dosage of genistein (e.g. dosage&lt;54mg/d vs. \u226754mg/d); (iii) for the duration of genistein (e.g. duration\u22661 year vs. &gt;1 year); (iv) for diet (e.g. restricted or not); (v) physical condition (e.g. healthy vs. metabolic diseases); (vi) for enrollment sites (e.g. single centre vs. multi-centres).\nSensitivity analyses\nThe following sensitivity analyses will be performed: (i) by excluding studies with unpublished literature; (ii) by excluding studies with small sample sized trials (sample size&lt;50); and (iii) by excluding studies with high bias based on \u2018Risk of Bias\u2019 assessment."}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "METHODS.docx"}, "nodeId": "6k2ad", "sha256": "f30c0d1076d922a8b96de093dfd3664403d98cbf359e490d4960fdca04d79f59", "viewUrl": "/project/9tafy/files/osfstorage/5e624664a0964501e5052852/", "selectedFileName": "METHODS.docx"}], "value": ""}}}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q10": {"extra": [], "value": "Registration prior to accessing the data"}, "q11": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q12": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "All published, unpublished, and ongoing randomized controlled trials that comparing genistein with placebo in the treatment of postmenopausal women will be included.

The next page will contain the questionnaires themselves. The participant will be given their role. There will be a second section where participants will be asked to fill out an additional questionnaire to measure whether sense of power is felt. Similar to P.K Smith et al.\u2019s 2008 paper, this will consist of 20 of 9-point scales with a trait on each side. The trait pairs will include 7 designated to indicate a sense of power, as well as 13 unrelated filler pairs to throw off suspicion and check that participants are paying attention. After this manipulation check, both groups will be asked to estimate the time needed to accomplish a task. The task is a writing assignment for a social media posting. The experiment will be conducted in two runs. As the survey will be made available on a public forum, it is not expected the first group will have any difference to the second which should affect the answers provided. The first run will only allow participants into the control group. Control group members will be given a modified version of the writing task to complete, and informed that writing this will enable them to potentially receive a bonus. After all control responses have been collected, the next group surveyed will be the powerful group. Powerful group participants will be asked to assess results from members of the control group. Members of this second group will be given up to $1 USD to allocate as a bonus to the control group participant whose submitted work they are evaluating. They will be assured that the scores will be kept anonymous. Finally, both groups will be asked for demographic data. The final section contains control variables to test that for example, age and gender are not affecting the outcomes. They will appear as: Gender: Male/Female/Other/Prefer not to say, Age, and experience as a supervisor. After completing the survey, the participant will enter a code provided to them into the Mechanical Turk site. After the survey is reviewed, all participants will be compensated for the work completed ($1, which amounts to .90 Euros based on conversion rate on the 4th of March 2020)  as well as any additional bonus which has been awarded to them.

Control and Powerful participants will be paired up and given access to one survey form on Unipark. Access will first be granted to control members, and then powerful members. Their data will be separated for analysis. On the first page of the experiment there will be a release form explaining that they consent to take part in an experiment focused on \u201csocialization patterns\u201d and that they understand they may remain anonymous. The next page will contain the questionnaires themselves. The participant will be given their role. There will be a second section where participants will be asked to fill out an additional questionnaire to measure whether sense of power is felt. Similar to P.K Smith et al.\u2019s 2008 paper, this will consist of 20 of 9-point scales with a trait on each side. The trait pairs will include 7 designated to indicate a sense of power, as well as 13 unrelated filler pairs to throw off suspicion and check that participants are paying attention. After this manipulation check, both groups will be asked to estimate the time needed to accomplish a task. The task is a writing assignment for a social media posting. The experiment will be conducted in two runs. As the survey will be made available on a public forum, it is not expected the first group will have any difference to the second which should affect the answers provided. The first run will only allow participants into the control group. Control group members will be given a modified version of the writing task to complete, and informed that writing this will enable them to potentially receive a bonus. After all control responses have been collected, the next group surveyed will be the powerful group. Powerful group participants will be asked to assess results from members of the control group. Members of this second group will be given up to $1 USD to allocate as a bonus to the control group participant whose submitted work they are evaluating. They will be assured that the scores will be kept anonymous. Finally, both groups will be asked for demographic data. The final section contains control variables to test that for example, age and gender are not affecting the outcomes. They will appear as: Gender: Male/Female/Other/Prefer not to say, Age, and experience as a supervisor. After completing the survey, the participant will enter a code provided to them into the Mechanical Turk site.

Hence, RTR captures the extent to which relevant linguistic information of a text controls its perceptual-cognitive processing during reading.

As a first step, a reader has to identify the basic units of a text, namely its words, and then words must be integrated into a coherent structure. To achieve this, a text can be divided into different levels of informational structure, which in turn require different processing  mechanisms. As reading progresses, simply adding up propositions of successive sentences would depict the micro level, whereas only propositions of more global relevance are thought to build the macro level of a text. Moreover, information is combined with a reader's world knowledge, leading to inferences that might exceed the literal meaning of a text (Kintsch &amp; van Dijk, 1978, O\u2019Brien &amp; Cook, 2015, Verhoeven &amp; Perfetti, 2008). \nThe aim of the current study is to test whether or how these three different levels (micro structure, macro structure, inferences) contribute to text comprehension.\nFor this purpose, three short stories of comparable length and linguistic characteristics were selected. For each of the three stories a total of 16 w-questions and 60 yes/no-statements were constructed with each 10 w-questions and 40 statements referring to micro level information, while the remaining items are based on inferences. Subjects are asked to freely answer the w-questions and to judge the statements as right or wrong. Since the macro level only contains the weighed propositions (i.e., the main contents) of a text, participants were also instructed to write short summaries.

As a first step, a reader has to identify the basic units of a text, namely its words, and then words must be integrated into a coherent structure. To achieve this, a text can be divided into different levels of informational structure, which in turn require different processing  mechanisms. As reading progresses, simply adding up propositions of successive sentences would depict the micro level, whereas only propositions of more global relevance are thought to build the macro level of a text. Moreover, information is combined with a reader's world knowledge, leading to inferences that might exceed the literal meaning of a text (Kintsch &amp; van Dijk, 1978, O\u2019Brien &amp; Cook, 2015, Verhoeven &amp; Perfetti, 2008). \nThe aim of the current study is to test whether or how these three different levels (micro structure, macro structure, inferences) contribute to text comprehension.\nFor this purpose, three short stories of comparable length and linguistic characteristics were selected. For each of the three stories a total of 16 w-questions and 60 yes/no-statements were constructed with each 10 w-questions and 40 statements referring to micro level information, while the remaining items are based on inferences. Subjects are asked to freely answer the w-questions and to judge the statements as right or wrong. Since the macro level only contains the weighed propositions (i.e., the main contents) of a text, participants were also instructed to write short summaries. The study is implemented as an online survey, and each participant is randomly assigned a text. Different texts were used in order to ensure a minimum of generalisation of the results across, at least, a certain range of texts.", "q4": "By means of confirmatory factor analysis, different models of text comprehension will be modelled and compared.
