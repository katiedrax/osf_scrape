primary elections in new democracies. Building on some very recent agenda-setting work that examines how political elites use endorsements to shape electoral processes in new democracies (Arriola, 2012; Baldwin, 2013; Arriola, Choi and Gichohi, 2016), I examine whether party leaders are able to use endorsements to inform voters about their preferences over candidates to sway primary voters to choose their allies and do away with their foes (Cohen et al., 2009). This question is important because many parties in African democracies are moving towards open modes of candidate selection such as primary elections. In principle, the introduction of primary politics implies that party leaders must cede partial control over party nominations to the grassroots. This may pose a serious dilemma for party leaders, since it compromises their ability to reward or sanction the behavior of the party elites in elected office, which is vital for maintaining their position at the helm of the party machine. However, if the endorsement of party leaders can induce primary voters follow their lead and choose aspirants party leaders favor to become the party\u2019s candidate, party leaders are essentially retaining their grip over a process crucial for the control over party elites and the party organization itself."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "The following are the main hypotheses to be tested in the two survey experiments Hypothesis 1 (Endorsement): Primary voters will be more likely to support a primary candidate endorsed by a party leader.

Hypothesis 3A: Primary voters will be no more likely to support a high performance candidate denounced by a party leader in comparison to a low performance candidate with no endorsement/denouncement. Hypothesis 3B: Primary voters will be no more likely to support a high performance candidate with no endorsement/denouncement in comparison to a low performance candidate with a party leader endorsement."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "In order to establish the causal effect of leader endorsements on primary vote choice, I employ a set of survey experiments among likely primary voters in constituencies across two counties in Kenya. For the first experiment, I use conjoint analysis (Hainmueller, Hopkins and Yamamoto, 2013), where respondents are asked to choose between the profiles of two hypothetical candidates competing in the party primaries that differ in terms of various attributes, including an attribute that indicates whether or not the candidate in question received the endorsement of the party leader of the respondent.

Building on some very recent agenda-setting work that examines how political elites use endorsements to shape electoral processes in new democracies (Arriola, 2012; Baldwin, 2013; Arriola, Choi and Gichohi, 2016), I examine whether party leaders are able to use endorsements to inform voters about their preferences over candidates to sway primary voters to choose their allies and do away with their foes (Cohen et al., 2009). This question is important because many parties in African democracies are moving towards open modes of candidate selection such as primary elections. In principle, the introduction of primary politics implies that party leaders must cede partial control over party nominations to the grassroots. This may pose a serious dilemma for party leaders, since it compromises their ability to reward or sanction the behavior of the party elites in elected office, which is vital for maintaining their position at the helm of the party machine. However, if the endorsement of party leaders can induce primary voters follow their lead and choose aspirants party leaders favor to become the party\u2019s candidate, party leaders are essentially retaining their grip over a process crucial for the control over party elites and the party organization itself.", "q16": "The following are the main hypotheses to be tested in the two survey experiments Hypothesis 1 (Endorsement): Primary voters will be more likely to support a primary candidate endorsed by a party leader. Hypothesis 2 (Denouncement): Primary voters will be less likely to support a primary candidate denounced by a party leader. Hypothesis 3A: Primary voters will be no more likely to support a high performance candidate denounced by a party leader in comparison to a low performance candidate with no endorsement/denouncement. Hypothesis 3B: Primary voters will be no more likely to support a high performance candidate with no endorsement/denouncement in comparison to a low performance candidate with a party leader endorsement.", "q17": "In order to establish the causal effect of leader endorsements on primary vote choice, I employ a set of survey experiments among likely primary voters in constituencies across two counties in Kenya.

Our first set of hypotheses concern the presence of motivated reasoning and how it depends on poll quality. First, we expect to find evidence that motivated reasoning operates when respondents simultaneously encounter conflicting poll results (H1). We plan to test this by looking at differences in the perceptions of polls in condition C1 by partisanship (See Table 1). Next, we expect that partisans will differ from one another in the credibility that they associate with polls that have consistent results (H2; C2 and C3 by partisanship). These same conditions will allow us to answer our first research question: Do people recognize methodological quality differences between polls with consistent results? (RQ1; C2 and C3). When polls are inconsistent, however, we expect that individuals will be responsive to methodological quality (H3; C4 and C5). Whether variations in methodological quality will enhance or mitigate motivational biases in conflicting polls is a key question (RQ2; C4 and C5 by partisanship vs C1 by partisanship). Compared to conditions where poll results are consistent, we expect that inconsistent results will trigger stronger methods-based assessments (H4; C4 and C5 by partisanship vs C2 and C3 by partisanship). Our second set of hypotheses concern how commentary on polls might further moderate poll evaluations. Because out-partisans can latch onto expert critiques to dismiss disliked results, we expect that expert commentary will enhance motivated reasoning for polls with consistent findings (H5; C6 and C7 by partisanship vs C2 and C3 by partisanship). In contrast, we expect that expert commentary will reduce motivational biases where polls\u2019 results are inconsistent, because they will serve as an informational corrective (H6; C8 and C9 by partisanship vs C4 and C5 by partisanship). Partisan commentary, on the other hand, should enhance motivated reasoning (H7; C10 and C11 by partisanship vs C1). Finally, we included an additional condition in which an expert critiques conflicting polls both of which are high quality. In this condition, we expect the effects of motivational biases will be stronger than in a condition without expert commentary (H8; C12 vs C1). This final condition is also important for ecological validity reasons as the entire polling industry has increasingly come under fire. Across all of the conditions, we expect to replicate the earlier studies\u2019 findings that more politically aware respondents will be the most susceptible to motivational biases; we plan to use education and party strength to test this.

This experiment tests how different variations of text messages sent to registered voters encouraging voting can increase voter turnout in the 2018 midterm elections. Despite widespread use, SMS messages have received little scholarly attention as a medium for campaign communication (Dale and Strauss 2009; Malhotra et al 2011; Bhatti et al 2017b). This experiment is part of a series of experiments in the 2018 general election to build on this prior research. This experiment focuses on encouraging the return of mail ballots in states where all registered voters are sent a ballot by mail. The experiment does not include states where voters must request a ballot for a particular election or election year and in states where voters may \u201cpermanently\u201d request a mail ballot for every election, as these states are addressed in a separate experiment. Encouraging the return of ballots mailed to registered voters is a different behavioral challenge than moving registered voters from the couch to the polling place. These voters face potentially less opportunity cost to complete a ballot (at home, anytime) and return it (any mail box or ballot drop box, anytime over a period of weeks). This experiment explores whether SMS messages can successfully increase the return of valid ballots. The experiment compares three treatments and a uncontacted control group. The Information treatment relies on positive descriptive norms, civic duty and information about voting to increase turnout. These tactics are very common in voter mobilization and have been successful in past randomized controlled tests (see Green and Gerber 2015 for review). For the Adopt-a-voter treatment, the first message for each method of voting encouraged recipient to get friends and family members to vote (EIPV+EDay series got the Adopt-a-voter message twice). The Adopt-a-Voter treatment was based on leveraging the social rewards from voting (e.g. Sinclair 2012). Delivering similar Adopt-a-Voter treatments by mail has successfully increased in-person voter turnout (e.g. Mann & Klofstad 2011). This treatment generated significant increases in turnout in a prior experiment in 2017. For the Calendar treatment, the second message for each method of voting includes an option to create a reminder to vote in the recipient\u2019s smartphone calendar.

This experiment tests how different variations of text messages sent to registered voters encouraging voting can increase voter turnout in the 2018 midterm elections. Despite widespread use, SMS messages have received little scholarly attention as a medium for campaign communication (Dale and Strauss 2009; Malhotra et al 2011; Bhatti et al 2017b). This experiment is part of a series of experiments in the 2018 general election to build on this prior research. This experiment focuses on encouraging the return of mail ballots in states where all registered voters are sent a ballot by mail. The experiment does not include states where voters must request a ballot for a particular election or election year and in states where voters may \u201cpermanently\u201d request a mail ballot for every election, as these states are addressed in a separate experiment. Encouraging the return of ballots mailed to registered voters is a different behavioral challenge than moving registered voters from the couch to the polling place. These voters face potentially less opportunity cost to complete a ballot (at home, anytime) and return it (any mail box or ballot drop box, anytime over a period of weeks). This experiment explores whether SMS messages can successfully increase the return of valid ballots. The experiment compares three treatments and a uncontacted control group. The Information treatment relies on positive descriptive norms, civic duty and information about voting to increase turnout. These tactics are very common in voter mobilization and have been successful in past randomized controlled tests (see Green and Gerber 2015 for review). For the Adopt-a-voter treatment, the first message for each method of voting encouraged recipient to get friends and family members to vote (EIPV+EDay series got the Adopt-a-voter message twice). The Adopt-a-Voter treatment was based on leveraging the social rewards from voting (e.g. Sinclair 2012). Delivering similar Adopt-a-Voter treatments by mail has successfully increased in-person voter turnout (e.g. Mann & Klofstad 2011). This treatment generated significant increases in turnout in a prior experiment in 2017. For the Calendar treatment, the second message for each method of voting includes an option to create a reminder to vote in the recipient\u2019s smartphone calendar. The Calendar treatment was based on the \u201cplan-making\u201d mechanism originally investigated as a voter mobilization strategy by Nickerson and Rogers (2010) and now used in an array of voter mobilization experiments that have increased turnout (see Green and Gerber 2015).

{"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q15": {"extra": [], "value": "The current Presidential election cycle has generated a great deal of attention for scholarship on the political psychology of voting behavior. While high emotions during campaigns are nothing new, pundits and scholars are now regularly claiming this cycle sets a high water mark for the use and impact of emotional political rhetoric. This project will empirically evaluate the role of emotion in the current political moment. We propose a simple experimental test of competing hypothesis about the power of fear vs anger in driving subsets of voters toward populist, nationalist candidacies like Donald Trump\u2019s. Contrary to much conventional wisdom, we have pilot data demonstrating that Trump\u2019s support does not derive from anxiety among authoritarians, ethnocentrists or sexists. In fact, when these citizens experience fear, their support for Trump declines precipitously. Anger, on the other hand, seems to powerfully galvanize support for Trump (but not other Republican candidates), especially among those who score highly on measures of ethnocentrism and sexism (results for authoritarians were not significant, given the small portion of authoritarians in the sample). One of the more common narratives in the current political blogosphere involves the fear messages used in this election: The surprisingly successful campaign to date of non-establishment candidate Donald Trump is due to his ability to capitalize on authoritarian, ethnocentric or sexist fears about \u201cothers\u201d: immigrants, Muslims, women, other minorities, etc. Where do these fears come from? Perhaps they are rooted in economic insecurity and the shifting demographic and social structure in America. Authoritarian populists like Trump, therefore, are simply preying on the economic insecurity of many working and lower middle class white voters (Stenner 2005; Hetherington and Weiler 2009). By scapegoating minorities, then, fear can drive up support for these leaders. In sum, according to this view, support for candidates like Trump in the U.S. and other candidates of the far right in Europe is grounded mostly in anxiety about outgroups, and will therefore be maximized when fear is triggered among those with the most negative outgroup attitudes. However, two related arguments in the literature on the politics of emotion strongly contradict these predictions, and lead us to suggest fear will not be a powerful driver of support for right wing populists like Trump. First, according to cognitive appraisal theories of emotion, fear results when threats are appraised as powerful and uncontrollable (Frijda 1986; Roseman 1984; Lazarus 1991; Scherer 1999). The experience of fear should lead people to withdraw from the situation and carefully consider how they might cope with the threat. Affective Intelligence Theory (Marcus, Neuman & McKuen 2000) makes a similar prediction about anxiety: It should orient the brain to new information regarding the threat and away from habitual views, such as predispositions toward out-groups. Second, some evidence suggests that specific emotions and particular group attitudes can become linked as a result of socialization processes, and in the U.S. the strongest emotional substrate for racial attitudes is anger, not fear (Banks & Valentino 2012; Banks 2014). Fearmongering, we therefore predict, is not likely to galvanize support for candidates among those high in ethnocentrism, authoritarianism or sexism. Anger, on the other hand, should galvanize voters with strong predispositions toward the parties and these groups: It should boost support for Trump among strong Republicans and those scoring high on authoritarianism, ethnocentrism and sexism. Our research is thus an attempt to adjudicate between these two competing causal stories \u2013 are Trump voters driven primarily by fear, anger, or is the emotional content of his message irrelevant to his success?"}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: Authoritarians in the anger condition are more likely to support Trump than those in the fear or control conditions.

While high emotions during campaigns are nothing new, pundits and scholars are now regularly claiming this cycle sets a high water mark for the use and impact of emotional political rhetoric. This project will empirically evaluate the role of emotion in the current political moment. We propose a simple experimental test of competing hypothesis about the power of fear vs anger in driving subsets of voters toward populist, nationalist candidacies like Donald Trump\u2019s. Contrary to much conventional wisdom, we have pilot data demonstrating that Trump\u2019s support does not derive from anxiety among authoritarians, ethnocentrists or sexists. In fact, when these citizens experience fear, their support for Trump declines precipitously. Anger, on the other hand, seems to powerfully galvanize support for Trump (but not other Republican candidates), especially among those who score highly on measures of ethnocentrism and sexism (results for authoritarians were not significant, given the small portion of authoritarians in the sample). One of the more common narratives in the current political blogosphere involves the fear messages used in this election: The surprisingly successful campaign to date of non-establishment candidate Donald Trump is due to his ability to capitalize on authoritarian, ethnocentric or sexist fears about \u201cothers\u201d: immigrants, Muslims, women, other minorities, etc. Where do these fears come from? Perhaps they are rooted in economic insecurity and the shifting demographic and social structure in America. Authoritarian populists like Trump, therefore, are simply preying on the economic insecurity of many working and lower middle class white voters (Stenner 2005; Hetherington and Weiler 2009). By scapegoating minorities, then, fear can drive up support for these leaders. In sum, according to this view, support for candidates like Trump in the U.S. and other candidates of the far right in Europe is grounded mostly in anxiety about outgroups, and will therefore be maximized when fear is triggered among those with the most negative outgroup attitudes. However, two related arguments in the literature on the politics of emotion strongly contradict these predictions, and lead us to suggest fear will not be a powerful driver of support for right wing populists like Trump. First, according to cognitive appraisal theories of emotion, fear results when threats are appraised as powerful and uncontrollable (Frijda 1986; Roseman 1984; Lazarus 1991; Scherer 1999). The experience of fear should lead people to withdraw from the situation and carefully consider how they might cope with the threat. Affective Intelligence Theory (Marcus, Neuman & McKuen 2000) makes a similar prediction about anxiety: It should orient the brain to new information regarding the threat and away from habitual views, such as predispositions toward out-groups. Second, some evidence suggests that specific emotions and particular group attitudes can become linked as a result of socialization processes, and in the U.S. the strongest emotional substrate for racial attitudes is anger, not fear (Banks & Valentino 2012; Banks 2014). Fearmongering, we therefore predict, is not likely to galvanize support for candidates among those high in ethnocentrism, authoritarianism or sexism. Anger, on the other hand, should galvanize voters with strong predispositions toward the parties and these groups: It should boost support for Trump among strong Republicans and those scoring high on authoritarianism, ethnocentrism and sexism. Our research is thus an attempt to adjudicate between these two competing causal stories \u2013 are Trump voters driven primarily by fear, anger, or is the emotional content of his message irrelevant to his success?", "q16": "H1: Authoritarians in the anger condition are more likely to support Trump than those in the fear or control conditions.

Yet, when citizens are evaluating officials' behavior and the welfare benefits of government spending from different sources, their willingness to sanction and monitor may be driven by more than just a psychological aversion to loss and a desire to recover their taxed private revenue in the form of public goods provision. Revenues may differ not only in where they come from but also in how they are tracked, distributed, and managed. Existing studies have, in general, paid little attention to these institutional differences, or attempted to distinguish between effects driven by such differences and those driven by psychological mechanisms such as the endowment effect. To remedy this, we propose a lab-in-the-field experiment that varies both the source of revenue from which spending is financed. The experiment will follow the Maritn (2014) design, in which the author utilized laboratory experiments in Uganda to measure the existence of a loss aversion mechanism after citizens pay taxes. We build on Martin's work by adopting the basic framework of the tax and grant game, adding several additional treatments designed to test psychological and institutional mechanisms that may be in operation alongside or, perhaps, in lieu of the endowment effect."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Game Outcomes. Following Martin, our key outcome of interest is the smallest transfer made by the Leader at which the Citizen will not punish the leader. For the collective action condition, we measure two additional outcomes. The first is the proportion of the time that the leader transfers such that one citizen chooses to punish and the other does not, which results in no punishment of the leader. The second is the subject's response to a survey item asked directly after each round of play in the collective action game that asks the subject to guess the transfer threshold of the citizen with which he has been paired. Debrief Questions. In addition to the game, subjects are administered a short survey after the completion of the 5 rounds. Included in this questionnaire is an open-ended debrief question that is hand-written and an additional close-ended question that asks the degree to which the respondent agrees several statements about motivations for playing the game. Subjects received slightly different version of the close-ended question depending on whether they were citizens or leaders. Leaders were asked how important each of the following were in determining how they set transfers to the Citizen: 1. Whether the money was split fairly 2. Whether the citizen(s) had enough money 3. How much money [the Leader] was earning 4. Whether or not [the Leader] would get punished 5. Whether payouts were equal Citizens got a similar battery with one exception: certain items were contingent on the treatment condition. These items were as follows: 1. Whether the group fund was split fairly 2. Whether the leader passed back enough money for me and my community 3. Whether payouts were equal 4. How much money I was earning 5. Getting back some of the money I'd lost in taxes (\\textit{Tax Source}) 6. Whether the other citizen would punish the leader (\\textit{Collective Action}) 7. Whether or not the punishment would be successful (\\textit{Punishment Probability}) 8. Whether I would lose money in punishment 9. Whether the Leader had enough remaining for his responsibilities Citizens also received one additional question that read as follows: ``Do you agree or disagree with the following statement. As a citizen, the group fund of [TREATMENT SOURCE] belonged to me.'' This item will be used to measure the ability of the valence treatment to induce the ownership effect described above, particularly for the oil source condition. The measurement for those who do not receive the valence treatment (i.e., who receive only the source) will be used a measure of the baseline degree of ownership felt over the source. We also expect that, averaging across conditions, ownership will be higher for Citizens in the Tax treatment, relative to non-tax sources. Manipulation Check. Subjects also received a manipulation check that asked them the source from which the group fund in the game was derived. Enumerators were instructed not to read any of the answer options and to select the source reported by the subject. Answers were then coded as correct or incorrect ex post. The additional items present in the debrief list for Collective Action and Punishment Probability were also intended as manipulation checks to ensure that subjects are responding to the variations in these treatments that differentiate them from the base game with certain punishment.

Yet, when citizens are evaluating officials' behavior and the welfare benefits of government spending from different sources, their willingness to sanction and monitor may be driven by more than just a psychological aversion to loss and a desire to recover their taxed private revenue in the form of public goods provision. Revenues may differ not only in where they come from but also in how they are tracked, distributed, and managed. Existing studies have, in general, paid little attention to these institutional differences, or attempted to distinguish between effects driven by such differences and those driven by psychological mechanisms such as the endowment effect. To remedy this, we propose a lab-in-the-field experiment that varies both the source of revenue from which spending is financed. The experiment will follow the Maritn (2014) design, in which the author utilized laboratory experiments in Uganda to measure the existence of a loss aversion mechanism after citizens pay taxes. We build on Martin's work by adopting the basic framework of the tax and grant game, adding several additional treatments designed to test psychological and institutional mechanisms that may be in operation alongside or, perhaps, in lieu of the endowment effect.", "q16": "Game Outcomes. Following Martin, our key outcome of interest is the smallest transfer made by the Leader at which the Citizen will not punish the leader. For the collective action condition, we measure two additional outcomes. The first is the proportion of the time that the leader transfers such that one citizen chooses to punish and the other does not, which results in no punishment of the leader. The second is the subject's response to a survey item asked directly after each round of play in the collective action game that asks the subject to guess the transfer threshold of the citizen with which he has been paired. Debrief Questions. In addition to the game, subjects are administered a short survey after the completion of the 5 rounds. Included in this questionnaire is an open-ended debrief question that is hand-written and an additional close-ended question that asks the degree to which the respondent agrees several statements about motivations for playing the game. Subjects received slightly different version of the close-ended question depending on whether they were citizens or leaders. Leaders were asked how important each of the following were in determining how they set transfers to the Citizen: 1. Whether the money was split fairly 2. Whether the citizen(s) had enough money 3. How much money [the Leader] was earning 4. Whether or not [the Leader] would get punished 5. Whether payouts were equal Citizens got a similar battery with one exception: certain items were contingent on the treatment condition. These items were as follows: 1. Whether the group fund was split fairly 2. Whether the leader passed back enough money for me and my community 3. Whether payouts were equal 4. How much money I was earning 5. Getting back some of the money I'd lost in taxes (\\textit{Tax Source}) 6. Whether the other citizen would punish the leader (\\textit{Collective Action}) 7. Whether or not the punishment would be successful (\\textit{Punishment Probability}) 8. Whether I would lose money in punishment 9. Whether the Leader had enough remaining for his responsibilities Citizens also received one additional question that read as follows: ``Do you agree or disagree with the following statement. As a citizen, the group fund of [TREATMENT SOURCE] belonged to me.'' This item will be used to measure the ability of the valence treatment to induce the ownership effect described above, particularly for the oil source condition. The measurement for those who do not receive the valence treatment (i.e., who receive only the source) will be used a measure of the baseline degree of ownership felt over the source. We also expect that, averaging across conditions, ownership will be higher for Citizens in the Tax treatment, relative to non-tax sources. Manipulation Check. Subjects also received a manipulation check that asked them the source from which the group fund in the game was derived. Enumerators were instructed not to read any of the answer options and to select the source reported by the subject. Answers were then coded as correct or incorrect ex post. The additional items present in the debrief list for Collective Action and Punishment Probability were also intended as manipulation checks to ensure that subjects are responding to the variations in these treatments that differentiate them from the base game with certain punishment. Their primary purpose will be to make sure that a potential null result is not driven by poor comprehension. We will dichotomize the response scale, which ranges from ``Very Important'' to ``Not at all important'', to take one for the top two responses and zero otherwise.
