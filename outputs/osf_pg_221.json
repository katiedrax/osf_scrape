Because the reward manipulation is likely to simultaneously influence this choice, we will control for reward level in this analysis.

When a central trading partner raises barriers in the form of increased tolls and tariffs it will increase the perception of labor market vulnerability and economic risk. Subsequently, increased risk perception should fuel different demands for different types of social policy reforms. Labor market segmentation into formal and informal workers thereby moderates the impact of risk. Our analysis contains two steps: the impact of changing trade relationships on individual economic risk perception, and, subsequently, the effect of risk on social policy preferences. To investigate the first part of the argument, we use a vignette experiment that primes individuals about hazards of changes in current trade relationships between Mexico and the U.S.. Next, we analyze how risk perception influences social policy preferences and how far different redistribution coalitions arise. As workers embedded in notoriously permeable labor markets not only frequently switch the sector of employment, but also share households with a spouse who works e. g. in the informal sector, social policy preferences cannot be simply derived from income level. Using a conjoint experiment that models the trade-off between different social policies and different degrees of scope, level, and who pays for it, allows to study the effect of increased risk perception and employment sector on policy preferences in a more nuanced way. We study our argument with an experimental survey for the case of Mexico in 2018."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Prediction 1 Mexicans who worry about negative economic effects of U.S. trade policy are more likely to feel insecure about their own job situation.

When a central trading partner raises barriers in the form of increased tolls and tariffs it will increase the perception of labor market vulnerability and economic risk. Subsequently, increased risk perception should fuel different demands for different types of social policy reforms. Labor market segmentation into formal and informal workers thereby moderates the impact of risk. Our analysis contains two steps: the impact of changing trade relationships on individual economic risk perception, and, subsequently, the effect of risk on social policy preferences. To investigate the first part of the argument, we use a vignette experiment that primes individuals about hazards of changes in current trade relationships between Mexico and the U.S.. Next, we analyze how risk perception influences social policy preferences and how far different redistribution coalitions arise. As workers embedded in notoriously permeable labor markets not only frequently switch the sector of employment, but also share households with a spouse who works e. g. in the informal sector, social policy preferences cannot be simply derived from income level. Using a conjoint experiment that models the trade-off between different social policies and different degrees of scope, level, and who pays for it, allows to study the effect of increased risk perception and employment sector on policy preferences in a more nuanced way. We study our argument with an experimental survey for the case of Mexico in 2018.", "q16": "Prediction 1 Mexicans who worry about negative economic effects of U.S. trade policy are more likely to feel insecure about their own job situation. Prediction 1.a Mexican informal sector workers who worry about negative economic effects of U.S. trade policy are more likely to feel insecure about their own job situation compared to formal sector workers. Prediction 2 Formal sector workers who are more exposed to economic insecurities are more likely to support a contribution-based than a universal or means-tested social policy. Prediction 3 Informal sector workers who are more exposed to economic insecurities are more likely to support universal than contribution-based or means-tested social policy. Prediction 4 Mexicans who fear to be cut from remittances from relatives in the U.S. are more likely to support an increase in social policy. Prediction 5 Formal sector workers who were informally employed in the past years are more likely to support a universal than a contribution-based or means-tested social policy. Prediction 6 Formal sector workers who expect to lose the job/to work in the informal sector in the near future are more likely to support a universal than a contribution-based or means- tested social policy. Prediction 7 Informal sector workers are more likely to support an increase for a universal social policy if the form of financing is based on contributions from the government increasing taxes from people with higher incomes or based on workers with written contract and the government. Prediction 8 Formal sector workers are more likely to accept an increase of contribution-based social policy if the form of financing is on contributions from the government increasing taxes from people with higher incomes or with contributions from the government with increased taxes. Prediction 9 Formal sector workers who are more exposed to economic insecurities, and share a household with an informal sector worker, are more likely to support a contribution-based than a universal social policy. Prediction 10 Formal sector workers who are more exposed to economic insecurities and share a household with an informal sector worker are more likely to support a universal than contribution-based social policy. Prediction 11 Informal workers who are more exposed to economic insecurities are more likely to support an increase of social benefits for people in need. Prediction 12 Formal workers who are more exposed to economic insecurities are more likely to support a system of social justice in which only those individuals receive benefits who also contribute to it. Prediction 13 Mexicans who are more exposed to re-migration from Mexicans that are coming back from the U.S. are more likely to support an increase in level of [social policy] benefits.

Instead of a nationally representative survey, which would go beyond our funding capacities and due to difficulties to field the survey in geographic areas dominated by drug cartels, we aim at drawing a random sample of Mexicans in two average federal states, Puebla and Quer\u00e9taro. Thereby, we focus on selecting two states of Mexico with average values on trade and GDP per capita as this allows to reach the active working population without over- or underestimating a possible impact from changes in trade interdependencies.

Identify relevant studies; Study selection; Charting the data and Collating, summarizing and reporting the results.\n\nA comprehensive search in 10 databases was done from inception to Feb 2020.\nSnowball method was performed in reference lists, grey literature, and relevant journals.\nTwo independent reviewers examined all full articles for fit with the eligibility criteria.\nItems of data extraction included characteristics of articles, description of humanoid robot-assisted interventions and mechanism of the humanoid robot in improving diabetic children management.\n\nThe review process followed the Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR).", "uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=4esa2", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "4esa2", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "4esa2", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/wrg3j/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "wrg3j", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nxvju/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "nxvju", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/4esa2/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4esa2/"}}, {"id": "r4wbf", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Community\u2019s Syncretism on Sunan Kudus Teaching", "description": "Aldyan, R.

For those eligible and willing to participate, data will be collected the following week from Monday until Friday with 10 diaries. Each day will include two diaries (one afternoon, one evening). Participants will be emailed a link from Qualtrics to each diary when they return from work and prior to going to bed. Participants will have the opportunity to indicate their preferred time on the initial survey. For the initial survey, no reimbursement is given; for the diary studies, a total of up to $10 will be awarded in an electronic gift card (i.e. $1 for each completed diary). Data collection efforts will begin in mid-March and will continue until 100 participants have successfully completed the diary-portion of the study. We estimate all data collection efforts will be completed prior to summer 2020.\n\nParticipants will be eligible for participation if they are 18 years of age or older and are employed full-time. All participants must have access to the Internet in order to complete the daily diary surveys, and surveys will be hosted by Qualtrics. The daily diary surveys will be accessible by cell phone with Internet connectivity or computers with Internet connectivity. We aim to collect data from around 100 participants. This will account for any attrition or missed collection points. Participants will be recruited online via social media websites (e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook). Additionally, eligibility includes supplying useable data. We will assess usability by: removing cases due to careless responding, checking IP addresses, checking time to completion, non-sensical or inconsistent responses, and missed attention checks. By assessing data quality, we will also eliminate any potential \"bots\" in the data (i.e. non-human respondents). \n\nWorkaholism will be assessed with the Dutch Work Addiction Scale (DUWAS; Schaufeli, Shimazu, &amp; Taris, 2009). The short form of the DUWAS will be used in order to reduce the participant burden. The DUWAS contains two factors: working excessively and working compulsively. Example items include: \u201cI find myself continuing work after my co-workers have called it quits\u201d (working excessively) and \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to work hard even when I don\u2019t enjoy what I\u2019m doing\u201d (working compulsively). All scale items are answered on a Likert-type scale from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). Hypothesis testing will utilize the composite workaholism score in order to operationalize workaholism as a continuous variable, and exploratory analyses will examine the subscales and cutoff score.\n\nPsychological detachment will be used to assess one\u2019s ability to mentally disengage from work during time with family, and we will use of The Recovery Experience Questionnaire (REQ; Sonnentag &amp; Fritz, 2007) to measure psychological detachment. The REQ contains four items that address psychological detachment. An example item includes: \u201cI forget about work.\u201d All items are ranked on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (I do not agree at all) to 5 (I fully agree). The REQ shows good psychometric validity (Sonnentag &amp; Fritz, 2007).\n \nThe Work-Family Conflict Scale (Netemeyer, Boles, &amp; McMurrian, 1996) will be used to assess WFC. An example item includes: \u201cThe demands of my work interfere with my home and family life.\u201d The original scale contains five items that are ranked on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree); we will use a 5-point Likert-type scale in order to maintain consistency across scales in our survey. This study will also use a shortened, four item scale that is a better fit for the models and shows good psychometric validity (Boyar, Carson, Mosley Jr., Maertz Jr., &amp; Pearson, 2006). Deleting the original fourth item (\u201cMy job produces strain that makes it difficult to fulfill my family duties\u201d) has been shown to reduce error and explain more variance.\n\nThe survey will contain open ended responses for participants to indicate when they got home from work, if they intend to work any more that evening, and how many total hours they worked.\n\nFor the purposes of this study, all scale items will be altered so that participants can answer them in the context of the current workday and will be answered in the context of since their prior diary entry. For example, a questionnaire item may be prompted, \u201cSince you last responded to this diary\u201d and the question will be read as \u201cI found myself continuing work after my co-workers have called it quits.\u201d Additionally, all questions will be answered at each time points.

This allows us to measure workaholism as a continuous variable. Workaholism is defined as a feeling of needing to engage in work behaviors beyond what is necessary and thinking obsessively about work (Clark et al., 2016).\nMediators: Hours worked refers to the amount of hours each participant worked formally plus informally each day. Hours worked is assessed with open ended responses. Psychological detachment refers to ones ability to remove their mental thoughts from work and will be assessed with the REQ (Sonnentag &amp; Fritz, 2007).\nCriterion: Work-family conflict (WFC) refers to the strain experience when one's work role interferes with successful fulfillment of one's family role (Greenhaus &amp; Beutell, 1985) and will be measured with the Work-Family Conflict Scale by Netemeyer and colleagues (1996).\n\nExploratory analyses:\nOccupational role reward value refers to one's general beliefs regarding their job and will be assessed with the occupational role reward value subscale on the Life Role Salience Scale (LRSS; Amatea, Cross, Clark, &amp; Bobby, 1986).\nProblem-solving rumination, or pondering, refers to one's work-related rumination that is distinctly focused on how to address issues at work (Questret &amp; Cropley, 2012). Problem-solving rumination occurs after work when an individual continues to mentally engage in thoughts about solving problems in the work context. This will be measured with the Problem-Solving Rumination Subscale of the Work-Related Rumination Questionnaire (WRRQ; Cropley, Michialianou, Pravettoni, &amp; Millward, 2012).\nWe aim to measure psychological distress, meaning a negative emotional state. To measure psychological distress, we are using two sub scales of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS; Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995): Difficulty Relaxing and Impatient."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q19": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Prior to hypothesis testing, we will assess the reliability of our scales by assessing Cronbach\u2019s alpha(\u03b1) and Macdonald\u2019s omega total (\u03c9total) for each scale. Once sufficient reliability is established, we will conduct confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to address common method bias concerns and to check that each measured variable represents different constructs. Lastly, we will conduct analyses to ensure that any missing data are missing at random; any missing data should not be systematically related to high levels of workaholism or WFC so that we have equal representation of the range of each variable assessed. We expect to have some missing data and will not exclude cases based on missing diary entries. Only cases with fewer than three diary entries will be removed from subsequent data analyses. This is to ensure that each case has at least three diary entries so that we can establish the temporal precedence of our hypothesized causal relationships . Additionally, we will conduct analyses to assess for normality, outliers, and missing data, and we will analyze basic descriptive statistics and create visualizations of data distributions.\n\nOur data will consist of days (level 1) nested within persons (level 2). Person-data (e.g., gender, number of children, telecommuting, and job experience level) will be measured with the baseline survey and will be modeled at level 2. Day-level data (e.g., workaholism, WFC, work hours, psychological detachment) will be measured with the twice-daily diary entries and will be modeled at level 1. Due to the nested nature of diary study data, we will use hierarchical linear modeling to test our hypotheses. \n\nOur hypotheses do not suggest any time-related relationships (e.g. rates of workaholism are not expected to increase as the week progresses). Because of this, both within- and between-person models can be used to examine the hypotheses. Prior to assessing our hypotheses, we will first check to ensure that hierarchical linear modeling is appropriate for the data by calculating the within-individual and between-individual variance accounted for by our study variables. If a meaningful proportion of variance is accounted for by the within-persons variance, then we will proceed with within-person analyses. If a low proportion of the variance is accounted for by the within-persons variance, we will utilize between-person analyses. \n\nIdeally, we will assess our hypotheses using a within-person model. For this, hypothesis testing and exploratory analyses will primarily occur at level 1 (within-person), where i represents each data point per participant and j represents each participant, and all hypothesized level-1 variables will be group-mean centered (i.e. person-centered). Level-2 covariates (i.e. gender, number of children, telecommuting, and job experience level) will be measured during the baseline survey, represent between-person constructs, and will be grand-mean centered. Because we are assessing all day-level variables at both afternoon and evening time points, we are also able to include previous measurements of the hypothesized variables as level-1 covariates in the model.  In addition to the hypothesized models, an intercepts-only model (null model) will be tested. Hypothesis 1 tests the direct effect of our model: the relationship between workaholism on WFC. Hypotheses 2 and 3, the indirect effects of our model, assess the influence of our hypothesized mediators (i.e. hours worked and psychological detachment) on the relationship between workaholism and WFC. Once we have determined the direct and indirect effects, we will determine which mediator has a greater impact on the workaholism-WFC relationship. We will obtain 95% confidence intervals using bootstrapping procedures for 10,000 simulations. Analyses for hypothesis testing will be conducted in R using the lavaan package (Rosseel, 2019). \n\nIf our data does not support within-person model assessment, we will assess the hypotheses using between-person models. For this, we will use an aggregate value of the responses across all measurement time periods. The model testing will include the same three hypothesized models as listed above (just at the between-person level). All variables with a between-person model will be grand-mean centered.   \n\nWe carefully screen data from the baseline survey in order to maintain high data quality. Due to the high prevalence of bots (i.e. non-human respondents) and the likelihood of careless responding, we will adhering to strict data quality management.

The diaries will begin on the following Monday and end Friday. Each participant will respond to two diaries per day (afternoon and evening).

", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "This protocol has been approved by the Saint Louis University Institutional Review Board (IRB; Title: \"Working Behaviors and Family Life\"; Protocol ID: 30938).\n\nAs noted in the study design, the initial survey will assess eligibility and baseline scores. For those eligible and willing to participate, data will be collected the following week from Monday until Friday with 10 diaries. Each day will include two diaries (one afternoon, one evening). Participants will be emailed a link from Qualtrics to each diary when they return from work and prior to going to bed. Participants will have the opportunity to indicate their preferred time on the initial survey. For the initial survey, no reimbursement is given; for the diary studies, a total of up to $10 will be awarded in an electronic gift card (i.e. $1 for each completed diary). Data collection efforts will begin in mid-March and will continue until 100 participants have successfully completed the diary-portion of the study. We estimate all data collection efforts will be completed prior to summer 2020.\n\nParticipants will be eligible for participation if they are 18 years of age or older and are employed full-time. All participants must have access to the Internet in order to complete the daily diary surveys, and surveys will be hosted by Qualtrics. The daily diary surveys will be accessible by cell phone with Internet connectivity or computers with Internet connectivity. We aim to collect data from around 100 participants. This will account for any attrition or missed collection points. Participants will be recruited online via social media websites (e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook). Additionally, eligibility includes supplying useable data. We will assess usability by: removing cases due to careless responding, checking IP addresses, checking time to completion, non-sensical or inconsistent responses, and missed attention checks. By assessing data quality, we will also eliminate any potential \"bots\" in the data (i.e. non-human respondents). \n\nWorkaholism will be assessed with the Dutch Work Addiction Scale (DUWAS; Schaufeli, Shimazu, &amp; Taris, 2009). The short form of the DUWAS will be used in order to reduce the participant burden. The DUWAS contains two factors: working excessively and working compulsively. Example items include: \u201cI find myself continuing work after my co-workers have called it quits\u201d (working excessively) and \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to work hard even when I don\u2019t enjoy what I\u2019m doing\u201d (working compulsively). All scale items are answered on a Likert-type scale from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). Hypothesis testing will utilize the composite workaholism score in order to operationalize workaholism as a continuous variable, and exploratory analyses will examine the subscales and cutoff score.\n\nPsychological detachment will be used to assess one\u2019s ability to mentally disengage from work during time with family, and we will use of The Recovery Experience Questionnaire (REQ; Sonnentag &amp; Fritz, 2007) to measure psychological detachment. The REQ contains four items that address psychological detachment. An example item includes: \u201cI forget about work.\u201d All items are ranked on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (I do not agree at all) to 5 (I fully agree). The REQ shows good psychometric validity (Sonnentag &amp; Fritz, 2007).\n \nThe Work-Family Conflict Scale (Netemeyer, Boles, &amp; McMurrian, 1996) will be used to assess WFC. An example item includes: \u201cThe demands of my work interfere with my home and family life.\u201d The original scale contains five items that are ranked on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree); we will use a 5-point Likert-type scale in order to maintain consistency across scales in our survey. This study will also use a shortened, four item scale that is a better fit for the models and shows good psychometric validity (Boyar, Carson, Mosley Jr., Maertz Jr., &amp; Pearson, 2006). Deleting the original fourth item (\u201cMy job produces strain that makes it difficult to fulfill my family duties\u201d) has been shown to reduce error and explain more variance.\n\nThe survey will contain open ended responses for participants to indicate when they got home from work, if they intend to work any more that evening, and how many total hours they worked.\n\nFor the purposes of this study, all scale items will be altered so that participants can answer them in the context of the current workday and will be answered in the context of since their prior diary entry. For example, a questionnaire item may be prompted, \u201cSince you last responded to this diary\u201d and the question will be read as \u201cI found myself continuing work after my co-workers have called it quits.\u201d Additionally, all questions will be answered at each time points.

This allows us to measure workaholism as a continuous variable. Workaholism is defined as a feeling of needing to engage in work behaviors beyond what is necessary and thinking obsessively about work (Clark et al., 2016).\nMediators: Hours worked refers to the amount of hours each participant worked formally plus informally each day. Hours worked is assessed with open ended responses. Psychological detachment refers to ones ability to remove their mental thoughts from work and will be assessed with the REQ (Sonnentag &amp; Fritz, 2007).\nCriterion: Work-family conflict (WFC) refers to the strain experience when one's work role interferes with successful fulfillment of one's family role (Greenhaus &amp; Beutell, 1985) and will be measured with the Work-Family Conflict Scale by Netemeyer and colleagues (1996).\n\nExploratory analyses:\nOccupational role reward value refers to one's general beliefs regarding their job and will be assessed with the occupational role reward value subscale on the Life Role Salience Scale (LRSS; Amatea, Cross, Clark, &amp; Bobby, 1986).\nProblem-solving rumination, or pondering, refers to one's work-related rumination that is distinctly focused on how to address issues at work (Questret &amp; Cropley, 2012). Problem-solving rumination occurs after work when an individual continues to mentally engage in thoughts about solving problems in the work context. This will be measured with the Problem-Solving Rumination Subscale of the Work-Related Rumination Questionnaire (WRRQ; Cropley, Michialianou, Pravettoni, &amp; Millward, 2012).\nWe aim to measure psychological distress, meaning a negative emotional state. To measure psychological distress, we are using two sub scales of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS; Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995): Difficulty Relaxing and Impatient.", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Prior to hypothesis testing, we will assess the reliability of our scales by assessing Cronbach\u2019s alpha(\u03b1) and Macdonald\u2019s omega total (\u03c9total) for each scale. Once sufficient reliability is established, we will conduct confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to address common method bias concerns and to check that each measured variable represents different constructs. Lastly, we will conduct analyses to ensure that any missing data are missing at random; any missing data should not be systematically related to high levels of workaholism or WFC so that we have equal representation of the range of each variable assessed. We expect to have some missing data and will not exclude cases based on missing diary entries. Only cases with fewer than three diary entries will be removed from subsequent data analyses. This is to ensure that each case has at least three diary entries so that we can establish the temporal precedence of our hypothesized causal relationships . Additionally, we will conduct analyses to assess for normality, outliers, and missing data, and we will analyze basic descriptive statistics and create visualizations of data distributions.\n\nOur data will consist of days (level 1) nested within persons (level 2). Person-data (e.g., gender, number of children, telecommuting, and job experience level) will be measured with the baseline survey and will be modeled at level 2. Day-level data (e.g., workaholism, WFC, work hours, psychological detachment) will be measured with the twice-daily diary entries and will be modeled at level 1. Due to the nested nature of diary study data, we will use hierarchical linear modeling to test our hypotheses. \n\nOur hypotheses do not suggest any time-related relationships (e.g. rates of workaholism are not expected to increase as the week progresses). Because of this, both within- and between-person models can be used to examine the hypotheses. Prior to assessing our hypotheses, we will first check to ensure that hierarchical linear modeling is appropriate for the data by calculating the within-individual and between-individual variance accounted for by our study variables. If a meaningful proportion of variance is accounted for by the within-persons variance, then we will proceed with within-person analyses. If a low proportion of the variance is accounted for by the within-persons variance, we will utilize between-person analyses. \n\nIdeally, we will assess our hypotheses using a within-person model. For this, hypothesis testing and exploratory analyses will primarily occur at level 1 (within-person), where i represents each data point per participant and j represents each participant, and all hypothesized level-1 variables will be group-mean centered (i.e. person-centered). Level-2 covariates (i.e. gender, number of children, telecommuting, and job experience level) will be measured during the baseline survey, represent between-person constructs, and will be grand-mean centered. Because we are assessing all day-level variables at both afternoon and evening time points, we are also able to include previous measurements of the hypothesized variables as level-1 covariates in the model.  In addition to the hypothesized models, an intercepts-only model (null model) will be tested. Hypothesis 1 tests the direct effect of our model: the relationship between workaholism on WFC. Hypotheses 2 and 3, the indirect effects of our model, assess the influence of our hypothesized mediators (i.e. hours worked and psychological detachment) on the relationship between workaholism and WFC. Once we have determined the direct and indirect effects, we will determine which mediator has a greater impact on the workaholism-WFC relationship. We will obtain 95% confidence intervals using bootstrapping procedures for 10,000 simulations. Analyses for hypothesis testing will be conducted in R using the lavaan package (Rosseel, 2019). \n\nIf our data does not support within-person model assessment, we will assess the hypotheses using between-person models. For this, we will use an aggregate value of the responses across all measurement time periods. The model testing will include the same three hypothesized models as listed above (just at the between-person level). All variables with a between-person model will be grand-mean centered.   \n\nWe carefully screen data from the baseline survey in order to maintain high data quality. Due to the high prevalence of bots (i.e. non-human respondents) and the likelihood of careless responding, we will adhering to strict data quality management. For example, any participant that provides bogus data, data that are inconsistent, or are otherwise deemed not usable will be excluded from data analyses, and these participants will not be invited to participate in the diary-portion of the study.", "q19.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e5d948fe890330045f049f2", "file_name": "Workaholism Study Model HRC 3 2 20.pdf", "file_urls": {"html":

Where this may be true in some cases of psychopathy, only 15-25% of the prison population are categorised as psychopaths (Kirkman,2002), meaning psychopathy cannot be the only valid explanation for violent or criminal behaviour. One per cent of the general population meet the criteria for psychopathy but given that these individuals are able to live a functional life in society, they are likely free of criminality and are able to abide to social norms. \nThis study aims to question the stigma around psychopathy and investigate if some aspects of psychopathy are actually advantageous. For example, there is research that has discussed \u2018successful psychopaths\u2019 which refer to those who have no criminal record and have excelled in their careers, for example there is evidence for a high proportion of psychopathy in occupations such as law, the cooperate world and politics (Cleckley 1988, Hare 2003). A common trait in psychopathy is fearlessness and risk taking, which in business can pay off and lead to huge financial benefits. The current investigation will focus on dealing with stress, as there is evidence that those who display psychopathy demonstrate differences in physiological and subjective responses to stress. For example, those classed as high psychopathy in a sample of 48 incarcerated males had the lowest scores on Stanford Acute Stress reactivity questionnaire (Pham 2012). Further, in terms of physiological reactions, urine, adrenaline and noradrenaline were measured in 24 male prisoners 2 weeks, 1 week and directly before their trial (Lidberg et al 1978). High psychopathy was linked to no increase in adrenaline or noradrenaline immediately before the trial, which is seemingly the most stressful timepoint. \nA large majority of research into psychopathy is conducted with incarcerated population when investigating the effects of psychopathic traits and stress. Most people only get a diagnosis of psychopathy once they have been admitted to prison or the forensics ward, meaning that many individuals living in the general population could exhibit psychopathic traits without having been formally assessed for psychopathy. We have a lack of knowledge about how psychopathic traits, among the non-incarcerated population, may be advantageous or detrimental in everyday life. Therefore, in the current study, we will administer a measure of psychopathic traits to members of the general population and measure their stress response using a subjective State Anxiety Inventory, as well as a physiological stress response by measuring beat to beat cardiovascular reactivity.\n There is also evidence for some autonomic nervous system irregularities.
