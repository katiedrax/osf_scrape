However, results from experimental work are conflicted as to how these two related factors interact. In one recent study, the authors found that increased inequality had less of an impact on wealth redistribution choices when income was equitable (i.e., earned through performance) than when income was inequitable (i.e., earned through luck; Gee, Migueis, &amp; Parsa, 2017). In contrast, Rustichini and Vostroknutov (2015) found that, when outcomes were performance-based, low earners became more likely to subtract the winnings of higher earners at a cost to themselves, and did so in greater amounts, as the income gap increased, possibly due to negative feelings experienced in response to performing more poorly on the task. Inequality did not have the same impact when outcomes were luck-based. This suggests two possible interaction patterns: (1) greater inequality will reduce social affiliation in the high-inequity condition compared to the low-inequity condition (e.g., Gee et al., 2017), or (2) greater inequality will reduce social affiliation in the low-inequity condition compared to the high-inequity condition (e.g., Rustichini &amp; Vostroknutov, 2015)."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Participants will be asked to exchange five messages with the interaction partner using a chat message system that they will ostensibly use during the experiment (McAuliffe, Forster, Philippe, &amp; McCullough, 2018). No instructions for what to discuss will be included; the ostensible purpose of the chat is simply to familiarize the participants with the chat function.\n\nAfter this brief introductory period, participants will complete an \u201cInvestment Task\u201d modified from past research (Brown-Iannuzzi, Lundberg, Kay, &amp; Payne, 2014). In the task, participants will make three investment decisions regarding how much out of $1,000 in seed money to invest between two companies. Paragraphs describing the companies, as well as information about each company\u2019s past stock performance and price-earnings ratio, will be provided.

On an ideal Saturday, I would wake up early in the morning and go to the gym for about an hour. I would try to convince my roommate to come along to the gym with me.  After a good workout, I would go home and take a shower. Then I would go to a caf\u00e9 and study for the remainder of the afternoon.

Each item lists three words corresponding to a different emotion (e.g., \u201cjoyful, glad, or happy,\u201d \u201cangry, irritated, or annoyed\u201d) and asks participants the extent to which they are currently experiencing each on a 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely) scale.\n\nDESIRE FOR CLOSENESS WITH PARTNER: Participants will complete a five-item scale assessing their desire for closeness with their partner (van Kleef et al., 2008). Participants respond to each item using a 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) Likert scale. The five items are:\n\n1. I would like to get to know my partner better.\n2. I feel like my partner and I could be friends.\n3. I feel close to my partner.\n4. I would like to befriend my partner.\n5. I would like to spend more time with my partner.\n\nPARTNER TRAIT RATINGS: Using a 7-point scale (1 = strongly disagree; 7 = strongly agree), participants rated their partner on traits indicative of warmth (friendly, warm, likable), three of competence (intelligent, skilled, competent), and three of moral integrity (trustworthy, honest, sincere; Leach, Ellemers, &amp; Barreto, 2007). \n\nINCLUSION OF OTHER IN THE SELF: Participants will be given the Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale (Aron, Aron, &amp; Smollan, 1992), a validated, one-item pictorial measure of psychological closeness. Participants will choose among seven pictures of increasingly overlapping circles the picture that best represented the connection that they felt with their interaction partner after reading the interaction partner\u2019s letter.\n\nRESPONSES TO THE LETTER. We will use a scale composed of three items to judge the affiliative intent of participants\u2019 responses to their partner\u2019s letter regarding their ideal weekend. Specifically, we will have two research assistants rate the extent to which the responses were positive, warm, and interested. These three items will be summed and averaged into a single index of affiliative intent. Reliability of coders\u2019 judgments will be calculated using intraclass coefficients. Assuming the codes are reliable, we will average the two coders\u2019 scores together to create a single affiliative intent score for each participant.

"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q19": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Scale construction\n\nWe anticipate combining the items from each survey into their respective scales as detailed above. To determine the final scales for analyses, we will begin by calculating Cronbach\u2019s alpha to determine the internal consistency of each scale. We will perform confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) and refinine each scale based on fit indices as necessary. We will use several heuristics to assess goodness of fit for each scale. We will consider an alpha of 0.60 or higher as acceptable internal consistency. We will consider a Comparative Fit Index of 0.90 or higher as the threshold for acceptable fit of a scale in CFA analyses.   \n\nStatistical models\n\nDistribution of belonging in and between schools\n\nOur modeling strategy will conform closely to that of Farrington, Porter and Klugmnan (2019). We will first assess uniformity of scale measurement for student measures of school and classroom belonging across race/ethnicity, sex, parental education and family income (measured by whether or not students have ever participated in the free or reduced lunch programs). We will also evaluate the correlation between the school-level belonging measures previously employed by MMSD and our measures. The greater the correlation in these sets of items, the more confidence we can have in drawing on additional years of MMSD data to estimate models of variation in students belonging within and between schools (but not by classroom). \n\nNext, we will estimate a series of random-effects models to explore how students\u2019 sense of belonging varies at the classroom, student and school levels. Let Yics be a measure of belonging or academic identity for student i in class c in school s. We will first estimate a model to decompose the variance in student belonging and academic identity: \n\n\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60=\ud835\udefe000+\ud835\udc620\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60+\ud835\udc5f00\ud835\udc60+\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60 (1) \n\nWhere 0cs is a class*school specific random effect, r00s is a school-specific random effect and eics is a student-specific random effect. Assuming these sources of variance are independent, this basic equation will reflect how sense of belonging and academic identity varies among students, between classes and between schools. \n\nNext, we will consider how student attributes Z, including race/ethnicity, gender, parental education and student FRPL status, prior disciplinary referrals and prior academic performance (measured by grades and test scores) are associated with student sense of belonging and academic identity. Finally, we will distinguish between math and social studies courses by including a dummy indicator for math (mathis). This specification will allow us to a) understand variation in belonging across types of courses and b) support the inclusion of interaction terms to see if differences in belonging across subjects varies by student attributes including race/ethnicity, gender and parental education and income. The main effects version of this model (without interactions) is:\n\n\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60=\ud835\udefe000+\ud835\udc81\ud835\udf37+\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc60+\ud835\udc5f00\ud835\udc60+\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60 (2)\n\nWe will also evaluate, for only math classes, variation in math identity. In that case we will omit the math class indicator.\n\nTeacher mindset and belonging\n\nWe will begin our analyses by estimating confirmatory factor models to evaluate the quality of our teacher mindset and belonging scales and to explore whether the measurement properties of these scales vary across school contexts defined by the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic composition of the school. Next, we will evaluate how if at all teacher mindset is related to students\u2019 feelings of belonging, academic (math) identity and achievement growth. To explore the contribution of teacher beliefs to student belonging, we will modify eq (2) to reflect the contribution of teacher mindset at the classroom and school levels, school mean centering measures of teacher mindset and estimating parameters for the contribution of individual and school average measures of teacher mindset to student belonging.\n\nWe will pursue a similar strategy to analyze the contribution of teacher mindset to student math identity and academic growth. Importantly, MMSD assesses all middle school students in mathematics with the Measures of Academic Progress in both fall and spring, supporting analyses of growth over the academic rather than calendar year.\n\nPractices, behaviors and instructional environments associated with belonging\n\nWe will follow these observations with one-on-one semi-structured interviews with teachers to learn about their instructional philosophy, pedagogical decision-making process and how if at all they perceive the relationship between their mindset and sense of belonging and their students\u2019 educational experiences.

Despite a wealth of literature on the subject of belonging, it remains unclear how much student sense of belonging varies across organizational contexts, including schools and classrooms, nor the extent to which teacher behaviors and beliefs contribute to students\u2019 sense of belonging. We ask the following research questions:\n\nHow is student sense of belonging distributed within and between middle schools? \n\nHow is teacher mindset related to student sense of belonging, academic identity and student success in middle school in general and mathematics classes in particular?

We discuss construction of these scales further in the Analysis Plan. ", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Scale construction\n\nWe anticipate combining the items from each survey into their respective scales as detailed above. To determine the final scales for analyses, we will begin by calculating Cronbach\u2019s alpha to determine the internal consistency of each scale. We will perform confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) and refinine each scale based on fit indices as necessary. We will use several heuristics to assess goodness of fit for each scale. We will consider an alpha of 0.60 or higher as acceptable internal consistency. We will consider a Comparative Fit Index of 0.90 or higher as the threshold for acceptable fit of a scale in CFA analyses.   \n\nStatistical models\n\nDistribution of belonging in and between schools\n\nOur modeling strategy will conform closely to that of Farrington, Porter and Klugmnan (2019). We will first assess uniformity of scale measurement for student measures of school and classroom belonging across race/ethnicity, sex, parental education and family income (measured by whether or not students have ever participated in the free or reduced lunch programs). We will also evaluate the correlation between the school-level belonging measures previously employed by MMSD and our measures. The greater the correlation in these sets of items, the more confidence we can have in drawing on additional years of MMSD data to estimate models of variation in students belonging within and between schools (but not by classroom). \n\nNext, we will estimate a series of random-effects models to explore how students\u2019 sense of belonging varies at the classroom, student and school levels. Let Yics be a measure of belonging or academic identity for student i in class c in school s. We will first estimate a model to decompose the variance in student belonging and academic identity: \n\n\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60=\ud835\udefe000+\ud835\udc620\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60+\ud835\udc5f00\ud835\udc60+\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60 (1) \n\nWhere 0cs is a class*school specific random effect, r00s is a school-specific random effect and eics is a student-specific random effect. Assuming these sources of variance are independent, this basic equation will reflect how sense of belonging and academic identity varies among students, between classes and between schools. \n\nNext, we will consider how student attributes Z, including race/ethnicity, gender, parental education and student FRPL status, prior disciplinary referrals and prior academic performance (measured by grades and test scores) are associated with student sense of belonging and academic identity. Finally, we will distinguish between math and social studies courses by including a dummy indicator for math (mathis). This specification will allow us to a) understand variation in belonging across types of courses and b) support the inclusion of interaction terms to see if differences in belonging across subjects varies by student attributes including race/ethnicity, gender and parental education and income. The main effects version of this model (without interactions) is:\n\n\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60=\ud835\udefe000+\ud835\udc81\ud835\udf37+\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc60+\ud835\udc5f00\ud835\udc60+\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60 (2)\n\nWe will also evaluate, for only math classes, variation in math identity. In that case we will omit the math class indicator.\n\nTeacher mindset and belonging\n\nWe will begin our analyses by estimating confirmatory factor models to evaluate the quality of our teacher mindset and belonging scales and to explore whether the measurement properties of these scales vary across school contexts defined by the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic composition of the school. Next, we will evaluate how if at all teacher mindset is related to students\u2019 feelings of belonging, academic (math) identity and achievement growth. To explore the contribution of teacher beliefs to student belonging, we will modify eq (2) to reflect the contribution of teacher mindset at the classroom and school levels, school mean centering measures of teacher mindset and estimating parameters for the contribution of individual and school average measures of teacher mindset to student belonging.\n\nWe will pursue a similar strategy to analyze the contribution of teacher mindset to student math identity and academic growth. Importantly, MMSD assesses all middle school students in mathematics with the Measures of Academic Progress in both fall and spring, supporting analyses of growth over the academic rather than calendar year.\n\nPractices, behaviors and instructional environments associated with belonging\n\nWe will follow these observations with one-on-one semi-structured interviews with teachers to learn about their instructional philosophy, pedagogical decision-making process and how if at all they perceive the relationship between their mindset and sense of belonging and their students\u2019 educational experiences. We will also interview a sample of students in each classroom to learn how they experience and respond to their teachers.\n\nWe will recruit teachers based on a modified version of equation (1) in which we condition only on student background attributes, including prior year GPA: \ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60=\ud835\udefe000+\ud835\udc81\ud835\udf37+\ud835\udc620\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60+\ud835\udc5f00\ud835\udc60+\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60 We will then draw a sample of math classrooms stratified based on the classroom random effects (0cs) such that we sample a total of 20 classrooms\u20147 each from the top and bottom quartiles of value-added for student belonging and 3 each from the middle two quartiles. If we are unsuccessful in recruiting particular classrooms, we will replace them with another classroom form the same quartile.\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children":
