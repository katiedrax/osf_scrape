that used scoping review methodology to collect and verify the applicability of the phrase \"Food Studies\" in bibliographic records across five databases. Five large bibliographic databases were identified for size, relevance to food studies, and subject metadata standards. These were ProQuest Central (PQC), EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS), Web Of Science (WOS), PubMed (PM), and PubAg. The phrase \u201cfood studies\u201d was then searched within each database, using a scholarly or peer-reviewed filter. The date range for the articles was all-time, through the date of the final search (December 3, 2019.) \n\nEach database\u2019s search results were exported, transferred, and pooled into bibliographic management software (EndNote). Using endnote, the author verified \u201cfood studies\u201d in the metadata, and prepared the metadata for screening. (No deduplication methods were used in this or the next phase because metadata can differ between duplicates.) Eligibility criteria for results were determined to be any peer-reviewed article\u2019s record that contained data in its keyword, index term, subject, or heading fields, and had the phrase \u201cfood studies\u201d anywhere in its metadata. \n\nThe results were then imported into ES management software (Covidence), where all records were screened for relevance or irrelevance. Two major exclusion parameters were used in this phase. The first was whether the phrase \u201cfood studies\u201d was lexically written as a plural or uncountable noun. Secondarily, I conducted background research for unfamiliar uses of \u201cfood studies\u201d as a concept.\n\nOnce completed, this set of citations constituted The \u201cFood Studies\u201d Corpus. Because keyword frequency results rely on counting exact textual strings from five different database sources, the keywords needed to be crosswalked, or clustered and merged. Textual differences were cleaned through algorithmic clustering.The corpus was prepared and exported into a tabular document. This tabbed-corpus was then imported into data cleaning software (OpenRefine). OpenRefine contains several clustering methods. The number of keywords and clusters for each method, used in succession, can be found in \"Keyword Clustering\" spreadsheet. (Note that each text cluster was manually evaluated before merging\u2014no merge was automatic.)", "category": "data", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-12T18:20:36.739732",

A randomized trial", "description": "There is evidence that, although most reputable medical journals endorse the use of reporting guidelines, authors still find it difficult to identify the most appropriate one and use it effectively to improve the completeness of their article.  \n\nWe have developed an online tool called GoodReports (www.goodreports.org) to help researchers find and use reporting guidelines. The tool currently helps researchers identify the most appropriate single reporting guideline (e.g., CONSORT, STROBE, or PRISMA) and delivers an online, editable checklist that can also be downloaded. The checklist can be annotated to indicate where in the manuscript each item has been reported, then submitted to a journal alongside an article manuscript. However, pilot data collected as part of a collaboration with a medical journal indicated that when a checklist was delivered immediately before submission, it did not lead to authors making significant additions to their manuscript.  \n\nTherefore, we plan to \n\n1. Develop the functionality of the GoodReports tool to deliver an article template to be used during writing. \n\n2. Combine items from more than one reporting guideline into a single article template, where appropriate.  \n\n3. Conduct a randomized trial to test whether article templates delivered early in the writing process result in more complete reporting of health research articles.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-12T18:37:12.867497", "date_modified": "2020-04-12T16:29:25.275374", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["EQUATOR Reporting Guidelines"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "c9493860c4d578c5795147f3e51265aa17b39ff932a74329633974b86cefa9fe3e1757907738a3796ebb88525ba64db7452689eca0d4985aa66b8d91760f31d5d345542ad4bf35e5a01c2eba8bd63ddf8188c999edcda01d4f6a1a5694fb4874df374b79099f0d8882eb699658072de02d7cc43d3499e74072034a91fc605452cf07986ad5bd45a0da644aa3fcdb95cd", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-12T18:37:12.849653", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Caroline Struthers, Jennifer Anne de Beyer, Patricia Logullo, James Harwood, Gary Collins"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Null hypothesis: \nIf an author who is writing a research article for publication in a medical journal is provided with an article template including items from up to four reporting guidelines appropriate to the characteristics of their study, they will not write a more complete, transparent and publishable account of their work than if they are recommended those same individual reporting guidelines.\n"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

We will ask a range of questions about:\n\n* Their experience of using the GoodReports template or the reporting guideline recommendation(s) to help them write their article\n* Whether they sought reporting guidance from elsewhere during the trial   \n* The usefulness of the completeness assessment report\n* Whether they submitted a checklist to the journal with their manuscript\n\nWe hope also to collect objective outcomes from the manuscripts of participants recruited via our two partner journals (`BMJ Open' and `Diseases of the Colon and Rectum') on submission and acceptance rates, time through editing and peer review, and the quality of the final publications.

project extends work from previous experiments examining how knowing an audience's perspective can influence how individuals reflect on their autobiographical memories. Experiment 1 of this project (https://osf.io/xpv7d) demonstrated that communicating with an audience who has a positive perspective on the memory topic leads to more positive attitudes related to the memory topic and more positive event memory perceptions than communicating with an audience who has a negative perspective on the memory topic. Research on audience tuning in regards to communication about the behavior of others has shown that the audience-congruent memory bias is greater when the communicator has high epistemic trust in the audience as opposed to when trust in the audience is low (Echterhoff, Higgins, Kopietz, &amp; Groll, 2008).
