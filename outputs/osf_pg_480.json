JULIUS--MAXIMILIANS-UNIVERSITY W\u00dcRZBURG.\n\nThe aim of this study is to examine the influence of nonverbal cues of submission and suffering on satisfaction, escalation likelihood and blame assignment on female in comparison to male violent interactions.\n\nTo examine physical aggression, the majority of research has used laboratory tasks, such as electric shock paradigms (Frodi et al., 1977). Until now, very little research has used realistic contexts to examine determinants that influence outcomes of those violent interactions. Hence, the study of Krishna et al. (2019) is very interesting, as they used a practical model of escalating violent conflicts among young men, called the monkey dance (Miller, 2014), to examine the role of nonverbal cues of submission and suffering. Participants were shown videos of naturalistic violent interactions between young men, filmed from a first person perspective. They then rated the satisfaction of the perspective (first person) individual, the relative blame for the interaction and the likelihood of escalation for the perspective as well as the target (other) individual (Krishna et al., 2019). The results are described below.\nAccording to Miller (2014), the monkey dance is a ritualized dominance game and the motivation is to attain higher status. Usually, accepting a lower rank, expressed through submissive body language, ends the dominance game (Mazur &amp; Booth, 1998; Miller, 2014). Furthermore, as aggression is usually defined as \u201cbehavior whose goal is the injury of some person or object\u201d (Berkowitz, 1964, p. 104), it is plausible to assume that another sign for the current state of the competition is if someone shows suffering (Anderson &amp; Carnagey, 2004; Rule &amp; Leger, 1976). Thereby, previous research has shown that cues of suffering reduce further aggression in the counterpart (Baron, 1971; Buss, 1966).\nIt therefore follows, that the satisfaction of the perspective individual should depend on whether the target individual displays motivation-relevant emotions. Indeed, Krishna et al. (2019) found that if the target individual showed submission or suffering, participants judged the perspective individual to be more satisfied. If the interaction had already satisfied the motivation of the perspective individual, there would be no excuse to continue. Matching this, Krishna et al. (2019) found that if the target individual showed submission or suffering, participants judged the perspective individual to have more blame for the interaction. As the nonverbal expressions of the target individual should reflect their motivational state, cues of submission and suffering should be perceived as less motivated to aggress. Furthermore, this expressions in the target individual should also reduce the perceived likelihood to escalate for the perspective individual, as those cues might satisfy their motivation. In the study of Krishna et al. (2019) this effect was shown for the target individual, but for the perspective one only the effect of suffering was shown. The effects of submission were more complex and seem to depend on the relative size of the target model (Krishna et al., 2019). \nOverall, this study suggest that cues of suffering and submission are important determinants for feelings and behavior of an aggressor (Krishna et al., 2019). However, it is unclear whether those effects are stable and can be generalized over different stimuli. Therefore, the first aim of this study is to replicate the effects of submission and suffering on the estimated satisfaction, escalation likelihood and relative blame under improved circumstances. As the relative size of video models seemed to have an influence on the outcomes, this should be controlled by using physically similar actors. Furthermore, the interaction will be highly standardized to be more comparable among the target individuals. The second and novel aim, which drives this research is, whether all those effects can be found beyond gender and thus also in violent interactions between women. \nConcerning dominance and submission, there are different perspectives on this question. Miller (2014) pointed out that dominance games like the monkey dance are a male phenomenon and females seldom fight for status due to the high cost of intrasexual competition. This assumption is in line with many scientific papers about female aggression (e.g. Arnocky, 2019; Campbell, 2013). According to them, in many species only women provide the parental care required for the survival of the offspring. The damage from physical fights suffered by a women is therefore meaningful for their child\u2019s survival (Arnocky, 2019). It follows that a dominance game might be unusual for women and they may not have the same extent of desire to win this game as men. This could mean that females feel less satisfaction when their female counterpart shows submission. However, if the satisfaction decreases, it might be possible that the likelihood of ones own escalation increases, as the aggressor doesn\u2019t feel satisfied with the current state of the game. On the other hand it might also be possible that the escalation likelihood for women is also generally reduced in comparison to men, as they are socialized to avoid violent behavior (Pollock et al., 2006). In sum it seems unclear if the unusual nature of a female dominance game might change the effects of submission on outcomes of violent interactions.\nIn contrast to the view that the dominance game is prototypically male, according to Campbell (2013) also women fight for status and higher ranks, to gain advantages such as priority of access to food or the best mates. In addition, even the \u201cchallenge hypothesis\u201d (Archer, 2006) typically applied to young men, says that physical aggression and dominance is associated with increases in testosterone levels also for women. High testosterone levels in turn are related with an assertive style that is in contrast to subtle forms of competition. Following this, also women might engage in challenging, competitive social behavior to achieve submission of their counterpart (Archer, 2006). Therefore, there seem to be also reasons to assume that cues of submission might lead to similar outcomes for female violent interactions in comparison to male.\nIn conclusion, it cannot be clearly predicted whether signs of dominance and submission in violent interactions work differently or similar for females than for males, as there are arguments in both directions.\nConcerning suffering, again there are different perspectives on this question. Buss (1966) showed, signs of pain reduced aggression in male as well as in female participants. Consequently, it seems plausible to assume that cues of suffering may reduce the escalation likelihood in the same extent for women as for men.\nOther studies have suggested that feelings of guilt or anxiety are psychological mediators of sex differences of aggression (Eagly &amp; Steffen, 1986; Frodi et al., 1977). They point out that those differences appear through increased empathy among women in comparison to men. According to Bandura (1973) feelings of fear and guilt, aroused through high pain cues, inhibit subsequent aggression. Following, the escalation likelihood may be generally decreased for women. In addition, it seems plausible to assume that feelings of guilt could also affect feelings of satisfaction and relative blame. If one feels guilty, cues of suffering might decrease the satisfaction and increase the feeling of self blame. Consequently, cues of suffering in women might influence outcomes of violent interaction differently than for men. However, this argumentation presupposes that empathy plays a role in aggressive disputes and this has not been conclusively clarified (Frodi et al., 1977). \nAgain, there are arguments in both directions and it remains unclear whether signs of suffering work different or similar for women and men.\nIn sum, most arguments point in the direction that the effects found by Krishna et al. (2019) will be smaller for women, but the theoretical foundation is not sufficient to make a directional prediction."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "As mentioned above, the first aim of this study is to replicate the effects of submission and suffering on the estimated satisfaction, escalation likelihood of the target individual and relative blame for male stimuli. \nH1: Participants will report higher satisfaction levels for the male perspective individuals, a lower likelihood to escalate for the male target individuals and more blame for the male perspective individuals when the male target individuals shows submission or suffering than when the male target individuals shows dominance or no suffering.\nAs the findings for the escalation likelihood of the perspective individual seem to depend on relative size of the target individual, this time physically similar models are chosen. Nevertheless, no clear predictions can be drawn from the findings of the study of Krishna et al. (2019).\nRQ1: How do suffering and submission interact in ratings of the escalation likelihood for the male perspective individuals?\nThe specific question which drives this research is, whether all those effects are different for female stimuli. In summary, current research has given us some arguments that submission and suffering may have a different effect on women, but also arguments that it may be the same as for men. Following, this does not allow specific hypotheses. \nRQ2: Do the effects described for men stimuli hold for female stimuli and if not what is the specific pattern for female stimuli?"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

The stimuli for the experiment are videos, filmed in the open countryside. Two pairs of actors were filmed, one male and one female pair and each actor assumed each role (perspective and target individual) within the pair. The actors were briefly instructed with a script, which followed the specific steps of escalation of the monkey dance (Miller, 2014). The actors started from about 7 meters distance. The target person started with a provoking stare, then the perspective individual (with a GoPro mounted on the head) made a challenging comment. Afterwards both individuals exchanged challenges, threats and insults while closing the distance. On a close distance the perspective individual started the physical contact with a two-handed push on the chest or poking the finger on the chest. Then the physical aggression started with two two-handed pushes each. Finally the target person wound up for a punch. \nThe actors had to vary their expressions and reactions across the four conditions: dominant posture (hard stare, head lifted slightly, arms spread wide, chest puffed out) or submissive posture (eye aversion, hunched over, arms close to body) and suffering responses (shock reaction on the challenge, pain expression on the pushes) or no suffering responses (see video files in \"Stimuli\").\nEscalation Judgments. Participants will see a series of sixteen videos from a first-person perspective. Thereby they see the hands of the perspective individual and the full body of the target individual. Each combination of dominance and suffering will be shown for each possible target individual, resulting in four videos per target person. The presentation of the videos will be blocked for each target individual, but randomized in the order of the combination of dominance and suffering within the target individual block. Furthermore, the order of the video presentation of the target individual will be randomized.\nThe videos will end when the individuals begin to close the distance and it\u2019s not clear yet, whether the situation is going to escalate. The average duration of the videos is 12s. After each video the participants should rate the perceived likelihood of escalation for the perspective and for the target individual from 1 (very unlikely) to 7 (very likely). \nSatisfaction and Blame Judgments. For the judgments of satisfaction of the perspective individual and blame for the interaction, participants will see the videos of all conditions again, but this time the long version, until the target person wound for a punch. The average duration of the videos is 22s. After each video, participants should rate the relative blame for the interaction from 1 (the perspective individual) to 7 (the target individual) and how satisfied they are as the perspective individual from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much).\nProcedure. Data collection is planned as part of a longer experimental session in which one other experiment will also be run. The sessions will be executed on a computer in a lab room of the University of Wuerzburg. After entering the room, participants will read and sign the provided information consent. Then they will start the experiment.\nFirstly, participants will see the short videos and judge the escalation likelihood after each video. Secondly, they will see the long videos and judge the satisfaction and the relative blame after each video. Finally, participants will answer the question, how difficult it was for them to adopt the perspective of the perspective individual from 1 (very difficult) to 7 (very easy) and provide the demographic information (for the whole experiment see \"MonkeyDance3.iqx\").

If the interaction had already satisfied the motivation of the perspective individual, there would be no excuse to continue. Matching this, Krishna et al. (2019) found that if the target individual showed submission or suffering, participants judged the perspective individual to have more blame for the interaction. As the nonverbal expressions of the target individual should reflect their motivational state, cues of submission and suffering should be perceived as less motivated to aggress. Furthermore, this expressions in the target individual should also reduce the perceived likelihood to escalate for the perspective individual, as those cues might satisfy their motivation. In the study of Krishna et al. (2019) this effect was shown for the target individual, but for the perspective one only the effect of suffering was shown. The effects of submission were more complex and seem to depend on the relative size of the target model (Krishna et al., 2019). \nOverall, this study suggest that cues of suffering and submission are important determinants for feelings and behavior of an aggressor (Krishna et al., 2019). However, it is unclear whether those effects are stable and can be generalized over different stimuli. Therefore, the first aim of this study is to replicate the effects of submission and suffering on the estimated satisfaction, escalation likelihood and relative blame under improved circumstances. As the relative size of video models seemed to have an influence on the outcomes, this should be controlled by using physically similar actors. Furthermore, the interaction will be highly standardized to be more comparable among the target individuals. The second and novel aim, which drives this research is, whether all those effects can be found beyond gender and thus also in violent interactions between women. \nConcerning dominance and submission, there are different perspectives on this question. Miller (2014) pointed out that dominance games like the monkey dance are a male phenomenon and females seldom fight for status due to the high cost of intrasexual competition. This assumption is in line with many scientific papers about female aggression (e.g. Arnocky, 2019; Campbell, 2013). According to them, in many species only women provide the parental care required for the survival of the offspring. The damage from physical fights suffered by a women is therefore meaningful for their child\u2019s survival (Arnocky, 2019). It follows that a dominance game might be unusual for women and they may not have the same extent of desire to win this game as men. This could mean that females feel less satisfaction when their female counterpart shows submission. However, if the satisfaction decreases, it might be possible that the likelihood of ones own escalation increases, as the aggressor doesn\u2019t feel satisfied with the current state of the game. On the other hand it might also be possible that the escalation likelihood for women is also generally reduced in comparison to men, as they are socialized to avoid violent behavior (Pollock et al., 2006). In sum it seems unclear if the unusual nature of a female dominance game might change the effects of submission on outcomes of violent interactions.\nIn contrast to the view that the dominance game is prototypically male, according to Campbell (2013) also women fight for status and higher ranks, to gain advantages such as priority of access to food or the best mates. In addition, even the \u201cchallenge hypothesis\u201d (Archer, 2006) typically applied to young men, says that physical aggression and dominance is associated with increases in testosterone levels also for women. High testosterone levels in turn are related with an assertive style that is in contrast to subtle forms of competition. Following this, also women might engage in challenging, competitive social behavior to achieve submission of their counterpart (Archer, 2006). Therefore, there seem to be also reasons to assume that cues of submission might lead to similar outcomes for female violent interactions in comparison to male.\nIn conclusion, it cannot be clearly predicted whether signs of dominance and submission in violent interactions work differently or similar for females than for males, as there are arguments in both directions.\nConcerning suffering, again there are different perspectives on this question. Buss (1966) showed, signs of pain reduced aggression in male as well as in female participants. Consequently, it seems plausible to assume that cues of suffering may reduce the escalation likelihood in the same extent for women as for men.\nOther studies have suggested that feelings of guilt or anxiety are psychological mediators of sex differences of aggression (Eagly &amp; Steffen, 1986; Frodi et al., 1977). They point out that those differences appear through increased empathy among women in comparison to men. According to Bandura (1973) feelings of fear and guilt, aroused through high pain cues, inhibit subsequent aggression. Following, the escalation likelihood may be generally decreased for women. In addition, it seems plausible to assume that feelings of guilt could also affect feelings of satisfaction and relative blame. If one feels guilty, cues of suffering might decrease the satisfaction and increase the feeling of self blame. Consequently, cues of suffering in women might influence outcomes of violent interaction differently than for men. However, this argumentation presupposes that empathy plays a role in aggressive disputes and this has not been conclusively clarified (Frodi et al., 1977). \nAgain, there are arguments in both directions and it remains unclear whether signs of suffering work different or similar for women and men.\nIn sum, most arguments point in the direction that the effects found by Krishna et al. (2019) will be smaller for women, but the theoretical foundation is not sufficient to make a directional prediction.", "q4": "As mentioned above, the first aim of this study is to replicate the effects of submission and suffering on the estimated satisfaction, escalation likelihood of the target individual and relative blame for male stimuli. \nH1: Participants will report higher satisfaction levels for the male perspective individuals, a lower likelihood to escalate for the male target individuals and more blame for the male perspective individuals when the male target individuals shows submission or suffering than when the male target individuals shows dominance or no suffering.\nAs the findings for the escalation likelihood of the perspective individual seem to depend on relative size of the target individual, this time physically similar models are chosen. Nevertheless, no clear predictions can be drawn from the findings of the study of Krishna et al. (2019).\nRQ1: How do suffering and submission interact in ratings of the escalation likelihood for the male perspective individuals?\nThe specific question which drives this research is, whether all those effects are different for female stimuli. In summary, current research has given us some arguments that submission and suffering may have a different effect on women, but also arguments that it may be the same as for men. Following, this does not allow specific hypotheses. \nRQ2: Do the effects described for men stimuli hold for female stimuli and if not what is the specific pattern for female stimuli?", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

The stimuli for the experiment are videos, filmed in the open countryside. Two pairs of actors were filmed, one male and one female pair and each actor assumed each role (perspective and target individual) within the pair. The actors were briefly instructed with a script, which followed the specific steps of escalation of the monkey dance (Miller, 2014). The actors started from about 7 meters distance. The target person started with a provoking stare, then the perspective individual (with a GoPro mounted on the head) made a challenging comment. Afterwards both individuals exchanged challenges, threats and insults while closing the distance. On a close distance the perspective individual started the physical contact with a two-handed push on the chest or poking the finger on the chest. Then the physical aggression started with two two-handed pushes each. Finally the target person wound up for a punch. \nThe actors had to vary their expressions and reactions across the four conditions: dominant posture (hard stare, head lifted slightly, arms spread wide, chest puffed out) or submissive posture (eye aversion, hunched over, arms close to body) and suffering responses (shock reaction on the challenge, pain expression on the pushes) or no suffering responses (see video files in \"Stimuli\").\nEscalation Judgments. Participants will see a series of sixteen videos from a first-person perspective. Thereby they see the hands of the perspective individual and the full body of the target individual. Each combination of dominance and suffering will be shown for each possible target individual, resulting in four videos per target person. The presentation of the videos will be blocked for each target individual, but randomized in the order of the combination of dominance and suffering within the target individual block. Furthermore, the order of the video presentation of the target individual will be randomized.\nThe videos will end when the individuals begin to close the distance and it\u2019s not clear yet, whether the situation is going to escalate. The average duration of the videos is 12s. After each video the participants should rate the perceived likelihood of escalation for the perspective and for the target individual from 1 (very unlikely) to 7 (very likely). \nSatisfaction and Blame Judgments. For the judgments of satisfaction of the perspective individual and blame for the interaction, participants will see the videos of all conditions again, but this time the long version, until the target person wound for a punch. The average duration of the videos is 22s. After each video, participants should rate the relative blame for the interaction from 1 (the perspective individual) to 7 (the target individual) and how satisfied they are as the perspective individual from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much).\nProcedure. Data collection is planned as part of a longer experimental session in which one other experiment will also be run.

Secondly, they will see the long videos and judge the satisfaction and the relative blame after each video. Finally, participants will answer the question, how difficult it was for them to adopt the perspective of the perspective individual from 1 (very difficult) to 7 (very easy) and provide the demographic information (for the whole experiment see \"MonkeyDance3.iqx\").
