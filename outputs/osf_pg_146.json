These models, which will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood, will assume that variation in effect sizes is due to fixed effects of moderators (e.g., age), random effects of residual between-study heterogeneity, and within-study sampling variance (Borenstein et al., 2009). Because many studies likely will generate multiple effect sizes, we will implement robust variance estimation (RVE) to account for effect size dependencies, using the small-sample correction based on the Satterthwaite approximation (Tipton, 2015) and the \u201cCR2\u201d bias-reduced linearization adjustment (Pustejovky &amp; Tipton, 2018). We will first estimate mixed-effects meta-analysis model parameters using the rma.mv() function in the metafor R package (Viechtbauer, 2010) and then adjust the standard errors, degrees of freedom, and p values by implementing RVE using the coef_test() function in the clubSandwich package (Pustejovsky, 2018). \n\nMETA-ANALYSIS 1: Confirmatory moderator analyses will test our directional hypotheses such as pro-male STEM ability stereotypes should strengthen with age. We will examine each moderator in separate models and in one multivariable model that will simultaneously adjust for all confirmatory moderators. To control for nuisance methods variance, all models will include four dummy-coded covariates for the scale type: (a) 2 or 3 response options, (b) forced-choice scale with no gender-neutral response option for individual items, (c) continuous scale (vs. discrete ratings), and (d) separate ratings (vs. comparative scales). Though effect sizes will be standardized, the original measurement scale still could contribute additional variance that should be adjusted for. STEM ability and verbal ability stereotypes will be analyzed in separate statistical models, except when directing comparing their overall magnitude (in that case, both will be included in the same model to account for their correlation).\n\nMETA-ANALYSIS 2: Our core prediction for Meta-Analysis 2 is that pro-male STEM and pro-male female ability stereotypes should relate to motivational STEM outcomes negatively for girls and positively for boys. We will test these basic predictions with four separate random-effects models for the four broad categories of correlations (see Table 9), along with characterizing their overall heterogeneity. Two additional mixed-effects models (bottom rows of Table 9) will directly examine average differences between boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 correlations by including one moderator for gender. For the correlations between girls\u2019 STEM ability stereotypes and STEM motivational outcomes, we will conduct additional moderator analyses using mixed-effects models. We focus on this category of correlations in part because we expect to obtain the most primary data for it (relative to other categories).\n\nSELECTIVE REPORTING BIAS ANALYSES: Though we will use several systematic search methods to find unpublished studies, our conclusions may nevertheless be subject to selective reporting bias (e.g., publication bias or outcome reporting bias). Researchers may be cautious to report results conflicting with commonly accepted theory and research hypotheses. As detailed in Appendix D in the uploaded protocol document, we will use three approaches as sensitivity analyses to diagnose and adjust for such biases: (a) selection modeling, (b) comparison of unpublished versus published studies, and (c) meta-regression to assess small-study effects. If the three approaches yield diverging conclusions, we will place the greatest weight on selection models for reasons detailed in Appendix D. Simulation studies have shown superior performance for selection models, compared to other publication bias methods, in several conditions that may likely characterize our meta-analysis such as moderate to large between-study heterogeneity (Carter, Sch\u00f6nbrodt, Gervais, &amp; Hilgard, 2019)."}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Preregistration_2.19.20.pdf"}, "nodeId": "29egh", "sha256": "9031532c3bebaac3077c35336688678dda8c9f4fb268f8ae2e9cf19981859823", "viewUrl": "/project/jqtfe/files/osfstorage/5e4da067b8c2e501954c6893/", "selectedFileName": "Preregistration_2.19.20.pdf"}], "value": ""}}}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Whenever possible, we will record both the average and range for children\u2019s age and grade level; children\u2019s average age will be the focal moderator in analyses.

Using Hedges and Pigott\u2019s (2001) formulas and assuming 80 studies with N = 481, we estimate there would be sufficient power (i.e., 80% power) to detect a minimum mean effect size of 0.07 assuming moderate study heterogeneity (tau = 0.2; I^2 = 95%) and 0.10 for large heterogeneity (tau = 0.3; I^2 = 98%).", "q14": "We will include all eligible studies that we find through search processes, regardless of the final number of studies to analyze.", "q15": "After completing our initial literature search and screening, we plan to update the literature search before submitting our first research manuscript, but we do not plan further updates after the first time of submitting the manuscript for peer review.", "q20": "Whenever possible, we will record both the average and range for children\u2019s age and grade level; children\u2019s average age will be the focal moderator in analyses. If a study reports an age range but not average age, we will impute children\u2019s age as the midpoint of the range (e.g., \u201cfour- and five-year-olds\u201d would be coded as 5.0 years; \u201cfour-year-olds\u201d would be 4.5 years). If the grade level but not age is reported, we will add 5.5 years to the grade level for U.S. samples (e.g., \u201cthird graders\u201d would be 8.5 years) and adjust this transformation as necessary for nations with different grade bands (e.g., \u201cYear 3\u201d would be 9.5 years for U.K. samples). We will attempt to contact study authors for these details if neither age nor grade level information was reported. \n\nPublication status will differentiate between (a) articles in academic journals and edited books versus (b) dissertations, Master\u2019s theses, conference papers, blog posts, and unpublished manuscripts. If a dissertation or other unpublished report was later published in a journal or edited book, we will consider that study to be published.\n\nIf any moderator level has 4 effect sizes or less, we will combine that moderator level with others prior to analysis (e.g., group engineering and computer science stereotypes measures as one category if there are not enough effects for disaggregated analysis of them), if possible.", "q21": "We will determine two-tailed p-values for regression coefficients using t-tests based the Satterthwaite degrees of freedom and apply a default alpha cut-off level of .05 when determining statistical significance. However, we will lower the alpha level to .025 when the degrees of freedom for individual coefficients are less than 4 because of inflated Type I error rates in those scenarios (Tipton, 2015). In addition, if any moderator level has 4 effect sizes or less, we will combine that moderator level with others prior to analysis (e.g., group engineering and computer science stereotypes measures as one category if there are not enough effects for disaggregated analysis of them), if possible.\n\nBecause we have prespecified our confirmatory moderator analyses, we will not apply corrections for multiple comparisons to them. However, for exploratory analyses of potentially many more comparisons, we will use the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995) to control false discovery rates, rather than the Bonferroni method which can too stringent in many situations (see Appendix F in What Works Clearinghouse, 2017). ", "q22": "We will test the robustness of our findings to potential outliers by using the rstudent() function in the metafor package to identify effect sizes that have studentized deleted residuals exceeding 2.5 standard errors (Viechtbauer &amp; Cheung, 2010). We will rerun meta-analytic models with and without such outliers, reporting when the conclusions are sensitive to such exclusions.", "q23": "We will use multiple imputation to account for any missing moderator data (e.g., for racial/ethnic composition) that may remain missing even after attempting to contact study authors. Compared to common listwise deletion practices, multiple imputation preserves a larger set of studies and can often produce less biased estimates (Pigott, 2001, 2012). We will implement a joint modelling approach by using the jomo R package to also account for the multilevel structure of the data (i.e., nesting within studies) when imputing moderator values (Quartagno, Grund, &amp; Carpenter, in press). We will allow the level-1 covariance structures to randomly vary across studies by setting the \u201cmeth\u201d option in the jomo() function equal to \u201crandom.\u201d As a simplifying assumption, the imputation model will account for just the overall 2-level nesting structure (i.e., effects within studies). The effect sizes, but not their variances, will be included in the imputation models because omitting the outcome (i.e., effect sizes) when imputing covariates (i.e., moderators) can introduce bias due to a lack of correspondence between the imputation model and analysis model (e.g., Moons, Donders, Stijnen, &amp; Harrell, 2006).", "q24": "META-ANALYSIS 1: Exploratory analyses will examine additional moderators such as question wording and stereotype domain (e.g., math vs. spatial ability; Table 2) that may yield further insight. We also will explore interactions with age to advance understanding of possible developmental mechanisms (e.g., indirect and direct measures might show different age-related trends, especially if they capture distinct theoretical constructs). Last, we will repeat analyses separated by children\u2019s gender to see if stereotypes vary in consistent ways for boys and girls. These analyses could help build fundamental theory about stereotype development and suggest promising novel directions for future research. However, we will interpret these exploratory analyses cautiously, given possible inflation of false-positive error rates.\n\nMETA-ANALYSIS 2: Exploratory analyses will extend moderator analyses to the other effect size categories (e.g., correlations for boys), though the statistical power may be lower. We also will explore other moderators (e.g., socioeconomic status, stereotype or outcome STEM domain) and correlations with two categories of performance outcomes (i.e., test scores, grades).", "q25": "Answers to these structured OSF questions provide a high-level summary of our preregistered plans, but the uploaded protocol document provides much more detail.", "q8.question": "This project consists of two meta-analyses that will analyze variation in (a) mean levels of children\u2019s gender stereotypes about STEM and verbal abilities and (b) these stereotypes\u2019 correlations with motivational STEM outcomes such as confidence and interests.

Each search strategy includes systematic methods for finding unpublished studies, such as using ProQuest to identify doctoral dissertations in Strategy 1. Finding grey literature is critical because reviews can otherwise produce distorted conclusions by focusing on well-known, easily available, published studies. Our four-pronged, multidisciplinary search process will help mitigate such biases.\n\nINCLUSION CRITERIA: We will include studies that (a) included a sample of children (age &lt; 18 years), (b) measured gender stereotypes about STEM or verbal abilities, (c) included a stereotype measure whose response structure permits directional assessment of stereotypes, (d) included at least 10 total child participants, (e) measured stereotypes before an experimental manipulation, (f) separately reported statistics for ability-related stereotype items (or at least 50% of a scale\u2019s items were ability-related), and (g) reported sufficient quantitative information to compute effect sizes.

In Stage 1 (abstract review), screeners will examine titles and abstracts using the screening tool Abstrackr to help facilitate and manage this initial review (Rathbone, Hoffmann, &amp; Glasziou, 2015); screeners will exclude only obviously ineligible articles at this stage. In Stage\u00a02 (full text review), screeners will thoroughly examine the full text, including only articles meeting all the inclusion criteria. In Stage 3 (data review), we will contact study authors for missing information needed to compute effect sizes and then exclude studies in which no effect sizes can be computed, even after sending author queries. We separate Stages 2 and 3 to track otherwise eligible studies lacking needed effect size data (i.e., we will keep a list of such studies).

We plan to make this decision after coding studies, but before analyzing the data, so that our decision is based on data availability, but not the results. If we do include partial correlations (e.g., converted from regression coefficients), we would include a dummy code for them in all moderator analyses.

These models, which will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood, will assume that variation in effect sizes is due to fixed effects of moderators (e.g., age), random effects of residual between-study heterogeneity, and within-study sampling variance (Borenstein et al., 2009). Because many studies likely will generate multiple effect sizes, we will implement robust variance estimation (RVE) to account for effect size dependencies, using the small-sample correction based on the Satterthwaite approximation (Tipton, 2015) and the \u201cCR2\u201d bias-reduced linearization adjustment (Pustejovky &amp; Tipton, 2018). We will first estimate mixed-effects meta-analysis model parameters using the rma.mv() function in the metafor R package (Viechtbauer, 2010) and then adjust the standard errors, degrees of freedom, and p values by implementing RVE using the coef_test() function in the clubSandwich package (Pustejovsky, 2018). \n\nMETA-ANALYSIS 1: Confirmatory moderator analyses will test our directional hypotheses such as pro-male STEM ability stereotypes should strengthen with age. We will examine each moderator in separate models and in one multivariable model that will simultaneously adjust for all confirmatory moderators. To control for nuisance methods variance, all models will include four dummy-coded covariates for the scale type: (a) 2 or 3 response options, (b) forced-choice scale with no gender-neutral response option for individual items, (c) continuous scale (vs. discrete ratings), and (d) separate ratings (vs. comparative scales). Though effect sizes will be standardized, the original measurement scale still could contribute additional variance that should be adjusted for. STEM ability and verbal ability stereotypes will be analyzed in separate statistical models, except when directing comparing their overall magnitude (in that case, both will be included in the same model to account for their correlation).\n\nMETA-ANALYSIS 2: Our core prediction for Meta-Analysis 2 is that pro-male STEM and pro-male female ability stereotypes should relate to motivational STEM outcomes negatively for girls and positively for boys. We will test these basic predictions with four separate random-effects models for the four broad categories of correlations (see Table 9), along with characterizing their overall heterogeneity. Two additional mixed-effects models (bottom rows of Table 9) will directly examine average differences between boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 correlations by including one moderator for gender. For the correlations between girls\u2019 STEM ability stereotypes and STEM motivational outcomes, we will conduct additional moderator analyses using mixed-effects models. We focus on this category of correlations in part because we expect to obtain the most primary data for it (relative to other categories).\n\nSELECTIVE REPORTING BIAS ANALYSES: Though we will use several systematic search methods to find unpublished studies, our conclusions may nevertheless be subject to selective reporting bias (e.g., publication bias or outcome reporting bias). Researchers may be cautious to report results conflicting with commonly accepted theory and research hypotheses. As detailed in Appendix D in the uploaded protocol document, we will use three approaches as sensitivity analyses to diagnose and adjust for such biases: (a) selection modeling, (b) comparison of unpublished versus published studies, and (c) meta-regression to assess small-study effects. If the three approaches yield diverging conclusions, we will place the greatest weight on selection models for reasons detailed in Appendix D. Simulation studies have shown superior performance for selection models, compared to other publication bias methods, in several conditions that may likely characterize our meta-analysis such as moderate to large between-study heterogeneity (Carter, Sch\u00f6nbrodt, Gervais, &amp; Hilgard, 2019).", "q19.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e4da067b8c2e501954c6893", "file_name":

or the lack thereof, plays in shaping educational inequality. Basic needs \u2013 like stable housing \u2013 are essential for students to learn and flourish (Maslow, 1943). Moreover, recent research has highlighted the substantial challenges today\u2019s students face in securing the most basic needs such as food and housing (Goldrick-Rab, Richardson, &amp; Kinsley, 2017; Hallett, Crutchfield, &amp; Maguire, 2019; Martinez, Frongillo, Leung, &amp; Ritchie).\nThe Southern Scholarship Foundation (SSF) program aims to create an array of both qualitative and quantitative improvements in students\u2019 lives. For example, students are given the opportunity to become part of a social network and community with housemates, which may affect their self-esteem, sense of belonging in college, and mental health. They are also relieved of a key source of financial pressure\u2014rent\u2014which has the potential to reduce their need to take on student debt or work long hours. Accepted applicants pay a semester food and utility bill averaging $900 and live in houses with approximately 10-30 students per house.\nEach year, SSF receives about 25 times more applicants than it has spaces available in its houses, and when narrowed to qualified applicants, the ratio of applicants to spaces is about 3:1. This oversubscription provides an opportunity for randomization to examine the impact of the program through a randomized-control trial.\nUnder normal circumstances in which SSF selects participants, students receiving rent-free housing may have a higher or lower propensity to persist in college, even without the program. Those outcomes, in other words, may be predicted by their pre-existing characteristics that shaped program participation in the first place. We therefore propose an approach that introduces a selection process to cleanly distinguish non-participants from participants.

Other variables described herein are expected to be more relevant predictors, moderators, and mediators of student outcomes.\nThe research team will use National Student Clearinghouse data to monitor student stop-out (when a student decides to take a break from higher education for at least one term) and transfer to another campus, as these data include enrollment outside of the participating institution. Students who have not graduated from participating institutions, are no longer enrolled, and do not appear in the Clearinghouse data will likely no longer be in college. In this case, attrition from the sample will indicate a negative outcome (i.e., failure to complete or persist in college). Some proximate outcomes, such as student grades, finances, and social-psychological well-being, will not be observable for some students who stop out (although we will attempt to survey all students, including those who have stopped out). For outcomes that could be affected by attrition, analyses will be approached with caution and, when necessary, bounds will be created based on assumptions about best- and worse-case scenarios for students who have stopped out. In these cases, appropriate caveats concerning potential biases due to attrition will accompany all estimates. \nWithin-house spillover of the housing scholarship from treatment to control students is unlikely as the scholarship can be administered to only one student\u2014 it is not information that could be transferred and it cannot be shared. \nThe contrast between conditions (our primary independent variable) will be as listed below. \nThis independent variable of assignment to the housing scholarship is measured between-participant; we plan to control for and may also include fixed effects to capture institutional and gender blocks, as noted below.

All analyses will account for student-level heterogeneity when computing standard errors, and house-specific fixed effects employed where appropriate. \nIn Equation (1), \u03b2 represents the treatment impact, the average improvement in outcome yi for the treatment group relative to the control group. If the housing scholarships are effective, estimates of \u03b2 are expected to be positive, statistically significant, and substantively important. The impacts of the housing scholarship may be moderated by financial, academic, and demographic characteristics. For example, students with greater financial need, such as those with zero expected family contribution to college costs, may benefit more from the scholarship. To study whether these moderators are associated with heterogeneous impacts of the housing scholarship, an interaction between the relevant moderator and Treatmenti will be added to Equation (1). Substantively and statistically significant coefficients on these interaction terms will imply that the housing scholarship are more effective for students in those subgroups. \nObservations with missing data will be dropped from analyses for which their data are incomplete.

However, the opposite may be true\u2014if students with more unmet need benefit more from the program but are less likely to be included, it may not reduce equity gaps in outcomes. Similarly, the housing scholarship may have a greater impact on the outcomes of students who have demonstrated higher academic achievement before grant receipt, in the form of a higher GPA or more accumulated credits, who are more capable of meeting graduation requirements. In addition, high school grade point average (GPA) affects short- and longer-term outcomes, as a predictor of academic success in college and \u2013 more importantly for this study \u2013 as both an eligibility requirement for the housing scholarship and potentially as a moderator of access to merit aid scholarships for college (at different levels of support depending on academic performance) that may yield higher positive effects for students eligible for SSF and below the Bright Futures scholarship thresholds. \nTo whom the housing scholarship should be targeted is of great interest to universities and philanthropic foundations offering support to college students. To maximize return on investment, they may seek to target supports to students with higher graduation probabilities. But this focus may not be cost-effective if those students would have graduated without the support. Analyses of impacts by predicted graduation probability can help institutions better target support to students whose graduation outcomes the intervention is most likely to improve. \nMediators. An exploratory mediation analysis will examine associations between the housing scholarship and hypothesized mediators.

From a financial standpoint, the housing scholarship may reduce students\u2019 unmet financial need, allowing them to use fewer loans or work less. These financial benefits, in turn, may result in enhanced focus on classwork, improved grades and credit completion, and completion and retention. Likewise, the housing scholarship may improve academic success through social-psychological outcomes.

Basic needs \u2013 like stable housing \u2013 are essential for students to learn and flourish (Maslow, 1943). Moreover, recent research has highlighted the substantial challenges today\u2019s students face in securing the most basic needs such as food and housing (Goldrick-Rab, Richardson, &amp; Kinsley, 2017; Hallett, Crutchfield, &amp; Maguire, 2019; Martinez, Frongillo, Leung, &amp; Ritchie).\nThe Southern Scholarship Foundation (SSF) program aims to create an array of both qualitative and quantitative improvements in students\u2019 lives. For example, students are given the opportunity to become part of a social network and community with housemates, which may affect their self-esteem, sense of belonging in college, and mental health. They are also relieved of a key source of financial pressure\u2014rent\u2014which has the potential to reduce their need to take on student debt or work long hours. Accepted applicants pay a semester food and utility bill averaging $900 and live in houses with approximately 10-30 students per house.\nEach year, SSF receives about 25 times more applicants than it has spaces available in its houses, and when narrowed to qualified applicants, the ratio of applicants to spaces is about 3:1. This oversubscription provides an opportunity for randomization to examine the impact of the program through a randomized-control trial.\nUnder normal circumstances in which SSF selects participants, students receiving rent-free housing may have a higher or lower propensity to persist in college, even without the program. Those outcomes, in other words, may be predicted by their pre-existing characteristics that shaped program participation in the first place.

With approximately 300 treated students, the power analysis indicates that pooling eight universities (of the nine that have indicated intent to participate) will yield sufficient power to detect an effect as small as a .333 MRES change in degree completion. The average effect sizes implied by the power analysis are reasonable for this intervention. While little data on the impacts of housing scholarships are available, and colleges do not publish graduation rates for near-completers, preliminary descriptive evidence from other studies, several led by Goldrick-Rab, pending publication is promising. ", "q15": "See description of Data Collection above.", "q20": "None at this time.", "q21": "We will use the standard What Works Clearinghouse guidelines and present impacts using Effect Size and standard error based on Ordinary Least Squares regression techniques. We will highlight results that show a statistical significance of p&lt;0.05 as statistically significant and may also discuss results with p&lt;0.10 as relevant to future study.", "q22": "Students will be excluded from the study when they are not eligible for the application as per above. Data will be excluded from analysis based on WWC standards. Data will not be reported for groups smaller than 10 and outliers may receive special treatment by being excluded or having a flag in all analyses relevant to the outlying data.", "q23": "All observations with missing data will be dropped from the initial analysis. Subsequent sensitivity analyses using missing data imputation techniques will be completed after the initial analysis.", "q24": "Moderators. Financial, academic, and demographic moderators may affect the relationship between the housing scholarship and academic success; they will be examined as outcomes above but also used as covariates or moderators in analyses of the primary outcome. Students with less unmet need might benefit more from receiving grants because the extra funds are more likely to fully resolve their financial challenges. However, the opposite may be true\u2014if students with more unmet need benefit more from the program but are less likely to be included, it may not reduce equity gaps in outcomes. Similarly, the housing scholarship may have a greater impact on the outcomes of students who have demonstrated higher academic achievement before grant receipt, in the form of a higher GPA or more accumulated credits, who are more capable of meeting graduation requirements. In addition, high school grade point average (GPA) affects short- and longer-term outcomes, as a predictor of academic success in college and \u2013 more importantly for this study \u2013 as both an eligibility requirement for the housing scholarship and potentially as a moderator of access to merit aid scholarships for college (at different levels of support depending on academic performance) that may yield higher positive effects for students eligible for SSF and below the Bright Futures scholarship thresholds. \nTo whom the housing scholarship should be targeted is of great interest to universities and philanthropic foundations offering support to college students. To maximize return on investment, they may seek to target supports to students with higher graduation probabilities. But this focus may not be cost-effective if those students would have graduated without the support. Analyses of impacts by predicted graduation probability can help institutions better target support to students whose graduation outcomes the intervention is most likely to improve. \nMediators. An exploratory mediation analysis will examine associations between the housing scholarship and hypothesized mediators. Listed under intermediate outcomes above, several mediators might account for any relationship between the housing scholarship and distal outcomes. These mediators fall into two categories of proximal outcomes\u2014financial and social-psychological. From a financial standpoint, the housing scholarship may reduce students\u2019 unmet financial need, allowing them to use fewer loans or work less. These financial benefits, in turn, may result in enhanced focus on classwork, improved grades and credit completion, and completion and retention. Likewise, the housing scholarship may improve academic success through social-psychological outcomes. We will also investigate any potentially mediating effects of majoring in postsecondary STEM fields (25% of our year 1 sample), which may compete with students\u2019 available time for paid work while studying and may negatively affect their college GPAs, with potential consequences for their merit aid renewal.", "q25": "References\n\nAlon, S.

This number is expected to be 300 treated students and a corresponding number of controls by the completion of the project, but will vary each cycle depending on the number of open beds and total applicants.\n\nAnalysis. Given the variation in size between the smaller and larger housing blocks, with the largest being a 3-campus share in Tallahassee, FL (Florida State University, Tallahassee Community College, and Flagler College-Tallahassee), we will assess in descriptive and predictive models any block-specific patterns in student outcomes, albeit primarily for diagnostic purposes. With any block-specific patterns identified, we will use OLS regression analysis to examine the treatment impact on the dependent variables/outcomes while controlling for any unbalanced characteristics at each level according to What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) standards. Other variables described herein are expected to be more relevant predictors, moderators, and mediators of student outcomes.\nThe research team will use National Student Clearinghouse data to monitor student stop-out (when a student decides to take a break from higher education for at least one term) and transfer to another campus, as these data include enrollment outside of the participating institution. Students who have not graduated from participating institutions, are no longer enrolled, and do not appear in the Clearinghouse data will likely no longer be in college. In this case, attrition from the sample will indicate a negative outcome (i.e., failure to complete or persist in college). Some proximate outcomes, such as student grades, finances, and social-psychological well-being, will not be observable for some students who stop out (although we will attempt to survey all students, including those who have stopped out). For outcomes that could be affected by attrition, analyses will be approached with caution and, when necessary, bounds will be created based on assumptions about best- and worse-case scenarios for students who have stopped out. In these cases, appropriate caveats concerning potential biases due to attrition will accompany all estimates. \nWithin-house spillover of the housing scholarship from treatment to control students is unlikely as the scholarship can be administered to only one student\u2014 it is not information that could be transferred and it cannot be shared. \nThe contrast between conditions (our primary independent variable) will be as listed below. \nThis independent variable of assignment to the housing scholarship is measured between-participant; we plan to control for and may also include fixed effects to capture institutional and gender blocks, as noted below. Given the size of the random assignment blocks, our hypothesized relationships focus on orthogonal relationships between the independent and dependent variables.", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Students will be excluded from the study when they are not eligible for the application as per above. Data will be excluded from analysis based on WWC standards. Data will not be reported for groups smaller than 10 and outliers may receive special treatment by being excluded or having a flag in all analyses relevant to the outlying data.\n\nAdministrative data: Data will be collected from the application to the scholarship. During the evaluation period, the SSF application is amended to obtain consent from all applicants to participation in evaluation. Also, administrative data is collected from institutional representatives and NSC data for all participants will be secured for tracking academic outcomes.\n\nSurvey data: Surveys will be administered to all applicants to the program. Follow-up surveys at 6-12 months will be administered to all treatment and control students.\nData is collected from students via surveys at baseline and via an annual follow-up all students receive at least 6 months after receiving notice of the housing scholarship award and individual interviews of a stratified random sample of treatment and control students, in the semester following their intended enrollment into the scholarship houses or an alternative housing arrangement. Administrative data from NSC will be collected through 2021 to secure longitudinal outcomes of the scholarship, in addition to semi-annual administrative data updates from SSF regarding residential movement in and out of houses and acceptance of scholarship offers.\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "The contrast between conditions (our primary independent variable) will be as listed below. \nThis independent variable manipulated is assignment to the housing scholarship is measured between-participant; we plan to control for and may also include fixed effects to capture institutional and gender blocks, as noted below. Given the size of the random assignment blocks, our hypothesized relationships focus on orthogonal relationships between the independent and dependent variables.\nRandom assignment. Assignment is done within-institution and blocked by gender. Campuses that are geographically isolated (i.e., Florida Gulf Coast University) or have campus-specific housing stipulations (i.e., Florida A&amp;M University) are blocked as single campus units, albeit broken out by gender given the single-sex design of SSF housing. For campuses that are geographically proximate, they share spaces within the housing block, an arrangement that predates the evaluation design. For example, the Gainesville, Florida location of both Santa Fe College (SFC) and University of Florida (UF) allow the campuses to share a SFC-UF housing block, for women and men interested in SSF housing for those campuses.\n\u2022 Treatment condition. Student offered the housing scholarship after applying to receive the scholarship, after having been deemed eligible on the stated criteria: an Expected Family Contribution of no more than $7,500, a minimum 3.0 unweighted state GPA or 675 GED score, university acceptance at one of the seven university partners, and excellent character as deemed from the letters of recommendation as pertain to service in the community, work, and academics.\n\u2022 Control condition.

The primary goal of the project is to measure the impact of the housing scholarship on degree completion rates within 100% (4 years) and 150% (6 years) of when students began attending the university. Most students will have been enrolled for 0-1 years at the study\u2019s inception but will remain enrolled in the housing scholarship program and postsecondary education for an additional 2-5 years depending on whether they are entering the study as a community college transfer, a second-year student, or a first time in college student. As described, the program will obtain graduation data from participating institutions and share with researchers. This data will be supplemented with National Student Clearinghouse information to better capture outcomes of transfer students. \nNear and Intermediate outcomes. In addition, a number of proximal outcomes of interest will include enrollment and persistence in subsequent terms, measured using administrative data (e.g., semester-to-semester retention, credits completed, and GPA), effective use of financial aid, including FAFSA application and strategic use of loans; reductions in food insecurity and financial stress, measured with surveys; and improvements in housing quality and stability, measured in follow-up surveys.\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "Some mediating and moderating variables such as financial stress or basic needs insecurity (food and housing) may be examined using an index. In these analyses we will follow the analytic process for creating index measures as described in the \"Guide to assessing basic needs insecurity in higher education\" (Sara Goldrick-Rab, Christine Baker-Smith, Vanessa Coca, and Elizabeth Looker 2019).", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "To identify institution-specific causal impacts of the housing scholarship, equation (1) will be estimated: (1) yi = \u03b1 + \u03b2 * Treatmenti + Xi + \u03b5i where yi represents an outcome for student i; Treatmenti is an indicator variable for whether a student was assigned to the treatment group; Xi is a vector of additional student-level covariates such as race, gender, family income, unmet need, etc. as available on the application; and \u03b5i is a term for student-specific random error. All analyses will account for student-level heterogeneity when computing standard errors, and house-specific fixed effects employed where appropriate. \nIn Equation (1), \u03b2 represents the treatment impact, the average improvement in outcome yi for the treatment group relative to the control group. If the housing scholarships are effective, estimates of \u03b2 are expected to be positive, statistically significant, and substantively important. The impacts of the housing scholarship may be moderated by financial, academic, and demographic characteristics. For example, students with greater financial need, such as those with zero expected family contribution to college costs, may benefit more from the scholarship. To study whether these moderators are associated with heterogeneous impacts of the housing scholarship, an interaction between the relevant moderator and Treatmenti will be added to Equation (1). Substantively and statistically significant coefficients on these interaction terms will imply that the housing scholarship are more effective for students in those subgroups. \nObservations with missing data will be dropped from analyses for which their data are incomplete. For outcomes from administrative data (including National Student Clearinghouse data)\u2014completion, persistence, financial aid, and academic achievement\u2014few issues with missing data are anticipated. The research team will analyze survey data with caution, particularly if response rates are not balanced between treatment and control students. When necessary, estimates will be bounded with reasonable assumptions of best-case and worst-case scenario outcomes for students with missing data. In these cases, estimates will be accompanied by caveats concerning potential bias due to missing data. \nAlthough the experiment may lack sufficient power for a causal analysis of mediators, exploratory mediation analysis will provide evidence of correlations between the housing scholarship and hypothesized mediators. This work will indicate potential mechanisms for how the housing scholarship improve academic outcomes and suggest avenues for future research. For analysis of fidelity of implementation outcomes, researchers will examine treatment and control students\u2019 presence in the scholarship houses as per house-records. These analyses will use simple counts and means and analysis of institutional communications, respectively. Additionally, exploratory analysis of survey results and in-person interviews will inform implementation analysis and any potential moderation implementation has on the impacts.\n", "q19.uploader":

asthma and COPD\n\nINTRODUCTION \nRationale. \nIn Canada, 91% of adults use the Internet regularly and 76% own a smartphone.[1] Consequently, mobile Internet-enabled devices like smartphones and tablets are increasingly being incorporated into the delivery of healthcare.  These technologies and applications, referred to as \u201cmHealth\u201d, can be leveraged for health data collection, health monitoring, patient education, behaviour change promotion, and enhancing communication between patients and physicians.[2] \nOne area in which mHealth solutions have significant potential is the evolving healthcare needs of aging populations. mHealth can provide older adults with medication assistance, and improve disease self-management, monitoring, and patient education.[3\u20135] Though this area of mHealth is still developing and rigorous clinical evidence is sparse, a scoping review in 2017 of smart device-based mHealth interventions for older adults identified several studies that found mHealth-related improvements in diabetes control, weight retention in patients post-gastrectomy for gastric cancer, and quality of life in patients heart failure.[6] However, there are also important barriers to successfully delivering these technologies to adults 65 years and older,[4] who represent 17.2% of the Canadian population,[7] and account for 45% of national public healthcare expenditure.[8] Access is one obstacle, as daily Internet use and smartphone ownership remain disproportionately lower in older adults despite significant increases in the past 5 years.[1] Usability concerns are another barrier, as functional limitations and age-related challenges are not often considered during mHealth development,[4] and applications developed for a general populations are frequently not suitable for older adult users.[9] Accordingly, a recent scoping review of mHealth for older adults found that despite user interest in older populations, acceptance and engagement with mHealth was \u201clow and inconsistent\u201d.[5]\nAsthma and COPD are two examples of highly prevalent airways diseases in which there is a growing interest in the use of mHealth.[10\u201312] mHealth interventions are particularly well suited to the management of airways diseases, as they can help facilitate the patient self-monitoring and self-management that are integral to effective care in asthma and COPD.[10,11,13] These two diseases are also growing in relevance in older populations, as asthma and COPD prevalence are increasing in older adults in Canada as the population ages,[14,15] and older populations with asthma and COPD have been shown to have disproportionately worse respiratory health outcomes compared to younger patients.[16\u201319] However, little is currently known about the effectiveness and acceptance of airways disease mHealth tools,  specifically in older adult populations, nor how older adults have been incorporated into asthma and COPD mHealth research cycles.[5,11,12,20\u201322] Given this lack of knowledge, a scoping review is an appropriate initial strategy to explore these questions, as it can be used to \u201cexamine broad areas to identify gaps in the evidence, clarify key concepts, and report on the types of evidence that address and inform practice\u201d.[23] A scoping review will help to contextualize the current state of knowledge related to mHealth use and development in older patients with asthma and COPD, and will guide future study in this evolving field. \n\nObjectives. \nTo comprehensively review mobile health research in adult patients with asthma and COPD in order to:\n1) Examine age-based inclusion/exclusion criteria applied in primary studies of mHealth interventions as well as the proportion of recruited adults aged 65 years or older\n2) Identify any reported mHealth implementation strategies and/or effectiveness outcomes that addressed patient age or are stratified by patient age.\n3) Determine if and how older adults were included and specifically considered in the development process for each identified mHealth intervention\n\nThis protocol was developed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Scoping Review Checklist (PRISMA-ScR),[24] the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer Manual for scoping reviews,[25] and revised by team members.  \n\nMETHODS\nEligibility Criteria. \nStudies of interest will be those that report on the clinical evaluation of an mHealth tool targeting the management of any airways disease in adult patients, in primary or specialized care.  Acceptable study designs will include randomized controlled trials, retrospective or prospective observational studies, quasi-experimental designs (i.e. controlled before-and-after studies, interrupted time series analysis), and qualitative studies.  We will include studies which:  1) recruited adult patients; 2) targeted asthma or COPD; 3) were published after 2010 (this is consistent with other mHealth reviews and represents the time at which smartphones and tablets became widely adopted in North America);[6] 4) study an mHealth intervention as defined by the World Health Organization,[26] and 5) were published in English or French.  Studies in which the mHealth intervention is only a short message service (i.e. text-message or SMS) will be excluded, as this represents a limited and traditional definition of mHealth that doesn\u2019t capture the complexity of mHealth applications using the full feature set of smart-devices available today, such as applications and interactive touch screens.[6] As such, age-related issues with SMS-only mHealth are unlikely to fully encompass those that may arise with more complex modern mHealth applications.\n\nInformation sources. \nAn experienced information scientist will complete the search and a second will independently appraise it using the PRESS checklist.[27] The search strategy will begin by identifying important keywords through a limited search of highly relevant articles in eHealth journals, and these keywords will then be used to search Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials for relevant research published after January 1st, 2010.  Following this, reference lists of included articles will also be searched for further relevant research reports. The grey literature will also be searched using both Google Scholar as well as the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) practical grey literature searching tool.[28] The search may be revised iteratively to include new important search terms as the reviewers become more familiar with the field. The initial search will begin in April 2020.\n\nSelection of Sources of Evidence. \nTwo reviewers will assess studies independently for inclusion in the scoping review and perform data abstraction.  Screening will begin with titles and abstracts, and then proceed to full text review.  At each stage, the two reviewers will perform a calibration exercise using a random sample of references (50 for abstract and title screening, and 25 for full text screening), identifying the level of agreement for inclusion/exclusion decisions, and discussing any disagreements.  Once a level of agreement &gt;80% has been achieved, the remaining references will be screened.[29] Following screening, data abstraction will be performed. A calibration exercise on 5 randomly selected included studies will be performed as detailed above prior to full abstraction. Among the mHealth intervention studies, information regarding the study population (geographic location, demographic descriptors, age distribution, disease-related descriptors, and any inclusion of caregivers/family members), study methodology (study design type and setting), and the intervention (type of mHealth technology [i.e. mobile phone, tablet, smartwatch], nature of mHealth intervention [detailed description], target user outcomes [i.e. uptake, knowledge, behaviour], and any effort to address older age in implementation strategies) will be extracted. A priori inclusion/exclusion criteria for age as well any age-based recruitment quotas will be extracted.  Any reporting of study outcomes stratified by age will be extracted.  Following this, studies will be reviewed for any reference to publication(s) describing the original development of the mHealth tool, and identified reports will be retrieved and reviewed to extract information regarding the age distribution of patients involved in tool development (if any), details regarding the methods used in tool development (i.e. usability testing, qualitative methods, etc.), and any mention of age-related development considerations.  In studies without reference to relevant mHealth development work, study authors (first and last) will be contacted by email (2 attempts, 1 week apart) to inquire about development processes using a standardized questionnaire.\n\nData Charting Process. \nA data-charting form will be jointly developed by the two reviewers and discussed with the research supervisor. Two reviewers will independently chart the data, discussing the results and any disagreements.  Data charting will be iteratively updated based on these discussions. Specifically, the proportion of mHealth intervention studies including adults 65 years and older will be presented, stratifying by study methodology, inclusion/exclusion criteria description, and disease type.  Next, any outcomes stratified by age will be presented.  Finally, the age distributions and methodologies in accompanying development studies will be similarly charted.  \n\nRegistration and reporting. \nThis protocol will be registered online in Open Science Framework.  Study methods and results will be reported using PRISMA-ScR checklist.[24]\n\nPotential Limitations. \t\nWhile a scoping review will help to identify the existing body of literature pertaining to mHealth research in older adults with airways disease, one important limitation of this type of review strategy is that it is not designed to assess the methodological quality of identified research.[30] As this research area further develops over time, a systematic review strategy would be warranted to assess the quality of available research. Additionally, only works published in English and French, and after 2010 will be searched. Though this might exclude some early mHealth research, 2010 is a commonly used cut-off in contemporaneous mHealth research, as this is the date by which smartphone and tablet use was considered to be widely adopted across North America.[6]\n\nPotential outputs. \nThis scoping review will comprehensively map the current state of mHealth research in airways disease at it pertains to the inclusion and consideration of older adults.  Based on our initial literature review, we are likely to find that in asthma mHealth, few studies include an asthma-population representative proportion of adults 65 years and older.  In COPD, older adults will make up a much larger proportion of implementation study participants, but their perspectives and needs may not often be specifically considered during development research.  When present, the methods used to specifically include the input of older adults in mHealth development are likely to vary, from referencing work done in other tools, to formal usability testing, to qualitative inquiry. These results will help to further contextualize the existing evidence gaps identified in our literature review and will guide future efforts to study, and ultimately to improve upon airways disease mHealth tools.  \n\nREFERENCES\n1.

These technologies and applications, referred to as \u201cmHealth\u201d, can be leveraged for health data collection, health monitoring, patient education, behaviour change promotion, and enhancing communication between patients and physicians.[2] \nOne area in which mHealth solutions have significant potential is the evolving healthcare needs of aging populations. mHealth can provide older adults with medication assistance, and improve disease self-management, monitoring, and patient education.[3\u20135] Though this area of mHealth is still developing and rigorous clinical evidence is sparse, a scoping review in 2017 of smart device-based mHealth interventions for older adults identified several studies that found mHealth-related improvements in diabetes control, weight retention in patients post-gastrectomy for gastric cancer, and quality of life in patients heart failure.[6] However, there are also important barriers to successfully delivering these technologies to adults 65 years and older,[4] who represent 17.2% of the Canadian population,[7] and account for 45% of national public healthcare expenditure.[8] Access is one obstacle, as daily Internet use and smartphone ownership remain disproportionately lower in older adults despite significant increases in the past 5 years.[1] Usability concerns are another barrier, as functional limitations and age-related challenges are not often considered during mHealth development,[4] and applications developed for a general populations are frequently not suitable for older adult users.[9] Accordingly, a recent scoping review of mHealth for older adults found that despite user interest in older populations, acceptance and engagement with mHealth was \u201clow and inconsistent\u201d.[5]\nAsthma and COPD are two examples of highly prevalent airways diseases in which there is a growing interest in the use of mHealth.[10\u201312] mHealth interventions are particularly well suited to the management of airways diseases, as they can help facilitate the patient self-monitoring and self-management that are integral to effective care in asthma and COPD.[10,11,13] These two diseases are also growing in relevance in older populations, as asthma and COPD prevalence are increasing in older adults in Canada as the population ages,[14,15] and older populations with asthma and COPD have been shown to have disproportionately worse respiratory health outcomes compared to younger patients.[16\u201319] However, little is currently known about the effectiveness and acceptance of airways disease mHealth tools,  specifically in older adult populations, nor how older adults have been incorporated into asthma and COPD mHealth research cycles.[5,11,12,20\u201322] Given this lack of knowledge, a scoping review is an appropriate initial strategy to explore these questions, as it can be used to \u201cexamine broad areas to identify gaps in the evidence, clarify key concepts, and report on the types of evidence that address and inform practice\u201d.[23] A scoping review will help to contextualize the current state of knowledge related to mHealth use and development in older patients with asthma and COPD, and will guide future study in this evolving field. \n\nObjectives. \nTo comprehensively review mobile health research in adult patients with asthma and COPD in order to:\n1) Examine age-based inclusion/exclusion criteria applied in primary studies of mHealth interventions as well as the proportion of recruited adults aged 65 years or older\n2) Identify any reported mHealth implementation strategies and/or effectiveness outcomes that addressed patient age or are stratified by patient age.\n3) Determine if and how older adults were included and specifically considered in the development process for each identified mHealth intervention\n\nThis protocol was developed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Scoping Review Checklist (PRISMA-ScR),[24] the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer Manual for scoping reviews,[25] and revised by team members.  \n\nMETHODS\nEligibility Criteria. \nStudies of interest will be those that report on the clinical evaluation of an mHealth tool targeting the management of any airways disease in adult patients, in primary or specialized care.  Acceptable study designs will include randomized controlled trials, retrospective or prospective observational studies, quasi-experimental designs (i.e. controlled before-and-after studies, interrupted time series analysis), and qualitative studies.  We will include studies which:  1) recruited adult patients; 2) targeted asthma or COPD; 3) were published after 2010 (this is consistent with other mHealth reviews and represents the time at which smartphones and tablets became widely adopted in North America);[6] 4) study an mHealth intervention as defined by the World Health Organization,[26] and 5) were published in English or French.  Studies in which the mHealth intervention is only a short message service (i.e. text-message or SMS) will be excluded, as this represents a limited and traditional definition of mHealth that doesn\u2019t capture the complexity of mHealth applications using the full feature set of smart-devices available today, such as applications and interactive touch screens.[6] As such, age-related issues with SMS-only mHealth are unlikely to fully encompass those that may arise with more complex modern mHealth applications.\n\nInformation sources. \nAn experienced information scientist will complete the search and a second will independently appraise it using the PRESS checklist.[27] The search strategy will begin by identifying important keywords through a limited search of highly relevant articles in eHealth journals, and these keywords will then be used to search Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials for relevant research published after January 1st, 2010.  Following this, reference lists of included articles will also be searched for further relevant research reports. The grey literature will also be searched using both Google Scholar as well as the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) practical grey literature searching tool.[28] The search may be revised iteratively to include new important search terms as the reviewers become more familiar with the field. The initial search will begin in April 2020.\n\nSelection of Sources of Evidence. \nTwo reviewers will assess studies independently for inclusion in the scoping review and perform data abstraction.  Screening will begin with titles and abstracts, and then proceed to full text review.  At each stage, the two reviewers will perform a calibration exercise using a random sample of references (50 for abstract and title screening, and 25 for full text screening), identifying the level of agreement for inclusion/exclusion decisions, and discussing any disagreements.  Once a level of agreement &gt;80% has been achieved, the remaining references will be screened.[29] Following screening, data abstraction will be performed. A calibration exercise on 5 randomly selected included studies will be performed as detailed above prior to full abstraction. Among the mHealth intervention studies, information regarding the study population (geographic location, demographic descriptors, age distribution, disease-related descriptors, and any inclusion of caregivers/family members), study methodology (study design type and setting), and the intervention (type of mHealth technology [i.e. mobile phone, tablet, smartwatch], nature of mHealth intervention [detailed description], target user outcomes [i.e. uptake, knowledge, behaviour], and any effort to address older age in implementation strategies) will be extracted. A priori inclusion/exclusion criteria for age as well any age-based recruitment quotas will be extracted.  Any reporting of study outcomes stratified by age will be extracted.  Following this, studies will be reviewed for any reference to publication(s) describing the original development of the mHealth tool, and identified reports will be retrieved and reviewed to extract information regarding the age distribution of patients involved in tool development (if any), details regarding the methods used in tool development (i.e. usability testing, qualitative methods, etc.), and any mention of age-related development considerations.  In studies without reference to relevant mHealth development work, study authors (first and last) will be contacted by email (2 attempts, 1 week apart) to inquire about development processes using a standardized questionnaire.\n\nData Charting Process. \nA data-charting form will be jointly developed by the two reviewers and discussed with the research supervisor. Two reviewers will independently chart the data, discussing the results and any disagreements.  Data charting will be iteratively updated based on these discussions. Specifically, the proportion of mHealth intervention studies including adults 65 years and older will be presented, stratifying by study methodology, inclusion/exclusion criteria description, and disease type.  Next, any outcomes stratified by age will be presented.  Finally, the age distributions and methodologies in accompanying development studies will be similarly charted.  \n\nRegistration and reporting. \nThis protocol will be registered online in Open Science Framework.  Study methods and results will be reported using PRISMA-ScR checklist.[24]\n\nPotential Limitations. \t\nWhile a scoping review will help to identify the existing body of literature pertaining to mHealth research in older adults with airways disease, one important limitation of this type of review strategy is that it is not designed to assess the methodological quality of identified research.[30] As this research area further develops over time, a systematic review strategy would be warranted to assess the quality of available research. Additionally, only works published in English and French, and after 2010 will be searched. Though this might exclude some early mHealth research, 2010 is a commonly used cut-off in contemporaneous mHealth research, as this is the date by which smartphone and tablet use was considered to be widely adopted across North America.[6]\n\nPotential outputs. \nThis scoping review will comprehensively map the current state of mHealth research in airways disease at it pertains to the inclusion and consideration of older adults.
