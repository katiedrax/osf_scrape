Despite the potential importance of constituency service to distributive politics, we have little rigorous empirical data to determine whether or not politicians in developing countries are engaging in this form of behavior. The established view in political science posits that the distribution of state benefits is most often shaped by patron-client relations at the local level. Yet, there is substantial qualitative evidence to suggest that politicians at higher levels of government in developing countries such as India spend substantial time and effort offering direct assistance to individual citizens.

Indian politicians via a text message- and WhatsApp-based audit of politician responses to requests for assistance from fictitious individuals in their constituency. I test whether state-level politicians in India respond to requests for assistance with basic public goods from individual citizens who send them a phone-based message and whether the propensity to provide assistance is affected by indicators of partisan support, past voting behavior, or attempts to acquire assistance at other levels of government. Despite the potential importance of constituency service to distributive politics, we have little rigorous empirical data to determine whether or not politicians in developing countries are engaging in this form of behavior. The established view in political science posits that the distribution of state benefits is most often shaped by patron-client relations at the local level. Yet, there is substantial qualitative evidence to suggest that politicians at higher levels of government in developing countries such as India spend substantial time and effort offering direct assistance to individual citizens. This experiment--with politicians from across all of India--will allow us to test whether these claims can be substantiated generally and whether this assistance constitutes a form of non-partisan representation understood as constituency service.", "q16": "I will collect data on response rates, the timing of responses, and response content in order to test the following primary hypotheses: - Politicians will attempt to help citizens requesting assistance, even when they have no information on that individual\u2019s partisan affiliation or voting record. - Having information on a petitioner\u2019s shared partisan affiliation will have a positive effect on the likelihood that a politician will attempt to provide assistance, but that this effect will be small relative to the baseline response level - Knowledge of a petitioner\u2019s past voting behavior in favor of the politician will have a positive effect on a politician\u2019s willingness to provide assistance and this will be larger than the effect for co-partisanship. - Having information on a petitioner\u2019s lack of success in acquiring assistance from a local politician will increase an MLA\u2019s willingness to provide assistance, and that this will be magnified by information on perceived partisan blocking at the local level (i.e. the indication that a petitioner is of a different party affiliation than the local politician). - In general, politicians will be more likely to respond to requests for individual level goods (ration card) than group goods (street lamp). - Knowledge of shared partisanship or past vote for a candidate will increase the likelihood of response for group goods (street lamp), more than for individual goods (ration card). - Having information on shared caste group or shared religion with the petitioner will have a positive effect on the likelihood that a politician will attempt to provide assistance, but that this effect will be small relative to the baseline response

plan to study political incivility--the tendency to demonize the outgroup (political party or movement) in such a way that makes the genuine exchange of ideas impossible. I will select subjects by searching Twitter for those people who respond to the two major presidential candidates (@realDonaldTrump and @hillaryclinton) and speak aggressively/with incivility towards another non-elite Twitter user supporting the opposite position. I will control \"bots\" that will sanction subjects engaged in this behavior. I will manipulate the partisan identity of the bot, as well as the language of the sanctioning, in order to test theories about suasion based on Moral Foundations Theory. The goal is to decrease the incidence of aggressive or incivil discussion on Twitter, which has been shown to have a chilling effect on political discourse and to increased perceived polarization between members of different parties."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "The primary outcome variables are aggression and incivility. I measure aggression with a machine learning model trained on Wikipedia comments (based on a labeled data set from crowdsourcing) that is designed to identify comments that attack someone else. Incivility is defined as impoliteness when discussing fundamental poltical topics (see http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2657074), and is defined through the presence of aggression and topics of fundamental political importance. With these outcome variables, I have a 3x2 experimental design, with 2 different subject pools. For people I identify as conservatives, I have two bot identities from which they could receive sanctioning: a bot with many pro-Rebublican signifiers on their profile, and one with many pro-Trump signifiers. From these two types of bots, the subjects will recieve one of 3 tweetments. This manipulation intends to test Moral Foundations Theory, by seeing how different kinds of moral appeals are more effective among liberals and conservatives. I will use one message that appeals to the Care moral foundation, and should be more effective on liberals: \"You shouldn't use language like that. [Democrats/Republicans] need to remember that our opponents are real people, with real feelings.\" I will use another message that appeals to the Authority moral foundation, which should appeal more to conservatives: \"You shouldn't use language like that. [Democrats/Republicans] need to behave according to the proper rules of political civility.\" In addition to the true control, I will have another treatment arm that functions as a `placebo check' to measure the effect of getting any message at all. This condition will consist of the message: \"Remember that everything you post here is public. Everyone can see that you tweeted this.\" Analogous Democrat/Hillary bots will tweet at subjects identified as liberal.

I will select subjects by searching Twitter for those people who respond to the two major presidential candidates (@realDonaldTrump and @hillaryclinton) and speak aggressively/with incivility towards another non-elite Twitter user supporting the opposite position. I will control \"bots\" that will sanction subjects engaged in this behavior. I will manipulate the partisan identity of the bot, as well as the language of the sanctioning, in order to test theories about suasion based on Moral Foundations Theory. The goal is to decrease the incidence of aggressive or incivil discussion on Twitter, which has been shown to have a chilling effect on political discourse and to increased perceived polarization between members of different parties.", "q16": "The primary outcome variables are aggression and incivility. I measure aggression with a machine learning model trained on Wikipedia comments (based on a labeled data set from crowdsourcing) that is designed to identify comments that attack someone else. Incivility is defined as impoliteness when discussing fundamental poltical topics (see http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2657074), and is defined through the presence of aggression and topics of fundamental political importance. With these outcome variables, I have a 3x2 experimental design, with 2 different subject pools. For people I identify as conservatives, I have two bot identities from which they could receive sanctioning: a bot with many pro-Rebublican signifiers on their profile, and one with many pro-Trump signifiers. From these two types of bots, the subjects will recieve one of 3 tweetments. This manipulation intends to test Moral Foundations Theory, by seeing how different kinds of moral appeals are more effective among liberals and conservatives. I will use one message that appeals to the Care moral foundation, and should be more effective on liberals: \"You shouldn't use language like that. [Democrats/Republicans] need to remember that our opponents are real people, with real feelings.\" I will use another message that appeals to the Authority moral foundation, which should appeal more to conservatives: \"You shouldn't use language like that. [Democrats/Republicans] need to behave according to the proper rules of political civility.\" In addition to the true control, I will have another treatment arm that functions as a `placebo check' to measure the effect of getting any message at all. This condition will consist of the message: \"Remember that everything you post here is public. Everyone can see that you tweeted this.\" Analogous Democrat/Hillary bots will tweet at subjects identified as liberal. The main hypothesis is that the Care argument will appeal more to liberals and that the Authority argument more to conservatives, and that these treatment groups will experience a significantly greater reduction in aggression/incivility than the placebos.

Minibuses in the Republic of Georgia represent one of the main forms of inter and intracity transportation. The minibus market however is nearly entirely unregulated, and minibuses are a significant cause of road accidents and deaths in the Republic of Georgia, as well as in the former Soviet space more generally. The project aims to test whether an inexpensive, unannounced monitoring program could lead to safer driving practices among minibus drivers. To test whether monitoring and a safe driving prize incentivize drivers to drive safer, we will carry out two waves of data collection using both a within and between subjects design. For unannounced monitoring to be effective, however, there must be a contamination effect on other drivers. Thus, control group measurements must temporally precede treatment group measurements. Hence, we will measure the control group one week prior to the treatment group in the first and second waves of data collection. Although on the spot randomization is not possible in the present case, routes were first matched on length and direction and then randomly assigned to either treatment or control group. The treatment is informing drivers that monitoring is ongoing. In the treatment group, drivers will be told they are being monitored in the first round of data collection, and that they will not be told they are being monitored in the second round which will happen in the near future.

We also expect significant contamination of the control group from treatment group drivers. Minibus drivers are a relatively tight knit group in Georgia and while waiting for passengers, they talk to one another. Based on this we expect contamination and for non-monitored drivers to also improve their driving.

Minibuses in the Republic of Georgia represent one of the main forms of inter and intracity transportation. The minibus market however is nearly entirely unregulated, and minibuses are a significant cause of road accidents and deaths in the Republic of Georgia, as well as in the former Soviet space more generally. The project aims to test whether an inexpensive, unannounced monitoring program could lead to safer driving practices among minibus drivers. To test whether monitoring and a safe driving prize incentivize drivers to drive safer, we will carry out two waves of data collection using both a within and between subjects design. For unannounced monitoring to be effective, however, there must be a contamination effect on other drivers. Thus, control group measurements must temporally precede treatment group measurements. Hence, we will measure the control group one week prior to the treatment group in the first and second waves of data collection. Although on the spot randomization is not possible in the present case, routes were first matched on length and direction and then randomly assigned to either treatment or control group. The treatment is informing drivers that monitoring is ongoing. In the treatment group, drivers will be told they are being monitored in the first round of data collection, and that they will not be told they are being monitored in the second round which will happen in the near future. They will also be told that monitoring is ongoing of other drivers without their knowledge.", "q16": "We will test whether monitoring affects driving practices both immediately following treatment, whether there is a lasting impact of being monitored and whether contamination through minibus drivers discussing the project among themselves leads to safer driving practices in the control group. We specifically test the following hypotheses: H1: Monitoring will decrease distracted/dangerous driving practices among the treatment group at treatment; H2: Monitoring and the knowledge that one may be monitored any time in the coming weeks will have a short term, but lasting impact decreasing distracted/dangerous driving practices. We also expect significant contamination of the control group from treatment group drivers. Minibus drivers are a relatively tight knit group in Georgia and while waiting for passengers, they talk to one another. Based on this we expect contamination and for non-monitored drivers to also improve their driving. Hence: H3: Control group drivers will have decreased distracted/dangerous driving practices during the second wave of data collection. Specific measures are given in the pre-analysis plan.", "q17": "There are three types of effects we will measure for the present design: 1. Immediate effect 2. Lasting effect 3.
