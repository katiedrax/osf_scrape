{"data": [{"id": "3jcvp", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Protocol for a scoping review of national policies for healthy ageing in Mainland China from 2016 to 2020", "description": "Background: There is strong political willingness to address healthy ageing in China with the first national policy with a focus on healthy ageing independently released by the Chinese Central Government in 2017. However, there remains limited literature to understand all national polices related to healthy ageing in China over the last five-year planning cycle, from 2016 to 2020. This scoping review will systematically map national policies for healthy ageing in mainland China from 2016 to 2020.\n\nMethods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis: Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) will be used to guide the proposed study. A complete search for healthy ageing-related policy documents satisfying the eligibility criteria will be performed in all departments affiliated to the State Council of China and relevant websites of English and Chinese grey literature. Essential information from all eligible policy documents will be extracted and mapped to a pre-defined two-dimensional framework generated from the World health Organization\u2019s health system building blocks and Rothwell and Zegveld\u2019s innovation policy instrument.\n\nDiscussions: It is anticipated that the results of this study will provide an in-depth overview of national policies of healthy ageing issued between 2016 and 2020 in Mainland China, and aid identification of strengths and gaps in healthy ageing policy response. Findings may facilitate policy makers to optimize the policy formulation related to healthy ageing and realign the national health system to better support the needs of the older population. This study also describes the general paradigm of policy process and essential conceptions used to conduct a systematic study on national policies in China, which might be useful to guide policy research on other topics.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-20T09:59:39.120870", "date_modified": "2020-04-20T09:33:49.684778", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["Healthy ageing, policy, China"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Pengpeng Ye"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "39c0673d5f6563ce15d0f34eed3d9c1d19b6b82dad39705f3e75fb78eb303c9f6570f0852933ebfa14698d6c11e24d083d99b8d6b81ee783e8d8d0856b1f9a290e165a9a7b564be3d3837ed0f6727d5dc06ccd3d4ae2cc0db68eb46dd8a75e8daa1cfc139d47ed10ab977a88cac845b8a07e9b90780c84efd405d92f27fa12ff34e11b9849da50ed983a1ffbc6212d7b", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-20T09:59:39.105528", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Pengpeng Ye, Yuliang Er, Leilei Duan, Anna Palagyi, Rebecca Ivers, Lisa Keay, Maoyi Tian"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Population ageing, while one of humanity\u2019s great successes due to both public health policies and social and economic development, also raises many challenges for society.

This looming demographic shift in China will present considerable social and economic challenges. \n\nIn response to this emerging burden, the 69th World Health Assembly in 2016 adopted the Global Strategy and Action Plan on Ageing and Health. Five strategic objectives with 15 priority areas for action were identified to align with the vision of healthy ageing for all. In China, healthy ageing has subsequently become a key priority in Chinese central government\u2019s agenda for health and development.

Before running the main experiment, the two main purposes of this pre-study are (a) to eleminate images that are unclear (i.e., not clearly recognizable; based on clarity ratings as well as on the standard deviations of other \u2013 valence and arousal \u2013 ratings) and (b) to test whether giving ratings for valence and arousal separately or together influences the respective ratings.\n\n2. Methods \n2.1 Material\nMost silhouettes were acquired through internet search using Google Images (images.google.com) under the creative commons license, searching either directly for silhouettes or pictures that we edited into black-white-silhouettes using GIMP. \n\nWe restricted our image search to images labelled \u201cavailable for reuse with modification\u201d.\nThe sources of the silhouettes are most notably Pixabay (pixabay.com; N = 477), CleanPNG (cleanpng.com; N = 34), and svgsilh (svgsilh.com; N = 32). Twenty silhouettes were created for this project by a graphic designer/illustrator. We collected a wide range of pictures, depicting persons, animals, objects, and scenes, which we indicate in a category column in the database for easier stimulus selection. Special focus was put on collecting positive, negative and neutral pictures of either low, medium, or high arousal. Every picture was scaled and/or cropped to a size of 300 x 300 pixels. \n\nSilhouette Colour Manipulation: We will present the silhouettes in two different versions to the participants. We will provide information on the white-to-black ratio (pixel count of white vs. black pixels) in the database, so that researchers can utilize this control measure in their studies when using material from the database. In addition, we are curious as to how inverted (white on black background) and non-inverted (black on white background) ratings would differ from each other \u2013 if at all. Importantly, we hope that the ratings will remain generally similar at least comparatively among the images, i.e. we expect a correlation between black-on-white and white-on-black images. This manipulation would provide an additional measure for the impact of brightness on emotion ratings.  \n\n2.2 Participants\nAvoiding Valence-Arousal Contamination: \nGroup 1, 4: Rates stimuli on the valence dimension \nGroup 2, 5: Rates stimuli on the arousal dimension \nGroup 3, 6: Rates stimuli on the valence and the arousal dimension\n\nParticipants (students from the University of Vienna) are randomly assigned to one of the six resulting conditions permuting rating mode and colour mode (black-on-white or white-on-black). We stop data collection for the pilot when we reach 100 participants or after March 18, 2020 (data collection will start earliest February 24, 2020).\n\n2.3 Procedure / Data collection\nGeneral Procedure: After the informed consent and demographical data, we will adequately explain the terms valance and/or arousal to the participants, depending on which rating condition the participant is assigned to. After the instruction, the experiment starts. Participants see a silhouette stimulus (300 x 300 px) on a grey background (hex colour #808080) for 2 s. After this time elapsed, the picture disappears and is replaced with the rating scales: the lower rating scale is always on clarity (9 pt likert scale from very unclear to very clear; German: Eindeutigkeit; labels absolut unklar, recht unklar, wei\u00df nicht, recht klar, absolut klar). Above appears either a valence rating scale (9 pt likert scale from very negative to very positive; German: Valenz; labels sehr negativ, recht negativ, neutral, recht positiv, sehr positiv), or an arousal scale (9 pt likert scale from very low to very high; German: Arousal; labels sehr niedrig, recht niedrig, weder hoch noch niedrig, recht hoch, sehr hoch), or both scales. Participants can enter their ratings via clicks on the scales and submit their rating by pressing a button that appears below the scales, or they can skip the rating. After confirming their choice, the next picture appears on screen, and so on. A total of 150 pictures is presented to each participant. We incorporate two attention checks:\n\nAttention Check 1: After all 155 rating trials, a black-and-white picture is shown after which participants have to indicate, what was depicted on it (this will be the same item for all participants) out of a list of answers. Participants who do not answer this question correctly will have failed Attention Check 1.\n\nAttention Check 2/Intrarater Reliability: Following Attention Check 1, for Groups 1, 4 and 3, 6 (Valence rating only, and Valence &amp; Arousal rating), five of the most negatively and five of the most positively rated pictures are repeated (constituting the last 10 trials of the experiment). For Groups 2, 5 (Arousal rating only), five of the least arousing and five of the most arousing pictures are repeated. For those stimuli pairs, both instances of the rating will be tested for correlation (Spearman, see Statistical Analysis). \n\n2.4 Exclusions\nFor each silhouette, participants have the option to skip the rating. Data from participants who skip the rating for more than 50% of the items will be discarded. Moreover, data from participants who fail Attention Check 1 will be discarded. Note: Attention Check 2 will not yet be used for exclusions in this first pilot study.\n\n3 Statistical Analysis \nThe main dependent variables are the average ratings given for each picture, for valence, and for arousal, in the two conditions (Separate or Together).\n\n3.1 Avoiding Valence-Arousal Contamination: \nAs a preliminary check, we will conduct two analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to see whether presenting two rating scales separately has an absolute effect on either of the measures (i.e., positive or negative shift in average ratings for valence or for arousal). We report Bayes factors based on matched models.\n\nFor black-on-white Silhouettes: We will check if ratings from Group 3 differ significantly from those of Groups 1 and 2. This will be done by running an ANOVA with Dimension (Valence vs. Arousal) \u00d7 Condition (Together vs. Separate) as within-picture factors. \n\nFor white-on-black Silhouettes: We will check if ratings from Group 6 differ significantly from those of Groups 4 and 5. This will be done by running an ANOVA with Dimension (Valence vs. Arousal) \u00d7 Condition (Together vs. Separate) as within-picture factors. \n\nMore importantly, we will check whether the ratings of one measure are directly influenced by the ratings for the other measure. For example, we might expect that, after giving a high arousal rating value, participants would tend to give a higher value (and hence more positive value) for valence, and vice versa, e.g. simply because they already hold the cursor closer to these values.\n\nFor this, we will perform four correlation tests (including corresponding Bayes factors). First, taking the average rating values per picture, we correlate the arousal ratings in Separate conditions with the difference between the valence Together and the valence Separate ratings. If significant correlation is found, it means that higher ratings for arousal indeed resulted in higher valence ratings when rated together, as compared to when rated separately. The second correlation is the reverse, testing the influence of valence on arousal: we correlate the valence ratings in Separate condition with the difference between the arousal Together and the arousal Separate ratings. The two additional correlations will be similar, except that the difference will be taken not between rating means, but from ratings SDs (standard deviations): We correlate the arousal rating averages in Separate condition with the difference between the valence Together rating SDs and the valence Separate rating SDs. Vice versa for the effect of valence average on arousal SDs.\n\n3.2 Differences in black-on-white vs. white-on-black\nWe will check in a Silhouette Type (black-on-white vs. white-on-black) x Rating mode (Valence vs. Arousal) ANOVA, if valence and/or arousal ratings diverge significantly from each other, when comparing black silhouettes on white background (Condition 1) to their white silhouette on black background (Condition 2) counterparts. \n\nWe will also conduct a simple correlation test between the ratings obtained in the two conditions, expecting high correlation.\n\n3.3 Attention Check 2/Intrarater Reliability\nThis pre-study will set the threshold on intrarater reliability for the big-scale online rating study, which is to follow. We expect participating students to have a relatively high level of concentration and that they pay proper attention throughout the experiment. The analysis on the correlation for the attention check items (see section 2.3 Procedure / Data collection) will give us an idea on which threshold we should set for the correlation in the following online study.
