Previous research has shown that immigrant attributes such as country of origin, religion, or occupational status have strong effects on natives\u2019 views towards immigrants. However, in a landmark study, Hainmueller and Hopkins (2015) identified an important limitation in the literature: namely, few studies have tested the relative strength of multiple immigrant attributes, and instead have focused solely on the influence of attributes that receive the most attention in the literature on immigration. To mitigate these concerns, Hainmueller and Hopkins (2015) used fully randomized conjoint analysis to test how nine different immigrant attributes affected support for immigrants. Using this approach, Hainmueller and Hopkins found that respondents did indeed prioritize some attributes over others when selecting hypothetical immigrants for admission to the United States. Respondents prioritized immigrants in high-status jobs and immigrants who were educated. They actively discriminated against those who lacked plans to work, entered the country without authorization, were from Iraq, or had low English proficiency. They marginally preferred immigrants who were escaping political or religious persecution, and those who had previously visited the United States legally. They concluded that in the United States, immigration attitudes are motivated by concerns about immigrants\u2019 adherence to national norms, and by their expected economic contribution to the country (sociotropic concerns). Aside from one study that used conjoint analysis to explore multidimensional views towards refugees in western Europe (Bansak, Hainmueller, and Hangartner 2016), no previous research has explored French natives\u2019 preferences for different types of immigrants based on multiple attributes. However, important country-level differences in attitudes towards immigrants may exist (e.g., Citrin and Sides 2008). Drawing inspiration from Hainmueller and Hopkins, we therefore apply conjoint analysis to study attitudes towards immigrants among French natives. We also investigate whether preferences vary by respondents\u2019 experiences of social contact with immigrants\u2014namely, whether French natives who regularly experience positive, everyday contact with immigrants prioritize different immigrant attributes than do low-contact natives. Previous literature on the effects of social contact on prejudice tends to examine prejudice as the main outcome variable and contact as the key explanatory variable.

Previous research has shown that immigrant attributes such as country of origin, religion, or occupational status have strong effects on natives\u2019 views towards immigrants. However, in a landmark study, Hainmueller and Hopkins (2015) identified an important limitation in the literature: namely, few studies have tested the relative strength of multiple immigrant attributes, and instead have focused solely on the influence of attributes that receive the most attention in the literature on immigration. To mitigate these concerns, Hainmueller and Hopkins (2015) used fully randomized conjoint analysis to test how nine different immigrant attributes affected support for immigrants. Using this approach, Hainmueller and Hopkins found that respondents did indeed prioritize some attributes over others when selecting hypothetical immigrants for admission to the United States. Respondents prioritized immigrants in high-status jobs and immigrants who were educated. They actively discriminated against those who lacked plans to work, entered the country without authorization, were from Iraq, or had low English proficiency. They marginally preferred immigrants who were escaping political or religious persecution, and those who had previously visited the United States legally. They concluded that in the United States, immigration attitudes are motivated by concerns about immigrants\u2019 adherence to national norms, and by their expected economic contribution to the country (sociotropic concerns). Aside from one study that used conjoint analysis to explore multidimensional views towards refugees in western Europe (Bansak, Hainmueller, and Hangartner 2016), no previous research has explored French natives\u2019 preferences for different types of immigrants based on multiple attributes. However, important country-level differences in attitudes towards immigrants may exist (e.g., Citrin and Sides 2008). Drawing inspiration from Hainmueller and Hopkins, we therefore apply conjoint analysis to study attitudes towards immigrants among French natives. We also investigate whether preferences vary by respondents\u2019 experiences of social contact with immigrants\u2014namely, whether French natives who regularly experience positive, everyday contact with immigrants prioritize different immigrant attributes than do low-contact natives. Previous literature on the effects of social contact on prejudice tends to examine prejudice as the main outcome variable and contact as the key explanatory variable.

We also test whether the effect of a threatening or counter-threatening frame on support for immigration varies among respondents with high vs. low social contact with immigrants. Previous studies on the effects of social contact on prejudice tend to examine prejudice as the main outcome variable and contact as the key independent variable. Thus, our objectives are to explore the role of contact as a moderator, and to expand the literature on media frames, immigration, and NIMBYism to the context of France.", "q16": "Our four hypotheses and two research questions are as follows: Hypothesis 1: Exposure to threatening media frames that highlight a link between immigrants and terrorism will reduce French natives\u2019 support for immigrants in their country and/or communities. Hypothesis 2: Exposure to counter-threatening frames that suggest that there is no link between immigrants and terrorism will have no effect on French natives\u2019 support for immigrants in their country and/or communities. Hypothesis 3: The effect of exposure to information that frames immigrants as threatening on attitudes towards immigration will vary based on natives\u2019 social contact with immigrants. Specifically, the threatening frame will create greater opposition to immigrants nationally and/or locally among natives with low contact with immigrants than among natives with high contact with immigrants. Hypothesis 4: French natives will be less supportive of immigration into their communities than immigration into France as a whole. Research Question 1: How will the effect of exposure to counter-threatening frames on support for immigration vary among natives with high and low contact with immigrants? Research Question 2: How will preferences for community-level immigration and country-level immigration vary among natives with high and low contact with immigrants?", "q17": "In a randomized online survey experiment written in French, we present a sample of 1500-2000 native French respondents with an article excerpt that frames immigrants in either a threatening or a counter-threatening way. There is also a control condition that does not read an article. The threatening article highlights a link between immigration and terrorism, while the counter-threatening article argues that immigration does not lead to terrorism. After answering some initial demographic questions on age, sex, and residency, respondents in the two treatment groups will read the article excerpt, and then all respondents will answer questions about their support for immigration nationally and locally. These two questions appear in a random order. Then, respondents will answer additional demographic questions, questions on their political preferences, a battery of three questions designed to gauge their level of social contact with immigrants, and a question about their views on immigration policy. The survey concludes with an opportunity to provide written feedback. We have multiple measures of social contact. We will use each measure of contact elicited by the three social contact questions as a separate moderator, and/or as an index. We will also create high- vs. low-contact respondent groups by using data on the immigrant population in French municipalities, and will link this to data on respondents\u2019 postal codes to determine whether they live in an area with a \u201cvery large,\u201d \u201clarge,\u201d \u201csmall,\u201d or \u201cvery small\u201d immigrant population, which correspond to four quartiles based on the foreign population in each area designated by a postal code in metropolitan France. We will then estimate the treatment effects based on regression analysis, and compare the estimated effects among subgroups of respondents with low and high social contact with immigrants based on the multiple measures, to discern whether and how contact exerts a moderating influence. For the continuous moderator (i.e., the percentage of immigrants), we will also apply a semi-parametric approach to estimate the interaction effects, as suggested by Hainmueller, Mummolo, and Xu

factors that influence American public opinion of foreign countries, with an emphasis on regime type of the country in question. Although the democratic peace has been studied extensively, scholars disagree on both the existence of a causal relationship between regime type and state propensity for war and through which mechanisms this causal effect may operate. This study attempts to tease out the causal mechanisms of the effect of democracy on public opinion and public preferences for foreign policy choices.

All comparisons are between-subjects, using the first refugee resettlement outcome measure that each participant answered (as explained above, all participants answered both the national and local resettlement measure, but order was randomized). We may also report the same analyses using within-subject comparisons in an appendix. H1 (NIMBYism): Participants will be more supportive of national refugee resettlement than local refugee resettlement. We will calculate the difference-in-means between support for national refugee resettlement and local refugee resettlement. (Analysis limited to control group participants since this prediction does not involve media coverage.) H2a (Anti-refugee framing effects): Media frames that depict refugees as a threat to national security will decrease support for refugee resettlement. (Same prediction for both national and local resettlement.) We will calculate the difference-in-means between support for local (national) resettlement in the anti-refugee frame condition and support for local (national) resettlement in the control condition. (Participants in the pro-refugee frame condition excluded.) H2b (Pro-refugee framing effects): Media frames that depict refugees as non-threatening to national security will increase support for refugee resettlement. (Same prediction for both national and local resettlement.) We will examine whether pro-refugee frames increase support for both national and local refugee resettlement. To do so, we will calculate the difference-in-means between support for local (national) resettlement in the pro-refugee frame condition and support for local (national) resettlement in the control condition. (Participants in the anti-refugee frame condition excluded.) H3a (Magnitude of framing effects): Framing effects on support for national refugee resettlement will be larger than framing effects on support for local refugee resettlement. H3b (Magnitude of framing effects): Framing effects on support for local refugee resettlement will be larger than framing effects on support for national refugee resettlement. To examine whether framing effects are larger on support for either local or national refugee resettlement, we will pool responses to both the local and national resettlement outcome measures and use them in a single model. We will then estimate a regression model predicting support for resettlement based on the following variables: local (1=local resettlement, 0=national), negative frame (1=in condition, 0 otherwise), positive frame (1=in condition, 0 otherwise), and interactions between local x negative frame and local x positive frame. (Control participants are the omitted reference group.) Specifically, the model will take the following form: Support for refugee resettlement = b0 + b1*Local + b2*Positive Frame + b3*Negative Frame + b4*Local x Positive Frame + b5*Local x Negative Frame + e RQ1: Is NIMBYism more or less prevalent among highly educated participants? Extant literature suggests that education levels are a significant and positive predictor of support for immigration. Therefore, we will investigate whether negative attitudes towards refugee resettlement are moderated by education. We will evaluate this interaction by using self-provided information on education levels provided in a previous wave. RQ2: Is NIMBYism more or less prevalent among participants with a large existing refugee population in their local community? Empirical work has suggested that the density of immigrant settlement plays a role in shaping attitudes towards immigration, but only when debates are nationally salient (Hopkins 2010, 2011). We thus expect the effects of national frames to interact with the degree to which respondents are located within a community that has accepted refugees in the past. Notes: -We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models, including treatment effects by subgroup and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. -We will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from any interaction models described above. In some cases, we may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity. If so, we will verify that we can reject the null of no difference in treatment effects in a more complex interactive model reported in an appendix when possible. -\u201dDon\u2019t know\u201d responses will be considered as missing data. -We will also compute and report summary statistics for our samples. We will also collect and may report response timing data as a proxy for respondent attention. -The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity. - As robustness tests, we will also estimate post-stratification weights obtained via entropy balancing (Hainmueller 2012) and apply the weights in our tests."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "United States of America"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "2994 (maximum)"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "STUDY00030078, MOD00004982"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "1/27/17 (modification approved 2/7/17)"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q30": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q32": {"extra": [], "value": "D72"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Conflict and Violence", "Ethnic Politics"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Explaining Public Opinion towards Refugee Resettlement", "q2": "Jeremy Ferwerda | D.J.

Suppose that people who feel that absolutely no refugees should be placed in your local community are at one end of a scale, at point 0; others who feel that as many refugees as possible should be placed in your local community are at the other end, at point 10. Where would you place YOURSELF on this scale? -0-10 slider with labels at 0 (\u201cAbsolutely no refugees\u201d) and 10 (\u201cAs many refugees as possible\u201d) What about the United States? Do you support or oppose refugee resettlement in the United States? Suppose that people who feel that absolutely no refugees should be placed in the United States are at one end of a scale, at point 0; others who feel that as many refugees as possible should be placed in the United States are at the other end, at point 10.

All comparisons are between-subjects, using the first refugee resettlement outcome measure that each participant answered (as explained above, all participants answered both the national and local resettlement measure, but order was randomized). We may also report the same analyses using within-subject comparisons in an appendix. H1 (NIMBYism): Participants will be more supportive of national refugee resettlement than local refugee resettlement. We will calculate the difference-in-means between support for national refugee resettlement and local refugee resettlement. (Analysis limited to control group participants since this prediction does not involve media coverage.) H2a (Anti-refugee framing effects): Media frames that depict refugees as a threat to national security will decrease support for refugee resettlement. (Same prediction for both national and local resettlement.) We will calculate the difference-in-means between support for local (national) resettlement in the anti-refugee frame condition and support for local (national) resettlement in the control condition. (Participants in the pro-refugee frame condition excluded.) H2b (Pro-refugee framing effects): Media frames that depict refugees as non-threatening to national security will increase support for refugee resettlement. (Same prediction for both national and local resettlement.) We will examine whether pro-refugee frames increase support for both national and local refugee resettlement. To do so, we will calculate the difference-in-means between support for local (national) resettlement in the pro-refugee frame condition and support for local (national) resettlement in the control condition. (Participants in the anti-refugee frame condition excluded.) H3a (Magnitude of framing effects): Framing effects on support for national refugee resettlement will be larger than framing effects on support for local refugee resettlement. H3b (Magnitude of framing effects): Framing effects on support for local refugee resettlement will be larger than framing effects on support for national refugee resettlement. To examine whether framing effects are larger on support for either local or national refugee resettlement, we will pool responses to both the local and national resettlement outcome measures and use them in a single model. We will then estimate a regression model predicting support for resettlement based on the following variables: local (1=local resettlement, 0=national), negative frame (1=in condition, 0 otherwise), positive frame (1=in condition, 0 otherwise), and interactions between local x negative frame and local x positive frame. (Control participants are the omitted reference group.) Specifically, the model will take the following form: Support for refugee resettlement = b0 + b1*Local + b2*Positive Frame + b3*Negative Frame + b4*Local x Positive Frame + b5*Local x Negative Frame + e RQ1: Is NIMBYism more or less prevalent among highly educated participants? Extant literature suggests that education levels are a significant and positive predictor of support for immigration. Therefore, we will investigate whether negative attitudes towards refugee resettlement are moderated by education. We will evaluate this interaction by using self-provided information on education levels provided in a previous wave. RQ2: Is NIMBYism more or less prevalent among participants with a large existing refugee population in their local community? Empirical work has suggested that the density of immigrant settlement plays a role in shaping attitudes towards immigration, but only when debates are nationally salient (Hopkins 2010, 2011). We thus expect the effects of national frames to interact with the degree to which respondents are located within a community that has accepted refugees in the past. Notes: -We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models, including treatment effects by subgroup and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. -We will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from any interaction models described above. In some cases, we may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity. If so, we will verify that we can reject the null of no difference in treatment effects in a more complex interactive model reported in an appendix when possible. -\u201dDon\u2019t know\u201d responses will be considered as missing data. -We will also compute and report summary statistics for our samples. We will also collect and may report response timing data as a proxy for respondent attention. -The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity. - As robustness tests, we will also estimate post-stratification weights obtained via entropy balancing (Hainmueller 2012) and apply the weights in our tests.", "q18": "United States of America", "q19":
