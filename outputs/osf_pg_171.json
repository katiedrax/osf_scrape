The Cam-CAN is a large-scale imaging project at the University of Cambridge to examine neural mechanisms of cognitive aging. The Cam-CAN study consisted of three stages, but the data used in the proposed study is from the second stage. A total of 656 subjects were recruited for the second stage of the Cam-CAN, consisting of 56 subjects from the youngest decade (18-27) (due to recruitment problems) and 100 subjects from each decile age 28-87.  Subjects were asked to complete various cognitive experiments in three separate sessions. The proposed study will utilize resting state MRI data collected in session 1 and behavioral data from an emotional reactivity and regulation task collected in session 3. Only half of the total Cam-CAN subjects completed the emotional reactivity and regulation task (the other half completed a different task) and thus will be analyzed in the present study. Also, being left-handed and ambidextrous (assessed through the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory) was an exclusion criterion for the proposed study (See Shafto et al., 2014 for more details). We will only use the data of right-handed subjects because previous studies observe brain asymmetries among individuals with different handedness (e.g., Willems, Hagoort, &amp; Casasanto, 2010), and most neuroimaging studies on cognition have been conducted with right-handed subjects. \n\n1. Emotional reactivity and regulation task. This task was part of the third session in which half of the Cam-CAN subjects completed it. Shafto et al. (2014) reported detailed experimental procedures. Briefly, subjects were asked to watch 30 seconds movie clips that were classified as neutral, positive, and negative. There were four conditions that every subject underwent: 1) watch neutral, 2) watch positive, 3) watch negative, 4) reappraise negative. For each trial before a movie clip was shown, subjects were given a prompt to indicate the valence of the movie clip they were about to watch (i.e., neutral, positive, or negative) and how they should watch it (i.e., watch or reappraise). Then, a movie clip was shown. After each clip, subjects were asked to provide a rating on two 0-100 scales indicating how much positive or negative emotion they felt, from \u201c0 = Not Negative/Positive\u201d to \u201c100 = Extremely Negative/Positive\u201d. Subjects were also asked to rate how well they adhered to the task instruction (i.e., watch or reappraise). There were eight blocks, and each block consisted of four runs (one run from each condition).\n\n2. MRI scans. Both structural and functional MRI scans were collected during the first session (Detailed procedures reported in Taylor et al., 2017). In the proposed study, we will be using T1 structural images and resting state functional images. \n\n\n\n- MRI data preprocessing -\n\tFunctional MRI images will be skull-stripped using BET (Brain Extraction Tool), which is part of FSL. Within-run motion correction will be computed using MCFLIRT in FSL using the middle volume as an initial template image. We will use recommended procedures to control for motion and physiological noise-related signal fluctuations that otherwise affect RSFC values (Power, Barnes, Snyder, Schlaggar, &amp; Petersen 2012). First, we will extract the time series for cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, and whole-brain signal and calculate framewise displacement (FD) and global signal change (DVARS) for the rest scan. These values will be used to exclude volumes with too much motion and noise: individual volumes will be removed if either FD exceeded 0.5 mm or DVARS exceeded 0.5%, as well as one volume before and two volumes after each flagged volume. The first two volumes and the last volume of the rest run will also be excluded. \n\t\n- Regions of Interest -\n\tRegions of interest (ROIs) will be defined by parcellating and segmenting high resolution anatomical images using Freesurfer in their native space. Each brain region will be collapsed across hemispheres. Our ROIs include amygdala, ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Amygdala is a critical region for emotions (Davis &amp; Whalen, 2001), and our cognitive control ROIs (VMPFC, MFG, IFG, ACC) have been implicated in their roles on emotion regulation regarding the amygdala (Banks et al., 2007; Etkin, B\u00fcchel, &amp; Gross, 2015; Kim et al, 2011). We will also include hippocampus to serve as a control region for amygdala because it is a subcortical region adjacent to amygdala, but its connectivity to prefrontal control regions would not be expected to relate to emotion regulation.\n\n- Measuring connectivity -\n\tConnectivity will be measured as the partial correlation between each of our seed regions (amygdala and hippocampus) and each cortical ROI (VMPFC, MFG, IFG, ACC) while controlling for motion and physiological noise. We will include the standard six realignment motion parameters, the above described physiological noise parameters (cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, whole brain signal), and all their derivatives as nuisance regressors. The resulting correlation coefficients will be Fisher z-transformed for subsequent analysis.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q10": {"extra": [], "value": "Registration prior to analysis of the data"}, "q11": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q12": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Data has been downloaded from the Cam-CAN database.

Thus, four connectivity values per subject will be used for the main analyses, and four connectivity values per subject will be used for the control analyses. \n\n2. Emotional reactivity and regulation ratings: The Cam-CAN database contains three measures (mean positive emotion rating, mean negative emotion rating, mean watch vs. reappraise task compliance rating) for each of four conditions (watch neutral, watch positive, watch negative, reappraise negative). Out of these 12 total behavioral variables, we will generate three constructs of interest.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "1. Emotion reactivity. Emotion reactivity will assess to what degree subjects\u2019 ratings were sensitive to the emotional content of the video stimuli and will be measured using two scores: (1) For each subject, mean positive ratings will be subtracted between the watch-positive and watch-negative conditions to indicate decrease in positivity ratings related to watching a negative (as opposed to positive) clip. (2) For each subject, mean negative ratings will be subtracted between the watch-positive and watch-negative conditions to measure increase in negativity ratings related to negative (as opposed to positive) clips. If positive and negative ratings are strongly correlated within each condition, they will be collapsed into a single \u201cemotional reactivity\u201d rating for each subject by subtracting the negative ratings from the positive ratings.  \n\n2. Subjective feeling of emotion regulation. To capture to what degree subjects felt they were following the reappraise instructions, we will subtract a subject\u2019s mean watch vs. reappraise ratings between the condition in which they were shown negative clips and instructed to reappraise (reappraise-negative) and the condition in which they were not instructed to reappraise (watch-negative).\n\n3. Emotion regulation success. Emotion regulation success is the main behavioral effect of interest for which we have specific hypotheses. Emotion regulation scores will capture to what degree emotional response to negative stimuli changes as a function of reappraise instruction (watch vs. reappraise). Similar to emotion reactivity, emotion regulation will be initially measured using two scores: (1) Subtracting a subject\u2019s mean positive rating for the reappraise-negative condition from the one for the watch-negative condition. (2) Subtracting a subject\u2019s mean negative rating for the reappraise-negative condition from the one for the watch-negative condition.

Because all of the measures are the difference scores, we will test them against the null hypothesis that the difference scores are zero on average (equivalence to paired t-tests comparing the two components of each score, e.g., positive ratings to positive clips vs. positive ratings to negative clips). \n\n\tTo test whether age relates to emotional reactivity and regulation, we will first conduct zero-order correlations between each emotion-related index and age (as a continuous variable). Further, we will test the same hypothesis by treating age as a categorical variable. Subjects will be divided into 3 age groups (young=18-30, middle=30-59, old=60+) and then perform a 2 (conditions) x 3 (age: young, middle, old) ANOVAs. This would allow us to capture non-linear age-related changes. Finally, even when no single measure may significantly relate to age, there may be an effect when all emotion reactivity and regulation measures are combined. We will thus perform a multiple regression with age as an outcome and all emotion-related constructs of interest as predictors. Overall model fit as well as the coefficients for each predictive construct will be tested.\n\n- Connectivity analyses \u2013 \n\tRelationship between amygdala connectivity and emotion regulation: We hypothesize that stronger RSFC between the amygdala and cognitive control regions will be associated with better emotion regulation performance. In order to examine this hypothesis, we will first conduct multiple regressions with the four amygdala-cortex connectivity measures as predictors and the emotion regulation success index as an outcome. We will assess the overall fit of the model as well as coefficients for each connectivity measure. As a second approach, support vector regressions (SVR) will be used to predict emotion regulation success from the pattern of our four connectivity measures. We will randomly divide our subjects into five groups regardless of their age and perform 5-fold cross validation to test the SVR model. \n\n\tRelationship between connectivity and age: To quantify how connectivity values relate to age, we will conduct two analyses: First, age will be correlated with each amygdala-cortex connection value, and secondly, multiple regressions will be conducted with the four connections as predictors and age as outcome. If we find that age and connectivity are related, we will also run a regression with the four connectivity values and age predicting emotion regulation success to assess if age and connectivity explain distinct variance in emotion regulation.\n\n\tTesting whether the association between amygdala connectivity and emotion regulation is age-dependent: We will conduct a multiple regression with one connectivity measure, age, and an interaction between the connectivity measure and age to predict emotion regulation success. Separate regressions will be conducted for each connectivity measure to examine if any of the connectivity x age interactions track individual differences in emotion regulation. \n\t\n\tLastly, we will conduct all of the aforementioned connectivity analyses using hippocampus \u2013 cognitive control regions RSFC as our control analyses. \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q21": {"extra": [], "value": "We will use the standard p &lt; .05 criteria for determining if inference tests are significant."}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Subjects who have excessive motion during the resting scan will be excluded from the analyses."}, "q23": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "- References - \n\nBanks, S.

The Cam-CAN is a large-scale imaging project at the University of Cambridge to examine neural mechanisms of cognitive aging. The Cam-CAN study consisted of three stages, but the data used in the proposed study is from the second stage. A total of 656 subjects were recruited for the second stage of the Cam-CAN, consisting of 56 subjects from the youngest decade (18-27) (due to recruitment problems) and 100 subjects from each decile age 28-87.  Subjects were asked to complete various cognitive experiments in three separate sessions. The proposed study will utilize resting state MRI data collected in session 1 and behavioral data from an emotional reactivity and regulation task collected in session 3. Only half of the total Cam-CAN subjects completed the emotional reactivity and regulation task (the other half completed a different task) and thus will be analyzed in the present study. Also, being left-handed and ambidextrous (assessed through the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory) was an exclusion criterion for the proposed study (See Shafto et al., 2014 for more details). We will only use the data of right-handed subjects because previous studies observe brain asymmetries among individuals with different handedness (e.g., Willems, Hagoort, &amp; Casasanto, 2010), and most neuroimaging studies on cognition have been conducted with right-handed subjects. \n\n1. Emotional reactivity and regulation task. This task was part of the third session in which half of the Cam-CAN subjects completed it. Shafto et al. (2014) reported detailed experimental procedures. Briefly, subjects were asked to watch 30 seconds movie clips that were classified as neutral, positive, and negative. There were four conditions that every subject underwent: 1) watch neutral, 2) watch positive, 3) watch negative, 4) reappraise negative. For each trial before a movie clip was shown, subjects were given a prompt to indicate the valence of the movie clip they were about to watch (i.e., neutral, positive, or negative) and how they should watch it (i.e., watch or reappraise). Then, a movie clip was shown. After each clip, subjects were asked to provide a rating on two 0-100 scales indicating how much positive or negative emotion they felt, from \u201c0 = Not Negative/Positive\u201d to \u201c100 = Extremely Negative/Positive\u201d. Subjects were also asked to rate how well they adhered to the task instruction (i.e., watch or reappraise). There were eight blocks, and each block consisted of four runs (one run from each condition).\n\n2. MRI scans. Both structural and functional MRI scans were collected during the first session (Detailed procedures reported in Taylor et al., 2017). In the proposed study, we will be using T1 structural images and resting state functional images. \n\n\n\n- MRI data preprocessing -\n\tFunctional MRI images will be skull-stripped using BET (Brain Extraction Tool), which is part of FSL. Within-run motion correction will be computed using MCFLIRT in FSL using the middle volume as an initial template image. We will use recommended procedures to control for motion and physiological noise-related signal fluctuations that otherwise affect RSFC values (Power, Barnes, Snyder, Schlaggar, &amp; Petersen 2012). First, we will extract the time series for cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, and whole-brain signal and calculate framewise displacement (FD) and global signal change (DVARS) for the rest scan. These values will be used to exclude volumes with too much motion and noise: individual volumes will be removed if either FD exceeded 0.5 mm or DVARS exceeded 0.5%, as well as one volume before and two volumes after each flagged volume. The first two volumes and the last volume of the rest run will also be excluded. \n\t\n- Regions of Interest -\n\tRegions of interest (ROIs) will be defined by parcellating and segmenting high resolution anatomical images using Freesurfer in their native space. Each brain region will be collapsed across hemispheres. Our ROIs include amygdala, ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Amygdala is a critical region for emotions (Davis &amp; Whalen, 2001), and our cognitive control ROIs (VMPFC, MFG, IFG, ACC) have been implicated in their roles on emotion regulation regarding the amygdala (Banks et al., 2007; Etkin, B\u00fcchel, &amp; Gross, 2015; Kim et al, 2011). We will also include hippocampus to serve as a control region for amygdala because it is a subcortical region adjacent to amygdala, but its connectivity to prefrontal control regions would not be expected to relate to emotion regulation.\n\n- Measuring connectivity -\n\tConnectivity will be measured as the partial correlation between each of our seed regions (amygdala and hippocampus) and each cortical ROI (VMPFC, MFG, IFG, ACC) while controlling for motion and physiological noise. We will include the standard six realignment motion parameters, the above described physiological noise parameters (cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, whole brain signal), and all their derivatives as nuisance regressors. The resulting correlation coefficients will be Fisher z-transformed for subsequent analysis.\n", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Data has been downloaded from the Cam-CAN database. The procedures used to collect all the data are reported in Shafto et al. (2014) and Taylor et al. (2017). We have submitted an abstract of our proposed study to the Cam-CAN and been granted the access to the data. ", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "1. Resting state functional connectivity: We will measure resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the amygdala and each cognitive control ROIs (VMPFC, MFG, IFG, ACC). As a control, we will also measure connectivity between hippocampus and each of the cognitive control regions. Thus, four connectivity values per subject will be used for the main analyses, and four connectivity values per subject will be used for the control analyses. \n\n2. Emotional reactivity and regulation ratings: The Cam-CAN database contains three measures (mean positive emotion rating, mean negative emotion rating, mean watch vs. reappraise task compliance rating) for each of four conditions (watch neutral, watch positive, watch negative, reappraise negative). Out of these 12 total behavioral variables, we will generate three constructs of interest.\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "1. Emotion reactivity. Emotion reactivity will assess to what degree subjects\u2019 ratings were sensitive to the emotional content of the video stimuli and will be measured using two scores: (1) For each subject, mean positive ratings will be subtracted between the watch-positive and watch-negative conditions to indicate decrease in positivity ratings related to watching a negative (as opposed to positive) clip. (2) For each subject, mean negative ratings will be subtracted between the watch-positive and watch-negative conditions to measure increase in negativity ratings related to negative (as opposed to positive) clips. If positive and negative ratings are strongly correlated within each condition, they will be collapsed into a single \u201cemotional reactivity\u201d rating for each subject by subtracting the negative ratings from the positive ratings.  \n\n2. Subjective feeling of emotion regulation. To capture to what degree subjects felt they were following the reappraise instructions, we will subtract a subject\u2019s mean watch vs. reappraise ratings between the condition in which they were shown negative clips and instructed to reappraise (reappraise-negative) and the condition in which they were not instructed to reappraise (watch-negative).\n\n3. Emotion regulation success. Emotion regulation success is the main behavioral effect of interest for which we have specific hypotheses. Emotion regulation scores will capture to what degree emotional response to negative stimuli changes as a function of reappraise instruction (watch vs. reappraise). Similar to emotion reactivity, emotion regulation will be initially measured using two scores: (1) Subtracting a subject\u2019s mean positive rating for the reappraise-negative condition from the one for the watch-negative condition. (2) Subtracting a subject\u2019s mean negative rating for the reappraise-negative condition from the one for the watch-negative condition. If these scores are strongly correlated, they will be collapsed into a single composite \u201cemotional regulation\u201d rating for each subject by subtracting the differences in negative ratings from the differences in positive ratings.  \n", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "- Behavioral analyses \u2013 \n\tTo test for the degree of emotional reactivity, subjective feeling of emotion regulation, and emotion regulation success, we will compute the mean scores on each of these measures of interests. Because all of the measures are the difference scores, we will test them against the null hypothesis that the difference scores are zero on average (equivalence to paired t-tests comparing the two components of each score, e.g., positive ratings to positive clips vs. positive ratings to negative clips). \n\n\tTo test whether age relates to emotional reactivity and regulation, we will first conduct zero-order correlations between each emotion-related index and age (as a continuous variable). Further, we will test the same hypothesis by treating age as a categorical variable. Subjects will be divided into 3 age groups (young=18-30, middle=30-59, old=60+) and then perform a 2 (conditions) x 3 (age: young, middle, old) ANOVAs. This would allow us to capture non-linear age-related changes. Finally, even when no single measure may significantly relate to age, there may be an effect when all emotion reactivity and regulation measures are combined. We will thus perform a multiple regression with age as an outcome and all emotion-related constructs of interest as predictors. Overall model fit as well as the coefficients for each predictive construct will be tested.\n\n- Connectivity analyses \u2013 \n\tRelationship between amygdala connectivity and emotion regulation: We hypothesize that stronger RSFC between the amygdala and cognitive control regions will be associated with better emotion regulation performance. In order to examine this hypothesis, we will first conduct multiple regressions with the four amygdala-cortex connectivity measures as predictors and the emotion regulation success index as an outcome. We will assess the overall fit of the model as well as coefficients for each connectivity measure. As a second approach, support vector regressions (SVR) will be used to predict emotion regulation success from the pattern of our four connectivity measures. We will randomly divide our subjects into five groups regardless of their age and perform 5-fold cross validation to test the SVR model. \n\n\tRelationship between connectivity and age: To quantify how connectivity values relate to age, we will conduct two analyses: First, age will be correlated with each amygdala-cortex connection value, and secondly, multiple regressions will be conducted with the four connections as predictors and age as outcome. If we find that age and connectivity are related, we will also run a regression with the four connectivity values and age predicting emotion regulation success to assess if age and connectivity explain distinct variance in emotion regulation.\n\n\tTesting whether the association between amygdala connectivity and emotion regulation is age-dependent: We will conduct a multiple regression with one connectivity measure, age, and an interaction between the connectivity measure and age to predict emotion regulation success. Separate regressions will be conducted for each connectivity measure to examine if any of the connectivity x age interactions track individual differences in emotion regulation. \n\t\n\tLastly, we will conduct all of the aforementioned connectivity analyses using hippocampus \u2013 cognitive control regions RSFC as our control analyses. \n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []},

No further limits were applied related to timing of initiation of treatment, location of intervention, type of comparison used, or outcomes measured.  \nThe exclusion criteria comprised: a) studies addressing populations under 18 years of age; b) studies involving interventions without a specific cognitive dimension e.g. only physical or psychological; c) studies reporting on interventions

(2018). Sample items include \"I am motivated to lose weight\", \"I try to eat more healthily\", which are assessed on a 7-point scale (1 = not at all, 7 =very much).\n\n2) Restraint Eating Scale (Herman, Polivy, Pliner, Threlkeld, &amp; Munic, 1978): This 10-item scale was used to assess participants' restraint eating practices, with a minor change in scaling of one of the item. In item 1 (\"How often are you dieting?\") the original scales range from never (0) to always (4), instead we changed the scales to \"I never diet\", \"2-3 times a month\", \"once a month\", \"I start a new diet after 1-2 weeks quiting the one before\", \"I always diet\". We thought that the original scaling misses crucial information of the participants' dieting practices. Beside this change, all the other items were used as was in van Strien et. al. (2007).\n\n3) Functional and Dysfunctional Self-licensing Scale: This scale was developed and validated by Prinsen et. al. (2018) which involves 10-item for functional and 10-item for dysfunctional self-licensing on a 7-point scale (1 = does not apply to me at all, 7 = totally applies to me).\n\n4) Brief Self-control Scale: The Turkish version (Nebioglu et. al., 2012) of the 13-item Brief Self-control Scale (Tangney, Baumeister, Boone, 2008) was used to assess participants' self-control levels. The scale options ranged from 1 (not at all) and 5 (Very much). \n\n5) Unhealthy Snack Habits Scale: Participants' habit strength of unhealthy snacking was measured with the scale developed by Verplanken and Orbell (2003). The scale wording was changed so that it reflected unhealthy snacking habit and assessed on a 5-point scale (1 = not at all agree, 5 = completely agree).\n\n6) Weight-related Self-efficacy Scale: Wilson et. al. (2016) developed brief self-efficacy scales to be used in the weight-loss trials. These scales tap into participants' confidence with eating healthful foods, being physically active and losing weight. In this study, we measured only the 4-item losing weight scale which ranged from 0 (no confidence) to 100 (full confidence). \n\n7) Cognitive Flexibility Scale: The Turkish version (Altunkol, 2017) of the Cognitive Flexibility Scale (Martin and Rubin, 1995) was assessed. The scale consists of 12 items that range from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 6 (Strongly agree). \n\n8) Barratt's Impulsivity Scale: The Turkish version (Tamam et. al., 2012) of the Barratt's Impulsivity Scale was used to assess the impulsivity levels of the participants. The scale has 15 items that range from 1 (Rarely/Never) to 4 (Always). \n\n9) Emotional Appetite Scale:  The Turkish version (Demirel et. al., 2014) of the Emotional Appetite Scale was used. The scale measures changes in the amount of eating under different emotions. We did not include all of the emotions in the original scale and assessed only those emotions that we were shown to be predictor of eating in the self-licensing literature. These emotions include sadness, boredom, angry, anxious, happy, tired, pessimist, cheerful and alone. The scale ranged from 1 (eating less than normal), 5 (eating as usual) and 9 (eating more than usual). \n\n10) Each night for 7 days, participants will answer perceived stress and perceived sleep efficiency for the day they submit their diaries on a 10-point scale.\n\nOutcome measures:\n1) The amount of the eaten snack: Participants reported the amount of the each snack they submitted, whether as a package, handful, pieces or glasses. \n\n2) Type of snack: Participants reported each snack and drink they consumed that day from waking up to before going bed. They were limited to send 10 snacks and drinks per day. \n\n3) Time eaten the snack: We collected the data of the time eaten each snack by asking participants to record the time, along with the amount and type of snack."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "1) Participants' BMI will be calculated by their height and weight information.\n\n2) Age, gender, diet frequency and descriptives, dieting or not will not be combined but will be used only for descriptive purposes.\n\n3) Beside the above items, each of the main measure variables' mean will be calculated, after transforming the reversed items. Three exceptions are (1) Functional and Dysfunctional Self-licensing items will be combined differently to create two means, one for each, (2) the mean of the Emotional Appetite Scale items will be taken for positive and negative emotions differently and (3) instead of the mean, the sum of scores will be used to create cognitive flexibility score of the participants.\n\nThe caloric value of the snacks reported will be assessed by multiplying the amount of the snack eaten with the caloric value of the snack.

We did not include all of the emotions in the original scale and assessed only those emotions that we were shown to be predictor of eating in the self-licensing literature. These emotions include sadness, boredom, angry, anxious, happy, tired, pessimist, cheerful and alone. The scale ranged from 1 (eating less than normal), 5 (eating as usual) and 9 (eating more than usual). \n\n10) Each night for 7 days, participants will answer perceived stress and perceived sleep efficiency for the day they submit their diaries on a 10-point scale.\n\nOutcome measures:\n1) The amount of the eaten snack: Participants reported the amount of the each snack they submitted, whether as a package, handful, pieces or glasses. \n\n2) Type of snack: Participants reported each snack and drink they consumed that day from waking up to before going bed. They were limited to send 10 snacks and drinks per day. \n\n3) Time eaten the snack: We collected the data of the time eaten each snack by asking participants to record the time, along with the amount and type of snack.", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "1) Participants' BMI will be calculated by their height and weight information.\n\n2) Age, gender, diet frequency and descriptives, dieting or not will not be combined but will be used only for descriptive purposes.\n\n3) Beside the above items, each of the main measure variables' mean will be calculated, after transforming the reversed items. Three exceptions are (1) Functional and Dysfunctional Self-licensing items will be combined differently to create two means, one for each, (2) the mean of the Emotional Appetite Scale items will be taken for positive and negative emotions differently and (3) instead of the mean, the sum of scores will be used to create cognitive flexibility score of the participants.\n\nThe caloric value of the snacks reported will be assessed by multiplying the amount of the snack eaten with the caloric value of the snack. The caloric values will be obtained from different sources to be sure of the reliability of the snacks' caloric values. For the packaged snacks, the caloric information at the back of the packages will be used. For those snacks and drinks that are not packaged, the caloric information will be taken from https://www.diyetkolik.com/kac-kalori/, https://www.diyetasistan.com/besinler-kac-kalori.html, https://www.kackalori.com.tr/KaloriCetveli/ to be sure of the caloric values. \n\nAfter calculating each of the snacks and drinks' caloric value, they will be transformed into four different indexes. These four variables will be healthy snack mean, healthy drink mean, unhealthy snack mean and unhealthy drink mean. The mean of any of the above variable for a participant will be calculated by dividing the sum of caloric intake by 7.

While acquiring new knowledge and competences, university students also deal with significant challenges, such as identity exploration and balance achievement between academic obligations, leisure time and house demanding tasks. Therefore, college students may experience mental health issues, substance use problems, which can lead to a lack of involvement with university, academic performance decrease, absenteeism, or even dropout. Positive Youth Development (PYD) focus on the enhancement of youth strengths to achieve a healthy, productive and meaningful youth (Lerner et al., 2011; Shek, Dou, Zhu, &amp; Chai, 2019). PYD is associated with emotional competence (Lau &amp; Wu, 2012) and may depend on several situational factors such as the academic context (\u00c5rdal, Holsen, Diseth, &amp; Larsen, 2018; Matos, Santos, Reis, Gom\u00e9z-baya, &amp; Marques, 2018).

It is a broad concept that depicts students\u2019 commitment, motivation, interaction and involvement with the learning institution and learning activities with predictors both at individual and social-cultural levels. In educational research, student engagement has been conceptualized as a multidimensional construct (Appleton, Christenson, &amp; Furlong, 2008) with three dimensions \u2013 emotional/affective, behavioural, and cognitive (Fredricks, Blumenfeld, &amp; Paris, 2004; Furlong &amp; Rebelez-Ernst, 2013; Furlong et al., 2003; Jimerson, Campos, &amp; Greif, 2003). Studies using samples of college students have found positive associations between student engagement and academic achievement (Carini, Kuh, &amp; Klein, 2006; Gunuc, 2014; Kuh, Cruce, Shoup, Kinzie, &amp; Gonyea, 2008), school persistence (Kuh et al., 2008), college completion (Price &amp; Tovar, 2014), physical and psychological well-being (Salmela-Aro &amp; Read, 2017; Schaufeli, Mart\u00ednez, Pinto, Salanova, &amp; Barker, 2002). Even though research in this area is vast, not much attention has been given to this process in the university, in particular the role of emotion in student engagement in higher education (Kahu, 2013). \nSocioemotional competencies can be distinguished in two domains: intrapersonal and interpersonal. Intrapersonal are competencies used for a healthy functioning, and interpersonal are competencies used for adequate interactions with others (Domitrovich, Durlak, Staley, &amp; Weissberg, 2017). Socioemotional competencies are important resources in maintaining mental health (Domitrovich et al., 2017), being predictors of well-being, academic performance (Brackett &amp; Rivers, 2013) and college completion (Taylor, Oberle, Durlak, &amp; Weissberg, 2017). Thus, the present study expands previous research by examining the role of emotional competence and prosocial behaviour as predictors of student engagement. \nIndividual level variables, such as grade, gender and socioeconomic status, have shown to be predictors of student engagement among adolescent samples (Amir, Saleha, Mohd Jelas, Ahmad, &amp; Hutkemri, 2014; Chiu, Pong, Mori, &amp; Chow, 2012; Greene, Marti, &amp; McClenney, 2008; Lam et al., 2016), but information is lacking in respect to college students. Student engagement is also largely influenced by sociocultural variables (Kahu, 2013), with positive contextual factors affecting the increase of engagement (Ungar &amp; Liebenberg, 2013). Thus, we will analyse the role of the reviewed HDI2018 (Human Development Report, 2019), since the country\u2019s socioeconomic development is associated with access to education, namely with entry in higher education and schooling years. The second country level predictor will be employment rate. The job market is considered to influence students\u2019 engagement mainly in situations of economic crises (Tinto, 1975), with unemployment considered to be a relevant concern among college students (Reis &amp; Matos, 2019).

Socioeconomic status is measured with the Family Affluence Scale (FAS; Currie et al., 2008), which comprises four items that reflects family resources (e.g. car ownership, own computer ownership, number of vacations per year, having an individual room).

Because not all measures will be used for this study, this document only presents the measured variables required for the present analysis. \nAll measures in use are self-reported and will be mainly used in English and Portuguese versions, which were previously validated. For countries where English or Portuguese is not a first or second language, translation and transcultural adaptation will be performed using Beaton, Bombardier, Guillemin, and Ferraz (2000) guidelines for self-administered measures. \nEmotional Skills and Competence Questionnaire (ESCQ, Faria &amp; Santos, 2009; Tak\u0161i\u0107, 2000) comprises a total of 45 items and has three subscales: i) Ability to perceive and understand emotion (15 items); ii) Ability to express and label emotion (14 items); and iii) Ability to manage and regulate emotion (16 items), all answered on a 3-point scale, ranging from 0 (Not true) to 6 (Certainly true).\nProsocial behaviour will be measured with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; Fleitlich, Loureiro, Fonseca, &amp; Gaspar, 2004; Goodman, 2001). SDQ comprises a subscale of Prosocial Behaviour with five items, answered on a 3-point scale, ranging from 0 (Not true) to 5 (Certainly true).\nStudent Engagement will be assessed with the Student Engagement Scale (SES), previously developed in an international study with 12 countries (Lam et al., 2014). SES comprises three engagement subscales: i) affective (emotional) (9 items), ii) behavioural (12 items); and iii) cognitive (12 items). Both affective and behavioural subscales are answered on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree), whereas the cognitive is answered on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (Always) to 5 (Never). \nSociodemographic characteristics consist of age, gender, academic year, grades, nationality and generation university status, i.e. if student\u2019s parents attended university or not (Gibson &amp; Slate, 2010). Socioeconomic status is measured with the Family Affluence Scale (FAS; Currie et al., 2008), which comprises four items that reflects family resources (e.g. car ownership, own computer ownership, number of vacations per year, having an individual room). The FAS score is calculated for each person based on the responses to these four items on an ordinal three-point scale, composed for analysis, where: FAS 1 (score = 0 - 3) = indicates low turnout; FAS 2 (score = 4 - 6) = indicates mean turnout; FAS 3 (score = 7 - 9) = indicates high turnout (Currie et al., 2008). Participants under the social care services living in residential care homes will be included in the lower status.\nCountry variables includes socio-economic development and employment rate. The Human Development Index (HDI) will be used to capture the degree of socio-economic development of the countries involved. This index was developed by the United Nations as a comparative measure for development across countries.(Human Development Report, 2019). It combines four dimensions: i) life expectancy at birth, ii) expected years of schooling, iii) mean years of schooling and iv) gross national income per capita. The HDI provides a global measure of socio-economic development of countries worldwide.

In this investigation, we seek to provide this evidence.

They will be given a brief presentation of the study, and will be asked to complete a pre-anipulation questionnaire online in order to participate in the study.\n\nPremanipulation questionnaire. This questionnaire will include several measures: \n- Environmental Behavioral Intent Scale (Dependent Variable, Time 1)\n- Proximity to the group (covariate)\n- Demographic information (sex, date of birth, parents' socio-professional category, initials)\n\n1. For the presence of vicarious dissonance condition: \nParticipants will be greeted by an experimenter who will tell them that this is a paired study. The experimenter will then stage a telephone conversation with another experimenter during which he or she will learn that the other participant has arrived. \nOnce the participants are seated in the experiment room, the experimenter will tell them that this is a computer study. The experimenter explained that he was studying linguistic subcultures, to explore whether the mere fact of living together might cause unique speech patterns to develop (Norton et al., 2003). We stressed these potential differences between groups to make group concerns salient (Turner et al., 1987). The experimenter will specify that in his research, he is particularly interested in the language differences between the youth group (18-25 years old) and the senior group (65-75 years old), and that the paired participant who performs the experiment at the same time as him is also part of the youth group. It will be indicated that this person is of the same sex as him/her: if it is a girl student, we will say that the pair is a girl, if it is a boy, we will say that the pair is a young man (control of group membership). The experimenter will then explain to the participants that in order to study these linguistic subcultures, one of the participants will have to write an argumentative text in favor of environmental behavior, while the other will judge this argumentative text on a set of linguistic criteria. Our cover story was corroborated by having a tape recorder and micro- phone on the table in each of the two experimental rooms. Once the instructions have been given, the experimenter will leave the experimental room and the participant will perform the tasks on the computer.\n\nAfter reading a brief article on linguistic subcultures, all participants will be led to believe that the computer randomly assigns the position of judge or writer of the argumentative text. For the credibility of the cover, while waiting for their pair to write the argumentative text, participants will fill in the same demographic information as in the premanipulation questionnaire (allowing us to link the pre- and post-manipulation questionnaires). Then, participants will be asked to read the argumentative text for environmental behavior written by their pair. To give the impression that the author is hypocritical about agreeing with pro-environmental behavior, the argumentative text will be followed by a question asking whether they always save energy. He will then be asked to recall the last time or times when he could have saved energy but did not. To this question, the author will answer: \"Sometimes I waste water when I wash the dishes or take a shower\", \"I leave the heating on when I leave the house for several days\", and \"I leave my appliances on standby instead of turning them off\". The participant will then respond to the dependent measures and manipulation check in the postmanipulation questionnaire. \n\nPostmanipulation questionnaire. \n- Environmental Behavioral Intent Scale (Dependent Variable, Time 2)\n- Manipulation check (affiliation with the writer's group)\n\n2. For the absence of vicarious dissonance condition:\nParticipants will complete only the postmanipulation questionnaire, with dependent measure (i.e., environmental behavioral intention un time 2), without following a vicarious dissonance procedure. \n\nWe will use block randomization, where each participant will be randomly assigned to one of the two equally sized, predetermined blocks \nFor randomization, we will use https://www.random.org/integers/"}}}, "planned-sample": {"value": {"question4b": {"extra": [], "value": "Participants will be undergraduate student from Aix Marseille University, recruited through advertisements.

Our measure of proximity with the group consists of 4 measures: group prototypicality, social identification with the group, similarity and interpersonal proximity to the group. \n1. The measure of prototypicality was based on the study by Hogg, Cooper-Shaw, &amp; Holzworth (1993). Participants were asked to identify the characteristics of the group of youth (18 to 25 years of age) and to describe a prototype in no more five lines.

Finally, the prototypicality of the participants will be measured in 1 item: \"How typical of the group of young people do you consider yourself to? \"(1 = not at all representative, 7 = very representative), adapted in French from studies by Hogg, Cooper-Shaw, and Holzworth (1993). \n2.

The IOS scale (Aron, Aron, &amp; Smollan, 1992) will measure interpersonal closeness to the group, and \n4. similarity to the group will be measured in 4 items, \"How do you feel similar to the person in general\", \"...in terms of personal dispositions\", \"...in terms of attitudes\", and \"...in terms of background,\" (1 = not at all similar, 7 = very similar), adapted in French from the studies of Stephan, Liberman, &amp; Trope (2011).", "recommended-analysis.specify.question6c": "We will use the standard p&lt;.05 criteria for determining if the Paired Samples T-Test and Repeated Measures ANOVA and the post hoc test suggest that the results are significantly different from those expected if the null hypothesis were correct.

They will be given a brief presentation of the study, and will be asked to complete a pre-anipulation questionnaire online in order to participate in the study.\n\nPremanipulation questionnaire. This questionnaire will include several measures: \n- Environmental Behavioral Intent Scale (Dependent Variable, Time 1)\n- Proximity to the group (covariate)\n- Demographic information (sex, date of birth, parents' socio-professional category, initials)\n\n1. For the presence of vicarious dissonance condition: \nParticipants will be greeted by an experimenter who will tell them that this is a paired study. The experimenter will then stage a telephone conversation with another experimenter during which he or she will learn that the other participant has arrived. \nOnce the participants are seated in the experiment room, the experimenter will tell them that this is a computer study. The experimenter explained that he was studying linguistic subcultures, to explore whether the mere fact of living together might cause unique speech patterns to develop (Norton et al., 2003). We stressed these potential differences between groups to make group concerns salient (Turner et al., 1987). The experimenter will specify that in his research, he is particularly interested in the language differences between the youth group (18-25 years old) and the senior group (65-75 years old), and that the paired participant who performs the experiment at the same time as him is also part of the youth group. It will be indicated that this person is of the same sex as him/her: if it is a girl student, we will say that the pair is a girl, if it is a boy, we will say that the pair is a young man (control of group membership). The experimenter will then explain to the participants that in order to study these linguistic subcultures, one of the participants will have to write an argumentative text in favor of environmental behavior, while the other will judge this argumentative text on a set of linguistic criteria. Our cover story was corroborated by having a tape recorder and micro- phone on the table in each of the two experimental rooms. Once the instructions have been given, the experimenter will leave the experimental room and the participant will perform the tasks on the computer.\n\nAfter reading a brief article on linguistic subcultures, all participants will be led to believe that the computer randomly assigns the position of judge or writer of the argumentative text. For the credibility of the cover, while waiting for their pair to write the argumentative text, participants will fill in the same demographic information as in the premanipulation questionnaire (allowing us to link the pre- and post-manipulation questionnaires). Then, participants will be asked to read the argumentative text for environmental behavior written by their pair. To give the impression that the author is hypocritical about agreeing with pro-environmental behavior, the argumentative text will be followed by a question asking whether they always save energy. He will then be asked to recall the last time or times when he could have saved energy but did not. To this question, the author will answer: \"Sometimes I waste water when I wash the dishes or take a shower\", \"I leave the heating on when I leave the house for several days\", and \"I leave my appliances on standby instead of turning them off\". The participant will then respond to the dependent measures and manipulation check in the postmanipulation questionnaire. \n\nPostmanipulation questionnaire. \n- Environmental Behavioral Intent Scale (Dependent Variable, Time 2)\n- Manipulation check (affiliation with the writer's group)\n\n2. For the absence of vicarious dissonance condition:\nParticipants will complete only the postmanipulation questionnaire, with dependent measure (i.e., environmental behavioral intention un time 2), without following a vicarious dissonance procedure. \n\nWe will use block randomization, where each participant will be randomly assigned to one of the two equally sized, predetermined blocks \nFor randomization, we will use https://www.random.org/integers/", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question1c": "Vicarious dissonance: It will be attributed the number \u201c1\u201d for participants in the condition \"presence of dissonance\", and the number \u201c0\u201d for participants in the condition \"absence of dissonance\".\n\nMeasurement of environmental behavioral intention: Participants will indicate on a scale of 1 to 7 their environmental behavioral intention, in time 1 and time 2.
