McLaughlin, David Weissman"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Emotional awareness is reflected by the ability to recognize, differentiate and label emotional states (Croyle &amp; Waltz, 2002; Lane &amp; Schwartz, 1987; Lennartsson et al., 2017). In addition to feeling an emotion, emotion awareness requires cognitive reflection on what is being experienced (Barrett et al., 2001; Croyle &amp; Waltz, 2002). Emotional awareness is widely accepted as a prerequisite for adaptive emotion regulation abilities (Barrett et al., 2001; Lambie &amp; Marcel, 2002; Teasdale, 1999). Barrett et al. (2001) suggest that knowing what one is feeling can inform how to go about coping with those emotions. Indeed, individuals with higher emotional awareness are more likely to use adaptive emotion regulation strategies like cognitive reappraisal compared to maladaptive strategies like suppression (Subic-Wrana et al., 2014). \n\nCognitive reappraisal is an emotion regulation technique where one reframes what they are experiencing so as to make it less distressing. The technique involves maintaining the intention to reappraise in working memory, using semantic memory to generate alternative appraisals given the context of the situation, selecting a new appraisal, and then updating and sustaining this reappraisal in working memory\u2014all while evaluating whether or not the appraisal was successful in regulating one\u2019s emotional state (Ochsner &amp; Gross, 2008). Cognitive reappraisal has consistently been shown to activate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and is associated with decreased amygdala activation relative to passive viewing of emotional stimuli without using reappraisal (Buhle et al., 2014; Kalisch, 2009). The amygdala is activated in response to stimuli that have motivational salience (Lee et al., 2012; Santos et al., 2011). The dlPFC is involved with manipulation of verbal and spatial knowledge, and thus may be central to continuously updating appraisals in working memory (i.e. maintaining the intention to reappraise in working memory) (Barbey et al., 2013; Buhle et al., 2014; Wager &amp; Smith, 2003). On the other hand, the vlPFC may be involved with selection and inhibition of appraisals, and the dmPFC may support inferring higher-level meaning from stimuli and affective states (i.e. appraisal), particularly from negative emotional stimuli (Baetens et al., 2017; Buhle et al., 2014; Etkin et al., 2011). \n\nWe expect emotional awareness will support emotion regulation in two ways. First, we anticipate higher emotion awareness will make regulation using cognitive reappraisal more effective, since low emotional awareness is associated with ineffective regulation (Kalokerinos et al., 2019). Specifically, higher emotional awareness should be associated with greater reduction in amygdala activation during reappraisal relative to passive viewing. Second, we expect that that higher emotional awareness will be associated with greater use of reappraisal, and less use of suppression and rumination (i.e., negative emotion regulation strategies).\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "1. We hypothesize that dependent variable, self-reported frequency of use of cognitive reappraisal, is positively related to independent variable, emotional awareness, after controlling for age, sex, and violence exposure.\n\n2. We hypothesize that dependent variable amygdala activation during reappraisal (vs. reactivity) is negatively related to independent variable emotional awareness such that higher emotional awareness would be associated with lower amygdala activation during reappraisal after controlling for age, sex, and violence exposure.\n\n3. We will conduct an exploratory whole-brain analysis of activation during reappraisal (vs. reactivity) to identify significant clusters of voxels that are related to independent variable emotional awareness, after controlling for age, sex, and violence exposure. \n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

They were instructed to either look at images of emotional neutral or negative faces or attempt to regulate their response using cognitive reappraisal. Participants rated the valence of their emotional response after each image was presented. Participants were instructed to relax between trials.\n\nEmotional awareness was assessed by the \u201cPoor Awareness\u201d subscale of the Expression and Emotion Scale for Children (EESC). The EESC is a questionnaire that uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all true) to 5 (extremely true). The eight-item Poor Awareness subscale measures lack of emotional awareness (e.g., \u201cSometimes I just don\u2019t have words to describe how I feel\u201d; \u201cI have feelings I can\u2019t figure out\u201d). Strong reliability, validity, and internal consistency of the Poor Awareness subscale have been well-documented (Penza-Clyve &amp; Zeman, 2002; Sim et al., 2009; Simon et al., 2017; Zeman et al., 2002). Previous studies have not found any gender differences on the poor awareness subscale (Sim et al., 2009).\n\nBecause half the sample was trauma exposed (n = 79), all analyses control for trauma exposure.

McLaughlin, David Weissman", "q3": "Emotional awareness is reflected by the ability to recognize, differentiate and label emotional states (Croyle &amp; Waltz, 2002; Lane &amp; Schwartz, 1987; Lennartsson et al., 2017). In addition to feeling an emotion, emotion awareness requires cognitive reflection on what is being experienced (Barrett et al., 2001; Croyle &amp; Waltz, 2002). Emotional awareness is widely accepted as a prerequisite for adaptive emotion regulation abilities (Barrett et al., 2001; Lambie &amp; Marcel, 2002; Teasdale, 1999). Barrett et al. (2001) suggest that knowing what one is feeling can inform how to go about coping with those emotions. Indeed, individuals with higher emotional awareness are more likely to use adaptive emotion regulation strategies like cognitive reappraisal compared to maladaptive strategies like suppression (Subic-Wrana et al., 2014). \n\nCognitive reappraisal is an emotion regulation technique where one reframes what they are experiencing so as to make it less distressing. The technique involves maintaining the intention to reappraise in working memory, using semantic memory to generate alternative appraisals given the context of the situation, selecting a new appraisal, and then updating and sustaining this reappraisal in working memory\u2014all while evaluating whether or not the appraisal was successful in regulating one\u2019s emotional state (Ochsner &amp; Gross, 2008). Cognitive reappraisal has consistently been shown to activate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and is associated with decreased amygdala activation relative to passive viewing of emotional stimuli without using reappraisal (Buhle et al., 2014; Kalisch, 2009). The amygdala is activated in response to stimuli that have motivational salience (Lee et al., 2012; Santos et al., 2011). The dlPFC is involved with manipulation of verbal and spatial knowledge, and thus may be central to continuously updating appraisals in working memory (i.e. maintaining the intention to reappraise in working memory) (Barbey et al., 2013; Buhle et al., 2014; Wager &amp; Smith, 2003). On the other hand, the vlPFC may be involved with selection and inhibition of appraisals, and the dmPFC may support inferring higher-level meaning from stimuli and affective states (i.e. appraisal), particularly from negative emotional stimuli (Baetens et al., 2017; Buhle et al., 2014; Etkin et al., 2011). \n\nWe expect emotional awareness will support emotion regulation in two ways. First, we anticipate higher emotion awareness will make regulation using cognitive reappraisal more effective, since low emotional awareness is associated with ineffective regulation (Kalokerinos et al., 2019). Specifically, higher emotional awareness should be associated with greater reduction in amygdala activation during reappraisal relative to passive viewing. Second, we expect that that higher emotional awareness will be associated with greater use of reappraisal, and less use of suppression and rumination (i.e., negative emotion regulation strategies).\n", "q4": "1. We hypothesize that dependent variable, self-reported frequency of use of cognitive reappraisal, is positively related to independent variable, emotional awareness, after controlling for age, sex, and violence exposure.\n\n2. We hypothesize that dependent variable amygdala activation during reappraisal (vs. reactivity) is negatively related to independent variable emotional awareness such that higher emotional awareness would be associated with lower amygdala activation during reappraisal after controlling for age, sex, and violence exposure.\n\n3. We will conduct an exploratory whole-brain analysis of activation during reappraisal (vs. reactivity) to identify significant clusters of voxels that are related to independent variable emotional awareness, after controlling for age, sex, and violence exposure. \n", "q5": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

They were instructed to either look at images of emotional neutral or negative faces or attempt to regulate their response using cognitive reappraisal. Participants rated the valence of their emotional response after each image was presented. Participants were instructed to relax between trials.\n\nEmotional awareness was assessed by the \u201cPoor Awareness\u201d subscale of the Expression and Emotion Scale for Children (EESC). The EESC is a questionnaire that uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all true) to 5 (extremely true). The eight-item Poor Awareness subscale measures lack of emotional awareness (e.g., \u201cSometimes I just don\u2019t have words to describe how I feel\u201d; \u201cI have feelings I can\u2019t figure out\u201d). Strong reliability, validity, and internal consistency of the Poor Awareness subscale have been well-documented (Penza-Clyve &amp; Zeman, 2002; Sim et al., 2009; Simon et al., 2017; Zeman et al., 2002). Previous studies have not found any gender differences on the poor awareness subscale (Sim et al., 2009).\n\nBecause half the sample was trauma exposed (n = 79), all analyses control for trauma exposure. More details on how participants were categorized can be found be found in Weissman et al. (2019).", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "160 participants between the ages of 8 and 17 were recruited at adoption programs, food banks, schools, after-school and prevention programs, medical clinics, shelters, parenting programs, and the general community in Seattle, WA between January 2015 and June 2017. The aim was to recruit a sample with high variability in trauma and maltreatment exposure. Thus, we targeted areas such as clinics that served a predominantly low-SES population, high-crime neighborhoods, and programs affiliated with Child Protective Services. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were assessed at the first visit.\n\nInclusion criteria for the maltreated group, consisted of exposure to physical or sexual abuse or direct witnessing of domestic violence (i.e., violence directed towards a caregiver). Participants in the control group were required to have neither maltreatment nor violence exposure. Participants were matched on age, gender, and handedness. Exclusion criteria included IQ &lt; 80, pervasive developmental disorder, active psychotic symptoms, mania, substance abuse, other safety concerns, as well as any standard contraindications for MRI scanning (e.g., braces).\n\n2019 Child Trauma and the Development of Neural Systems Underlying Emotion Regulation (NIH R01MH103291) Data consist of 151 subjects. 160 participants initially completed the emotion regulation fMRI task. However, 9 participants were excluded due to excessive motion during scanning (n=2), not responding during more than 2 runs of the fMRI Task (n=2), incompletion of the task (n=4), and significant non-maltreatment-related violence exposure (n=1).", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "1.

disorder: A multiple case series", "description": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterised by a fear of negative evaluation leading to severe distress and avoidance. SAD is common and can have a significant negative impact on many aspects of life in both childhood and adulthood (e.g. on school attendance and attainment, relationships and jobs). It is often diagnosed in early adolescence, with a median age of onset of 13 years. However, when left untreated, SAD typically persists into adulthood. As such, effective, early interventions are important. SAD in young people is particularly resistant to the current psychological treatments that are used, but recent evidence suggests that an approach that is used successfully to treat SAD in adults may also be successful in treating SAD in young people. However, this treatment involves young people entering social situations to test out theories about the consequences of feared situations. This can be difficult to do within therapy sessions in practice, particularly due to limited access to relevant environments and the increased burden this causes in terms of therapist time and resources. Recently, virtual reality (VR) software has been applied as a means to conduct exposure to social situations and, for example, for conducting behavioural experiments within treatment of adults with paranoid delusions. Given its success so far, the current study seeks to conduct a preliminary investigation of the potential use of VR in the treatment of performance fears among adolescents with SAD by assessing whether young people experience performance fears and negative thoughts in VR social scenarios, whether these change after conducting a behavioural experiment to test out fears in the VR environment, and whether any new learning generalises to real world scenarios.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-03-09T13:37:58.615610", "date_modified": "2020-03-09T11:14:21.973564", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": null, "analytics_key": "8fea29c8c58e3ee6b45c1f69cc860e03b592b87f485a9e15e0c7f9945ee13382cd20f7381a689d57e537d61b1f71cc2f52478842b5f929b97353e8eeba916618b41285c04d37ea321444fc9abafa35c96b91fa63e08934be379ce103e0edd013979035e1563db4a1c4669c0bb45e2dd90e774cd92ea5ae44fe5863d589aac8c6aee13d505762d382e1e145fbe7bc2e84", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-03-09T13:37:58.591967", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Using virtual reality to test fears among adolescents with social anxiety disorder: A multiple case series"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Samantha Pearcey"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterised by a fear of negative evaluation leading to severe distress and avoidance.

After initial piloting of the battery, we made some modifications to the tasks and added a consonant-vowel Dichotic Listening task. We also adapted the analysis plan to include a structural equation modeling to look at dissociations between laterality on different tasks. \n\nHemispheric specialisation (lateralisation) is a ubiquitous characteristic of the human brain, and yet many questions remain unanswered as to its causes and consequences. Much of the ambiguity in the literature may arise from unreliable measures of lateralisation and underpowered studies. This study aims to develop a reliable online battery to assess lateralisation, which could be used to test large numbers of participants.\n\nThe new battery will consist of:\n\u2022\tFour behavioural laterality tests:\n1.\tRhyme Decision: A visual half-field task in which participants decide whether a central written word rhymes with the name of a laterally-presented picture. This measures laterality of language processing.\n2.\tDichotic Listening: A dichotic listening task in which participants hear two consonant-vowel (CV) auditory stimuli simultaneously, one to each ear. They are required to report which CV stimulus out of six options (ba, da, ga, ka, pa, ta) provided the best match to the stimulus they heard . This measures laterality of language processing.\n3.\tChimeric Faces: A visual half-field task in which participants view stimuli that are vertically split at the midline with each hemiface displaying one of four emotions (anger, disgust, happiness, and sadness), They are required to report the overall emotion that they perceive in the face. This measures laterality of face and emotion processing.\n4.\tFinger Tapping: A speeded sequential key-pressing task performed using a computer keyboard with left and right hands. This provides a quantitative measure of relative skill of the two hands.\n\u2022\tThe Lexical Test for Advanced Learners of English (LexTALE; Lemh\u00f6fer &amp; Broersma, 2012), to assess vocabulary as an indicator of language proficiency.\n\u2022\tThe Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, 1971), to assess manual preference.\n\u2022\tModified versions of the Miles Test (Miles, 1929) and the Porta Test (Porac &amp; Coren, 1976) which are suitable for online testing, to assess ocular dominance. \n\u2022\tA basic demographic questionnaire. This will include questions about age, gender, footedness, years in education, and bilingualism. \n\nThe study is primarily exploratory. Our principal goal is to refine the four laterality tests to maximise test-retest reliability. The whole battery will be administered at the first testing session, then the four laterality tests will be repeated at a second session 3-10 days later. In addition, we will test some predictions about the relationships between laterality on the four tests.\n\nThe primary outcome measure from each of the four tests is a laterality index; depending on the task, this is based on difference between left and right sides in accuracy (dichotic and chimeric faces tasks), reaction time (rhyme decision), or completed sequences (finger tapping) (see \u2018Indices\u2019 section below for details). \n\nAs well as establishing reliability of measures, we will consider the inter-relationships between them. With online testing, there is the opportunity to test this using an adequately powered sample using measures of known reliability.  Prior studies have been inconclusive because it has been difficult gather large amounts of data to establish test-retest reliability. For instance, Van der Haegen and Brysbaert (2018), found that language laterality did not correlate with face laterality in visual half-field tasks. However, their study was restricted to left-handers, who may be atypical in this regard, and they noted that lack of association was hard to interpret because it may be due to unreliability of measurement. \n\nOur research questions are as follows:\n\n1.\tIs it possible to achieve test-retest reliability of .65 or more with laterality indices derived from the four laterality tests?  If so, could this be achieved more efficiently by using fewer trials in each test?\n2.\tLaterality indices can be calculated in multiple different ways (e.g. using RT, accuracy or a combination of the two; as a raw difference score or a proportion). We will explore these options (described in more detail in the \u2018Indices\u2019 section) to determine which metric shows the strongest test-retest reliability.\n3.\tDo extreme left-handers show a higher rate of atypical laterality than right-handers on the Rhyme Decision, Dichotic listening, or Chimeric Faces tasks?\n4.\tDo the laterality indices from the language and faces laterality tasks correlate? This question will be considered separately for left- and right-handers, since our previous research on language laterality indicated a single factor provided a good fit to data from right-handers but not left-handers."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "As noted above, our main goal is to devise a battery of laterality assessments with adequate test-retest reliability. In addition we have specific a priori hypotheses relating to questions 3 and 4 as follows:\n\nHypothesis 1: At a population level, the laterality indices for Rhyme Decision will show a right visual field advantage (indicating left hemisphere dominance for language processing); the laterality indices for the Dichotic Listening task will show a right ear advantage (indicating left hemisphere dominance for language); the laterality indices for Chimeric Faces will show a left visual field advantage (indicating right hemisphere dominance for face or emotion processing); and the Finger Tapping task will show a right hand advantage.\n\nHypothesis 2: Strong left-handers (i.e. those with laterality quotient of -90 or less on the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory) will be more likely to show atypical laterality (i.e. laterality in the opposite direction to our population level predictions) than right-handers. This prediction follows from observations by Mazoyer et al (2014) who studied a large group of left- and right-handers using fMRI to measure language laterality. They concluded \"concordance of hemispheric dominance for hand and for language occurs barely above the chance level, except in a group of rare individuals (less than 1% in the general population) who exhibit strong right hemisphere dominance for both language and their preferred hand.\"\n\nHypothesis 3: For right-handers, a model (a) where the two language tasks are correlated with each other but not with the chimeric faces will provide better fit to the data than a model (b) in which laterality indices are correlated between the language and chimeric face tasks, or a base model (c) where each task is independently lateralised. For left-handers, we anticipate that that model (c) may be a better fit to the data, indicating that laterality is dissociated across the different tasks. \n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

This will estimate sensitivity to stimuli presented in either visual field and equate to a laterality index. One benefit of this approach is that we can also identify participants who show a statistically significant RT advantage for one side, i.e. where the t-value on 2-sided test has p &lt; .05.  We will collect and report accuracy data for this task, but our pilot testing indicated that most participants score near ceiling, and this is not a sensitive measure of lateralisation.\n\nFor Dichotic Listening, laterality indices will calculated based on trials in which participants correctly identify a consonant-vowel sound. The count of correct responses that corresponds to each side  will be used to generate an accuracy LI. The index will be calculated in the traditional fashion: 100*(Right \u2013 Left) / (Right + Left).

After initial piloting of the battery, we made some modifications to the tasks and added a consonant-vowel Dichotic Listening task. We also adapted the analysis plan to include a structural equation modeling to look at dissociations between laterality on different tasks. \n\nHemispheric specialisation (lateralisation) is a ubiquitous characteristic of the human brain, and yet many questions remain unanswered as to its causes and consequences. Much of the ambiguity in the literature may arise from unreliable measures of lateralisation and underpowered studies. This study aims to develop a reliable online battery to assess lateralisation, which could be used to test large numbers of participants.\n\nThe new battery will consist of:\n\u2022\tFour behavioural laterality tests:\n1.\tRhyme Decision: A visual half-field task in which participants decide whether a central written word rhymes with the name of a laterally-presented picture. This measures laterality of language processing.\n2.\tDichotic Listening: A dichotic listening task in which participants hear two consonant-vowel (CV) auditory stimuli simultaneously, one to each ear. They are required to report which CV stimulus out of six options (ba, da, ga, ka, pa, ta) provided the best match to the stimulus they heard . This measures laterality of language processing.\n3.\tChimeric Faces: A visual half-field task in which participants view stimuli that are vertically split at the midline with each hemiface displaying one of four emotions (anger, disgust, happiness, and sadness), They are required to report the overall emotion that they perceive in the face. This measures laterality of face and emotion processing.\n4.\tFinger Tapping: A speeded sequential key-pressing task performed using a computer keyboard with left and right hands. This provides a quantitative measure of relative skill of the two hands.\n\u2022\tThe Lexical Test for Advanced Learners of English (LexTALE; Lemh\u00f6fer &amp; Broersma, 2012), to assess vocabulary as an indicator of language proficiency.\n\u2022\tThe Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, 1971), to assess manual preference.\n\u2022\tModified versions of the Miles Test (Miles, 1929) and the Porta Test (Porac &amp; Coren, 1976) which are suitable for online testing, to assess ocular dominance. \n\u2022\tA basic demographic questionnaire.

Our principal goal is to refine the four laterality tests to maximise test-retest reliability. The whole battery will be administered at the first testing session, then the four laterality tests will be repeated at a second session 3-10 days later. In addition, we will test some predictions about the relationships between laterality on the four tests.\n\nThe primary outcome measure from each of the four tests is a laterality index; depending on the task, this is based on difference between left and right sides in accuracy (dichotic and chimeric faces tasks), reaction time (rhyme decision), or completed sequences (finger tapping) (see \u2018Indices\u2019 section below for details). \n\nAs well as establishing reliability of measures, we will consider the inter-relationships between them. With online testing, there is the opportunity to test this using an adequately powered sample using measures of known reliability.  Prior studies have been inconclusive because it has been difficult gather large amounts of data to establish test-retest reliability. For instance, Van der Haegen and Brysbaert (2018), found that language laterality did not correlate with face laterality in visual half-field tasks. However, their study was restricted to left-handers, who may be atypical in this regard, and they noted that lack of association was hard to interpret because it may be due to unreliability of measurement. \n\nOur research questions are as follows:\n\n1.\tIs it possible to achieve test-retest reliability of .65 or more with laterality indices derived from the four laterality tests?  If so, could this be achieved more efficiently by using fewer trials in each test?\n2.\tLaterality indices can be calculated in multiple different ways (e.g. using RT, accuracy or a combination of the two; as a raw difference score or a proportion). We will explore these options (described in more detail in the \u2018Indices\u2019 section) to determine which metric shows the strongest test-retest reliability.\n3.\tDo extreme left-handers show a higher rate of atypical laterality than right-handers on the Rhyme Decision, Dichotic listening, or Chimeric Faces tasks?\n4.\tDo the laterality indices from the language and faces laterality tasks correlate? This question will be considered separately for left- and right-handers, since our previous research on language laterality indicated a single factor provided a good fit to data from right-handers but not left-handers.", "q4": "As noted above, our main goal is to devise a battery of laterality assessments with adequate test-retest reliability. In addition we have specific a priori hypotheses relating to questions 3 and 4 as follows:\n\nHypothesis 1: At a population level, the laterality indices for Rhyme Decision will show a right visual field advantage (indicating left hemisphere dominance for language processing); the laterality indices for the Dichotic Listening task will show a right ear advantage (indicating left hemisphere dominance for language); the laterality indices for Chimeric Faces will show a left visual field advantage (indicating right hemisphere dominance for face or emotion processing); and the Finger Tapping task will show a right hand advantage.\n\nHypothesis 2: Strong left-handers (i.e. those with laterality quotient of -90 or less on the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory) will be more likely to show atypical laterality (i.e. laterality in the opposite direction to our population level predictions) than right-handers. This prediction follows from observations by Mazoyer et al (2014) who studied a large group of left- and right-handers using fMRI to measure language laterality. They concluded \"concordance of hemispheric dominance for hand and for language occurs barely above the chance level, except in a group of rare individuals (less than 1% in the general population) who exhibit strong right hemisphere dominance for both language and their preferred hand.\"\n\nHypothesis 3: For right-handers, a model (a) where the two language tasks are correlated with each other but not with the chimeric faces will provide better fit to the data than a model (b) in which laterality indices are correlated between the language and chimeric face tasks, or a base model (c) where each task is independently lateralised. For left-handers, we anticipate that that model (c) may be a better fit to the data, indicating that laterality is dissociated across the different tasks. \n", "q5": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

This early-developing understanding of intentions is quickly over-extended and applied beyond the domain of intentional action, resulting in scientifically unwarranted teleological beliefs for which no agent could plausibly be attributed with intentions.  A robust finding in the literature is that children tend to be more accepting of scientifically unwarranted teleological explanations than adults are (e.g., Kelemen, 1999b).  However, in adults, teleological acceptance increases when semantic knowledge is impaired as a result of neurological degeneration (Lombrozo, Kelemen, and Zaitchick, 2007), in the absence of formal education (Casler and Kelemen, 2008), and when under time-pressure to respond (Kelemen, Rottman, and Seston, 2013).  Importantly, Kelemen et al. (2013) found that speeded responding had a greater effect on inaccuracy for teleological test statements than for control statements, suggesting that speeded responding is a method of measuring \"implicit\" teleological beliefs rather than causing a general inaccuracy in responding.  This persistence of child-like teleological beliefs throughout adulthood has been dubbed \"co-existence\", because although a person may explicitly disagree with a scientifically unwarranted teleological explanation of the natural world, implicitly, that same explanation continues to hold an intuitive appeal.\n\nGiven that teleological thought is said to be based in an understanding of intentional agents (Kelemen, 1999a), it is no surprise that a number of studies have found a positive relationship between scientifically unwarranted teleological acceptance and religious belief (e.g., Kelemen and Rosset, 2009; Kelemen et al., 2013; Roberts, Wastell, &amp; Polito, 2020).  In a series of large online studies Roberts and Polito (in preparation), found negative relationships between accuracy in responding to scientifically unwarranted teleological explanations, and both a belief in supernatural agents and anthropomorphism, and a positive relationship between accuracy in responding to teleological test statements and the tendency to inhibit intuitions.  Similar relationships were observed between these three predictors and accuracy in responding to control statements which were objectively false, but not with control statements which were objectively true.  We also found that accuracy in responding to teleological test statements was positively correlated with accuracy in responding to control statements which were objectively false, but not with control statements which were objectively true.\n\nRQ1:  Do these relationships replicate using an undergraduate sample in a laboratory-based study?\n\nRQ2:  Given that accuracy in responding to teleological test statements was positively related to accuracy for false, but not true control statements (Roberts and Polito, in preparation), does Kelemen et al.'s (2013) finding of speeded responding having a greater effect on test statement inaccuracy than control statement inaccuracy, also hold when looking only at control statements which are objectively false?  Put another way, does speeded responding uncover a teleological bias as claimed, or does speeded responding increase acceptance of bad arguments?\n\nWhen the three predictors were included together in a model, Roberts and Polito (in preparation) found that belief in supernatural agents and the tendency to anthropomorphise both negatively predicted unwarranted teleological accuracy after controlling for the inhibition of intuitions.  However, the effect of anthropomorphism was stronger than the effect of belief in supernatural agents, suggesting that scientifically unwarranted teleological beliefs reflect the application of an intentional stance rather than a design stance.  Conversely, the tendency to inhibit intuitions positively predicted unwarranted teleological accuracy after controlling for belief in supernatural agents and the tendency to anthropomorphise.\n\nIn summary, these findings suggest that on the one hand, scientifically unwarranted teleological beliefs are intuitively appealing despite potentially conflicting explicitly expressed beliefs.  However, explicitly expressed scientifically unwarranted teleological beliefs are associated with a belief in supernatural agents, anthropomorphism, and being less able to inhibit intuitions.\n\nRQ3: Does the difference between accuracy in responding to scientifically unwarranted teleological explanations under speeded compared to un-speeded conditions, depend upon a person's belief in supernatural agents, tendency to anthropomorphise, and their ability to inhibit intuitions?\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "* Responses to teleological test statements and false control statements will be reverse-coded, whereby a response of \"true\" is given a score of 0 and a response of \"false\" is given a score of 1, such that higher scores represent more accurate responding.\n\nH1.

However, we are aiming for slightly over this number for two reasons: Firstly, the hypotheses regarding the interactions between condition (speeded, un-speeded) and religious belief, anthropomorphism, and tendency to inhibit intuitions, are novel.  Secondly, Kelemen et al. (2013) report a high rate of exclusion due to not enough valid responses in the speeded condition (participants were excluded for failing to answer over 75% of test statements within the time limit).

Although the findings of Roberts and Polito (in preparation) suggest that anthropomorphism and inhibition of intuitions are both more important than a belief in supernatural agents for predicting scientifically unwarranted teleological beliefs, it is unclear how these variables may interact with the condition (speeded, un-speeded) when included in a model together.  For example, whether anthropomorphism accounts for a divergence between implicit and explicit teleological beliefs after controlling for belief in supernatural agents and inhibition of intuitions.  \n\nAn exploratory repeated measures ANCOVA will be conducted with condition (speeded, un-speeded) as the within-subjects factor, r-CRS, IDAQ, and CRT as covariates, and accuracy to test statements as the DV.  We will explore the interactions between each predictor and condition of the task when the other predictors are included in the model.\n\nE2.

Specifically, participants might be quicker to respond \u201ctrue\u201d to test statements than they are to respond \u201cfalse\u201d.\n\nAn exploratory repeated-measures ANOVA will be conducted for the un-speeded condition, with response (true, false) as the within subject factor, and response latency as the DV.", "q25": "N/A", "q8.question": "Condition (speeded, un-speeded) is manipulated within-subjects.

This variable has six levels: biological test, natural non-living test, true teleological control, true causal control, false teleological control, false causal control.

Accuracy for each statement type will then be calculated as the percentage of items endorsed, such that a higher score represents more accurate responding.\n\nIV3 - Belief in supernatural agents (r-CRS).  The full CRS contains five sub-scales (intellect, public practice, private practice, ideology, experience).  However, only the private practice, ideology, and experience sub-scales necessarily require a belief in the existence of supernatural agents.  We therefore use a reduced version of this scale (r-CRS) which is calculated as the mean of all items in the private practice, ideology, and experience sub-scales.\n\nIV4 - Anthropomorphism (IDAQ).  The IDAQ contains 15 items which are scored on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very much).  Total IDAQ score is obtained by summing responses to all 15 items, such that scores have a possible range of 0 to 150, with higher scores representing a more anthropomorphic world-view.\n\nIV5 - Inhibition of intuitions (CRT).  Scores on the CRT are scored as either: 1) incorrect but intuitive response; 2) incorrect response, or; 3) correct reflective response.  From these responses, two scores can be computed.  Firstly, the reflective score is calculated as the number of correct responses.  Secondly, the intuitive score is calculated as the number of incorrect but intuitive responses.

Replicating the previous relationships between accuracy and the three predictors (Roberts and Polito, in preparation), the following pattern of correlations are predicted:\n1a. A significant negative relationship between belief in supernatural agents (r-CRS) and accuracy in responding to teleological test statements and false control statements in the un-speeded condition.\n1b.

In this analysis we will include scores on the r-CRS, IDAQ, and CRT (calculated as described previously), and accuracy for test statements, true controls, and false controls in the un-speeded condition (collapsed as previously described).\n\nH2.  In line with previous findings supporting the co-existence perspective (e.g., Kelemen et al., 2013), we predict that speeded responding will have a stronger effect on inaccuracy for teleological test statements than for false control statements.  This will be evident from the following effects:\n2a. A main effect of condition, whereby accuracy is higher in the un-speeded condition than the speeded condition.\n2b. An interaction between condition and statement-type, whereby the difference between speeded and un-speeded accuracy is larger for test statements than for false control statements.\n\nAnalysis:  A 2 (condition: speeded, un-speeded) x 2 (statement: test, false control) repeated-measures ANOVA with accuracy as the DV will test hypothesis 2.\n\nH3.
