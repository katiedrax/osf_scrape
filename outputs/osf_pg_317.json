Most interventions for CLBP offer minimal clinically meaningful improvements in pain and disability (Henschke et al. 2010, Chou et al. 2017a, Chou et al. 2017b) and some interventions have harmful side effects (Abdel Shaheed et al. 2016). Novel treatments are needed to move the field forward. \n\nThere has been a shift in focus towards exploring the brain of people in pain. Research has identified neurochemical, structural and functional changes in the brains of patients with chronic low back pain compared to people without pain (Wand et al. 2011). Many studies have shown the influence of beliefs, expectations, contextual factors, cognitive, and emotional regulation in the experience of pain which can, at least in part, be modulated by experimental conditions or interventions (Matthewson et al. 2019, Koban et al. 2019). These findings have encouraged researchers to develop new treatments for the management of CLBP (Moseley 2016). Bagg et al. (2017) conducted a randomized controlled trial (RESOLVE) which assessed the efficacy of a graded rehabilitation programme for people with CLBP. In this trial, patients received a package of strategies that are thought to target central nervous dysfunction (Bagg et al. 2017), including pain education, sensory discriminative training, graded motor imagery, mirror visual feedback and movement training (Bagg et al. 2017). It is possible that many of the therapies in the RESOLVE are unfamiliar for patients with CLBP. Treatment beliefs have been associated with treatment choice (Dima et al. 2015), and several barriers have been identified for treatment of low back pain such as lack of discussion about self-management; unrecognition of the emotional impact of pain in patients \u2018life; and characteristics of treatment organization (Gordon et al. 2017). Participants of the RESOLVE-trial could provide valuable information about their experience in receiving interventions designed to target the brain instead of targeting the structure of the back.\n\nQualitative research is the optimal design to understand the patient experience, offering rich and compelling insights into the real-world experiences and perspectives of patients (Braun and Clarke 2014). There are no qualitative studies exploring the patients` perception of interventions intended explicitly to target the function of the brain to manage CLBP.

psychological symptoms over time and the effect of the exposure to multiple types of trauma in children exposed to war/conflict and not receiving psychosocial interventions. An important opportunity to understand the longitudinal trajectories of mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of conflict-affected children concerns the analysis of control groups in intervention studies. In this study, we aim to take advantage of a series of four cluster randomized trials with identical design that focused on a classroom-based intervention with conflict-affected children in Burundi, Indonesia, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. In the present project we aim to analyze: 1) the different directions that children responses to conflict-related events may take in terms of psychological symptoms and resilience outcomes over time; 2) the impact of the number of types of traumatic events on psychological symptoms and resilience outcomes over time.

revealed that collective narcissism is positively related to both RWA and SDO (Golec et al., 2009; Golec et al., 2013; G\u00f3rska et al., 2019). At the same time, findings regarding the relationship between in-group identification and ideological beliefs seem to be less consistent. Specifically, while in-group identification tends to correlate positively with RWA (Golec et al., 2009; Golec et al., 2013; G\u00f3rska et al., 2019), its association with SDO ranges from r = -.18 (Golec et al., 2013; Study 3) to r = .33 (Golec et al., 2009; Study 1). \n\nImportantly, none of the past research examined whether ideological attitudes are the antecedent or the consequence of narcissistic and non-narcissistic in-group identification. Even if RWA and SDO were assessed in the past studies, they were treated as the covariates of collective narcissism and secure in-group identification. Moreover, past research used solely cross-sectional design, which did not allow for observing the relations of interest over time. In this project, we aim to check the longitudinal associations between the two modes of in-group identification and ideological beliefs. To this end, we will use data from two two-wave surveys conducted in the population of adult Poles. The current pre-registration concerns Study 2. \n\nIn the following paragraphs, we propose that ideological beliefs may be considered both as the antecedents and the consequences of narcissistic and non-narcissistic in-group identification. We begin with presenting theoretical and empirical arguments in favor of Ideological-attitudes-as-antecedents hypothesis, and then present the points supporting ideological-beliefs-as-consequences hypothesis. Next, we report the results of Study 1 \u2013 an initial attempt to test our predictions. \n\nIdeological attitudes as antecedens \n\n\tDual Process Model (Duckitt, 2001) proposes that intergroup attitudes are driven by two independent processes. One of these processes stems from punitive socialization and is associated with perceiving the world as a dangerous place and compliance to in-group norms. The other one, in turn, originates from unaffectionate child-rearing and entails viewing the world as a competitive jungle where the strong win and the weak loose. These two distinct perspectives on the world lead to the development of RWA and SDO, respectively.\n\n\tAs RWA and SDO are rooted in different motives (threat and dominance, respectively), they predict distinct outcomes. For instance, while RWA predicts negative attitudes toward groups that threaten social order, SDO is associated with prejudice toward groups located at the bottom of social hierarchy (Asbrock, Sibley, &amp; Duckitt, 2010). In-group identification mode may constitute yet another consequence of RWA and SDO. Specifically, high SDO individuals may be inclined to perceive their in-group as placed at the top of intergroup hierarchy. This motivation may be satisfied by collective narcissism, which encompasses viewing one\u2019s in-group as exceptional and entitled to privileged treatment (even if unrecognized). As such, it is reasonable to expect a positive over-time effect of SDO on collective narcissism (S1H1).  By contrast, non-narcissistic in-group identification, which encompasses positive yet critical views of one\u2019s group and elicits positive behavior toward low-status groups (G\u00f3rska et al., in press), remains in conflict with domination motive. Therefore, SDO should predict it negatively (S1H2). When RWA is concerned, it is reasonable to expect a positive effect of this variable on collective narcissism (S1H3). This is because both RWA and collective narcissism are associated with constant vigilance and a sense of threat. Moreover, in social contexts where the dominant discourse promotes grandiose in-group image, concern for social cohesion reflected in RWA may prompt the adoption of narcissistic in-group identification. At the same time, RWA may serve as the positive predictor of non-narcissistic identification with one\u2019s group (S1H4). Compliance to social norms and tradition may translate into in-group attachment, which is accompanied by positive attitudes toward different groups. Indeed, past research found that, in contrast to SDO, RWA might predict positive out-group attitudes if negative attitudes are perceived as the violation of existing norms (Bilewicz, Soral, Marchlewska, &amp; Winiewski, 2017; Roets, Au, &amp; van Hiel, 2015). When we combine the hypotheses mentioned above, we can expect that SDO and RWA should exert opposite effects on non-narcissistic in-group identification (S1H5), while their effects on collective narcissism should be similar. \n\t\nIdeological attitudes as consequences \n\t\nAlthough rarely explored in the literature (see Osborne, Milojev, &amp; Sibley, 2017), viewing SDO and RWA as the consequences of different modes of in-group identification is also theoretically viable. Specifically, belief in the extraordinary greatness of one\u2019s group (collective narcissism) may prompt the support for intergroup hierarchy, at least for members of  high- or average-status groups (S1H6). This, in turn, may lead to prejudice toward the disadvantaged. As shown in the past research, collective narcissism predicts hostility toward low-status groups such immigrants (Golec de Zavala, Cichocka, &amp; Bilewicz, 2016) or Muslims and Syrian refugees (Dyduch-Hazar, Mrozinski, Golec de Zavala, 2019). On the other hand, the constant sense of threat embedded in collective narcissism (e.g., Cichocka &amp; Golec de Zavala, 2012; Golec de Zavala, Cichocka, Iskra-Golec, 2013) may lead to adoption of RWA, which builds upon the need for safety (S1H7). Regarding non-narcissistic in-group identification, one may expect that this variable would have a negative over-time effect on SDO (S1H8). Secure attachment to one\u2019s group, which entails lower prejudice, may inoculate against explicitly hostile ideologies such as support for intergroup hierarchy. At the same time, non-narcissistic in-group identification seems likely to elicit adherence to social norms (especially the norm of tolerance), and, as such, may increase RWA over time (S1H9). Summing up, while narcissistic and non-narcissistic should exert opposite effects on SDO (S1H10), their effects on RWA may be similar.  \n\nHypotheses in Study 1\n\nS1H1. SDO is a positive over-time predictor of collective narcissism.\n\nS1H2. SDO is a negative over-time predictor of non-narcissistic in-group identification.\n\nS1H3. RWA is a positive over-time predictor of collective narcissism.\n\nS1H4. RWA is a positive over-time predictor of non-narcissistic in-group identification.\n\nS1H5. The difference between RWA and SDO over-time effects on non-narcissistic in-group identification is significant\n \nS1H6. Collective narcissism is a positive over-time predictor of SDO.\n\nS1H7. Collective narcissism is a positive over-time predictor of RWA.\n\nS1H8. Non-narcissistic in-group identification is a negative over-time predictor of SDO.\n\nS1H9. Non-narcissistic in-group identification is a positive over-time predictor of RWA.\n\nS1H10. The difference between collective narcissism and non-narcissistic in-group identification over-time effects on SDO is significant.\n\nStudy 1: Method \n\nTo verify our hypotheses, we conducted a two-wave longitudinal survey of Poles (Study 1; N = 599). Study 1 used Computer-Assisted Personal Interviews and a 6-month interval between the measurements. Participants of Wave 1 (N = 1,000) constituted a representative sample of adult Poles. Among other variables, the questionnaire included the measures of SDO, RWA, nation-based collective narcissism and in-group identification, individual narcissism, and individual self-esteem. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics and correlations for the variables assessed in Study 1. \n\nWe verified our hypotheses using SEM with ML estimator. While RWA, SDO, collective narcissism and in-group identification were specified as latent variables, individual narcissism and self-esteem served as observed variables. To improve the fit of estimated models, we created item parcels for RWA, SDA, individual narcissism and in-group identification prior to main analyses. \n\nAfter concluding scalar variance, we estimated four autoregressive cross-lagged panel models. These models differed along two dimensions \u2013 the number of included variables and the treatment of T2 latent variables. First, while two models (Figures 1 and 2) involved only latent variables (i.e., RWA, SDO, collective narcissism, and in-group identification), the other two (Figures 3 and 4) included six variables (latent variables plus individual narcissism and self-esteem as observed variables). Controlling for individual narcissism and self-esteem was aimed to test the robustness of our conclusions, as these variables had been demonstrated to correlate with the two modes of in-group identification (e.g., Golec de Zavala et al., 2009, 2019), as well as ideological beliefs (Cichocka et al., 2017).  Second, the analyses differed with regard to the way, in which T2 latent variables were defined. Specifically, next to conventional autoregressive cross-lagged panel models (Figures 1 and 3) we tested models accounting for the overlap between the measures of RWA and SDO, as well as collective narcissism and in-group identification (Figures 2 and 4). We assumed that by covarying-out the variances shared with counterpart variables, we would be more successful in capturing unique components of RWA, SDO, collective narcissism and in-group identification (see Cichocka et al., 2017; Golec de Zavala et al., 2013). Importantly, the fit of models with the equal number of variables was identical. \n\nRegarding our hypotheses,  only  part of them received support across all tested models (Table 2).  Specifically,  SDO was a negative over-time predictor of non-narcissistic  in-group identification (S1H2), the longitudinal effects of RWA and SDO on non-narcissistic in-group identification differed significantly (S1H5), collective narcissism was a positive over-time predictor of collective narcissism (S1H6), non-narcissistic in-group identification exerted a negative effect on (S1H8), and the effects of two different types of in-group identification had opposite effects on SDO (S1H10). \n\nPost-hoc power analyses using Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 each) showed that Study 1 was underpowered to detect the effects supporting S1H3, S1H4, S1H7, and S1H9 (Table 3). At the same time, the final sample size (N = 599) was rather high as for a two-wave study in social and personality psychology, which suggests that the effects corresponding to S1H3, S1H4, S1H7, and S1H9 were trivial.  \n\nIn conclusion, it seems that this was SDO (but not necessarily RWA) that  decided whether  high-status group members adopted narcissistic or non-narcissistic identification. While high SDO individuals were likely to develop collective narcissism, low SDO predisposed to non-narcissistic identification with one\u2019s group. In line with our expectations, RWA and SDO  differed in their longitudinal effects on  non-narcissistic in-group identification.  \n\nThe aim of Study 2 \u2013 the subject of this pre-registration \u2013 is to replicate findings obtained in Study 1 using a different set of longitudinal data coming from the same socio-political context. \n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Based on the results of power analyses reported in Table 4, we decided to test six hypotheses in Study 2:  \n\nS2H1.

At the same time, findings regarding the relationship between in-group identification and ideological beliefs seem to be less consistent. Specifically, while in-group identification tends to correlate positively with RWA (Golec et al., 2009; Golec et al., 2013; G\u00f3rska et al., 2019), its association with SDO ranges from r = -.18 (Golec et al., 2013; Study 3) to r = .33 (Golec et al., 2009; Study 1). \n\nImportantly, none of the past research examined whether ideological attitudes are the antecedent or the consequence of narcissistic and non-narcissistic in-group identification. Even if RWA and SDO were assessed in the past studies, they were treated as the covariates of collective narcissism and secure in-group identification. Moreover, past research used solely cross-sectional design, which did not allow for observing the relations of interest over time. In this project, we aim to check the longitudinal associations between the two modes of in-group identification and ideological beliefs. To this end, we will use data from two two-wave surveys conducted in the population of adult Poles. The current pre-registration concerns Study 2. \n\nIn the following paragraphs, we propose that ideological beliefs may be considered both as the antecedents and the consequences of narcissistic and non-narcissistic in-group identification. We begin with presenting theoretical and empirical arguments in favor of Ideological-attitudes-as-antecedents hypothesis, and then present the points supporting ideological-beliefs-as-consequences hypothesis. Next, we report the results of Study 1 \u2013 an initial attempt to test our predictions. \n\nIdeological attitudes as antecedens \n\n\tDual Process Model (Duckitt, 2001) proposes that intergroup attitudes are driven by two independent processes. One of these processes stems from punitive socialization and is associated with perceiving the world as a dangerous place and compliance to in-group norms. The other one, in turn, originates from unaffectionate child-rearing and entails viewing the world as a competitive jungle where the strong win and the weak loose. These two distinct perspectives on the world lead to the development of RWA and SDO, respectively.\n\n\tAs RWA and SDO are rooted in different motives (threat and dominance, respectively), they predict distinct outcomes. For instance, while RWA predicts negative attitudes toward groups that threaten social order, SDO is associated with prejudice toward groups located at the bottom of social hierarchy (Asbrock, Sibley, &amp; Duckitt, 2010). In-group identification mode may constitute yet another consequence of RWA and SDO. Specifically, high SDO individuals may be inclined to perceive their in-group as placed at the top of intergroup hierarchy. This motivation may be satisfied by collective narcissism, which encompasses viewing one\u2019s in-group as exceptional and entitled to privileged treatment (even if unrecognized). As such, it is reasonable to expect a positive over-time effect of SDO on collective narcissism (S1H1).  By contrast, non-narcissistic in-group identification, which encompasses positive yet critical views of one\u2019s group and elicits positive behavior toward low-status groups (G\u00f3rska et al., in press), remains in conflict with domination motive. Therefore, SDO should predict it negatively (S1H2). When RWA is concerned, it is reasonable to expect a positive effect of this variable on collective narcissism (S1H3). This is because both RWA and collective narcissism are associated with constant vigilance and a sense of threat. Moreover, in social contexts where the dominant discourse promotes grandiose in-group image, concern for social cohesion reflected in RWA may prompt the adoption of narcissistic in-group identification. At the same time, RWA may serve as the positive predictor of non-narcissistic identification with one\u2019s group (S1H4). Compliance to social norms and tradition may translate into in-group attachment, which is accompanied by positive attitudes toward different groups. Indeed, past research found that, in contrast to SDO, RWA might predict positive out-group attitudes if negative attitudes are perceived as the violation of existing norms (Bilewicz, Soral, Marchlewska, &amp; Winiewski, 2017; Roets, Au, &amp; van Hiel, 2015). When we combine the hypotheses mentioned above, we can expect that SDO and RWA should exert opposite effects on non-narcissistic in-group identification (S1H5), while their effects on collective narcissism should be similar. \n\t\nIdeological attitudes as consequences \n\t\nAlthough rarely explored in the literature (see Osborne, Milojev, &amp; Sibley, 2017), viewing SDO and RWA as the consequences of different modes of in-group identification is also theoretically viable. Specifically, belief in the extraordinary greatness of one\u2019s group (collective narcissism) may prompt the support for intergroup hierarchy, at least for members of  high- or average-status groups (S1H6). This, in turn, may lead to prejudice toward the disadvantaged. As shown in the past research, collective narcissism predicts hostility toward low-status groups such immigrants (Golec de Zavala, Cichocka, &amp; Bilewicz, 2016) or Muslims and Syrian refugees (Dyduch-Hazar, Mrozinski, Golec de Zavala, 2019). On the other hand, the constant sense of threat embedded in collective narcissism (e.g., Cichocka &amp; Golec de Zavala, 2012; Golec de Zavala, Cichocka, Iskra-Golec, 2013) may lead to adoption of RWA, which builds upon the need for safety (S1H7). Regarding non-narcissistic in-group identification, one may expect that this variable would have a negative over-time effect on SDO (S1H8). Secure attachment to one\u2019s group, which entails lower prejudice, may inoculate against explicitly hostile ideologies such as support for intergroup hierarchy. At the same time, non-narcissistic in-group identification seems likely to elicit adherence to social norms (especially the norm of tolerance), and, as such, may increase RWA over time (S1H9). Summing up, while narcissistic and non-narcissistic should exert opposite effects on SDO (S1H10), their effects on RWA may be similar.  \n\nHypotheses in Study 1\n\nS1H1. SDO is a positive over-time predictor of collective narcissism.\n\nS1H2. SDO is a negative over-time predictor of non-narcissistic in-group identification.\n\nS1H3. RWA is a positive over-time predictor of collective narcissism.\n\nS1H4. RWA is a positive over-time predictor of non-narcissistic in-group identification.\n\nS1H5. The difference between RWA and SDO over-time effects on non-narcissistic in-group identification is significant\n \nS1H6. Collective narcissism is a positive over-time predictor of SDO.\n\nS1H7. Collective narcissism is a positive over-time predictor of RWA.\n\nS1H8. Non-narcissistic in-group identification is a negative over-time predictor of SDO.\n\nS1H9. Non-narcissistic in-group identification is a positive over-time predictor of RWA.\n\nS1H10. The difference between collective narcissism and non-narcissistic in-group identification over-time effects on SDO is significant.\n\nStudy 1: Method \n\nTo verify our hypotheses, we conducted a two-wave longitudinal survey of Poles (Study 1; N = 599). Study 1 used Computer-Assisted Personal Interviews and a 6-month interval between the measurements. Participants of Wave 1 (N = 1,000) constituted a representative sample of adult Poles. Among other variables, the questionnaire included the measures of SDO, RWA, nation-based collective narcissism and in-group identification, individual narcissism, and individual self-esteem. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics and correlations for the variables assessed in Study 1. \n\nWe verified our hypotheses using SEM with ML estimator. While RWA, SDO, collective narcissism and in-group identification were specified as latent variables, individual narcissism and self-esteem served as observed variables. To improve the fit of estimated models, we created item parcels for RWA, SDA, individual narcissism and in-group identification prior to main analyses. \n\nAfter concluding scalar variance, we estimated four autoregressive cross-lagged panel models. These models differed along two dimensions \u2013 the number of included variables and the treatment of T2 latent variables. First, while two models (Figures 1 and 2) involved only latent variables (i.e., RWA, SDO, collective narcissism, and in-group identification), the other two (Figures 3 and 4) included six variables (latent variables plus individual narcissism and self-esteem as observed variables). Controlling for individual narcissism and self-esteem was aimed to test the robustness of our conclusions, as these variables had been demonstrated to correlate with the two modes of in-group identification (e.g., Golec de Zavala et al., 2009, 2019), as well as ideological beliefs (Cichocka et al., 2017).  Second, the analyses differed with regard to the way, in which T2 latent variables were defined. Specifically, next to conventional autoregressive cross-lagged panel models (Figures 1 and 3) we tested models accounting for the overlap between the measures of RWA and SDO, as well as collective narcissism and in-group identification (Figures 2 and 4). We assumed that by covarying-out the variances shared with counterpart variables, we would be more successful in capturing unique components of RWA, SDO, collective narcissism and in-group identification (see Cichocka et al., 2017; Golec de Zavala et al., 2013). Importantly, the fit of models with the equal number of variables was identical. \n\nRegarding our hypotheses,  only  part of them received support across all tested models (Table 2).  Specifically,  SDO was a negative over-time predictor of non-narcissistic  in-group identification (S1H2), the longitudinal effects of RWA and SDO on non-narcissistic in-group identification differed significantly (S1H5), collective narcissism was a positive over-time predictor of collective narcissism (S1H6), non-narcissistic in-group identification exerted a negative effect on (S1H8), and the effects of two different types of in-group identification had opposite effects on SDO (S1H10). \n\nPost-hoc power analyses using Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 each) showed that Study 1 was underpowered to detect the effects supporting S1H3, S1H4, S1H7, and S1H9 (Table 3). At the same time, the final sample size (N = 599) was rather high as for a two-wave study in social and personality psychology, which suggests that the effects corresponding to S1H3, S1H4, S1H7, and S1H9 were trivial.  \n\nIn conclusion, it seems that this was SDO (but not necessarily RWA) that  decided whether  high-status group members adopted narcissistic or non-narcissistic identification. While high SDO individuals were likely to develop collective narcissism, low SDO predisposed to non-narcissistic identification with one\u2019s group. In line with our expectations, RWA and SDO  differed in their longitudinal effects on  non-narcissistic in-group identification.  \n\nThe aim of Study 2 \u2013 the subject of this pre-registration \u2013 is to replicate findings obtained in Study 1 using a different set of longitudinal data coming from the same socio-political context. \n", "q4": "Based on the results of power analyses reported in Table 4, we decided to test six hypotheses in Study 2:  \n\nS2H1.

The difference between RWA and SDO over-time effects on non-narcissistic in-group identification is significantl.\n\nS2H4.

The difference between collective narcissism and non-narcissistic in-group identification over-time effects on SDO is significant.\n\nWhile for the models accounting for the shared variance between T2 RWA and SDO we expected all of these hypotheses to be in line with the data, for conventional autoregressive cross-lagged panel model hypotheses S2H2-S2H6 should hold (see Table 4). \n", "q5": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

The morbidity and mortality associated with osteoporotic fracture incur substantial social and economic costs, making osteoporosis a major public health concern (Vasikaran et al., 2011). The prevalence of osteoporosis, and associated fracture, increase substantially when women enter the menopause (Boschitsch, Durchschlag, &amp; Dimai, 2017), owing to a significant decline in oestrogen. When oestrogen is low, RANK-L (Receptor Activator of Necrosis factor-Kappa B Ligand) expression and binding are increased, which increase bone resorption (Riggs, Khosia, &amp; Melton, 2002). The number of women over 50 years in the UK is projected to increase (Rutherford, 2012), with most women spending more than one third of their lifetime beyond the menopausal transition (Ji &amp; Yu, 2015). Strategies for increasing or maintaining bone health for women in the menopausal period are therefore required, in order to prevent risk of osteoporotic fracture.\n\n\nWeight-bearing exercise is a non-pharmacological strategy for improving bone health and reducing osteoporosis. The osteogenic effect of exercise is mainly a result of mechanical loading on the bone (Sugiyama, Yamaguchi, &amp; Kawai, 2002). Based on animal studies (Rubin, Sommerfeldt, Judex, &amp; Qin, 2001), dynamic rather than static loads, high strain magnitudes/rates, rapid strain reversal and unusual frequency distributions have the greatest osteogenic effects (Ehrlich &amp; Lanyon, 2002). Exercise that mimics these loading patterns, such as that which is dynamic and high-impact, has been found to be successful (Babatunde &amp; Forsyth, 2013; Babatunde, Forsyth, &amp; Gidlow, 2012). Among postmenopausal women, however, exercise interventions for improving bone health have not always been effective (Kelley &amp; Kelley, 2006), since the exercise has not been of the right magnitude, \u2018oddness\u2019 or impact (Hannam et al., 2017). It is, therefore, important to use previously successful exercise interventions that have been carried on women who are oestrogen deplete (and therefore having a similar oestrogen status as menopausal women) and apply these to a postmenopausal population.\n\n\nAim: to examine the effect of an exercise intervention for preventing osteoporosis among postmenopausal women.\n\n\nObjectives: \n\nTo examine whether mean values for Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation (BUA) using Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) among postmenopausal women following an eight-month exercise intervention (and at 3-month follow up), will be significantly higher than those obtained pre-intervention.\n\n\nTo examine whether mean BUA values among postmenopausal women following an eight-month exercise intervention (and at 3-month follow up) will be significantly higher than mean values obtained from participants in a control group undertaking sham exercises for an equivalent duration. \n\nTo examine the feasibility of the eight-month exercise intervention for a potential larger study (larger sample size, increased number of trial arms and increased outcome measures), in terms of recruitment, adherence, perceptions, barriers, and acceptability.\n\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypotheses: Mean values for Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation (BUA) among postmenopausal women following an eight-month lifestyle intervention (consisting of dynamic, high-impact exercise) will be significantly higher than those obtained pre-intervention, and when compared to mean values obtained from participants in a sham control group.

The jumps will be performed without shoes on a hard surface. The jumps will be preceded by a warm-up lasting approximately 3 min and consisting of mobilisation exercises for the legs and lower back. The jumping protocol follows previous work in our laboratory (Babatunde &amp; Forsyth, 2014b; Babatunde &amp; Forsyth, 2015). Jumping will be progressed over time and in accordance with individual needs. Initially, jumping may be undertaken with the use of a handheld support (such as the back of a chair or table), should participants feel unstable. Jumps will be progressed to include multi-directional movements (jumping to the side, forwards, backwards, and diagonally). Natural progression will also occur as participants should improve their jump height with increased muscular explosiveness. Participants will be asked to fill out a simple, daily training log, stipulating when they have undertaken the exercise, in order for adherence to be assessed. \n\nIn the control group, participants will be required to perform balance exercises. Balance is an effective treatment for avoiding falls that could potentially lead to fracture, but do not bring about a significant change in bone mineral density (de Kam et al., 2009). The balancing exercises will be progressed and varied (to ensure adherence). Initially, the use of a handheld support (such as the back of the chair) can be used. Participants will be required to balance on one leg for up to 60 seconds (2 x 60 s is equivalent in duration to the 10 jumps). This exercise will initially be progressed using time, and then by doing the following: confounding the visual fixation (e.g., head turns), changing the centre of mass (e.g. arm/leg lifts); performing the stork balance (hands on hips, knee bent and supported by standing leg); reaching in multiple directions before regaining the initial stance; closing the eyes; reducing the base of support; and a combination of these activities. The starting level of difficulty will be prescribed by the researcher, according to each participant\u2019s functional ability. The balance exercises will be preceded by a warm-up lasting approximately 3 min and consisting of mobilisation exercises for the legs and lower back. The balance exercises are based on an existing protocol (Gianoudis et al., 2012). The purpose of the sham exercise is to foster the perception of full participation in the study, in order to decrease attrition rates, and to blind participants to the intervention. The balance exercises, although not improving bone health, could decrease the risk of fracture, making the sham control group more ethical, owing to potential improvements, and limited risks. \n\nTo ensure quality control, digitised video clips of all exercises will be provided for the participants, who will be encouraged to perform the exercises as demonstrated on the video. The participants will be invited to one fully supervised group exercise session per month. These sessions will be used to monitor exercise quality, and to ensure progression is appropriate for each participant. Sessions will last 15-20 min. Attendance at these sessions will be monitored through registers. Apart from these supervised exercise sessions, participants will be given free choice to determine where and when they do the exercises. At the instructor-led session, training logs (Appendix 3) will be submitted. If they are unable to attend, participants will be asked to submit training logs electronically, or via post. To encourage adherence, an App will be used, which will enable weekly announcements to be posted, as well as emails and/or text reminders. Participants will be free to contact the researchers about any concerns they have during the intervention. Apart from the exercise undertaken, participants will be requested to maintain their usual exercise throughout the study. \n\nTo improve adherence, Bandura\u2019s Social Cognitive Theory for changing behaviour will be drawn upon. Specific constructs will include the knowledge and skills to perform the prescribed intervention, personal regulation of goal-directed health behaviour (self-control), and self-confidence in engaging in the exercise despite the absence of supervision. Reinforcement, i.e., activities that increase the propensity for adherence during the trial and beyond the study\u2019s lifespan, will also be addressed. \n\nParticipants\u2019 level of self-efficacy for engaging in lifestyle change will be assessed using a five-point Likert scale, from \u2018not at all confident\u2019 to \u2018very confident. Participants will be asked to rate how confident they are to commit to engage in the exercise, irrespective of usual circumstances such as time constraints, stress, and fatigue. Assessment of self-efficacy will take place at the study onset, and at one-monthly intervals (via attendance at the supervised group sessions). With non-attendance, assessment will take place electronically. In the event of a low rating, modes of handling such situations without compromising commitment to the regime, will be given in relation to each participant\u2019s personal circumstances. In addition, at the study outset, participants will be asked to identify any circumstances that could motivate them to comply with the exercise, as well as any perceived barriers to adherence. Any issues will be discussed, and participants will be given the opportunity to design personalised adherence strategies. The aim will be to foster self-efficacy in both groups.\n\nAfter the eight-month intervention, all females in the trial arm, who have completed the study, will be invited to take part in a focus group (in groups of 8, depending on numbers who volunteer for this), to examine participants\u2019 perceptions of the intervention. A topic guide will be used, which includes: An exploration of the perceived barriers to undertaking the exercise intervention; issues with adherence; acceptability of the intervention; adverse events; enjoyment; ratings of perceived exertion; how easily the intervention could be incorporated into lifestyle. At the end of the focus group, the topic guide will be checked to ensure that all areas had been covered. Focus groups will likely last between 45 and 60 min, although will continue until the researcher feels that data saturation has been reached. The focus groups will be audio-recorded and subsequently transcribed to facilitate analysis. Non-verbal participant behaviour will also be recorded. Focus groups will be used, since the degree of commonality and disparity of views, attitudes, beliefs, and experiences between participants can be explored. Data from the focus groups will be analysed using inductive thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006), allowing for exploration and interpretation of the relevant issues more widely (Marks &amp; Yardley, 2004). This method will involve two of the researchers reading transcripts independently and devising their own coding, key concepts and themes. Codes and themes will be based on the research question: What is the feasibility of the eight-month exercise intervention for a potential larger study, in terms of exercise adherence, perceptions, barriers, and acceptability. All data that meet this research question will be coded. Themes will be constructed based on meaningful and coherent patterns in the data, relevant to the research questions. Analysis will be conducted by pairs of researchers, who will meet to compare their findings, and to agree a set of themes and subthemes. \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q17": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "All outcome measures will be taken at study outset (baseline), and at intervention end (8 months) and at 3-month follow up. In addition, data will be collected each month on: attendance at scheduled sessions; adherence to the intervention based on exercise logs; self-efficacy score; recording of adverse events including falls. \n\nThe primary outcome measure will be BUA as measured by Quantitative Ultrasound (UBIS 5000 Diagnostic Medical Systems, Montpellier, France). The sensitivity of Quantitative Ultrasound has been investigated through meta-analysis (Babatunde, Forsyth, &amp; Gidlow, 2012). In our laboratory, the short-term BUA measurement precision (coefficient of variation) with repositioning is 2.4%. Calibration and quality control is accomplished via an automated verification process just prior to the examination of each participant. The participant removes footwear from the dominant foot and places it in the foot well of the UBIS, which fills with water. Ultrasound waves are used to provide information on BUA, speed of sound and stiffness index. The test is non-invasive, with no ionising radiation.   \n\nSecondary outcome measures will include: timed up-and-go test [TUG]; ground reaction force; jump height; and quality of life. The TUG is often used in studies on osteoporosis prevention as a measure of fall risk, since the test measures dynamic balance during three commonly performed functional activities: standing up, sitting down, and walking and turning (Tan et al., 2008). The test involves the participant starting in a seated position, walking 3 m, turning around, then walking back to the chair to sit down. The test has an inter-rater reliability, using ICC, of .99 (Podsiadlo &amp; Richardson, 1991). To estimate the mechanical loading force due to the exercise, ground reaction force will be evaluated with the aid of a force plate (Advanced Mechanical Technology, Inc., AMTI). A countermovement jump test (with arms swinging naturally) will be used to assess change in jump height, using the Optojump system (Microgate S.r.l., Bolzano, Italy). Health-related quality of life will be measured using the SF-36v2 Health Survey (https://www.optum.com/solutions/life-sciences/answer-research/patient-insights/sf-health-surveys/sf-36v2-health-survey.html).\n\nPossible confounding variables to bone accrual include history of and changes to exercise and lifestyle patterns and history of/changes to medication and health. All participants will, therefore, also complete a lifestyle and medical questionnaire consisting of: history of/current disease(s)/illnesses; previous fractures; family history of fractures/osteoporosis; current medications and dietary supplements; caffeine consumption; alcohol consumption; smoking; age of onset of menopause; history of hormone contraception; and an already validated bone-loading history questionnaire (Dolan, Williams, Ainsworth, &amp; Shaw, 2006). All questionnaires will be self-report, but with the researcher present to aid clarity on request. \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q19": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "A series of ANCOVAs will be used to determine if, after adjustments for baseline values, the intervention significantly improved outcome measures.

[MOBILE]", "q2": "Jacky Forsyth, Dean Burt", "q3": "Osteoporosis is a progressive disease characterised by low bone mass and a deterioration in bone microarchitectural structure, leading to an increased susceptibility for fracture. The morbidity and mortality associated with osteoporotic fracture incur substantial social and economic costs, making osteoporosis a major public health concern (Vasikaran et al., 2011). The prevalence of osteoporosis, and associated fracture, increase substantially when women enter the menopause (Boschitsch, Durchschlag, &amp; Dimai, 2017), owing to a significant decline in oestrogen. When oestrogen is low, RANK-L (Receptor Activator of Necrosis factor-Kappa B Ligand) expression and binding are increased, which increase bone resorption (Riggs, Khosia, &amp; Melton, 2002). The number of women over 50 years in the UK is projected to increase (Rutherford, 2012), with most women spending more than one third of their lifetime beyond the menopausal transition (Ji &amp; Yu, 2015). Strategies for increasing or maintaining bone health for women in the menopausal period are therefore required, in order to prevent risk of osteoporotic fracture.\n\n\nWeight-bearing exercise is a non-pharmacological strategy for improving bone health and reducing osteoporosis. The osteogenic effect of exercise is mainly a result of mechanical loading on the bone (Sugiyama, Yamaguchi, &amp; Kawai, 2002). Based on animal studies (Rubin, Sommerfeldt, Judex, &amp; Qin, 2001), dynamic rather than static loads, high strain magnitudes/rates, rapid strain reversal and unusual frequency distributions have the greatest osteogenic effects (Ehrlich &amp; Lanyon, 2002). Exercise that mimics these loading patterns, such as that which is dynamic and high-impact, has been found to be successful (Babatunde &amp; Forsyth, 2013; Babatunde, Forsyth, &amp; Gidlow, 2012). Among postmenopausal women, however, exercise interventions for improving bone health have not always been effective (Kelley &amp; Kelley, 2006), since the exercise has not been of the right magnitude, \u2018oddness\u2019 or impact (Hannam et al., 2017). It is, therefore, important to use previously successful exercise interventions that have been carried on women who are oestrogen deplete (and therefore having a similar oestrogen status as menopausal women) and apply these to a postmenopausal population.\n\n\nAim: to examine the effect of an exercise intervention for preventing osteoporosis among postmenopausal women.\n\n\nObjectives: \n\nTo examine whether mean values for Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation (BUA) using Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) among postmenopausal women following an eight-month exercise intervention (and at 3-month follow up), will be significantly higher than those obtained pre-intervention.\n\n\nTo examine whether mean BUA values among postmenopausal women following an eight-month exercise intervention (and at 3-month follow up) will be significantly higher than mean values obtained from participants in a control group undertaking sham exercises for an equivalent duration. \n\nTo examine the feasibility of the eight-month exercise intervention for a potential larger study (larger sample size, increased number of trial arms and increased outcome measures), in terms of recruitment, adherence, perceptions, barriers, and acceptability.\n\n", "q4": "Hypotheses: Mean values for Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation (BUA) among postmenopausal women following an eight-month lifestyle intervention (consisting of dynamic, high-impact exercise) will be significantly higher than those obtained pre-intervention, and when compared to mean values obtained from participants in a sham control group.

Postmenopause will be defined as having had an absence of menstrual cycle for 12 months or more (Hale &amp; Burger, 2009). \n\nExclusion criteria: Volunteers will be excluded from the study if they: are using any medicated that may affect bone turnover (e.g., corticosteroids, anticonvulsants, anticoagulants, calcitonin, bisphosphonates, raloxifene, denosumab and/or anabolic agents such as parathyroid hormone and growth hormone or steroids), including hormone replacement therapy and hormone-based contraception, within 6 months of starting the study; have or have had any bone, metabolic, kidney, liver, thyroid, gastro-intestinal or hormonal disorders or cancer, that may affect bone turnover; have a close family history of osteoporosis; have sustained a low trauma fragility fracture in the past 6\u2009months; are a heavy smoking (&gt;20 cigarettes/day) [owing to smoking being risk factor for low bone health (Yoon, Maalouf, &amp; Sakhaee, 2012)]; if they are already undertaking bone-specific jumping exercises or equivalent exercises; if they have an existing knee, hip or back injury or have any medical condition that would prevent them from completing the exercise. These disorders and conditions will be determined based initially through verbal interview at the recruitment stage, then confirmed through the self-reported lifestyle/medical history questionnaire at baseline. Additional exclusions at baseline testing will include: a low BUA score, i.e., estimated T score of &lt;2.5; obesity as determined by body mass index of &gt;35 km/m2, to minimise risk of strain or injury associated with the exercise. Participants will also not be able to undertake the bone scan if they have any foot swelling, as this can make results difficult to interpret.\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "Both groups (intervention and control) will complete their required programme for eight months, since 200 days (approximately 29 weeks) is the average duration of remodelling in normal trabecular bone (Eriksen, 1986), and is required for change to be detected. \n\nFor the intervention group, participants will be required to perform 10 maximal vertical jumps, with a 10-s rest interval between each jump, using an arm swing in countermovement style on three days per week. The jumps will be performed without shoes on a hard surface. The jumps will be preceded by a warm-up lasting approximately 3 min and consisting of mobilisation exercises for the legs and lower back. The jumping protocol follows previous work in our laboratory (Babatunde &amp; Forsyth, 2014b; Babatunde &amp; Forsyth, 2015). Jumping will be progressed over time and in accordance with individual needs. Initially, jumping may be undertaken with the use of a handheld support (such as the back of a chair or table), should participants feel unstable. Jumps will be progressed to include multi-directional movements (jumping to the side, forwards, backwards, and diagonally). Natural progression will also occur as participants should improve their jump height with increased muscular explosiveness. Participants will be asked to fill out a simple, daily training log, stipulating when they have undertaken the exercise, in order for adherence to be assessed. \n\nIn the control group, participants will be required to perform balance exercises. Balance is an effective treatment for avoiding falls that could potentially lead to fracture, but do not bring about a significant change in bone mineral density (de Kam et al., 2009). The balancing exercises will be progressed and varied (to ensure adherence). Initially, the use of a handheld support (such as the back of the chair) can be used. Participants will be required to balance on one leg for up to 60 seconds (2 x 60 s is equivalent in duration to the 10 jumps). This exercise will initially be progressed using time, and then by doing the following: confounding the visual fixation (e.g., head turns), changing the centre of mass (e.g. arm/leg lifts); performing the stork balance (hands on hips, knee bent and supported by standing leg); reaching in multiple directions before regaining the initial stance; closing the eyes; reducing the base of support; and a combination of these activities. The starting level of difficulty will be prescribed by the researcher, according to each participant\u2019s functional ability. The balance exercises will be preceded by a warm-up lasting approximately 3 min and consisting of mobilisation exercises for the legs and lower back. The balance exercises are based on an existing protocol (Gianoudis et al., 2012). The purpose of the sham exercise is to foster the perception of full participation in the study, in order to decrease attrition rates, and to blind participants to the intervention. The balance exercises, although not improving bone health, could decrease the risk of fracture, making the sham control group more ethical, owing to potential improvements, and limited risks. \n\nTo ensure quality control, digitised video clips of all exercises will be provided for the participants, who will be encouraged to perform the exercises as demonstrated on the video. The participants will be invited to one fully supervised group exercise session per month. These sessions will be used to monitor exercise quality, and to ensure progression is appropriate for each participant. Sessions will last 15-20 min. Attendance at these sessions will be monitored through registers. Apart from these supervised exercise sessions, participants will be given free choice to determine where and when they do the exercises. At the instructor-led session, training logs (Appendix 3) will be submitted. If they are unable to attend, participants will be asked to submit training logs electronically, or via post. To encourage adherence, an App will be used, which will enable weekly announcements to be posted, as well as emails and/or text reminders. Participants will be free to contact the researchers about any concerns they have during the intervention. Apart from the exercise undertaken, participants will be requested to maintain their usual exercise throughout the study. \n\nTo improve adherence, Bandura\u2019s Social Cognitive Theory for changing behaviour will be drawn upon. Specific constructs will include the knowledge and skills to perform the prescribed intervention, personal regulation of goal-directed health behaviour (self-control), and self-confidence in engaging in the exercise despite the absence of supervision. Reinforcement, i.e., activities that increase the propensity for adherence during the trial and beyond the study\u2019s lifespan, will also be addressed. \n\nParticipants\u2019 level of self-efficacy for engaging in lifestyle change will be assessed using a five-point Likert scale, from \u2018not at all confident\u2019 to \u2018very confident. Participants will be asked to rate how confident they are to commit to engage in the exercise, irrespective of usual circumstances such as time constraints, stress, and fatigue. Assessment of self-efficacy will take place at the study onset, and at one-monthly intervals (via attendance at the supervised group sessions). With non-attendance, assessment will take place electronically. In the event of a low rating, modes of handling such situations without compromising commitment to the regime, will be given in relation to each participant\u2019s personal circumstances. In addition, at the study outset, participants will be asked to identify any circumstances that could motivate them to comply with the exercise, as well as any perceived barriers to adherence. Any issues will be discussed, and participants will be given the opportunity to design personalised adherence strategies. The aim will be to foster self-efficacy in both groups.\n\nAfter the eight-month intervention, all females in the trial arm, who have completed the study, will be invited to take part in a focus group (in groups of 8, depending on numbers who volunteer for this), to examine participants\u2019 perceptions of the intervention. A topic guide will be used, which includes: An exploration of the perceived barriers to undertaking the exercise intervention; issues with adherence; acceptability of the intervention; adverse events; enjoyment; ratings of perceived exertion; how easily the intervention could be incorporated into lifestyle. At the end of the focus group, the topic guide will be checked to ensure that all areas had been covered. Focus groups will likely last between 45 and 60 min, although will continue until the researcher feels that data saturation has been reached. The focus groups will be audio-recorded and subsequently transcribed to facilitate analysis. Non-verbal participant behaviour will also be recorded. Focus groups will be used, since the degree of commonality and disparity of views, attitudes, beliefs, and experiences between participants can be explored. Data from the focus groups will be analysed using inductive thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006), allowing for exploration and interpretation of the relevant issues more widely (Marks &amp; Yardley, 2004). This method will involve two of the researchers reading transcripts independently and devising their own coding, key concepts and themes. Codes and themes will be based on the research question: What is the feasibility of the eight-month exercise intervention for a potential larger study, in terms of exercise adherence, perceptions, barriers, and acceptability. All data that meet this research question will be coded. Themes will be constructed based on meaningful and coherent patterns in the data, relevant to the research questions. Analysis will be conducted by pairs of researchers, who will meet to compare their findings, and to agree a set of themes and subthemes. \n", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "All outcome measures will be taken at study outset (baseline), and at intervention end (8 months) and at 3-month follow up. In addition, data will be collected each month on: attendance at scheduled sessions; adherence to the intervention based on exercise logs; self-efficacy score; recording of adverse events including falls. \n\nThe primary outcome measure will be BUA as measured by Quantitative Ultrasound (UBIS 5000 Diagnostic Medical Systems, Montpellier, France). The sensitivity of Quantitative Ultrasound has been investigated through meta-analysis (Babatunde, Forsyth, &amp; Gidlow, 2012). In our laboratory, the short-term BUA measurement precision (coefficient of variation) with repositioning is 2.4%. Calibration and quality control is accomplished via an automated verification process just prior to the examination of each participant. The participant removes footwear from the dominant foot and places it in the foot well of the UBIS, which fills with water. Ultrasound waves are used to provide information on BUA, speed of sound and stiffness index. The test is non-invasive, with no ionising radiation.   \n\nSecondary outcome measures will include: timed up-and-go test [TUG]; ground reaction force; jump height; and quality of life. The TUG is often used in studies on osteoporosis prevention as a measure of fall risk, since the test measures dynamic balance during three commonly performed functional activities: standing up, sitting down, and walking and turning (Tan et al., 2008). The test involves the participant starting in a seated position, walking 3 m, turning around, then walking back to the chair to sit down. The test has an inter-rater reliability, using ICC, of .99 (Podsiadlo &amp; Richardson, 1991). To estimate the mechanical loading force due to the exercise, ground reaction force will be evaluated with the aid of a force plate (Advanced Mechanical Technology, Inc., AMTI). A countermovement jump test (with arms swinging naturally) will be used to assess change in jump height, using the Optojump system (Microgate S.r.l., Bolzano, Italy). Health-related quality of life will be measured using the SF-36v2 Health Survey (https://www.optum.com/solutions/life-sciences/answer-research/patient-insights/sf-health-surveys/sf-36v2-health-survey.html).\n\nPossible confounding variables to bone accrual include history of and changes to exercise and lifestyle patterns and history of/changes to medication and health. All participants will, therefore, also complete a lifestyle and medical questionnaire consisting of: history of/current disease(s)/illnesses; previous fractures; family history of fractures/osteoporosis; current medications and dietary supplements; caffeine consumption; alcohol consumption; smoking; age of onset of menopause; history of hormone contraception; and an already validated bone-loading history questionnaire (Dolan, Williams, Ainsworth, &amp; Shaw, 2006). All questionnaires will be self-report, but with the researcher present to aid clarity on request. \n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "A series of ANCOVAs will be used to determine if, after adjustments for baseline values, the intervention significantly improved outcome measures.
