While social support from family, teachers, and peers has been associated with greater school engagement and more positive outcomes in adolescents such as better academic performance, life satisfaction and subjective well-being (Lewis, Huebner, Malone, &amp; Valois, 2011; Gilman &amp; Heubner, 2006; Suldo, Shaffer, &amp; Riley, 2008). Results from these studies indicate that further exploration is necessary to determine what aspects of the educational support environment impacts specific elements of character and emotional development and whether there is a difference in performance and character outcomes based on the amount/type of social support received by an adolescent. Teachers and administrators are committed to the success of their students but often lack detailed information into how they can best serve the whole student. Previous studies suggest that by targeting student engagement and well-being, then academic success will follow (Lewis, Huebner, Malone, &amp; Valois, 2011; Lyons &amp; Huebner, 2015; Suldo et al., 2011).

Controlled subjects are exposed to one of two vignettes informing subjects that (i) political experts expect that within the next week Israel will go for a third round of elections, or (ii) providing subjects with a neutral piece of information about the weather in Israel. We expect that our treatment, priming institutionalized partisan cooperation in the form of a grand unity coalition, will reduce affective polarization. Building on recent advances we theorize that this effect is driven by mechanisms of shared national identity, elite cues, and increased ideological ambiguity across parties (Levendusky, 2018a,b). We further consider whether institutionalized partisan cooperation affects attitudes towards minorities which are not incorporated in grand coalitions.

We expect that our treatment, priming institutionalized partisan cooperation in the form of a grand unity coalition, will reduce affective polarization. Building on recent advances we theorize that this effect is driven by mechanisms of shared national identity, elite cues, and increased ideological ambiguity across parties (Levendusky, 2018a,b). We further consider whether institutionalized partisan cooperation affects attitudes towards minorities which are not incorporated in grand coalitions.

They can comply with legal transparency requirements, but they can also over-comply or under-comply. If a candidate misses a disclosure deadline, she may be disorganized, but if she hides a contribution, she may be disorganized or she may be ``crooked''. Disorganization is important, because elected officials perform clerk like tasks (Neustadt 1960). But potential corruption or illegality is probably more alarming to most voters. In related work, I show that voters are willing to reward over-compliance and punish under-compliance (Wood 2017). In this project, I ask how their willingness to reward and punish campaign finance transparency varies with other candidate characteristics, including policy preferences. The tradeoffs between candidates who are high on valence characteristics and those who are attractive along policy dimensions has not been explored very deeply in the literature (c.f. Franchino, 2015, Groseclose 2007) and has never been addressed with transparency (campaign finance or otherwise) as a part of the analysis. This study will help us understand how voters view transparency when it is competing with other candidate features, including their policy preferences. This is an important time to learn about candidate transparency, because campaign finance transparency is at a tenuous moment. Long the most robust area of campaign finance law, its support is weakening at elite levels. If campaign finance transparency is a valence characteristic, then Republican elites who are pushing for less campaign finance transparency (or enabling the Treasury and IRS to de-regulate in this area) are not representing the desires of their constituents in this area. Moreover, candidates in Republican primaries may be able to highlight their support of campaign finance transparency in order to contrast themselves with other candidates. Building on my prior work showing that voters reward over-compliance and punish support from dark money groups, I now consider to what degree will voters trade off on their preferred policies in order to support candidates who are more transparent?"}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "See attached PAP, but generally: 1. (Primary) In general, among the campaign finance transparency attributes, I expect to observe electoral rewards for transparency and electoral punishments for lack of transparency. Moreover, I expect that the punishments will be larger than the rewards. 2. Voters will compromise more on their preferred levels of transparency than they will on their preferred policies. As the policy distance between the respondent and the candidate decreases, respondents' willingness to reward transparency or punish lack of transparency will decrease 3. Respondents' ideological extremity and policy distance between the respondent and the candidate should interact to affect reactions to transparency, so: a. Transparency will be more important to people who are deeply engaged or ideologically very committed. b. However, as policy preference distance between the respondent and the candidate increase, reaction of the more deeply engaged and ideologically extreme to transparency issues will be more muted than reaction to transparency by of the less deeply engaged and ideologically extreme. 4. (Exploratory): a. If transparency is a valence characteristic, I will observe no difference between respondents from different parties. b.

They can comply with legal transparency requirements, but they can also over-comply or under-comply. If a candidate misses a disclosure deadline, she may be disorganized, but if she hides a contribution, she may be disorganized or she may be ``crooked''. Disorganization is important, because elected officials perform clerk like tasks (Neustadt 1960). But potential corruption or illegality is probably more alarming to most voters. In related work, I show that voters are willing to reward over-compliance and punish under-compliance (Wood 2017). In this project, I ask how their willingness to reward and punish campaign finance transparency varies with other candidate characteristics, including policy preferences. The tradeoffs between candidates who are high on valence characteristics and those who are attractive along policy dimensions has not been explored very deeply in the literature (c.f. Franchino, 2015, Groseclose 2007) and has never been addressed with transparency (campaign finance or otherwise) as a part of the analysis. This study will help us understand how voters view transparency when it is competing with other candidate features, including their policy preferences. This is an important time to learn about candidate transparency, because campaign finance transparency is at a tenuous moment. Long the most robust area of campaign finance law, its support is weakening at elite levels. If campaign finance transparency is a valence characteristic, then Republican elites who are pushing for less campaign finance transparency (or enabling the Treasury and IRS to de-regulate in this area) are not representing the desires of their constituents in this area. Moreover, candidates in Republican primaries may be able to highlight their support of campaign finance transparency in order to contrast themselves with other candidates. Building on my prior work showing that voters reward over-compliance and punish support from dark money groups, I now consider to what degree will voters trade off on their preferred policies in order to support candidates who are more transparent?", "q16": "See attached PAP, but generally: 1. (Primary) In general, among the campaign finance transparency attributes, I expect to observe electoral rewards for transparency and electoral punishments for lack of transparency. Moreover, I expect that the punishments will be larger than the rewards. 2. Voters will compromise more on their preferred levels of transparency than they will on their preferred policies. As the policy distance between the respondent and the candidate decreases, respondents' willingness to reward transparency or punish lack of transparency will decrease 3. Respondents' ideological extremity and policy distance between the respondent and the candidate should interact to affect reactions to transparency, so: a. Transparency will be more important to people who are deeply engaged or ideologically very committed. b. However, as policy preference distance between the respondent and the candidate increase, reaction of the more deeply engaged and ideologically extreme to transparency issues will be more muted than reaction to transparency by of the less deeply engaged and ideologically extreme. 4. (Exploratory): a. If transparency is a valence characteristic, I will observe no difference between respondents from different parties. b. If transparency is a partisan issue, respondents from different parties will react differently to transparency, and if Republicans are following their elites, they should have the smaller reaction. c. It is also possible that extreme partisans will treat transparency as a partisan issue, whereas more moderate people will treat it as a valence issue. 5.

While the Nigerian government shares similar goals of growth for the city, in practice, development is uneven and leaves many of the city\u2019s inhabitants behind. As the Lagos State government seeks to transform the country\u2019s largest city into the next Dubai, it is faced with the question of how to develop its shopping malls and luxury apartment complexes while still upholding the social contract even with its poorest residents. Although there are some initiatives focused on inclusive development, the government has often adopted a strategy of simply trying to remove informal street hawkers and residents of informal settlements, through arrests, evictions, and demolitions. As a result, some residents of informal settlements fear being forcefully evicted from their homes by the government or overnight demolition of their entire community. From an outsider\u2019s perspective, it would appear that the state has broken its social contract with these citizens. When services no longer function and the state is seen as the predator, rather than protector, how do citizens view the government and make decisions about engaging with it?

While the Nigerian government shares similar goals of growth for the city, in practice, development is uneven and leaves many of the city\u2019s inhabitants behind. As the Lagos State government seeks to transform the country\u2019s largest city into the next Dubai, it is faced with the question of how to develop its shopping malls and luxury apartment complexes while still upholding the social contract even with its poorest residents. Although there are some initiatives focused on inclusive development, the government has often adopted a strategy of simply trying to remove informal street hawkers and residents of informal settlements, through arrests, evictions, and demolitions. As a result, some residents of informal settlements fear being forcefully evicted from their homes by the government or overnight demolition of their entire community. From an outsider\u2019s perspective, it would appear that the state has broken its social contract with these citizens. When services no longer function and the state is seen as the predator, rather than protector, how do citizens view the government and make decisions about engaging with it? The goal of this pilot study is to explore the relationship between residents of informal settlements in this megacity and the government.
