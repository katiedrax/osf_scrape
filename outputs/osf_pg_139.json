The extent to which body image dissatisfaction that one individual will experience in their lifetime is greatly influenced by the environment they live in (Holmqvist &amp; Fris\u00e9n, 2010). These includes internalisation of the thin and muscular-ideals and appearance-related pressures from peers, family, and the media. For instance, studies have shown that individuals with a higher tendency to reciprocate to appearance-related pressures are more likely to internalise the thin ideal when this ideal is not met, and in turn exhibit greater body dissatisfaction attitudes and behaviours (Fitzsimmons-Craft et al., 2014). While sociocultural influences have been recognised as antecedents to body dissatisfaction, psychological attributes such as self-esteem and social comparison orientation may also contribute to body image dissatisfaction and onset of eating pathology. Low self-esteem has been found to be strongly associated with body dissatisfaction in adolescents across different weight status, socioeconomic status, and racial and ethnic groups (Van Den Berg, Mond, Eisenberg, Ackard, &amp; Neumark-Sztainer, 2010). Another study found that the appearance-focused social comparison process is typically prompted by a desire for information about one\u2019s appearance, and in turn results in a negative feedback that heightens their body image dissatisfaction (Myers &amp; Crowther, 2009). It is worth noting that existing literature has failed to consider the combined effects between self-esteem, social comparison orientation and sociocultural pressures on body image dissatisfaction. Therefore, understanding the relationships among these variables can provide valuable information about the emergence and maintenance of eating pathology.

In addition, older adults\u2014and especially those suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s Disease\u2014are frequently the targets of financial exploitation (Lichtenberg, 2016). Fraud and financial abuse yield annual losses of nearly $3 billion with the vast majority of cases being perpetrated by strangers (51%) or friends and family (34%) (Roberto &amp; Teaster, 2011). Yet, very little is known about how older adults integrate information from the social domain to inform economic decision making. To address this gap, we will assess social decision-making skills with two games from the behavioral economics literature that probe trust and fairness. We will also build off prior work that has suggested that victims of financial exploitation are often from low socioeconomic status groups (Choi &amp; Mayer, 2000), have poorer cognitive functioning (James, Boyle, &amp; Bennett, 2014), have more severe depression (Butters et al., 2008; Dotson, Beydoun, &amp; Zonderman, 2010), and are more socially withdrawn (Choi &amp; Mayer, 2000; Kuiper et al., 2015) by collecting information on these variables as well.\n \nWe will conduct a Qualtrics Panel study that administers a survey to older adults around our community (Philadelphia, PA metropolitan area).

As such, it is proposed that BIS sometimes leads to exclusionary attitudes toward out-group members, especially those individuals from the contaminated areas/countries. In addition, it has been proposed that BIS leads to obedience to the social norms because infective disease control should be done at the group/society/country level. That leads to the enhanced levels of obedience to social norms on the one hand, and condemnation of those who do not follow the social norm on the other hand.\n\nIn this study, we examine the above predictions by collecting data under the COVID-19 pandemic on 1) BIS levels, 2) Exclusionarity toward foreign people, and 3) Praise and obedience to the nation and its governmental policies.

Since the sexual domain of the scale has several offensive items and is not necessarily related to BIS, we omit the domain.  2) Perceived Vulnerability to Disease (PVD, (Duncan et al., 2009; Fukukawa et al., 2014) that has the Germ aversion and Perceived infectability subscales, and 3) Five items from the Cleanness and Impurity Scale (POPA, Kitamkura &amp; Matsuo, 2019) that are related to orientation to cleanness. \n\nITEMS RELATED TO THE EXCLUSIONARY ATTITUDE TOWARD OUT-GROUP\nWe will ask the attitude toward foreign people (Chinese, Europeans, and Americans) coming for sightseeing or for working in one\u2019s country. We will also include Q9 of WVS asking what kinds of people one does not want to have in one\u2019s neighborhood (e.g., people of different religion, race, nationality).

We also ask about the experience(s) of visiting or living in foreign countries (numbers of foreign countries visited).", "conditions": "This is a survey study so that there are no experimental/control conditions.", "hypothesis": "The pandemic of the new coronavirus has rapidly spread not only in Asia but also in Europe and the United States, creating an \"emergency\" that has an enormous social impact as a global plague.\n\nThe behavioral immune system (hereafter, BIS) is thought to have evolved as a set of psychological/behavioral responses that prevent organisms from contracting pathogens by keeping a physical distance from possibly contaminated objects, organisms, and even persons. As such, it is proposed that BIS sometimes leads to exclusionary attitudes toward out-group members, especially those individuals from the contaminated areas/countries. In addition, it has been proposed that BIS leads to obedience to the social norms because infective disease control should be done at the group/society/country level. That leads to the enhanced levels of obedience to social norms on the one hand, and condemnation of those who do not follow the social norm on the other hand.\n\nIn this study, we examine the above predictions by collecting data under the COVID-19 pandemic on 1) BIS levels, 2) Exclusionarity toward foreign people, and 3) Praise and obedience to the nation and its governmental policies. We will look at correlations among the data collected under the pandemic in four countries; Japan, US, UK, and Italy. In addition, we will look at the differences between the data under pandemic and the data that have been collected and reported in the \u201cnormal time\u201d.", "study_type": "Survey"}, "subjects":

Although studies have evaluated individual components of management, to our knowledge no article has synthesized the literature on overall understanding of management of pediatric atopic dermatitis by frontline providers. \n\nReview Questions(s)\n1.\tHow do pediatricians and general practitioners approach the various arms of management (prescribing, counseling, referral for ancillary testing, and knowledge of disease) of atopic dermatitis in children?\n2.\tHow does management of pediatric atopic dermatitis by pediatricians and general practitioners differ from management by dermatologists?\n\nStudy Design\nSystematic literature review\n\nInclusion Criteria\n1.\tFull-text primary research journal article published in an English language journal\n2.\tStudy must address at least one outcome addressing management of atopic dermatitis in children\n3.\tStudy must evaluate by pediatricians and/or general practitioners\n\nExclusion Criteria\n1.\tCase reports, case series, review articles, and other secondary research articles\n2.\tStudies that include adults and do not stratify data for children\n3.\tConference abstracts\n\nCondition or domain being studied\nManagement of pediatric atopic dermatitis\n\nOutcome(s)\nMeasures of provider management of atopic dermatitis including survey responses, knowledge about atopic dermatitis, counseling practices, and prescribing habits.\n\nIntervention(s), exposure(s)\nAny intervention or observational study examining the above\n\n\nSearches\nWe will search Pubmed and Embase (via OVID) using a search strategy assessing for observational or interventional studies focusing on management of children with atopic dermatitis by frontline providers (general practitioners and pediatricians).We will identify other references by reviewing the references section as well as articles that cite articles that have already been identified.\n\nFull search in PubMed\n((((((((atopic dermatitis [majr]) OR eczema [majr]) OR atopic dermatitis) OR eczema)) AND ((((((((primary health care [mesh]) OR physicians, family [mesh]) OR physicians, primary care [mesh]) OR general practitioner [mesh]) OR \"general practitioner\") OR pediatrician) OR \"primary health care\" OR \"general practice\") OR \"primary care\")) AND (((((((management) OR counseling) OR treatment) OR therapy) OR \"food allergy\") OR \"allergy test*\" OR \"allergen test*\" OR \"topical corticosteroid\" OR \"corticosteroid\" OR \"topical steroid\" OR \"TCS\") OR medication OR prescrib*))).\n\nData extraction, (selection and coding)\nTitles and abstracts will be screened for relevance followed by full-text screening against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any data relating to management of pediatric atopic dermatitis by frontline providers and dermatologists will be extracted.\n\nRisk of bias (quality) assessment\nFull-text articles meeting inclusion criteria will be screened for quality assessment.\n\nStrategy for data synthesis\nA systematic review of the literature will identify interventional and observational studies on this topic. We will synthesize data examining the various components of pediatric atopic dermatitis management (including counseling, prescribing, referral for ancillary testing, and knowledge of disease) by general practitioners and pediatricians and report these collectively as \u201cfrontline providers.\u201d In instances where management between general practitioners and pediatricians varies significantly, this will be noted. Data for frontline providers will be compared to results for dermatologists when available. Data will be synthesized and reported by broad sections including topical corticosteroid use, management of infection, diet and allergy, topical calcineurin inhibitor use, and bathing and emollient recommendations. \n\nThis systematic review will be reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist.\n\nDissemination plans\nPublication as a systematic review in a peer reviewed journal\n"}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecaaaa", "text": "Medicine and Health Sciences"}, {"id": "584240da54be81056cecab69",
