The COVID-19 virus transmits early in its life cycle relative to other coronaviruses, (e.g., SARS), during which time many individuals present as asymptomatic (Zhou et al., 2020). The moderate to high transmissibility of this virus has required governments to consider moderate to extreme measures in order to prevent further transmissions. Indeed, the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic may require governments to use big data technologies to help contain its spread (Bonsall, Parker, &amp; Fraser, 2020). \n\nCountries that have managed to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d - the process of slowing the exponential transmission rate of the virus, for example, Singapore and Taiwan - have employed collocation tracking through mobile Wi-Fi, GPS, and Bluetooth as a strategy to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020). Through collocation tracking, government agencies may observe who you have been in contact with and when this contact occurred, allowing for the rapid implementation of appropriate measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. \n\nThe effectiveness of collocation tracking relies on the willingness of the population to support such measures, implying that government policy-making should be informed by the likelihood of public compliance. Gaining the social license - broad community acceptance beyond formal legal requirements - for collocation tracking requires the perceived public health benefits to outweigh concerns of personal privacy, security, and any potential risk of harm. \n\nIn the current study, we propose a longitudinal cross-cultural study mapping the evolution of people\u2019s attitudes towards government tracking during the COVID-19 crisis. We aim to understand (1) the factors that influence the social license around governmental use of location tracking data in an emergency, (2) how this may change over time, and (3) how it may differ across cultures. We will present participants with one of two scenarios describing mild or severe government tracking methods that may reduce the spread of COVID-19, and then question participants\u2019 attitudes towards the proposed methods.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-05T22:50:30.522872", "date_modified": "2020-04-05T22:27:14.123033", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["COVID", "COVID-19", "Mobile Tracking"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [""], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "a4cefbf72856ba613a694b10e615325d90300497f903b5d26c9065f8b8ef8a6dbb606594568bff7ea83abf90ef6c979e74592178e01919599d8095ecfd3c37a85cc10b97e77980769fb412725f15b34e2dc211b95f81530f6932c02cfa87e59e5a7afc9fb15acfcf26bcb2e907ffa8d19f94f17cd446e6c8f373389869e392c9ec092bed82c65b0f4e3dbd82057f8f19", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-05T22:50:30.497390", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Simon Dennis, Paul Garrett, Joshua White, Yoshihisa Kashima, Amy Perfors, Daniel R.

The first model will assess the acceptability of Government tracking directly after reading the scenario. Model inputs will include demographics and responses-made prior to reading the scenario (see Questions document). The model prior will be a Laplacian distribution centered on zero (biased to no effect) and our results will focus upon those inputs that overcome this bias to produce positive beta weights.

All responses will act as inputs for the second model. \n\nWe will assess how tracking acceptability (pre- and post-questioning), perceived severity, concern for self, concern for others, and job loss change over the four-week interval. We will plot these variables over time with 95% confidence intervals and report changes in trend. \n\nWe will further relate changes in participant responses and the results of the above models to reported changes in the number of total positive COVID-19 cases, the number of total COVID-19 deaths, and their respective rates of change.

questions we were posing in our earlier inquiry. Especially this question:\n\n`Do genre categories generally become more crisply defined or more closely knit as we move from the late 19c, through the 20c, to the present?`\n\nBoth of the experiments below are based on the intuition that the coherence and \"tightness\" of generic clustering in different periods can be assessed by measuring the difference between the average (random) distances between books and the distances measured between pairs of books that share a genre. The greater the difference, the more strongly books appear to be sorted by genre. This measure is loosely analogous to one called [silhouette value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering)). The difference is that the silhouette strategy is designed for complete partitioning of a single dataset, and we need to evaluate a window that slides down a timeline.\n\nWhile the distances between word vectors derived from book texts don't have obvious inherent significance in themselves, we know from our previous experiments that these distances do in practice correlate with the accuracy of predictive models--and also with predictive models of *reviews*. There is also [some previous research](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-4507/) that directly connects all of these measures to human perceptions of generic similarity and difference. So we do have some reason to treat these distances as a proxy for human judgment, although they are to be sure an imperfect proxy.\n\nfirst experiment: genres assigned by librarians\n------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, we plan to test the coherence of the genre categories defined by the librarians who assigned Library of Congress subject and genre headings recorded in HathiTrust metadata, from 1860 to 2010.\n\nWe grouped LoC genre and subject headings into nineteen categories. For instance \"Mystery fiction\" and \"Detective and mystery stories, American\" belong to the same category. See `genre_groups_for_20c_exp.tsv` for these categories.\n\nNext we will measure in-genre distance by selecting pairs of books in the same category, and measuring the cosine distance between their texts, using a vector of relative frequencies constructed with the 2500 most common words in the entire corpus. We will use tf-idf scaling to adjust the vectors--reflecting our intuition that relatively uncommon words are more important in discriminating genres than their sheer frequency might suggest.\n\n(We could alternately do no adjustment, or scale all the words to have equal weight--i.e., compare z scores of the frequencies. We have tried both of these things in a previous experiment, and it didn't make a great deal of difference. A pattern durable enough to be of real significance for us should probably hold true across most methodological details of this kind.)\n\nWe will only compare books published within ten years of each other, according to our metadata. Call these books Ax and Ay (genre A, in years x and y).\n\nAs a control for each in-genre comparison, we will compare the first book in genre A (Ax) to a randomly selected book in year y (Ry), and the second book (Ay) to a randomly selected book in year x (Rx). We will try two different forms of \"random selection\": one is to randomly select a book from the list of books assigned to other genres. Another is to randomly select a book from a subset of books that were genuinely plucked randomly from HathiTrust (including books without any genre categorization). We consider the second more reliable, but the difference between these measurements might also be of interest.\n\nSo the overall outgenre - ingenre difference is\n\n    ((Ax to Ry + Rx to Ay) / 2) - (Ax to Ay)\n\nWe'll date each measurement at the midpoint of years x and y.\n\n**Hypothesis to test:**\n\nWe expect that there is some year Y in the second half of the twentieth century, such that average generic closeness (outgenre_distance - ingenre_distance) increases from 1860 to that year, and decreases thereafter, where \"increases\" and \"decreases\" describe a correlation with time. We expect both correlations to be significant at p &lt; .05, if we compare the differences for individual pairs of books to the midpoint dates for those pairs.\n\nsecond experiment: genre categories derived from a topic model of Kirkus Reviews\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe chief objection to our first experiment will be that we're using genre categories assigned retrospectively, mostly by late-twentieth-century librarians. It is possible that genres would seem more cohesive toward the end of the timeline because the genre categories were created in that period, and are simply a better fit for books at the end of the timeline.\n\nThere are several ways to address this concern; by summer, we'll be able to use explicit genre categories derived from the index of the *Book Review Digest.* But in the meantime we can use book reviews as a source of genre-like categories that were assigned by readers closer to the date of a book's publication.\n\nAfter optimizing the number of topics, we produced an 80-topic model of Kirkus book reviews from 1930 to 2010. We manually inspected the model to identify 23 topics that seemed genre-*like*. (See `genre_80_mallet_categories_for_20c_exp.csv.`) We didn't expect a 1:1 mapping between topics and library genre labels, but we did try to exclude topics that were, for instance, organized around different types of evaluative language rather than different *kinds* of books.\n\nWe will evaluate these 23 topics in the same way as we evaluated the 19 library-assigned categories above. In other words, we'll select pairs of books in the same review topic, measure the Ax-Ay distance, and then compare it to the average of Ax-Ry and Rx-Ay. We'll plot the differences between in-topic and out-topic distance across a timeline.\n\n**Hypotheses to test:**\n\nThe measurement we're making here is not purely a measurement of the cohesiveness of known groups. It is better understood as a measure of the *alignment* between review-descriptions and book-texts. If the categories inferred from reviews are also strongly marked in the books, there will be a big difference between in-topic and out-topic distance. If those categories are not strongly aligned, the difference may be smaller.\n\nWe tentatively interpret the strength of alignment as an indication that genre categories are widely recognized and shared between writers and readers.\n\nSo the first hypothesis we offer is that the average out-topic/in-topic difference, aggregated by year, will correlate with the yearly measurement in our first experiment. If this is true, we'll conclude that the retrospective character of categories in our first experiment was not the only source of the observed pattern. We're really measuring how strongly books were sorted into reception categories at the time of publication.\n\nWe also, secondarily, hypothesize that the out-topic/in-topic difference will in general be greatest when a topic is most prevalent in the model. In other words, when a \"science fiction\" topic is just beginning to emerge in reception, books may not yet be very clearly sorted into that category. But when it reaches its peak (measured as the proportion of words in year Y assigned to the topic), we would expect it to be a more prominent category in reception.\n\nSince we're interested in a topic's peak relative to its own distribution, not its absolute size, we will measure a topic's relative \"prevalence\" in this experiment as `words in topic T, year Y / all words in topic T`.\n\nTo formalize this as a hypothesis we can test: if we measure out-topic/in-topic difference for topic X in year Y, and the relative prevalence of the topic in year Y, and aggregate those measurements across all years and topics, we expect a very small but significant (p &lt; .05) correlation between the two variables.\n\nIt would also be interesting if this correlation were improved by sliding the two sets of measurements relative to each other on the timeline. In other words, do topics tend to reach peak prevalence *before*, or *after*, books are most clearly sorted into the topic? We'll pose that question for now in an exploratory way; it might help us frame a hypothesis about the causal relations between writing and reception.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "genre_80_mallet_categories_for_20c_exp.csv"}, "nodeId": "a3749", "sha256": "6046c8616189ba31c1a727ad463241b232f14fc0a2d966a0768ae63eca716484", "viewUrl": "/project/a3749/files/osfstorage/5e8a57a1f135350062d5bd67", "selectedFileName": "genre_80_mallet_categories_for_20c_exp.csv"}, {"data": {"name": "genre_groups_for_20c_exp.tsv"}, "nodeId": "a3749", "sha256": "3f21d4b1593a03d18032650d065e2eb3645d49fd7a5b3570e9144dbf1a669593", "viewUrl": "/project/a3749/files/osfstorage/5e8a57aaf135350062d5bd77", "selectedFileName": "genre_groups_for_20c_exp.tsv"}], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"summary": "second registration\n===================\n\nThese experiments continue to explore the questions we were posing in our earlier inquiry.
