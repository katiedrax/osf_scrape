There are no SR or protocol on acupoint catgut embedding for irritable bowel syndrome. Therefore, research on it is needed.\n\n6.Participants/population: Patients with diagnosed IBS will be included, regardless of gender, age, race, education status, cases of source and different subtypes of IBS.\n\n7. Intervention(s), exposure(s): Intervention measures will be either acupoint catgut embedding alone or combined with other methods.\n\n8. Comparator(s)/control: Fake acupoint catgut embedding, normal acupuncture, western medicine, fire needle acupuncture, auricular point therapy, blank control, placebo control and other interventions.

If different measurement scales are used, standardized mean difference (SMD) will be performed to analyze continuous data.\nIf required data are not reported, we will try to obtain data from corresponding author.\nHeterogeneity will be assessed using both the \u03c7\u00b2 test and the I\u00b2 statistic, and we will consider an I\u00b2 value greater than 50% indicative of substantial heterogeneity.\n- For I\u00b2&lt;50%, a fixed-effect model is used.\n- For I\u00b2 &gt;=50%, a random-effect model is applied.\nIf data permit, we plan to exclude some trials that contribuite most to the heterogeneity to see whether the result change or not.\nWe will also use a summary of findings table to present the main findings using GRADEpro software (The Cochrane Collaboration). Funnel plots will be generated to detect publication bias if more than 10 trials are identified to report the same outcomes. If appropriate, we will use cumulative meta-analyses. Results of meta-analyses will be visualized by forest plots. In addition, we will conduct trial sequential analysis to evaluate the meta-analyses for primary outcomes, which can reveal the required information size and potentially false results in a meta-analysis. Intention-to-treat analysis will be applied for primary outcome, if missing data from the original trials are available.\n\n15.

Searches: English databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Chinese databases including CNKI, Wanfang, VIP databases will be searched. The research will start following the PRISMA protocol.\n\nThe terms used in the search will follow the rules of the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and the question that guided the search was based on the PICOS strategy (participants, interventions, comparison, results and studies). The following search strategy terms will be included: \u2460\"Irritable bowel syndrome\" or \"IBS\" or \"Changyijizonghezheng(\u80a0\u6613\u6fc0\u7efc\u5408\u5f81)\"; \u2461 \"acupoint catgut embedding\" or \"catgut embedding therapy\" or \"catgut implantation at acupoint\" or \"point embedding therapy\" or \"Maixian(\u57cb\u7ebf)\".\nOne month will be allocated for data collection and one month for article analysis.\nRetrieval time is from the inception dates of the databases to Feb 29, 2020.\nWe also considered the alternative terms and spellings for keywords.\nIn addition, the references of initially included literature were traced back to achieve a comprehensive search. English and Chinese language were included.\nAdditional search strategy information can be found in the attached PDF document (link provided below).\n\n5. Condition or domain being studied: Condition or domain being studied: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a group of continuous or intermittent attacks, which is characterized by abdominal pain, abdominal distention, defecation habits and / or changes in stool characteristics, but lack of gastrointestinal structure and biochemical abnormalities. Rome III classified it as a kind of functional enteropathy, the patients were mainly young and middle-aged people, the age of onset was more in 20-50 years old, women were more than men, there was a tendency of family aggregation, often accompanied by other gastrointestinal disorders such as functional dyspepsia. According to the characteristics of stool, IBS can be divided into four clinical types: diarrhea type, constipation type, mixed type and atypical type. acupoint catgut embedding in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome has done a lot of research, the effect is significant. There are no SR or protocol on acupoint catgut embedding for irritable bowel syndrome. Therefore, research on it is needed.\n\n6.Participants/population: Patients with diagnosed IBS will be included, regardless of gender, age, race, education status, cases of source and different subtypes of IBS.\n\n7. Intervention(s), exposure(s): Intervention measures will be either acupoint catgut embedding alone or combined with other methods.\n\n8. Comparator(s)/control: Fake acupoint catgut embedding, normal acupuncture, western medicine, fire needle acupuncture, auricular point therapy, blank control, placebo control and other interventions. Interventions in the experimental group were not included.\n\n9. Types of study to be included: We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published and unpublished, in English and Chinese.\n\n10. Main outcome(s): \u2460Scores of the IBS Adequate Relief question;\n                   \u2461IBS-SSS; \n                   \u2462Total effective rate; \n\n11. Additional outcome(s): \u2460 Evaluation index of enterodynamic effect;\n                       \u2461Evaluation index of intestinal accommodation function;\n\u2462Psychological assessment scale;\n\u2463Evaluation index of TCM diagnosis and treatment;\n\n12. Data extraction (selection and coding): Three reviewers searched the online databases listed above and recorded the titles and abstracts of all the articles.\nThree evaluators assessed the eligibility of these articles and made decisions on every research (inclusion or exclusion) independently. If they did not reach the same decision, the concerned articles were discussed with a fourth reviewer.\nThree reviewers extracted data independently from each study.\nDifferences regarding the extracted data were resolved after discussion with a fourth reviewer.\n\n13.Risk of bias (quality) assessment: Three authors of our review team will independently assess the methodological quality of included trials, and consensus will be reached by discussion with a third party in case of discrepancy.\nThe methodological quality of RCTs will be assessed according to the risk of bias tool described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [Higgins JPT 2009]. Six elements will be assessed: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, free of selective reporting, and other bias. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion with a third party.\n\n14. Strategy for data synthesis: Statistical analyses will be performed using RevMan 5.3 software (The Cochrane Collaboration).\n- Pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of dichotomous outcomes will be used to report effect estimate.\n- Continuous data will be presented as mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. If different measurement scales are used, standardized mean difference (SMD) will be performed to analyze continuous data.\nIf required data are not reported, we will try to obtain data from corresponding author.\nHeterogeneity will be assessed using both the \u03c7\u00b2 test and the I\u00b2 statistic, and we will consider an I\u00b2 value greater than 50% indicative of substantial heterogeneity.\n- For I\u00b2&lt;50%, a fixed-effect model is used.\n- For I\u00b2 &gt;=50%, a random-effect model is applied.\nIf data permit, we plan to exclude some trials that contribuite most to the heterogeneity to see whether the result change or not.\nWe will also use a summary of findings table to present the main findings using GRADEpro software (The Cochrane Collaboration). Funnel plots will be generated to detect publication bias if more than 10 trials are identified to report the same outcomes. If appropriate, we will use cumulative meta-analyses. Results of meta-analyses will be visualized by forest plots. In addition, we will conduct trial sequential analysis to evaluate the meta-analyses for primary outcomes, which can reveal the required information size and potentially false results in a meta-analysis. Intention-to-treat analysis will be applied for primary outcome, if missing data from the original trials are available.\n\n15. Analysis of subgroups or subsets: If data permitted, we plan to conduct subgroup analyses for different groups, including:\nDifferent age of patients\nDifferent severity of disease\nDifferent regimen applied\nDifferent treat time\nDifferent acupoints selected\nCombined with other interventions or not.\n\n16. Type and method of review: intervention; Meta-analysis; Systematic review.\n\n17. Health area of the review: Complementary therapies; Digestive system; Public health; \n\n18. Languages of the review: English and Chinese;\n\n19. Dissemination plans: In addition to producing a report, a paper will be submitted to a journal in this field.", "q8.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e69fe254a60a50102bb6ee0", "file_name": "search strategy.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/e3nmw/files/osfstorage/5e69fe254a60a50102bb6ee0", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e69fe254a60a50102bb6ee0"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "b118a33cff9cc139c9ac1ecb7bac1eb7645ce3d241d989e85179891a669873f5"}}], "q12.question": "1.

One reason for this shift in perspective might be differences in leadership styles between men and women (Miller &amp; Adkins, 2016). This is underlined by the finding that there actually are perceived gender differences in leadership styles (Eagly &amp; Carli, 2003). Eagly and Carli\u2019s meta-analysis shows, inter alia, that transformational leadership is perceived to be more typical for female than for male leaders. And transformational leadership does not only include an emotional component through leader-member-exchange (Little, Gooty &amp; Williams, 2016; Glas\u00f8 &amp; Einarsen, 2008), but is also strongly linked to performance outcomes (Ng, 2017). But even though there is positive evidence for the success of female leadership, there are still barriers for women to succeed in leadership positions (Brescoll, 2016). One reason for this are gender stereotypes as described by Schein (1975) with the think manager \u2013 think male phenomenon more than 40 years ago. A recent study by Fischbach, Lichtenthaler &amp; Horstman (2015) extended Schein\u2019s paradigm to the area of emotion expression and showed that gender stereotypes still hold true when it comes to female leaders and emotions. Additionally, there is evidence for gender differences in the use of emotion regulation strategies: LaFrance and Banaji (1992) describe how using suppression for negative emotions is more socially acceptable for males and Gross and John (2003) found that men are more likely to use suppression than women. Further, Shields (2005) applies the use of emotion regulation strategies to the workplace and denotes that \u201c[i]n most workplaces the economical expressiveness of manly emotion is the standard (\u2026)\u201d (ibid., p. 11). However, the effect of gender stereotypes concerning the typical emotion regulation strategies and especially the role of a transformational leadership style within emotion management remain rather unclear. Based on these findings, the aim of this study is to 1) replicate the findings of Fischbach et al. (2015) regarding gender stereotypes concerning emotion expression of successful managers, men and women, 2) to extend the think manager \u2013 think male investigation to different emotion regulation strategies and 3) to investigate the role of a transformational leadership style regarding gender stereotypes about emotion expression and emotion regulation strategies.\n\nResearch Questions \n1.

One reason for this shift in perspective might be differences in leadership styles between men and women (Miller &amp; Adkins, 2016). This is underlined by the finding that there actually are perceived gender differences in leadership styles (Eagly &amp; Carli, 2003). Eagly and Carli\u2019s meta-analysis shows, inter alia, that transformational leadership is perceived to be more typical for female than for male leaders. And transformational leadership does not only include an emotional component through leader-member-exchange (Little, Gooty &amp; Williams, 2016; Glas\u00f8 &amp; Einarsen, 2008), but is also strongly linked to performance outcomes (Ng, 2017). But even though there is positive evidence for the success of female leadership, there are still barriers for women to succeed in leadership positions (Brescoll, 2016). One reason for this are gender stereotypes as described by Schein (1975) with the think manager \u2013 think male phenomenon more than 40 years ago. A recent study by Fischbach, Lichtenthaler &amp; Horstman (2015) extended Schein\u2019s paradigm to the area of emotion expression and showed that gender stereotypes still hold true when it comes to female leaders and emotions. Additionally, there is evidence for gender differences in the use of emotion regulation strategies: LaFrance and Banaji (1992) describe how using suppression for negative emotions is more socially acceptable for males and Gross and John (2003) found that men are more likely to use suppression than women. Further, Shields (2005) applies the use of emotion regulation strategies to the workplace and denotes that \u201c[i]n most workplaces the economical expressiveness of manly emotion is the standard (\u2026)\u201d (ibid., p. 11). However, the effect of gender stereotypes concerning the typical emotion regulation strategies and especially the role of a transformational leadership style within emotion management remain rather unclear. Based on these findings, the aim of this study is to 1) replicate the findings of Fischbach et al. (2015) regarding gender stereotypes concerning emotion expression of successful managers, men and women, 2) to extend the think manager \u2013 think male investigation to different emotion regulation strategies and 3) to investigate the role of a transformational leadership style regarding gender stereotypes about emotion expression and emotion regulation strategies.\n\nResearch Questions \n1.
