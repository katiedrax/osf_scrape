Thereby, positive sport psychology could focus on the well-being and positive emotions in the context of sport (Mann &amp; Narula, 2017, p. 153) and close the research gap in sport psychology which has mainly focused on emotional problems, stress, or anxiety (Salama-Younes, 2011, p. 112).\nThe broaden-and-build theory (Fredrickson, 1998, 2001) states that positive emotions \u201cbroaden people\u2019s awareness in ways that, over time and with frequent recurrence, build consequential personal resources that contribute to their overall emotional and physical well-being\u201d (Fredrickson &amp; Joiner, 2018, p. 194). Part of the theory is the undoing hypothesis which describes positive emotions to act in service of homeostasis (Fredrickson &amp; Levenson, 1998, p. 193). In detail, after a stressor, positive emotions are assumed to lead to a faster cardiovascular recovery which eventually is presumed to lead to better cardiovascular health. Research focusing on the undoing hypothesis so far applied hardly comparable designs due to the use of different stressors (e.g., active vs. passive), different positive emotion inductions (e.g., film, articles, cartoons, sound) and different cardiovascular outcome measurements (e.g., heart rate, heart rate variability, skin conductance, pulse transmission time; see review of 24 studies by Cavanagh &amp; Larkin, 2018). Regardless of those different designs, none of the studies has focused on athletes so far.\nHowever, the undoing hypothesis might be fruitful especially for this population. Athletes are not only under a lot of pressure and experience psychophysiological stress prior to competition (Ehrlenspiel, Graf, K\u00fchn, &amp; Brand, 2011), they (in some sports) have several competitions on one day. As psychophysiological stress is known to impact (sports) performance (see e.g., review by Rumbold, Fletcher, &amp; Daniels, 2012; Salvador &amp; Costa, 2009), it appears relevant to quickly recover from the first stressor (i.e., first competition) in order to be ready for the second stressor (i.e., second competition). Thus, it could for example be beneficial for athletes to be exposed to positive emotion inductions between competitions within one day. \nThe previous research focusing on the undoing hypothesis might however, not be applicable for athletes as they differ with respect to psychophysiological stress responses in comparison to the previously studied populations. Athletes have shown to exhibit lower levels of cortisol (i.e., stress hormone), heart rate and state anxiety responses due to a psychosocial laboratory stressor (i.e., Trier Social Stress Test, TSST; see Rimmele et al., 2009). It is unclear whether this might also be true with respect to recovery from stress. Therefore, in a first step, the aim is to investigate the assumed effects of the undoing hypothesis in athletes.

particularly in the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) (Moss-Racusin et al., 2012). Numerous initiatives have tried to tackle this issue, but new research has shown that gender inequality persists as globally \u2018women\u2019 account for fewer than 30% of STEM authorships (Larivi\u00e8re et al., 2013). \n\nAn important step in tackling the issue of gender inequality is getting data on the nature of authorship as this is a significant metric for measuring academic success (Ioannidis, 2014). Although researchers have already published articles and reviews on this topic, not much focus has been on how \u2018women\u2019 and \u2018men\u2019 have been defined in such studies. For example, usually based purely on convenience, researchers have either manually assigned gender based on personal judgments of an author\u2019s online profile for small samples, or they have relied on algorithms such as genderize.io that predict an individual\u2019s gender based on inaccessible databases of social network profiles for larger samples (Wais, 2016). Discussions about the limitations of these methodologies are usually only contained to the precision and accuracy of the classification and not about what these classifications truly represent (Holman et al., 2018).\n\nAs the definitions of \u2018women\u2019 and \u2018men have changed over the years, there is a need to re-examine past methodologies and findings in today\u2019s context (Diamond, 2004). This is particularly true as past studies have relied on surface-level classifications of gender that is likely to have not captured the true picture of what it means to be a \u2018woman\u2019 in STEM. This study will therefore review past and recent findings, and in doing so will provide a fresh perspective on the current barriers and challenges that are currently present in pursuit of gender equality in academia.\n\nReferences\n\nDiamond, M.

warnings about confidence-accuracy conflation can abolish the featural justification effect. In this experiment, we address the effect of the warning when a) effect sizes are potentially larger than seen in the featural justification effect, b) the accuracy of the witness's statement is (un-)corroborated by outside information, and c) a different bias is at play.\n\nThe within-subject conditions mirror the Grabman &amp; Dodson (2019) paper on the impact of knowing the identity of a police suspect on interpretations of eyewitness statements. In this study, we found that participants rated eyewitness statements as more confident when the eyewitness identified the police suspect, as compared to a condition where the suspect was unknown. This is a logical error, because participants were explicitly told (and acknowledged) that the witness did not know the identity of the police suspect when making their selection, meaning that this information should not influence the witness's intended level of confidence.\n\nWill the same warning from the previous featural justification experiments reduce the impact of knowing the identity of the police suspect? This question has important real-world implications, as often legal decisions (e.g., whether to admit eyewitness testimony in court) are made with the identity of the suspect in mind. A witness may be perceived as more confident than is warranted if their selection matches the police suspect. Additionally, research suggests that picking someone other than the police suspect (i.e.,  a filler) should be considered evidence against the police suspect, meaning that downplaying the importance of disconfirmations could decrease exoneration rates. \n\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "1.

We also hypothesize that identical confidence statements will be perceived as less certain when witnesses' selections do not match the police suspect (filler-Id).\n\n2.

In this experiment, we address the effect of the warning when a) effect sizes are potentially larger than seen in the featural justification effect, b) the accuracy of the witness's statement is (un-)corroborated by outside information, and c) a different bias is at play.\n\nThe within-subject conditions mirror the Grabman &amp; Dodson (2019) paper on the impact of knowing the identity of a police suspect on interpretations of eyewitness statements. In this study, we found that participants rated eyewitness statements as more confident when the eyewitness identified the police suspect, as compared to a condition where the suspect was unknown. This is a logical error, because participants were explicitly told (and acknowledged) that the witness did not know the identity of the police suspect when making their selection, meaning that this information should not influence the witness's intended level of confidence.\n\nWill the same warning from the previous featural justification experiments reduce the impact of knowing the identity of the police suspect? This question has important real-world implications, as often legal decisions (e.g., whether to admit eyewitness testimony in court) are made with the identity of the suspect in mind. A witness may be perceived as more confident than is warranted if their selection matches the police suspect. Additionally, research suggests that picking someone other than the police suspect (i.e.,  a filler) should be considered evidence against the police suspect, meaning that downplaying the importance of disconfirmations could decrease exoneration rates. \n\n", "q4": "1. We expect to replicate previous findings on contextual effects when participants receive no warning. Specifically, as compared to a condition where the suspect is unknown (no-context), we expect that participants will perceive identical confidence statements as more certain when witnesses' selections match the police suspect (suspect-Id). We also hypothesize that identical confidence statements will be perceived as less certain when witnesses' selections do not match the police suspect (filler-Id).\n\n2. We expect that knowledge of the police suspect will be less impactful on participants receiving the confidence-accuracy conflation warning.

In addition, evidence was found for a correlation between chronic prevention focus and a view of God as punishing, albeit of a weaker magnitude. Situational regulatory focus was manipulated, but showed no effect in this study.\n\nStudy 2 attempted to generalize the findings from Study 1 to the perception of a fictitious goddess. Participants read stories written in a religious tone about said goddess and subsequently judged her behavior in the story as either punishing or nurturing. If chronic regulatory focus influences the processing of new information about godlike figures, similar correlations to those observed in Study 1 should have obtained for the ratings of the goddess\u2019 behavior. However, no reliable evidence was found for these predictions. \n\nStudy 2 suffered from several methodical shortcomings. First, the online structure of the experiment required the use of strong attention checks to ensure valid data. However, this necessitated a reward structure that was contingent on participants\u2019 attention, thereby possibly inducing a focus on rewards (i.e. a situational promotion focus). Second, the online data collection suffered from a bug that led to an undetermined number of participants seeing an older version of the experiment (see https://www.millisecond.com/forums/Topic25012.aspx). Third, the stories describing the goddess\u2019 behavior were written for this study and not pretested for content. This led to participants seeing not just ambivalent stories in which the goddess showed both punishing and nurturing tendencies, but also univalent stories in which she was only punishing or only nurturing. The presence of the univalent stories might have given a proportion of participants a specific unambiguous initial image of the goddess, rendering later judgments less likely to be affected by regulatory focus. Finally and perhaps most importantly, there may be important psychological differences between processing information about a fictitious godlike figure and the God in which one believes. \n\nFor these reasons, we decided to discontinue our inquiries into the processing of information about godlike figures and instead focus on replicating and extending our initial findings with regard to views of God. Therefore, we plan a study in which religious university students are queried on their views of God in general as well as their chronic regulatory focus, allowing a direct replication of the initial study.\n\nIn addition, we have adapted several of our vignettes to the Christian God. Using participants\u2019 evaluations of God\u2019s behavior in these vignettes, we seek to investigate whether participants are motivated to reconcile punishing behavior by God with their presumably positive general image of God by assigning the recipients of said punishment the responsibility for their negative outcomes. Participants who do not view God as punishing should be most likely to engage in such attributions in order to reconcile the inconsistency of God\u2019s behavior in the story with their view of God as nonpunishing. In particular, such participants with a strong chronic prevention focus should be particularly agitated by punishing behavior from God due to their increased sensitivity to negative outcomes and also particularly likely to condemn those punished by God due to their focus on avoiding violations of moral standards.
