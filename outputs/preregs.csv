Life Goal Development and Occupational Creativity,"Summary: This registration document contains the analysis plan for existing longitudinal data as part of a project assessing longitudinal changes in life goals and their relationships with occupational creativity. This project will use data from two existing datasets. The project has two primary goals: (1) to examine how life goals develop and change during adolescence and young adulthood and (2) to examine whether changes in goals (over and above initial levels) predict occupational creativity. 
We follow 2 steps in preregistering this project. At step 1, we registered our analysis plan for factor analyses to determine the structure of the life goals measure employed in the study. At step 2 (current document), we register hypotheses and research questions for the main study. Both registration documents follow the preregistration template, “Preregistration of secondary data analysis: A template and tutorial” (den Akker et al., 2019).",pw6v7,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/pw6v7/contributors/?format=json,,[],9d7fa

Being moved and attachment,"The emotion often denoted as ""being moved"" has often been supposed to be linked to the attachment system (e.g. Panksepp, 1995). However, this relationship has not yet been explored empirically. In a previous study, we found that attachment as a trait (measured with the Adult Attachment Questionnaire and the Relationships Questionnaire) was related to the propensity of a participant to be moved by a video and to be moved in general (as measured by the Geneva Sentimentality Scale).

A model to predict level of adherence to prehabilitation in older adults with frailty having cancer surgery,"BACKGROUND: Frailty is a well-established predictor of adverse postoperative outcomes in older surgical patients and is especially common in older people having cancer surgery. Early evidence suggests exercise could improve postoperative outcomes for people with frailty, however little is known about the factors that influence older people’s adherence in exercise before surgery (prehabilitation) programs.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to identify predictors of prehabilitation adherence in older adults living with frailty before cancer surgery.

METHODS: This will be a nested prospective cohort of older adults with frailty having cancer surgery who participated in a randomized controlled trial of home-based prehabilitation vs. standard care to improve postoperative functional performance. It is anticipated that 102 participants from the intervention arm will be included in this study’s nested cohort.

We will construct a multivariable ordinary least squares linear regression model using pre-specified, prospectively collected covariates to predict adherence (% prescribed exercise sessions attempted). Our covariates (collected at baseline) have been selected a priori based on clinical expertise and literature review; they will include age, sex, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), disability, frailty score, previous physical activity, depression, and neoadjuvant therapy. If assumptions of normality are met, our dependent variable will be % adherence; otherwise a log transformation will be applied. All continuous variables will be standardized and assessed for best fit using fractional polynomials. Collinearity will be considered using variance inflation factor and addressed with penalisation. Missing data will be handled using multiple imputation. Bootstrapping will be used to internally validate the model. 

EXPECTED RESULTS: This model will help us to understand the proportion of variance in prehabilitation adherence that is explained by baseline participant characteristics. This will allow for identification of people at risk of low adherence to inform resource targeting and personalization of prehabilitation support systems.",n9pk2,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9pk2/contributors/?format=json,,[],q7wp5

Goal conflict,"The Current Research
A few studies to date have addressed goal conflict in relation to individual and relational well-being showing that goal conflict has a negative impact on well-being (Gere &amp; Impett, 2018; Gere &amp; Schimmack, 2013; Gere et al., 2011; Righetti et al., 2016). However, surprisingly little research has been dedicated to addressing how goal conflict influences support toward goal pursuit and engagement in life’s opportunities (see Gere &amp; Impett, 2018 and Hui et al., 2014 for exceptions). The purpose of the current research is to address this gap in the literature. Specifically, the aim of the research is to examine whether goal conflict influences the interpersonal processes of RC support: support seeking, support providing, perceived partner responsiveness, and commitment toward opportunities. We expect that goal conflict will be negatively associated with all four core processes as partners are motivated to avoid threats to the relationship. Specifically, we expect that target’s perception of goal conflict will be negatively associated with support seeking (H1; replication of research by Righetti, Kumashiro, and Campbell, 2014 using the same dataset by), perceived partner responsiveness (H2; novel), and goal commitment/motivation (H3; novel). We also expect that partner’s perception of goal conflict will be negatively associated with support providing (H4). Previous research has shown that goal conflict is associated with motivation to provide, or not provide, support (Feeney et al., 2013, 2017) but has not been tested for actual support. We do not make any a priori predictions for partner effects as there is not enough prior research to be confident about specific hypotheses. However, if anything, the associations are likely to also be negative. 
Furthermore, we also extend the current literature by addressing whether individual differences in attachment styles moderate the relationship between goal conflict and the support processes. We expect that when goal conflict is high, higher levels of attachment anxiety will negatively predict perception of support (H5) as well as motivation toward goal pursuit (H6). We expect that when goal conflict is high, individuals higher (vs. lower) in attachment avoidance will seek less support (H7). Furthermore, while individuals lower (vs. higher) in attachment avoidance will be less motivated to pursue goals, those higher in attachment avoidance will be unaffected and therefore we expect this association to be positive (H8). We also expect that when partners high (vs. low) in attachment anxiety perceive goals as conflicting, they will provide less support (H9). We expect all other moderator effects to be non-significant but include them in the model as controls. Please see Table 1 for the hypotheses and Figure 2 for a graphical illustration of the proposed predictions.
We aim to test the hypotheses in a sample of couples who completed 8-days of daily diary data. We will use multilevel modeling with two-levels of random variation in which partners are nested within dyads and days are crossed within partners (Kenny, Kashy, &amp; Cook, 2006). We will include both partners’ perceptions of goal conflict and both partners’ attachment styles (and moderation) predicting a) support seeking, b) support providing, c) perceived responsiveness, and d) goal pursuit/movement. Furthermore, because goals can conflict with either the partner’s goals or the relationship’s goals, we will also test the models separately for goal conflict with partner’s goals and goal conflict with relationship’s goals to see whether models vary for the two outcome variables. We will also test for lagged effects by including yesterday’s goal conflict to predict the next day’s outcomes.",z3hyt,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/z3hyt/contributors/?format=json,,[],pu9h4

An umbrella review of psychological interventions aimed at the prevention and treatment of mental and psychosocial problems of college students,"The college years are a developmentally crucial period for young people in which they make the transition from late adolescence to emerging adulthood (Arnett, 2000). Psychosocial and mental health problems during this phase of life are not only highly prevalent (Auerbach et al., 2018), but they also affect academic functioning (Bruffaerts, 2018) and can have long-term adverse outcomes in later adulthood, including persistent emotional and physical health problems, relationship dysfunction, and labor market marginalization (Scott, 2016; Kerr, 2011). Moreover, a problematic start of the professional career can have long-term negative consequences for career success and sustainability (Niederkrotenthaler, 2015; Akkermans, 2018).
Many psychological interventions for these problems in college students have been developed and tested in randomized controlled trials, and a considerable number of meta-analyses of these trials have been published. However, because the field is so large, there is no good overview of interventions and the randomized trials available for this field. 
The goal of the current umbrella review of meta-analyses is to provide an overview of the field, including the number and quality of trials, the focus of the trials, the interventions, and the effect sizes found for the interventions in the meta-analyses.

Co-brooding mediates peer influence on depression and anxiety,"This study aims to examine mediating processes which explain how peers influence individuals’ depression and anxiety. Peers in this project refer to fellow students of the same cohort (i.e., first-year psychology students). Peers’ levels of depression predict changes in target individuals’ levels of depression (M. H. W. Van Zalk, Kerr, Branje, Stattin, &amp; Meeus, 2010), indicating that peers influence depression. Furthermore, peers’ levels of social anxiety predict changes in target individuals’ levels of social anxiety, indicating that peers influence social anxiety (N. Van Zalk, Van Zalk, Kerr, &amp; Stattin, 2011). Peer influence on other types of anxiety has not been examined, however. However, relatively little is known about how peers influence depression and anxiety, that is, which causal mechanisms are responsible for this type of peer influence. Co-rumination (Rose, 2002; Rose &amp; Asher, 1999; Rose, Carlson, &amp; Waller, 2007) has been proposed as a mediating process that explains how peers influence each other’s depression. Co-rumination refers to jointly dwelling on and rehashing emotional problems. Several longitudinal studies have shown that co-rumination predicts increases in depression among adolescent (M. H. W. Van Zalk et al., 2010) and adult (Ames-Sikora, Donohue, &amp; Tully, 2017) samples. More recently, co-brooding (Horn &amp; Maercker, 2016) has been proposed as one of the most detrimental component of co-rumination: it concerns a communication patterns characterized by “repetition of negative affect which is unwanted, rigid and perceived as unpleasant” (Horn &amp; Maercker, 2016, p. 2). However, to our knowledge, no prior study has examined how co-rumination, and specifically the co-brooding component, mediates peers’ depression effects on target individuals’ depression. Moreover, although co-brooding has also been cross-sectionally linked to different types of anxiety (Carlucci, D’Ambrosio, Innamorati, Saggino, &amp; Balsamo, 2018), to what degree co-brooding mediates peers’ anxiety effects on target individuals’ anxiety remains unclear. The current study therefore aims to examine to what extent co-brooding mediates peers’ depression and anxiety effects on target individuals’ depression and anxiety, respectively. 

The current study focuses on mediating mechanisms that explain peer influence on depression and anxiety. For depression, peer influence refers to higher levels of peers’ depression predicting stronger increases of target individual’s depression compared to lower levels of peers’ depression. For anxiety, peer influence refers to higher levels of peers’ anxiety predicting stronger increases of target individual’s anxiety compared to lower levels of peers’ anxiety. Specifically, we will examine to what extent co-brooding mediates peer influence. Co-brooding refers to repeated and consistent rehashing and dwelling on emotional problems. For depression, the predictor is the average of peers’ depression, the mediator changes in co-brooding between targets and peers, and the outcome changes in targets’ depression. For anxiety, the predictor is the average of peers’ anxiety, the mediator changes in co-brooding between targets and peers, and the outcome changes in targets’ anxiety. We will examine two types of anxiety: generalized anxiety and social phobia.",qazvd,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/qazvd/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Invitations for this study will be sent out shortly after this pre-registration (from the 22th of April 2020 onward) and participation can start immediately.

A Scoping Review of Interpersonal Social Capital in the Context of Cardiometabolic Disease across the Lifespan in US Dwelling Hispanics/Latinxs,"Hispanics/Latinxs are a historically oppressed ethnic group in the United States (US). They face myriad socioeconomic and health burdens when compared with their non-Hispanic/Latinx White counterparts including less educational attainment, lower income, more workplace injury, less access to health care, less access to healthy food and spaces for physical activity, and greater rates of diabetes mellitus. Yet, despite this considerable hardship, they demonstrate lower age-adjusted all-cause mortality and lower atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality.

The reasons for this health paradox are not well understood. Many scholars have hypothesized that this paradox may be partially explained by Hispanics'/Latinxs' collectivist values that may facilitate protective family and social dynamics, or interpersonal social capital. However, little is known about the nature of these dynamics and how they may influence disease incidence, management, and progression- particularly, cardiometabolic disease such as diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. To address this gap in knowledge, the proposed scoping review will identify and explore studies that measure social environments among US dwelling Hispanics/Latinxs and their association with cardiometabolic disease incidence, management, and progression. Social environments include marital-like relationships, family dynamics surrounding support behaviors, social networks, neighborhood social factors such as integration and cohesion, etc.

Effect of Fenugreek on vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women: Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes or night sweats) are closely related to the impaired quality of life in menopausal women. Fenugreek is the ripe seed of Trigonella foenum graecum Linn. In China, this plant is used to relieve menopausal symptoms in women.

Methods: Randomized controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria will be retrieved in Five English online databases and four Chinese online databases. The primary outcomes are changes in frequency and intensity of vasomotor symptoms that measured by validated scales. The secondary outcomes will include quality of life, blood hormone parameters, blood biochemical parameters, and adverse events. Heterogeneity of data will be assessed by I2 and Cochrane’s Q statistics. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis will be performed to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Egger's test and Begg’s test will be used to assess the publication bias. Finally, we will evaluate the quality of evidence by the GRADE approach.

The effects of a temporal processing-based auditory training program on the auditory skills of elderly users of hearing aids: a study protocol for a randomized clinical trial,"Background: One of the most important effects of age-related declines in neural processing speed is the impairment of temporal resolution, which leads to difficulty hearing in noisy environments. Since the central auditory system is highly plastic, by designing and implementing a temporal processing-based auditory training program, we can help the elderly improve their listening skills and speech understanding in noisy environments.
Methods: In the first phase of this research, based on the theoretical framework of temporal processing, an auditory training solution was developed as a software program. In the second phase, which will be described in the present study, the effects of the designed program on the listening skills of the elderly users of hearing aids (age: 60-75 years) will be studied in the control and intervention groups. In the intervention group, the auditory training program will be implemented for three months (36 sessions), and the results of central tests (GIN, DPT, QuickSIN) and the electrophysiological speech-ABR test will be compared in both groups before, immediately and one month after the intervention.

How Downward Comparison of Immigration Influences Personal Wherewithal,"The aim of this research is to understand how reflecting on discrimination of an ethnic group influences individuals' endorsement of personal wherewithal and neoliberal ideology.

Neoliberal policies create inequalities between the wealthy and the middle and lower classes. Our aim is to understand if policies against immigrants started by Trump administration influence people's support towards neoliberalism.

Social media survey,"The past decade has seen a rapid increase in the use of social media, with a recent report indicating that 66% of the UK’s population are active social media users (Underwood, 2020). Although the term ""social media addiction"" is widely used in mass media and public discussion to describe excessive usage, whether this behaviour should be pathologised as a behavioural addiction is still hotly contested in the scientific literature, and currently no formal diagnosis of social media addiction exists (Griffiths, Kuss, &amp; Demetrovics, 2014). In order to identify when/if excessive social media use may become problematic in the sense of predominant theoretical models of addiction, which rely heavily on the concept of reward (Berridge &amp; Robinson, 2016; Robinson &amp; Berridge, 1993), research must first clarify the rewarding aspects of social media that might perpetuate excessive use. Previous research indicates an important role for a range of reward-related motives (Kircaburun, Alhabash, Tosuntaş, &amp; Griffiths, 2018; Przybylski, Murayama, DeHaan, &amp; Gladwell, 2013; Ryan, Chester, Reece, &amp; Xenos, 2014; Zolkepli, Kamarulzaman, &amp; Kitchen, 2018) in social media use but the relative contribution of these motives to excessive usage and problematic behaviour remains unclear. The present study will therefore aim to systematically measure how much reward-based motives contribute to social media usage and how they predict problematic social media use. The study will use different subjective measures related to social media, including assessment of different types of reward-based motives underlying social media use, problematic social media usage behaviours based on the Social media disorder scale (Van Den Eijnden, Lemmens, &amp; Valkenburg, 2016) derived from DSM criteria for addiction, and general sensitivity to reward using a questionnaire. The study will also employ experimental paradigms derived from the substance addiction and food reward literature to assess reward related to social media implicitly. These measures will focus on the motivational component of reward (wanting), as changes of the neural system underlying wanting (mesolimbic dopaminergic system) are implicated in excessive drug use (Lambert, McLeod, &amp; Schenk, 2005; Leyton, et al., 2002), alcohol consumption (Ostafin, Marlatt, &amp; Troop-Gordon, 2010) and obesity (Mela, 2006; Volkow, Wang, &amp; Baler, 2011). Measures will include (a) visual cue reactivity to social media logos (and control logos) as a proxy for cue-elicited wanting (Berridge &amp; Robinson, 2016), (b) a visual approach-avoidance task to examine approach motivation associated with wanting (Kakoschke, Albertella, Lee, &amp; Wiers, 2019), (c) and pay-for-likes as an analogue to pay-for-food wanting measures (Rogers &amp; Hardman, 2015). In addition, we will measure self-reported urges (wanting) to check social media and pleasure (liking) associated with social media usage. The incentive sensitization theory of addiction (Berridge &amp; Robinson, 2016; Robinson &amp; Berridge, 1993) predicts that increased wanting should occur independent of liking. Both components of the study (self-reports and experimental measures) will be administered in an online survey programmed using PsyToolkit (Stoet, 2010; Stoet, 2017).",jqm57,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/jqm57/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Recruitment: Participants will be recruited using standard internal channels of advertising research studies at Durham University (e.g., the “SONA” participant credit system for Psychology students, the University newsletter, social media pages), as well as external channels of advertising (e.g., www.prolific.co). \n\nEligibility criteria: Participants between the ages of 18 and 30 years old, who are able to access visual information on their computer screen without any special equipment, such as a speech interface or the “Accessibility Mode” of the operating system, will be eligible to take part. The study will also require that participants access the survey on a device with a real keyboard and using a browser other than Safari (because of incompatibility with the experiments coded on PsyToolkit). \n\nProcedure: Participants who meet the eligibility criteria will be invited to take part in the study and will access the survey programmed using PsyToolkit (Stoet, 2010; Stoet, 2017) via a web link. Participants who confirm the consent agreement will first be asked to report demographic information (e.g., age and gender). They will then be asked questions related to their social media use, including the types of social media platforms they use, their daily time spent on social media and frequency of checking. Further questions related to social media usage will explore how daily time spent using and frequency of checking might have changed since the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. Secondary variables will then be measured including the number of expected ‘likes’ on a social media post and the willingness to ‘pay-for-likes’, for which participants are asked to choose between an incremental amount of money (i.e., £1, £2, £5, £10, £25, £50, £100) or doubling the number of ‘likes’ on their next social media post. Participants will then complete the ‘Social Media Disorder Scale’ (a 9-item scale adapted from the DSM criteria for Internet Gaming Disorder; Van Den Eijnden, Lemmens, &amp; Valkenburg, 2016), as a measure of problematic social media use. This will be followed by questions assessing the degree to which their social media use represents a “liking” vs. “wanting” behaviour. Participants will then be asked to report the extent to which they agree with 20 statements that assess 10 pre-identified categories of rewards and motivations related to social media use (two statements per each domain). The final part of the questionnaire will assess general sensitivity to reward using 10 items taken from the SPSRQ-20 (Aluja &amp; Blanch, 2011), a short form of the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (Torrubia, Avila, Moltó, &amp; Caseras, 2001). All questions in the questionnaire will be optional and participants can choose to omit any they do not wish to answer. After completing the questionnaire component of the study participants will complete an Online Visual Approach/Avoidance by the Self Task (online-VAAST) with social media and matched control stimuli, as an implicit measure of automatic approach tendencies to social media cues. Finally, participants will be asked to self-report whether they believe they use social media too much and whether they believe they are addicted, before finishing the survey.

Post-Stroke Fatigue: A Scoping Review,"Background: Post-stroke fatigue (PSF) is one of the most common and frustrating outcomes of stroke. It has a high prevalence and it can persist for many years after stroke. PSF itself contributes to a wider range of undesirable outcomes that affect all aspects of daily life. The aim of this review was to identify and summarise the most recent research on PSF, in order to update the evidence base.
Methods: We updated an existing review (Hinkle et al. 2017) systematically searching CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and PubMed to cover new research studies between 1st March 2016 and the search date (19th January 2020). We included interventional and observational research, and clinical practice guidelines that were not covered in the original review. After duplicate removal in EndNote, two reviewers screened the search results in Rayyan, and data from eligible full texts were extracted onto an Excel spreadsheet. Finally, we used RobotReviewer and a human reviewer to assess the risk of bias of randomised trials for this scoping review.
Results: We identified 45 records for 30 studies (14 observational, 10 interventional studies, and 6 guidelines). Apart from one, the interventional studies were single-centred, had high risk of bias and small sample size (median 50). They investigated exercise, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, education, and light therapy. Observational studies mainly reported the factors related to PSF including co-morbidities, depression and anxiety, quality of life, activities of daily living, stroke severity, medication use and polypharmacy, polymorphism, pain, apathy, limb heaviness, neuroticism, mobility, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Guidelines either did not report on PSF or, when reported, their recommendations were supported by little or low level of evidence.
Conclusion: Although we identified a number of recent studies which have added to our current knowledge on PSF, none are robust enough to change current clinical practice.",xjkcs,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xjkcs/contributors/?format=json,,"['Clinical Practice Guidelines', 'Cohort', 'Cross-Sectional', 'Evidence Synthesis', 'Fatigue', 'Post-Stroke Fatigue', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Scoping Review', 'Stroke']",2v69m

Adjusting to the COVID-19 Outbreak in the United States: The Role of Personality and Situational Factors on the Maintenance of Habitual Behaviors,"The COVID-19 outbreak and associated policies meant to reduce the spread of the virus have imposed many changes to the lives of people living in the United States. On top of working or attending classes from home, many families are now dealing with uncertain job prospects or limited income, reduced work or school hours, limited or unavailable childcare during the day, and limited access to food or healthcare items. At the same time, when living in cities where lockdown or stay-at-home orders are in place, many people have unlimited access to food, smoking, drinking, television and mobile devices. This suggests that the conditions imposed by the outbreak are affecting many health-promoting and health-damaging behaviors, including eating, sleep, substance use, and screen time. Our goal is to uncover (1) what types of lifestyle challenges people have been facing during their adaptation to the COVID-19 outbreak, and (2) the extent to which personality (e.g., self-control) and situational factors (i.e., local policies and lock down orders) predict the development of new habits, and changes in health behaviors, such as smoking, drinking, using social media, exercising, sleeping, and eating healthily.",v2ksg,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/v2ksg/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Participants can be of three types: \n(1) Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers who are currently adult, aged 18 years and above, living in the United States; \n(2) participants recruited from online forums, such as Facebook, Reddit, and other online communities who are currently adult, aged 18 years and above, living in the United States; \n(3) Duke Psychology &amp; Neuroscience subject pool available through Sona systems.

Information Retrieval (Perolehan Informasi) merupakan suatu pencarian informasi(biasanya berupa dokumen) yang didasarkan pada suatu query (inputan user) yang diharapkan dapat memenuhi keinginan user dari dokumen yang ada. Dua aspek penting dalam konsep Information Retrieval yang diterapkan dalam sebuah perancangan mesin pencari yaitu repesentasi dari informasi dan pengukuran yang akan mengukur nilai kesamaan antara dua obyek. Informasi yang dapat direpresentasikan menjadi sebuah obyek yang direpresentasikan dalam berbagai bentuk dan model (heterogeneous). Keadaan ini mengakibatkan bahwa pencarian untuk suatu obyek informasi yang diinginkan akan dapat dipetakan kepada beberapa obyek informati yang dinilai relevan. Relevansi dua informasi di-ukur dari keberadaan kata kunci (keyword) dan bobotnya. Konsekuensi logis atas keadaan ini adalah bahwa dalam melakukan pencarian obyek yang diinginkan, ditemukan terdapat ketidakpastian (uncertainly) terhadap penggunaan keyword pada query oleh pengguna dengan keberadaan keyword pada dokumen. Pada penelitian ini akan difokuskan pada studi efektifitas vektor model dengan menggunakan algoritma steming poter untuk membentuk kata-kata menjadi sebuah kata baku

Public reactions to anti-knife carrying messages.,"Over the years, police and anti-knife carrying organisations have tried different methods to proactively encourage individuals not to carry weapons, but despite this, knife enabled crime continues to rise. Anti-knife crime campaigns frequently highlight the risks associated with such behaviour, specifically that people are more likely to be seriously injured or killed themselves if they carry a knife.

In line with Terror Management Theory, mortality salience research has indicated that if one’s mortality is made salient, one is more likely to engage in behaviours to protect oneself and preserve self-esteem. Highlighting the possibility of death due to carrying a knife may actually accentuate positive views around knife carrying as individuals feel the need to protect themselves. Yet, these views may be negated when mortality salience is primed with responsibility. Encouraging individuals to think about the effects of knife carrying on others (primed responsibility), rather than the effect on themselves, may reverse the effects of mortality salience. If primed responsibility leads to less positive views about carrying a knife, police and anti-knife carrying organisations may be able to design more successful communication strategies, which has implications for policy makers.

Drawing on data from three survey experiments, we examine the efficacy of “face-saving” treatments as a means of reducing social desirability and enhancing measurement of compliance.

Task-induced Achievement Emotions and their Role in Visual Working Memory Performance: A Registered Report,"Previous research has demonstrated that emotional states or emotional stimuli can influence visual working memory (VWM) performance. However, up to date there is a striking lack of research on whether the VWM task itself induces emotional experiences, and whether they impact VWM performance. In our registered report we argue that the VWM task can be considered an achievement situation, therefore leading to participants naturally experiencing achievement emotions (AE) including joy, pride, anger, and shame. Specifically, we hypothesize (1) that these AE correlate with individual differences in VWM performance, that this link is (2) mediated by subjective task performance (STP; i.e. how well or poorly participants think they are doing) and (3) moderated by performance goal orientation (PGO). Further, we believe (4) that AE, PGO, and task difficulty interact in predicting VWM. N = 225 participants will be recruited to perform the continuous colour wheel task. The task shall be comprised of 240 trials, which include arrays of either four (easy) or eight (difficult) coloured squares.

Temporal Distancing Covid19,"COVID-19 is rapidly spreading across the globe, resulting in millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths to date. Fear and anxiety are especially prevalent emotions during an epidemic like this, and can have long-lasting negative consequences on psychological health. It is critical to identify strategies to help people better cope with the current epidemic. The aim is to provide insights and strategies to combat fear and anxiety, and to improve people’s psychological well-being, both during current epidemic and in similar future situations. Research has shown that psychological distance--temporally distancing the self from stressful events--promotes adaptive coping, mitigate emotional distress and reactivity, and improves adaptive emotional control. By eliciting a distant future perspective, the current research aims to reduce negative affect (e.g., anxiety/fear), and facilitate coping with current COVID-19 epidemic, through the mechanism of impermanent focus (i.e. focusing on transitory aspects of the stressor). Eventually, we plan to mitigate negative psychological consequences through online interventions because a timely online intervention is most desirable when opportunities to deliver in-person interventions are limited by widespread quarantine measures.

Review methods
Rationale (optional)
Checkpoint immunotherapy is administered based on disruption of tumor cell-induced inhibition of cytotoxic T cell mediated apoptosis. T cell re-activation is currently effectuated through the FDA and EMA approved drugs Ipilimumab, Atezolizumab, Avelumab, Pembrolizumab, Durvalumab, and Nivolumab, which target the PD1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4/B7.1/2 inhibitory mechanisms. These treatment strategies are tested in various organs, combinations, and lines of treatment. The drugs are highly efficient in patients with tumors that have a high mutation burden, mismatch repair deficiency/microsatellite instability, and high levels of tumor-infiltrating T cells, which are hallmarks of the hereditary cancer syndrome, Lynch syndrome. Though inclusion in clinical studies is based on patients having this tumor phenotype, up against 50% does not respond and predictive biomarkers are currently investigated to increase the response rates. 

Review questions
This scoping review aims to: 
1)	Systematically map current knowledge and gaps in the literature on the outcome from the FDA and EMA approved T-cell activating drugs Ipilimumab, Pembrolizumab, Atezolizumab, Avelumab, Durvalumab, and Nivolumab in patients with mismatch repair deficient/microsatellite instable tumors? How is this outcome affected by tumor-induced immune evasion mechanisms?
2)	Systematically map current knowledge and gaps in what is known in the literature on the outcome from the FDA and EMA approved T-cell activating drugs Ipilimumab, Pembrolizumab, Atezolizumab, Nivolumab in Lynch syndrome patients? How is this outcome affected by tumor-induced immune evasion mechanisms?

URL to search strategy
Not applicable

Condition or domain being studied
Patients with mismatch repair deficient/microsatellite instable tumors treated with the FDA and EMA approved T-cell activating drugs Ipilimumab, Pembrolizumab, Avelumab, Atezolizumab, Durvalumab, and Nivolumab.

Participants/Population
All patients regardless of age have been pre-selected based on tumor phenotype showing microsatellite instability or mismatch repair deficiency through immunohistochemical loss of protein expression of the mismatch proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2. There are no selection criteria regarding tumor type. 

Concept
All patients have been treated with the FDA and EMA approved T cell activating drugs Ipilimumab, Pembrolizumab, Avelumab, Atezolizumab, Durvalumab, or Nivolumab and tumor progression or regression (scored according to the RECIST criteria) and/or overall/progression-free survival have been collected in a medical setting. For some studies, biomarkers may have been investigated retrospectively to determine their predictive value. 

Context
All periods of time and duration of follow-up before March 20, 2020, are eligible. 

Primary outcomes (optional)
Primary outcomes include: objective response rate, overall survival, progression-free survival, progressive disease, resistance and biomarker analyses (protein analyses, gene expression analyses or DNA mutation analyses) on immune response and immune evasion pathways. 

Secondary outcomes (optional)
Secondary outcomes include: all of the primary outcomes described above but specifically in Lynch syndrome patients.

Data extraction
The full set of titles and abstracts retrieved will be independently screened for eligibility by three authors (Maria Rasmussen and Christina Therkildsen) and the level of agreement will be discussed. A pilot search has been conducted to study the selection criteria and compare articles identified in the beginning and end of the screening process. A third reviewer (Jon Durhuus) will be consulted where agreement cannot be achieved. 
A standardized data extraction formula will be developed and pilot-tested among all reviewers. Data extraction will include: tumor type (e.g. location, organ, level of mismatch repair deficiency, level of microsatellite instability), treatment regimen (e.g. pharmaceutical drug used, line of treatment, combinational treatment, period), outcome (e.g. objective response rate, overall survival, progression-free survival, resistance), and biomarkers (e.g. name of the protein/genes, type of analyses, level of expression, percentage of positive tumors).  All studies need to be on homo sapiens and written in English. Conference abstracts will be screened, but only included if all requested data are available.

Risk of quality assessment
Since this is a scoping review, quality assessment will not be conducted.

Strategy of synthesis
The synthesis will focus on providing: 1) mapping the outcomes from checkpoint-based immunotherapy in patients with mismatch repair deficient/microsatellite instable tumors and 2) describe the predictive value of immune response and immune evasion-related possible up-coming biomarkers associated with tumor-induced immune evasion mechanisms.

General Risk Attitudes and COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic may snowball into becoming a mental-health pandemic (Holmes et al., 2020, Lancet Psychiatry). Who is at risk of developing mental-health issues during the pandemic? Results from data-collection in a recent COVID-19 related project, aiming to delineate the role of general risk attitudes in shaping perceptions of the pandemic (and vice versa – see preregistration protocol: https://osf.io/cexyu), showed that people with a general disposition towards being risk averse exhibited more COVID-19 related anxiety. The predictive power of general risk attitude (GRA) in predicting COVID-19 related anxiety was much stronger than for age, income, and, educational level. It also was independent of gender (which also showed strong predictive power), domain-specific risk attitudes, frequency measures of everyday risk taking, and general decision-making skill (measures for which there was no predictive power). 
This is concerning because risk aversion and trait anxiety can together propel behavior such as panic buying, avoidance behavior leading to overly limited socialization, and self-medication. Moreover, being risk averse is a common trait, and the results thus hints the concerning possibility that many individuals in the general population may develop mental-health problems that are not easily fixed by providing safety nets (e.g., proper health care health risk-groups and economic risk-groups, since the anxiousness may be situated in a more dispositional manner.

Psychosocial outcomes of sport participation for middle-aged and older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Recent reviews have made an attempt to shed light on the psychosocial outcomes of sport participation for adults (Andersen, Ottesen, &amp; Thing, 2019; Eime et al., 2013; Gayman et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2019). Nevertheless, there is sufficient cause to conduct a meta-analysis examining the psychosocial outcomes of sport participation for middle-aged and older adults. Firstly, the reviews by Andersen et al. (2019) and Eime et al. (2013) have not focused strictly on the middle-aged and older adult population. This presents an issue as the meaning and function of sport participation for middle-aged and older adults is not comparable with that for younger adults (McPherson, 1984). Therefore, it is impossible to isolate the unique psychosocial effects of sport participation for middle-aged and older adults. Secondly, in spite of Kim et al. (2019) and Gayman et al. (2017) focusing solely on older adults, competitive and recreational sports were combined in the reviews. Similarly, both team and individual sports were examined together. This makes it impossible to decipher whether the nature and context of the sport influence these psychosocial outcomes. Thirdly, although Gayman et al. (2017) considered the psychosocial outcomes of older adults’ sport participation, they excluded all cases of recreational and leisure-time sport participation, which accounts for a vast majority of literature in this domain. Further, the studies they included were of mixed quality, and therefore cannot provide complete confidence in their results. Ultimately, it is unclear to what extent these psychosocial benefits are a direct result of sport participation.
Presently, there lacks a synthesis of the quantitative literature on the psychosocial outcomes of sport participation for middle-aged and older adults in the form of a meta-analysis. A meta-analysis enables such a quantitative synthesis, providing insight into the magnitude and consistency of the psychosocial outcomes of sport participation (Borenstein et al., 2009). Such inferences cannot be drawn from a systematic review.

15. * Searches.
State the sources that will be searched. Give the search dates, and any restrictions (e.g. language or publication period). Do NOT enter the full search strategy (it may be provided as a link or attachment.)
A systematic search without date restrictions was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials on March 4th, 2020, using a search strategy developed in conjunction with a librarian specializing in systematic review searches. The search strategy was consistent across all databases.

16. * Condition or domain being studied.
Give a short description of the disease, condition or healthcare domain being studied. This could include health and wellbeing outcomes.
Melasma is an acquired, symmetrical disorder of hypermelanosis that affects the sun-exposed areas of the skin. To-date, there does not exist a satisfactory treatment for melasma. A variety of topical and systemic treatments have been attempted, including laser therapy, oral and topical tranexamic acid, and combination therapies. In particular, many studies have explored the use of microneedling in melasma and have shown promising results. However, to-date, the literature lacks a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of microneedling in the treatment of melasma.

17. * Participants/population.
Give summary criteria for the participants or populations being studied by the review. The preferred format includes details of both inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Adult patients with melasma (&gt;18 years old). Pediatric patients are excluded.

18. * Intervention(s), exposure(s).
Give full and clear descriptions or definitions of the nature of the interventions or the exposures to be reviewed.
Microneedling, either alone or in combination with another therapy. Ex. Platelet rich plasma, tranexamic acid (oral and topical), vitamin C, depigmentation serum.

19. * Comparator(s)/control.
Where relevant, give details of the alternatives against which the main subject/topic of the review will be compared (e.g. another intervention or a non-exposed control group). The preferred format includes details of both inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Any control. Ex. Placebo, microinjections.

20. * Types of study to be included.
Give details of the types of study (study designs) eligible for inclusion in the review. If there are no restrictions on the types of study design eligible for inclusion, or certain study types are excluded, this should be stated. The preferred format includes details of both inclusion and exclusion criteria.
All English-language full-text articles that report on microneedling or microneedling combined with another intervention, such as tranexamic acid, lasers, and platelet plasma, for the treatment of melasma are included. Eligible study designs include prospective cohort, randomized controlled trials (RCT), and quasi-randomized clinical trials. Included studies are required to be comparative, either through split-faced design or experimental and control group design.

Studies that used microinjections or radiofrequency microneedling are excluded. Studies using baseline as a comparison are excluded along with retrospective cohort, case-reports, case series, reviews, and grey literature.

21. * Main outcome(s).
Give the pre-specified main (most important) outcomes of the review, including details of how the outcome is defined and measured and when these measurement are made, if these are part of the review inclusion criteria.
Outcome = Melasma Area and Severity Index.

23. * Data extraction (selection and coding).
Describe how studies will be selected for inclusion. State what data will be extracted or obtained. State how this will be done and recorded.
In order to be included in the meta-analysis, studies have to provide the difference between Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) scores at baseline and endpoint for both the intervention and control groups or provide sufficient data for these values to be calculated. All variations of the MASI score (MASI and modified MASI) are accepted and directly compared. Studies using baseline as a comparison are excluded.

In the next step, the characteristics and results of the studies will be extracted. This will include demographic data of each of the studies (authors, country of origin, date of publication) and details of the study’s design (age range, number, and sex of participants, interventions in the control group and experimental arm). The difference in MASI scores (mean and standard deviation) of the intervention and control groups between baseline and endpoint for each of the studies will be extracted or calculated. If necessary, ImageJ will be used to estimate values from figures, and corresponding authors will be contacted for missing data. Data will be stored and compared using Excel Software in duplicates.

24. * Risk of bias (quality) assessment.
Describe the method of assessing risk of bias or quality assessment. State which characteristics of the studies will be assessed and any formal risk of bias tools that will be used.
The Cochrane risk of bias tool 2 (reference) will be used to assess the quality of the included studies. Studies of any risk of bias will be included in the meta-analysis, but separate analysis will be conducted with these studies excluded.

25. * Strategy for data synthesis.
Provide details of the planned synthesis including a rationale for the methods selected. This must not be generic text but should be specific to your review and describe how the proposed analysis will be applied to your data.
Review Manager Software (version 5.3) will be used. The DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model for the meta-analysis of continuous data will be applied. Results will be displayed as the mean difference between baseline and endpoint MASI scores for both the intervention and control groups, with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). In the pooled analysis, studies using systemic therapy, such as oral tranexamic acid, will be separated from studies using topical therapies, such as topical tranexamic acid. I² statistic will be used to asses heterogeneity across studies. Funnel plots will be used to assess for publication bias.

Procedural justice and identity: police officers' perceptions compared to civilians,"This study will sample from both police officers and civilians and replicate previous procedural justice research by relying on vignettes in which decision-making process are manipulated through the components of procedural justice. Participants will evaluate the fairness of the decision-making processes in vignettes of police-civilian interactions. The vignettes will expand on previous research on process-based policing by incorporating the police officer violating the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and searches the civilian without consent. This manipulation will also serve to examine the role of voice in evaluating police-civilian interactions, especially when constitutional rights are asserted or not. Three pilot studies were conducted to test manipulations of the procedural justice components individually to create the procedural justice and no procedural justice vignettes.
This study will answer the two research questions: through what mechanisms in the procedural justice framework do police officers, as compared to civilians, evaluate fairness in police-civilian interactions and does the extent of overlap between self- and social-identity mitigate the effect of role on evaluations of fairness. We expect to find that evaluations of fairness are predicted by procedural justice condition via indirect effects through the justice subscales for both the police and civilians. However, we expect the indirect effects to be different for police officers than for civilians and for those differences to be explained by a moderating effect of the extent to which the participants identify with the police versus their neighborhood. We expect that police officers who identify more closely with their neighborhood or community than with other police will evaluate fairness through the same mechanisms as civilians. However, police officers who identify more closely with the police than with their community will evaluate fairness through different mechanisms than civilian participants. We expect this moderation because participants both rely on and get identity information from procedural justice in police-civilian encounters (Blader &amp; Tyler, 2009; Leonardielli &amp; Min Toh, 2010; Oliveria &amp; Murphy, 2016).",hbsy7,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hbsy7/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Civilian participants will be recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and police officer participants will be recruited through the local police departments.

Cross-cultural differences in self-reported psychiatric traits,"Introduction
The field of psychological science regularly makes generalised claims about the prevalence of self-reported behavioural and psychiatric traits (and their relationships with biological and environmental factors), yet recruitment for studies investigating these claims is often limited to Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD, e.g. American, European) populations.1,2 It is increasingly evident that psychological findings based on Western populations may not generalise to other cultures. Indeed, prior work3 has demonstrated that individuals from Asian or Black backgrounds, relative to those from White backgrounds, tend to score higher on self-reported measures of psychological traits, including those assessing symptoms of OCD and anxiety.

Cultural issues with online psychology research
There has been rapid expansion in recent years of large-scale data collection via the use of online recruitment platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk). These platforms provide a quick and efficient method for amassing a large participant pool for psychological research. However, this research often relies on the assumption that online participants are drawn from the same distribution of cultural backgrounds. To the contrary, recent work has shown that of active MTurk ‘workers’ at a given time, there are likely equal numbers based in the US and India. While workers based in India are typically as educated as those in the US, the different locations have esoteric features45 To get around these documented issues, many researchers restrict recruitment to local samples, which ultimately reinforces WEIRD norms.

Cultural issues with online psychiatry research
There has been less psychiatry-specific online research, but it is now growing in popularity. While prior studies have suggested that the proportion of individuals who score above clinically significant cut-off scores for e.g. obsessive-compulsive symptoms appears similar across MTurk and other community samples,6 our recent work7 found that nearly 50% of an MTurk sample scored above clinical cut-off for OCD. Exploratory analyses suggested that this effect was driven by a striking distinct distribution of scores between East Coast US workers and Indian/Sri Lankan/Pakistani workers (with bimodality seen in the West Coast US which has the highest proportion of Asian migrants in America8). Indeed, while online samples are thought to be more representative of the general population compared to college student samples (another common recruitment pool for psychological studies)9, collectively this evidence suggests that many online psychological studies using self-report measures may promote a biased or confounded interpretation of results. It is therefore important to gain a clearer understanding of the cultural differences which may underpin differences in response style among online participants in psychological research. In this study, we therefore test a simple prediction from our prior exploratory analyses: that there is a striking difference in OCD symptom scales across specific Western and Asian samples.",p9jud,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/p9jud/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Procedure\nThe study will be completed online using gorilla.sc.

Communicating a range of possible values in an icon array in the context of a genetic report,"Icon arrays are a form of visualisation commonly used to illustrate risk probabilities as they apply to a population. For example, if roughly 12 out of 100 individuals undergoing a particular medical procedure can be expected to have a particular outcome, this can be illustrated on an icon array by highlighting 12 out of 100 icons (people, circles, boxes, etc.) in one colour, and the other 88 in another. 

While icon arrays are much used in healthcare visualisations due to the fact that one does not need to understand percentages or manipulate abstract numbers to get a sense of one’s risk at a glance, it is unclear how well they can communicate the concept of a range of possible risk probabilities. For example, in the East Midlands and East of England, the risk of cancer for carriers of BRCA pathogenic variants is commonly communicated as a range (e.g., 65%-79%) due to statistical uncertainty around the true level of risk. 

Our key hypotheses concern the degree to which different ways of communicating a range of risk probabilities are understood in this context. Specifically, we wish to test whether lay participants’ recall of the increased risk that accompanies a pathogenic BRCA variant is substantially improved (or impaired) by the inclusion of an icon array, using any of three different approaches to illustrating a risk range.",znjh9,True,False,Preregistration Template from AsPredicted.org,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/znjh9/contributors/?format=json,,[],y5fm6

Probing ovulatory cycle shifts in women’s preferences for men’s behaviors,"The existence of ovulatory cycle shifts in women’s mate preferences has been discussed controversially. There is evidence that naturally cycling women in their fertile phase, compared to their luteal phase, evaluate specific behavioral cues in men as more attractive for sexual relationships. However, recent research has cast doubt on these findings. We addressed this debate in a large, pre-registered within-subject study including salivary hormone measures and luteinizing hormone tests. One-hundred-fifty-seven female participants rated natural videos of 70 men in dyadic intersexual interactions on sexual and long-term attractiveness. Multilevel comparisons across two ovulatory cycles indicated that women’s mate preferences for men’s behaviors did not shift across the cycle, neither for competitive, nor for courtship behavior.

"Effects of Sex Steroids on the Sporting Performance of Transgender Individuals, with a focus on bone health, lung function and skeletal muscle physiology. A question of advantage or disadvantage?","In 2015, the IOC allowed Transgender Athletes to compete after 1 year of HRT and without SRS (1). A primary concern is that TW develop permanent physiological features that give them a performance advantage over cis-women. Prior research has focused primarily on observational studies with no or limited evidence of change in body composition (2) and bone (3). There is also a lack of data on MTFT lung function. The aim: track TW individuals during their HRT cycle to quantify changes in body composition, bone health, muscle fibre physiology and lung function to further clarify if TW individuals retain an advantage.

Research Focus: Distorted information,"In 2020 the new coronavirus COVID-19 spread around the globe, leading to a pandemic which killed thousands of people across countries. Multiple countries implemented unprecedent policies to stop its spread including harsh demands for physical distancing and increased hygienic behaviors. Although COVID-19 was not the first pandemic in human history, it was the first within the digital society and the world health organization (WHO) rapidly warned that the pandemic was accompanied by a large-scale ‘infodemic’—“an over-abundance of information –some accurate and some not –that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance” (Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov), 2020). Concerns were large that citizens confrontation with ‘polluted’ (Phillips &amp; Milner, forthcomming) misleading and purposefully distorted information in this environment could impair the global fight against the pandemic. 
The current study addresses this concern. Using the differential susceptibility to media effects model (Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2013) as theoretical framework and a random-quota survey of the German population as data base, we examined the role of socio-demographics, citizens generalized ideological attitudes (right-wing authoritarianism, conspiracy mentality, intolerance for uncertainty, extreme political leanings), their trust in information authorities, intolerance of uncertainty, as well as the influence of their personal involvement and news media use for their emotional response to the situation (corona-related state uncertainty), their exposure to and belief in distorted news about COVID-19 (medical and conspiracy-theoretical falsehoods), and their COVID-19 related behavior. 
Parts of the study formed the Master-thesis of the second author (Lara Kuhfeldt), which studied the role of uncertainty for conspiracy theories around the COVID-19 crisis.

Honesty in coin flipping tasks,"A task in economics to assess cheating is the “coin flip” or “die rolling” task.  Participants are asked to flip a coin (or roll a die), and they are paid for the reported number of Heads (or Tails) flipped or the die roll outcome.  Because the outcome of the coin flip(s) or die roll are private and known only to the subject, experimentalists use the statistical properties of a fair coin flip (e.g., 50% of the flips should be Heads and 50% Tails) to identify whether a sample of subjects is cheating—a sample reporting statistically higher numbers of Heads than 50% is deemed to be cheating.  This project seeks to test whether the addition of response times and coin flip order will enrich the predictive capacity of the coin flip task at validating whether dishonesty is occurring in the task.

Speed and force of simple motor reaction as the indicators of the analgesic placebo effect,"The correlation of the endogenous opioid relief or cannabinoid receptor activation and the appearance of the analgesic placebo effect is considered an important confirmation of the existence of the biological basis of the placebo effect. Such findings suggest that the analgesic placebo effect is a real physiological phenomenon since those physiological changes are most commonly connected to subjective pain estimates as a fundamental indicator of a placebo effect. The aim of this study was to test the effect of a placebo treatment to a) subjective estimates of the severity of a pain stimulation; b) objective measures of pain stimulate. However, studies showed that both the speed and the force of a simple motor reaction are correlated to the severity of the pain sensation. Thus the study aimed to test if the placebo treatment if it appeared at the level of subjective assessments, will be accompanied on both of those objective measures of the sensation.

"What mobilizes us more, gender equality or climate emergency? Social engagement, Zeitgeist, and social norms","The study will explore social engagement with two socially relevant causes, gender-equality and climate protection. The rationale for this comparative analysis is that, in spite of high importance of both issues for the society as a whole, there are observable differences in the extent to which they have mobilizing potential among the citizens. Thus, while gender-related social agenda have become powerful determinate of social and political practices and discourse, climate protection problem, although it is becoming more and more recognized as urgent and of extreme importance, is still addressed less by social and political actors. Therefore, the main goal of the study is to compare the levels of social engagement with each issue among the citizens, and also to examine the relative power of several predictors. Namely, we will analyse the role of social norms, the sense of moral obligation, self-identity, and past behaviour for social engagement. Additionally, we will explore whether the perceived salience of the issue in the society (which we call “zeitgeist”) will differ for the issues studied, and whether this perceived relevance will influence engagement.  
The research will be conducted among university students. It will focus on two sources of social norms among them. We will research whether perceived norms for gender equality social engagement are higher than norms perceived for the engagement with climate protection. This would reflect the normative pressure existing for each issue. In order to account for diverse sources of social influence, we will focus on two types of these sources. On the one hand, we will study descriptive and injunctive norms coming from the reference group. On the other hand, in order to analyse the role of the more immediate context, we will explore the role of perceived descriptive and injunctive norms existing at the university campus. In this context, we will also test whether the degree to which the campus represents the source of the reference group will moderate the impact of campus social norms on engagement. 
We will also study moral obligation and self-identity as determinants of engagement. Moral obligation and self-identity are established predictors of behaviour, and we expect them to predict social engagement in our study. Besides, and adopting the social interactionist perspective, we will test the idea that social interactions and social context, reflected in the measures of social norms, shape individual sense of moral obligation. Therefore, we will test our hypothesis that norms impact engagement directly, and also indirectly, via increased moral obligation to mobilize for the issue, and also via strengthened self-identity as an advocate for the cause.  
Finally, we will include past behaviour as the predictor of engagement. 
In addition, we will try to apply Jackson's (1975) return potential model (RPM) to quantify the social context in which normative forces are at work. This measurement of the normative environment includes capturing both the extremity and consensus associated with expressed opinions. We will calculate these two measures as applied to both, the reference group´s norms and the norms perceived at the campus. The “intensity” of a norm quantifies the degree of approval or disapproval for an opinion or a behavior. As described in Glynn, Huge, &amp; Lunney (2009), intensity is calculated by taking the deviation of each participant's score from the point of indifference (in our case, 3). Crystallization is calculated by taking the square root of the inverse of each respondent's absolute deviation from the mean approval rating among all respondents. Thus, crystallization of variable x for participant i is the square root of [1/(│x i−x mean│)]. Finally, the normative power is calculated by multiplying the normative intensity by crystallization.
The study has theoretical and applied interest. Regarding to its contribution to the theory, it will provide evidence on the relative and comparative impact of the variables that shape and predict social engagement. As regards its applied value, it will provide insights about the more effective way of promoting social engagement depending on the characteristics of the cause.

Protocol for a scoping review of national policies for healthy ageing in Mainland China from 2016 to 2020,"Background: There is strong political willingness to address healthy ageing in China with the first national policy with a focus on healthy ageing independently released by the Chinese Central Government in 2017. However, there remains limited literature to understand all national polices related to healthy ageing in China over the last five-year planning cycle, from 2016 to 2020. This scoping review will systematically map national policies for healthy ageing in mainland China from 2016 to 2020.

Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis: Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) will be used to guide the proposed study. A complete search for healthy ageing-related policy documents satisfying the eligibility criteria will be performed in all departments affiliated to the State Council of China and relevant websites of English and Chinese grey literature. Essential information from all eligible policy documents will be extracted and mapped to a pre-defined two-dimensional framework generated from the World health Organization’s health system building blocks and Rothwell and Zegveld’s innovation policy instrument.

Discussions: It is anticipated that the results of this study will provide an in-depth overview of national policies of healthy ageing issued between 2016 and 2020 in Mainland China, and aid identification of strengths and gaps in healthy ageing policy response. Findings may facilitate policy makers to optimize the policy formulation related to healthy ageing and realign the national health system to better support the needs of the older population.

Investigation of the chronic inflammatory response to resistance training will aid understanding of how exercise modality effects changes in inflammation, and the potential for resistance training to be used as a prevention or treatment intervention to combat chronic disease. Therefore, the aims of this study are to: 1) determine the effect of resistance training compared to a no exercise control on chronic inflammation (measured by changes in concentrations of CRP, TNF-a and IL-6) in adults, through systematic review, 2) determine whether the relationship between resistance training and chronic inflammation is influenced by the presence of chronic disease. We hypothesise that: 1) resistance training will elicit consistent reductions in chronic inflammation (CRP, TNF-a and IL-6) in adults compared to a control group, 2) resistance training will stimulate greater improvements of chronic inflammation in those with chronic diseases than healthy adults when compared to a control.",xastp,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xastp/contributors/?format=json,,[],9xktr

"The Effect of Mechanical Stimulation, i.e. Exercise on Bone Health in Patients and Survivors of Hematological Malignancies:","Due to the disease, pharmacological treatments and modified lifestyle, the musculoskeletal system of patients and survivors of bone marrow-related hematological malignancies can be severely impaired, even years after complete remission. These adverse effects range from low bone mineral density (BMD), diminished bone microstructure and/or muscle weakness to, more severely, clinical osteoporosis with vertebral compaction or even osteonecrosis. 
Physical or mechanical stimulation, for example in the form of exercise has been shown to beneficially impact  bone health in osteoporotic as well as in healthy individuals, which leads to the following question: “Do mechanical stimulation interventions benefit bone health and quality(BMD) in bone marrow-related hematological malignancies?""

Investigating affective cognitive control and its effect on mental health and well-being in care-experienced young people compared to their peers,"There is extensive evidence that care-experienced young people have poorer mental health than their peers, attributed at least partly to early, often prolonged, exposure to maltreatment. However, there has been little exploration of the mechanisms that may link these experiences to their mental health outcomes, limiting knowledge of potential intervention targets. In this study we focus on the potential role of affective control, a core cognitive building block associated with emotion regulation and mental health outcomes. We will explore three key questions: (i) whether care-experienced young people have poorer affective control than sex and age-matched peers; (ii) whether the affective control of care-experienced young people is associated with broad internalising and externalising problems, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and school well-being; (iii) whether associations between affective control and these emotional and school well-being outcomes are partially explained by emotion regulation capacity. We aim to recruit 71 care-experienced young people aged 11-18, which will be compared to data already collected from young people at secondary school. Participants will complete a battery of computer-based tasks and questionnaires. This is comprised of three experimental tasks measuring affective control ability, a brief standardised IQ test and validated questionnaires measuring internalising and externalising problems, post-traumatic stress symptoms, school well-being and emotion regulation.",qjvda,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/qjvda/contributors/?format=json,,"['care-experienced', 'mental health', 'PTSD', 'transdiagnostic']",fk7vq

The effects of a temporal framing manipulation on environmentalism: A replication and extension,"Baldwin and Lammers (2016) recently published a program of research demonstrating that conservatives are more susceptible to pro-environmental messages that are past-focused compared to the same messages when framed as future-focused. In their third study, they showed participants a series of images comparing pristine and degraded environments to induce past and future temporal focus in the participants. These were labelled to depict changes from the current state of the environment to how it used to be (demonstrating pristine environments of the past, i.e., past-focused manipulation), or how it will be in the future (demonstrating degraded natural environments of the future, i.e., future-focused manipulation). Their research showed that past-focused comparisons attenuated the negative effect of political conservatism (measured with a single item liberal to conservative scale) on environmental attitudes (measured with the New Ecological Paradigm). That is, political conservatism was a weaker predictor of environmental attitudes among those who first viewed past-focused comparisons. 

In an effort to replicate and extend on their research, we conducted a study in 2019 among participants based in the United States recruited via crowdsourcing site Prolific. We presented participants with the same image-pairs as seen in Study 3 of Baldwin and Lammers (2016). However, we aimed to extend their work to test whether the temporal framing effect extended to increases in other forms of environmentalism, such as increased willingness to engage in pro-environmental action (measured using Liu and Sibley’s (2012) willingness to sacrifice scale), support for climate change policy (measured using Bateman &amp; O’Connor’s (2016) policy support scale), and/or belief in climate change. We also employed a multidimensional measure of political ideology, measuring this construct with social dominance orientation (using Ho et al.’s (2015) SDO7 scale), and testing the utility of the two dimensions of SDO (Dominance and Anti-egalitarianism) in place of the single item political orientation measure. 

Our preliminary analyses found differences in responses by condition across the political spectrum only for perceived certainty that climate change is happening. Specifically, while those with a more liberal political orientation were equally certain that climate change is happening, regardless of framing condition, those who were more conservative reported greater certainty after viewing the past comparisons. However, this interaction did not replicate for the other three environmental-outcome measures we included, despite more than doubling Baldwin and Lammers’ (2016) sample size (from 200 participants to just over 500 participants). We had planned to test several potential explanations for the temporal framing effect, such as differences in perceived certainty that the environmental changes have or will occur. However, in the absence of a significant interaction between political orientation and framing condition, comprehensive tests of these explanations were not possible. As an initial exploratory test of these explanations, we regressed political orientation, framing condition, and the interaction term on two explanatory variables (certainty ratings and temporal distance). We found that political orientation and temporal framing condition interacted only to predict certainty ratings, with individuals identifying as moderately to very conservative significantly more certain that the environmental changes depicted have occurred (i.e., if they were in the past-focused condition), than they will occur (future-focused condition).

This study will follow up on possible reasons for the failure to replicate Baldwin and Lammers (2016) finding of a temporal framing interaction with political orientation. From our exploratory analyses, we propose that there may be four potential reasons as to why the effect did not replicate in our study, which we outline below: 

1.	In our first study, we asked participants to rate the likely causes of environmental changes in the photo pairs, while Baldwin and Lammers asked the extent that each image demonstrated the effects of climate change. Using a similar temporal framing approach, Lammers and Baldwin (2018) eliminated the temporal framing effect when asking people to carefully evaluate their framed message, suggesting that this engages a different kind of processing style (central, rather than peripheral) that inoculates participants from the effects of the frame. It is possible that asking participants to rate causes engages a similar level of scepticism and/or inoculation, hence erasing the effect. To test this possible explanation, in addition to the temporal focus manipulation (past- versus future-comparisons), this study will also include a cover story manipulation, where participants are randomly assigned to either rate the causes of the depicted environmental changes (as in our study) or the extent they depict the effects of climate change (as in Baldwin &amp; Lammers). 

2.	Another explanation for our non-replication is that we employed different outcome measures. Baldwin and Lammers (2016) used the new environmental paradigm scale, which is the most widely used measure of pro-environmentalism. Based on criticisms of the scale (e.g. whether it measures attitudes, beliefs, values, or a worldview), our first study instead included a host of different environmental variables that were specifically related to climate change. We note that some framing effects do not extend to other forms of environmentalism (e.g. Levine &amp; Kline, 2017), and therefore we include the same new environmental paradigm scale from Baldwin and Lammers in this study to test whether the effect replicates on the same outcome measure. This is in addition to the other outcome variables included in our first study (climate change belief, certainty that climate change is happening, willingness to make sacrifices for the environment, climate change policy support, and agreement to sign a petition). To control for possible order effects, we will randomise the presentation of these outcome variables. 

3.	Another aim of our first study was to replicate the temporal framing effect with a multidimensional measure of political ideology. Specifically, some work suggests that the anti-egalitarian dimension/factor of social dominance orientation (SDO-E) is particularly relevant in predicting environment-relevant attitudes (Stanley et al., 2017) when compared to the dominance dimension/factor (SDO-D). In our exploratory analyses, we put SDO-E in place of political orientation, and when doing so we did replicate the interaction with condition on both climate change certainty and policy support. In this study, we expand the focus on the influence of more foundational attitudes towards how the world ought to be structured (SDO) and controlled (right-wing authoritarianism; RWA). To build on the exploratory findings that replicated the effect across SDO-E, this study will include a measure of right-wing authoritarianism, which is another ideological component underlying both political attitudes and predicting lower levels of pro-environmental attitudes and climate change belief (e.g. Häkkinen &amp; Akrami, 2014; Schultz &amp; Stone, 1994).

4.	Finally, although we took care to sample from the same target population as Baldwin and Lammers (i.e., those based in the United States), the political context has changed since the original study was conducted. When Baldwin and Lammers asked participants to think to the past, they did so at a time when the Democratic Party was in charge. Our data were collected under the Trump administration, who campaigned on a return to the past (e.g. “Make America Great Again”), and so it is possible that past comparisons are no longer effective for conservatives under this context as they have already returned to their ‘desired’ past. Given this, the study proposed below will recruit participants from the United Kingdom.",v97jc,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/v97jc/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'We will recruit participants via the online recruiting platform Prolific.

* Measures of effect

Risk estimates: Incidence rate ratio, Hazard ratio, and Odds ratio.

18. * Data extraction (selection and coding).

Two independent reviewers (AB and HL) will extract the study characteristics and results in duplicate. Extracted study characteristics will include information on the authors, publication date, country, study design, data sampling dates, ethnicity of population, number of participants, and adjusted factors in the analysis. The extracted results will include risk estimates, such as Odds ratio, Hazard ratio, incidence rate ratio, and their 95% confidence intervals. Authors will be contacted for data, if required.

19. * Risk of bias (quality) assessment.

The risk of bias for each study will be determined using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.

20. * Strategy for data synthesis.

Review Manager Software, version 5.3 (Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collaboration) will be used to conduct the meta-analysis when three or more studies provide useable data for an outcome. The meta-analysis will be conducted using the Der Simonian–Laird random-effects model, to account for heterogeneity between studies, and effect estimates will be combined using generic inverse variance method. Risk ratios (RR), incidence rate ratios, or hazard ratios will be pooled as they will be considered relative measures of risk for cohort studies. Risk estimates will be reported through odds ratios (OR) for case-control studies. Case-control studies and cohort studies will be analyzed separately given differences in study design. Risk estimates will be combined to estimate the risk of MACEs in both the cohort and case-control studies. The pooled analysis of less than three studies will be presented only for qualitative interpretation. Heterogeneity will be assessed using the I² statistic, and an I² greater than 50% will be considered substantial heterogeneity. Funnel plots will be used to assess for publication bias. P&lt;0.05 will be considered significant.

21. * Analysis of subgroups or subsets.

Subgroup analysis will be performed for MI, CVA, and cardiovascular-associated death.

Trolls Psyc 2017,"The Dark Tetrad is made up of four different personalities: Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and sadism. We encounter these personalities every day; the Machiavellian who has tricked you into giving something up, the narcissist who constantly brags about themselves, the subclinical psychopath who has physically hurt you, and the sadist who hurts people for fun. Cyberbullying is prominent in today’s society, as well as other online behaviors such as trolling. Trolling involves being deceptive online for no reason and towards people the person doesn’t know, and tricking people into humiliating themselves (Buckels, Trapnell, &amp; Paulhus, 2014). Online trolls are individuals who partake in deceptive, destructive, or disruptive behavior in a social setting on the Internet with no apparent instrumental purpose (Buckels, Trapnell &amp; Paulhus, 2014). There are many possible predictors of social media trolling behavior, specifically psychosocial disorders. As these individuals have no apparent purpose, we need an explanation for the behavior displayed by these online trolls is searched for. With research, one can gain an understanding of these behaviors. To begin to conduct research in order to understand trolling behaviors, one has to understand why these behaviors are prevalent in certain individuals. Research also indicates that those who are narcissists and those with antisocial personality disorder use social media more often than others (Rosen, Whaling, Rab, Carrier &amp; Cheever, 2013). An online “troll” is a separate personality related entity, and in order to understand this identity, one must understand the self- presentation that’s goes into its construction (Fox &amp; Rooney, 2015).

 

The behavior displayed by trolls over the Internet can not only give a lot of insight into the psychosocial disorders an individual may or may not possess or develop, but can also have severe effects on the individual on the receiving end of the trolls’ malicious behavior. By understanding the psychosocial predictors of social media trolling, the online behavior may be prevented along with its substantial and negative consequences to its victims (Howard, Zolnierek, Critz, Dailey &amp; Ceballos, 2019). There is a relationship believed to be between the Big Five personality traits, Dark Triad traits, and sadism with bullying and/ or cyberbullying (van Geel, Goemans, Toprak &amp; Vedder, 2017).If there is a relation between theses personality disorders and cyberbullying, as well as with increased social media use, then the negative behavior of online trolls can be predicted and prevented. This would solve the issue of the negative consequences trolling can have, while addressing the psychosocial disorder the ‘troll’ is experiencing. Understanding the meaning of an online “troll” and what traits they possess can also help society establish constructs of identity, as traits from the Dark Triad can manifest in both trolls and victims (Linton &amp; Power, 2013).",sz2vx,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/sz2vx/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': ""Two large samples of participants will be recruited from the US on Amazon's Mechanical Turk website (MTurk; http://www.mturk.com) and students from a psychology department at Louisiana State University.

To intervene or not to intervene? How parents’ beliefs influence their agreement with achievement-related parenting practices,"Previous research has identified parents as having an important influence on children's achievement motivation, particularly through what they say (e.g., the praise they give their children when they succeed) and do (e.g., whether or not they intervene when their child experiences academic difficulty).

Moral Growth Mindset is Associated with Change in Voluntary Service Engagement,"Incremental implicit theories are associated with a belief regarding it is possible to improve one’s intelligence or ability through efforts. Previous studies have demonstrated that incremental implicit theories contributed to better academic achievement and positive youth development. Our study aimed to examine whether incremental implicit theories of morality significantly influenced change in students’ engagement in voluntary service activities. In our study, 54 Korean college students for Study 1 and 180 Korean 8th graders for Study 2 were recruited to conduct two two-wave studies. We surveyed participants’ implicit theories of morality and participation in voluntary service activities. The effect of implicit theories of morality on change in service engagement was analyzed through regression analysis. In Study 1, the moral growth mindset significantly moderated longitudinal change in service engagement. In Study 2, the moral growth mindset significantly influenced engagement in art-related activities, while it significantly moderated change in engagement in youth-related activities.",ac6rh,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ac6rh/contributors/?format=json,,"['Growth mindset', 'Implicit theories', 'Prosocial motivation', 'Voluntary service engagement']",4bky3

Families amidst COVID-19 - How stressful is the situation for parents and their children?,"Nurseries, kindergartens, and schools are shut down until further notice in many countries. Many parents are forced to work from home and are additionally burdened by home-schooling and supervising their children full-time next to their regular workload and managing the household. Furthermore, there is the fear of the future, financially struggling, and health-related anxiety that stresses many people. COVID-19 affects the life of parents worldwide. Therefore, we would like to assess how the experience and the behaviour of parents and their children are affected by the current corona pandemic. Using an online questionnaire we want to evaluate the magnitude of stress in the parent-child system (using the German version of the Parenting Stress Index; EBI; Tröster, 2010) and identifying the frequency of conflicts in the family (FKS, Familien-Klima-Skalen, Engfer, Schneewind, Klaus, Hinderer, 1977). Besides, we would like to asses how everyday life of children in social-distancing times is influenced (occupations, worries, what they look forward to after Corona). We are particularly interested in the progression of those variables over time. We, therefore, plan to contact the parents once a week and answer the same questions.

COVID-19 &amp; Discrimination,"According to Bushman (2020), words matter, especially the words we use to describe a deadly virus. Calling COVID-19 the ""Chinese virus"" is a disturbing example of classical conditioning theory, which was discovered by Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936). Pavlov won a Nobel Prize in 1904 for his research on the role of saliva in digestion, but that is not what he is most famous for. Pavlov was studying digestion in dogs, and he noticed that the dogs started salivating at the mere sight of the food pail. Pavlov tested whether other stimuli (e.g., hearing the sound of a bell) could also be associated with food, and found similar effects. Based on his findings, Pavlov developed classical condition theory.

Classical conditioning theory begins with the premise that an unconditioned stimulus (e.g., food) will produce an unconditioned response (salivation). The neutral stimulus (e.g., the sight of a food pail, sound of a bell) initially does not produce any response. Through repeated pairing, however, the neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus, which can produce the same response as the unconditioned stimulus, called a conditioned response.

In this example, the unconditioned stimulus is the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which produces the unconditioned response of negative feelings (e.g., fear, panic). The neutral stimulus is China. But repeatedly pairing China with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by calling it the ""Chinese virus"" may make China a conditioned stimulus. The net result is that calling coronavirus disease (COVID-19) the ""Chinese virus"" can produce negative feelings toward people from China and other East Asian countries.",z42r9,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/z42r9/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Data will be collected by a research firm (Dynata); they will conduct recruitment using their online panels.

 Functional Brain Connectivity and Inhibition Control in Older Adults  ,"I will investigate the relationship between the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of inhibition networks, which includes the executive network of the attentional systems (Petersen &amp; Posner, 2012), and the salience network (Seeley et al., 2007) and behavioral measures of inhibition control. I will be conducting a secondary data analysis of approximately 200 healthy aging individuals, whose data was made available by the Alzheimer’s Disease Center at the University of Kansas Medical Center. The goal of my thesis is to examine the relationship between neuroimaging and behavioral measures of these inhibition networks. My secondary focus will be to examine how this relates to aging among an aging population. I expect to bridge the gap in literature regarding inhibition and healthy aging. The inhibition deficit hypothesis states that, “older adults are less able to suppress or ignore irrelevant thoughts and actions than young adults are” (Rey-Mermet &amp; Gade, 2017). However, results from studies have revealed mixed results, with a meta-analysis by Rey-Mermet and Gade (2017) questioning the generalizability of the hypothesis.

Sport and pelvic floor dysfunction in male and female athletes: A scoping review protocol,"BACKGROUND. Pelvic floor dysfunction is a term used to describe a variety of symptoms, signs and conditions involving different impairments on the pelvic floor muscles. 
The existing literature suggests that sport has many health benefits. However, some of these lead to a higher risk of developing pelvic floor dysfunction. No study and review have been conducted to map the entire phenomena in the sport population.
The objective of this scoping review is to summarize the literature to identify the available evidence of pelvic floor dysfunction among male and female athletes. 
INCLUSION CRITERIA. Any female and male athletes of any age with pelvic floor dysfunction. Any sports, performance level and dysfunctions will be included. Any context will be considered for inclusion. 
METHODS. This scoping review will be performed in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, Scopus, CINHAL, Embase and PEDro database will be searched from inception to March 2020. Additional records will be identified through searching in grey literature and the reference lists of all relevant studies. No study design, publication type, data and language restrictions will be applied. 
Two reviewers will independently screen all abstracts and full-text studies for inclusion. A data collection form will be developed by the research team to extract the characteristics of the studies included. A tabular and accompanying narrative summary of the information will be provided.
CONCLUSIONS. This will be the first scoping review to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic. The results will add meaningful information for clinicians especially during the patient’s assessment. Furthermore, any knowledge gaps of the topic will be identified. The results of this research will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and will be presented at relevant (inter)national scientific events.

Safety and effectiveness of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune globulin for people with COVID-19: a rapid review,Systematic Review,dwf53,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dwf53/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\nTypes of studies\nTo assess the benefits and safety of convalescent plasma for the therapy of COVID-19 we plan to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only, as such trials, if performed appropriately, currently give the best evidence for experimental therapies in highly controlled therapeutic settings. When RCT data are available, we will use the common methods recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019), as specified in the following description of the methods.\n\nIf there is insufficient evidence (very low-quality evidence or no evidence) available from RCTs to answer this review\'s questions we will include prospective controlled non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), including quasi-randomised controlled trials (e.g. assignment to treatment by alternation or by date of birth), controlled before-and-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. In that case, we will use the methods proposed in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions for the inclusion of NRSIs in systematic reviews (Reeves 2017).\n\nIf there is insufficient evidence (very low-quality evidence or no evidence) available from RCTs and NRSIs we will include prospective observational studies with a control group and will adapt the methods for the inclusion of NRSIs in systematic reviews as specified by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions as well (Reeves 2017).\n\nIf there is no evidence from RCTs, NRSIs, and prospective observational studies, we will include prospective non-comparative study designs (e.g. case series). In that case, we will follow the common suggestions specified in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019), as far as possible, and apply methodology outlined in the following protocol sections. We will only consider studies including 1\xa0or more participants with COVID-19.\n\nWe will include full-text publications, abstract publications, and results published in study registries, if sufficient information is available on study design, characteristics of participants, interventions and outcomes. There will be no limitation with respect to the length of follow-up.\n\nTypes of participants: \nWe will include individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, with no age, gender or ethnicity restrictions.\n\nWe will exclude trials including populations with other coronavirus diseases (SARS or MERS).\xa0We will also exclude trials including populations with mixed virus diseases (e.g. influenza), unless the trial authors provide subgroup data for people with COVID-19.\xa0\n\nTypes of interventions:\nWe will include the following main comparison for studies with a control arm.\n\nConvalescent plasma versus standard care or placebo\nConvalescent plasma therapy versus control treatment, for example, drug treatments (e.g. but not limited to hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir ). Cointerventions will be allowed, but must be comparable between intervention groups\nConvalescent plasma therapy versus hyperimmune globulin\nHyperimmune globulin versus standard care or placebo\nHyperimmune globulin versus control treatment, for example, drug treatments (e.g. but not limited to hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir). Cointerventions will be allowed, but must be comparable between intervention groups\nWe are not expecting a large body of evidence as informed by scoping of this topic area. However, if we encounter an unexpected larger volume, we may be decide during conduct to limit the review to a subset of comparisons, for feasibility.\n\nTypes of outcome measures\nWe will evaluate core outcomes as pre-defined by the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials Initiative for Covid-19 patients (COMET 2020).\nPrimary outcomes: \nAll-cause mortality at hospital discharge\nTime to death\n\nSecondary outcomes: \nNumber of participants with grade 3 and grade 4 adverse events, including potential relationship between intervention and adverse reaction (e.g. transfusion‐related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion‐transmitted infection, transfusion‐associated circulatory overload (TACO), transfusion‐associated dyspnoea (TAD), acute transfusion reactions)\nNumber of participants with serious adverse events\nImprovement of clinical symptoms, assessed through need for respiratory support at up to 7 days; 8 to 15 days; 16 to 30 days\nOxygen by mask or nasal prongs\nOxygen by NIV or high flow\nIntubation and mechanical ventilation\nMechanical ventilation\nECMO.\nIf doable resources permit, we will also include the following secondary outcomes:\xa0\n\n30-day and 90-day mortality\nAdmission on the intensive care unit\nLength of stay on the intensive care unit\nTime to discharge from hospital\nTiming of outcome measurement\nFor time-to-event outcomes, such as mortality, discharge from hospital, and improvement of clinical symptoms, we will include outcome measures representing the longest follow-up time available.\n\nAll other outcome categories will be included for the observational periods which were reported in the study publications. We will include those adverse events occurring during active treatment as well as long-term adverse events. If sufficient data are available, we will group the measurement time points of eligible outcomes, for example, adverse events and serious adverse events, into those measured directly after treatment (up to 7 days after treatment), medium-term outcomes (15 days\xa0after treatment) and longer-term outcomes (over 30 days\xa0after treatment).\n\nSearch methods for identification of studies\nWe will adapt search strategies from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Lefebvre 2019).\xa0 We will search for studies in all languages in order to limit language bias. However, we\xa0will prioritise articles in\xa0languages that our review team can accommodate (these are: English, Dutch, German, French, Italian, Malay, Spanish). We will not seek for translators via Cochrane Task Exchange for this version of the review. We will tag all references\xa0in additional languages as ""awaiting classification"" and will seek for translators via Cochrane Task Exchange in an update of this review.\xa0\xa0\n\nElectronic searches\nSearch strategies for electronic databases will be adapted from those suggested in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Lefebvre 2019). In this emerging field, we expect that at least the abstract will be in English. In case of studies published in other languages, we will involve Cochrane Task Exchange to identify people within Cochrane to translate these studies.\n\nAs publication bias might influence all subsequent analyses and conclusions, we will search all potential relevant trial registries in detail to detect ongoing as well as completed studies, but not yet published studies. Nowadays, it is mandatory to provide results at least in the study registry. In case results are not published elsewhere, we will extract and analyse these data.\n\nWe will search the following databases and sources, from 2019 onwards:\n\nDatabases of medical literature:\nWHO COVID-19 Global Research Database (https://search.bvsalud.org/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/advanced/?lang=en),\xa0see file attached\nMEDLINE (Ovid, 2019\xa0to present),\xa0see file attached\nEmbase (Ovid, 2019\xa0to present),\xa0see file attached\nPubMed (for epublications ahead of print only),\xa0see file attached\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article Database (downloaded April 13, 2020), see file attached\n\nStudy registries and registry platforms to identify ongoing studies and results of completed studies:\nCochrane COVID-19 Study Register (https://covid-19.cochrane.org/),\xa0see file attached\nClinicalTrials.gov - Covid-19 Subset,\xa0see file attached\nWHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) -\xa0Covid-19 Subset,\xa0see file attached\n\nData collection\nSelection of studies\nTwo review authors will independently screen the results of the search strategies for eligibility for this review by reading the abstracts using Covidence software (Covidence 2016). We will code the abstracts as either \'retrieve\' or \'do not retrieve\'. In the case of disagreement or if it is unclear whether we should retrieve the abstract or not, we will obtain the full-text publication for further discussion. Two review authors will assess the full-text articles of selected studies. If the two review authors are unable to reach a consensus, we will consult a third review author to reach a final decision Lefebvre 2019.\n\nWe will document the study selection process in a flow chart, as recommended in the PRISMA statement (Moher 2009), and will show the total numbers of retrieved references and the numbers of included and excluded studies. We will list all articles that we excluded after full-text assessment and their reasons for exclusion in a \'Characteristics of excluded studies\' table.\n\nData extraction and management\nAll extractions and assessments will be performed by one author.\xa0A second author will\xa0verify the accuracy and (where applicable) the plausibility of extractions and assessment.\n\nOne review author\xa0will assess eligible studies obtained in the process of study selection (as described above) for methodological quality and risk of bias.\xa0\n\nOne review author\xa0will extract data using a standardised data extraction form developed in Covidence (Covidence). Data extraction will be conducted according to the guidelines proposed by Cochrane. If the review authors are unable to reach a consensus, we will consult a third review author.\xa0\n\nWe will collate multiple reports of one study so that the study, and not the report, is the unit of analysis.\n\nWe will extract the following information.\n\nGeneral information: author, title, source, publication date, country, language, duplicate publications\nQuality assessment: (as specified in the Assessment of risk of bias in included studies section)\nStudy characteristics: trial design,\xa0setting and dates, source of participants, inclusion/exclusion criteria, comparability of groups, treatment cross-overs, compliance with assigned treatment, length of follow-up\nParticipant characteristics: age, gender, ethnicity, number of participants recruited/allocated/evaluated, disease, severity of disease, additional diagnoses, previous treatments (e.g. experimental drug therapies, oxygen therapy, ventilation)\nInterventions: convalescent plasma therapy or hyperimmune globulin therapy, concomitant therapy, duration of follow-up\nFor studies including a control group: comparator (type)\nOutcomes:\xa0\nPrimary outcomes:\nAll-cause mortality at hospital discharge\nTime to death\nSecondary outcomes:\nNumber of participants with grade 3 and grade 4 adverse events, including potential relationship between intervention and adverse reaction (e.g. transfusion‐related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion‐transmitted infection, transfusion‐associated circulatory overload (TACO), transfusion‐associated dyspnoea (TAD), acute transfusion reactions)\nNumber of participants with serious adverse events\nImprovement of clinical symptoms, assessed through need for respiratory support at up to 7 days; 8 to 15 days; 16 to 30 days\n30-day and 90-day mortality\nAdmission on the intensive care unit\nLength of stay on the intensive care unit\nTime to discharge from hospital\n\nAssessment of risk of bias in included studies\nRandomised controlled trials\nWe will use the Risk of Bias 2.0 (RoB 2) tool to analyse the risk of bias in the underlying study results (Sterne 2019). Of interest for this review is the effect of the assignment to the intervention (the ITT effect) and we will perform all assessments with RoB 2 on this effect. The outcomes that will be addressed are those specified for inclusion in the GRADE Summary of Findings tables. Accordingly, the outcomes will be prioritised based on close communication with patient representatives.\n\nOne review author will\xa0assess the risk of bias for each study result.\xa0A second author will\xa0verify the accuracy and the plausibility. In case discrepancies among their judgements arise or they are unable to reach consensus, we will consult a third review author\xa0to reach a final decision. We will assess the following types of bias as outlined in Chapter 8 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019).\n\nBias arising from the randomisation process.\nBias due to deviations from the intended interventions.\nBias due to missing outcome data.\nBias in measurement of the outcome.\nBias in selection of the reported result.\nTo address these types of bias we will used the signalling questions recommended in RoB 2 and make a judgement using the following options:\n\n\'yes\': if there is firm evidence that the question is fulfilled in the study (i.e. the study is at low or high risk of bias for the given the direction of the question)\n\'probably yes\': a judgement has been made that the question is fulfilled in the study (i.e. the study is at low or high risk of bias given the direction of the question).\n\'no\': if there is firm evidence that the question is unfilled in the study (i.e. the study is at low or high risk of bias for the given the direction of the question)\n\'probably no\': a judgement has been made that the question is unfilled in the study (i.e. the study is at low or high risk of bias given the direction of the question)\n\'no information\' if the study report does not provide sufficient information to allow any judgement\nWe will use the algorithms proposed by RoB 2 to assigns each domain one of the following levels of bias:\n\nLow risk of bias\nSome concerns\nHigh risk of bias\nSubsequently we will derive a risk of bias rating for each prespecified outcome in each study in accordance with the following suggestions:\n\n\'Low risk of bias\': The trial is judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains for this result\n\'Some concerns\': The trial is judged to raise some concerns in at least one domain for this result, but not to be at high risk of bias for any domain\n\'High risk of bias\': The trial is judged to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain for the result OR the trial is judged to have some concerns for multiple domains in a way that substantially lowers confidence in the results.\nNon-randomised controlled studies\nAs reported in the Types of studies section, we will include non-randomised studies if there is insufficient evidence from RCTs.\n\nOne review author\xa0will\xa0assess eligible studies for methodological quality and risk of bias (using the Risk Of Bias in Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool) (Sterne 2019). A second author will\xa0verify the accuracy and the plausibility. The quality assessment strongly depends upon information on the design, conduct and analysis of the trial. The two review authors will resolve any disagreements regarding the quality assessments by consulting a third review author until they reach a consensus.\n\nWe will assess the following domains of bias.\n\nBias due to confounding\nBias in selection of participants into the study\nBias in classification of interventions\nBias due to deviations from intended interventions\nBias due to missing data\nBias in measurement of outcomes\nBias in selection of the reported result\nFor every criterion we will make a judgement using one of five response options.\n\nYes\nProbably yes\nProbably no\nNo\nNo information\nNon-controlled prospectively planned trials\nAs specified in the Types of studies section we will only include non-controlled prospective studies if we do not identify any controlled studies.\n\nOne review author\xa0will assess eligible studies for methodological quality and risk of bias (using the \'Risk of bias\' assessment criteria for observational studies tool provided by the Cochrane Childhood Cancer Group (seeTable 1).\xa0A second author will\xa0verify the accuracy and the plausibility.

Aversive Racism and Social Distancing,"In the present socio-political environment in many countries, individuals are aware that racial prejudice may result in social censure, and thus often attempt to suppress the expression of such prejudice. In situations where discriminatory behaviour would be clearly attributable to prejudice – such as in recruitment decisions about candidates who are obviously strong or obviously weak – prejudiced people still avoid biased decisions. However, in situations where biased decisions can be attributable to other factors, biased decisions are more likely to occur (Dovidio &amp; Gaertner, 2000).

We argue that in the present social climate, wherein social distancing measures give individuals blanket sanction to avoid other people, individuals higher with less positive interracial attitudes might be more likely to exhibit racial prejudice in situations where the risk of contracting COVID-19 is intermediate (vs. low, or high).",qj63a,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/qj63a/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Participants will be recruited via three methods: 1) School of Psychology ‘participation points’ scheme; 2) volunteers recruited through social media (i.e., Facebook, Twitter); 3) volunteers recruited through websites where individuals choose to take part in psychological research for recreational and educational purposes (e.g., Social Psychology on the Net; Reddit, r/samplesize).

Templated from HUMANISTIC APPROACH TO PRINCIPAL’S LEADERSHIP  AND ITS IMPACTS IN CHARACTER EDUCATION STRENGTHENING,"Dear readers  Let me join this scientific group. I am a doctoral student in an education management study program. Currently, I am completing a dissertation. The article that I sent to be read by interested people aims to explore the role of educational leadership in implementing programs to strengthen character education in Indonesia. At present the Indonesian Ministry of Education assigns all schools from the level of early childhood education, elementary school, junior high school, and senior high school to intensify character education in schools. Based on research findings, schools in Indonesia have not yet implemented this program to the fullest. Weaknesses that occur because the principal has not found the suitability of the role with the character education program. Related to this weakness, we conducted research in two schools that have successfully implemented programs to strengthen character education.

"Linguistic form, causal explanations, and social essentialism","The current study will examine the effect of language and explanation on the development of children and adults’ essentialist beliefs about novel social categories. In particular, we will investigate the joint effects of generic vs. specific language about a category, and biological vs. social explanations of category properties on various indices of social cognition. This project intends to follow up on recent research by Noyes &amp; Keil (2019) that corroborates the effect of generic language on essentialist beliefs (whereby generic language increases essentialism; see Rhodes, Leslie, &amp; Tworek, 2012 and Leshin, Leslie, &amp; Rhodes, under review), but found that it does so only for biological properties. Here, we aim to clarify the relationship between generic language and essentialist beliefs by explicitly manipulating both the language (generic vs. specific) as well as the causal explanations (biological vs. social) provided for different properties. Additionally, since Noyes &amp; Keil (2019)’s project only included adults, we hope to illuminate the developmental trajectory of this phenomenon by including children in our study as well.

The emotional body and time perception: A replication of Sylvie Droit-Volet (2015),"The purpose of the experiment is two-fold. We are both partially replicating and modifying the experimental design from Droit-Volet &amp; Gil (2016) who examined the effects of emotional bodily expressions, without facial cues, on perception of time using a temporal bisection task. There will be two conditions to which a participant can be randomly assigned: one with the original images, and one with reduced outlines where the salient emotional expression has been removed. 

In the first condition design, if the originally recorded effect is reliable, we expect that the durations will be perceived as longer for the fearful stimulus and that the magnitude of the lengthening effect of fearful vs sad postures will increase with the duration range. Since the paper focused on fearful responses being the salient arousing emotion that was able to impact time perception relative to the low-arousal bodily presentation of sadness, this will be the only comparison that we test. The happy/sad condition will be removed since no effect was found and we want to have the highest statistical power for looking for the main effect. This is why the first condition in the study that we are conducting is only a partial replication. 

In the second condition design, we perform the same tests but with the reduced images. We hypothesize that we will get similar effects for the high-arousal vs low-arousal images since this difference in image complexity is preserved and we find the original paper’s neuroscientific explanation to be an unlikely cause with insufficient verification. We are also working under the assumption that the arousal of the original image, on average, correlates with the complexity of the blob image. This is because the fearful bodily expressions frequently showed more animation, resulting in greater image complexity, while sad images looked more linear.

We are neglecting to include two other components from the Droit-Volet &amp; Gil (2016): their Experiment 2 and the survey at the end of the image processing. The reason for not including their Experiment 2, showing that the effect increases with the duration, is that this component depends on the foundation of there being a reliable effect in the first place, which is the main focus of our experiment. Including it is therefore unnecessary to our primary goal, and although it might be interesting, would ultimately increase the duration of the experiment and limit the number of participants that we could pay and therefore the statistical power for the main effect. Our reasoning for not including the survey is that when using the blob-images for our second experimental condition, the goal is to prevent there from being a singular salient emotion that is perceivable in the bodily expression. By asking them about the emotion present in each image we worry that we will both increase the duration of the experiment and also weaken our own manipulation. We are therefore also removing the survey from our partial replication test of the fearful/sadness effect since we will not have a comparison. This is not a concern for us because in Droit-Volet &amp; Gil (2016) their survey demonstrated the robustness of emotional salience resulting from their stimuli selection process, and we followed guidelines that we believe are comparable if not stricter. We also conducted a separate survey to validate the production of our blob images with 20 participants that confirmed that the process had successfully destroyed any universal emotional salience in the body expression.

Moorean and evaluative incoherencies,"Expressivists in metaethics maintain that moral statements do not serve to describe the world, but that their function instead is to express that the speaker is in a certain conative or affective state of mind. 

The contrast between moral and non-moral statements is sometimes presented as the idea that, whereas non-moral statements express cognitive mental states such as belief, moral statements express non-cognitive mental states, such as approval. Moreover, the latter express non-cognitive states in the same way that non-moral statements express beliefs. This is Schroeder's 'Parity Thesis':

'[M]oral sentences are related to noncognitive, desire‐like states of mind in the same way that ordinary descriptive sentences are related to ordinary beliefs—they express them. (Schroeder, 2008, p. 3). 

The Parity Thesis makes a testable prediction: if moral assertions express non-cognitive attitudes in the same way that non-moral assertions express beliefs, then whatever relations hold between non-moral assertions and belief ascriptions should hold as well between moral assertions and ascriptions of the relevant non-cognitive attitudes. In particular, just as certain combinations of non-moral assertions and belief ascriptions generate so-called Moore paradoxes (1), similar combinations of moral assertions and ascriptions of non-cognitive attitudes ought to generate analogously unacceptable constructions (2).

(1) Murder is wrong but I don’t think it is wrong.
(2) Murder is wrong but I don’t disapprove of it.

Woods (2014) claims that this is not the case: sentences like (2) are not unacceptable in the same way that Moorean paradoxes are. He argues that this constitutes a major blow to the Parity Thesis. Woods, however, bases his claim that sentences like (2) are acceptable on his intuitions. But intuitions vary, and not everyone agrees with Woods on this score. 

The purpose of our study is to empirically test the acceptability of sentences like (2), and thereby provide empirical evidence that speaks to Wood's claim, the Parity Thesis, and the connection between moral language and non-cognitive attitudes that is the focus of much contemporary literature on metaethics and philosophy of language.

In a previous study, we tested the acceptability of constructions exactly like (2) (https://osf.io/vwekq/?view_only=d5281af405f54493a67cb3c2759d76ac). In this follow-up study, we will test the acceptability of the following variant of (2): 

(2') Murder is wrong, that's how I personally feel about it, but I don’t disapprove of it. 

The rationale behind this choice is the following: often, a sentence like 'murder is wrong' can have a so-called 'exocentric' interpretation, where the perspective or standards that matter for evaluating the sentence are not the speaker's, but someone else's. For example, an anthropologist commenting on the practices of a certain community could say 'murder is wrong' to describe the moral practices of that community, even if the anthropologist themself doesn't share that judgment. 

More importantly, under such exocentric use, it would make perfect sense to say something like (2): after all, if the speaker is speaking exocentrically and does not agree with the first conjunct, they could very well couple that with a denial of disapproving of murder. Thus, if a participant interprets the first conjunct of (2) exocentrically, then it should be rather easy to accept the whole construction as acceptable (perhaps the same thing applies to (1), but we are not sure about it). 

In order to control for this interpretation, and make sure that participants do not interpret a sentence like (2) exocentrically, we are adding the appositive phrase 'that's how I personally feel about it' throughout all the items.",cp5fn,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/cp5fn/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Participants will be recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk and will be paid $0.5 for the their participation, which will take 5 minutes of their time.

Therapeutic Relationships in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services: Feasibility and acceptability of a staff intervention for inpatient services,"Therapeutic alliance, or the relationship between professional and service user, has the greatest impact on treatment outcomes in mental health, over and above the specific mode or model of therapy (Duncan et al., 2010; Wampold, 2001). Particularly in child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS), the alliance between the child or family and staff on inpatient units is the key predictor of positive outcomes from admission (Green et al., 2007; Karver 2006; Shirk and Karver, 2003). Working in partnership with family members is essential to inpatient provision, although often complicated by the family’s own history with services and complex family dynamics (Gross &amp; Goldin, 2008).
Young people identify that relationships with staff can ease the experience of the admission (Street &amp; Svanberg, 2003a; 2003b) and they especially appreciate professionalism and expertise in the context of reciprocal engagement; making a ‘human connection’ (Sischy, 2006). The relationship between staff members and young people can contribute towards a therapeutic milieu that aids recovery even when young people struggle to access direct interventions, i.e. one-to-one therapy (Sergeant, 2009). Despite its importance, poor alliance is the main factor for ending therapeutic treatment (Garcia and Weisz, 2002), with various challenges to its development. Staff members suffer high levels of burnout (Johnson et al, 2012) and there are difficulties maintaining a skilled and sufficient workforce (Nixon, 2006). It is therefore essential that front-line professionals are well supported in managing these relationships (Ellis, 2016) in a way that is acceptable and feasible to them and the service. 
When working with young people especially, there is a need to navigate issues of power and control (Colton &amp; Pistrang, 2004) and manage the ‘push and pull’ of working with adolescents who have disrupted ways of relating to people due to their early relationships (Cross, 2016). The alliance is difficult for young people who have been maltreated (Eltz and Shirk, 1995) and the developmental trend toward increasing autonomy from adults can represent an additional obstacle (DiGiuseppe, Linscott, &amp; Jilton, 1996). 
Nursing staff are best placed to provide caring relationships, but interactions are often not therapeutic or guided by the psychological theory of relationships (Cameron, Kapur &amp; Campbell, 2005). There has been some progress in the adult service research field, with indications that clinical supervision can protect against staff burnout (Edwards et al., 2006) and psychologically-informed case discussions can enhance positive feelings towards service users and reduce staff self-blame (Berry et al., 2009). Team-based training to develop staff skills using psychological models can even improve service user engagement (Caruso et al., 2013). However, there is currently no well-evidenced intervention to support nursing staff to develop and manage the most important part of their work (Hartley, Raphael, Lovell, Berry, 2019). Moreover, prior preliminary work in the adult field has not taken into account the specific challenges of the CAMHS context outlined above, does not involve relationships with the wider family (‘carers’) and has not been developed with stakeholder involvement at its heart.

We therefore have created a theoretically-driven, tailored and stakeholder-informed intervention that will support the development and maintenance of helpful therapeutic relationships between nursing staff, young people and carers within inpatient CAMHS. the purpose of the current study will be to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of this staff-based intervention.",vr47z,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vr47z/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Setting\nThe setting is a general adolescent inpatient child and adolescent mental health ward.  \n\nParticipants\nThe main target for the intervention is nursing staff.

"In the preparation and administration of intravenous medicines, what are the best practice standards that healthcare professionals need to follow to ensure patient safety?","Abstract 

Introduction  

Intravenous therapy and medicines (IVTM) are the most common invasive interventions in use in healthcare. Prescribed IVTM play an essential role in the treatment of illness, management of chronic conditions and in maintaining health and wellbeing. The intravenous (IV) route is the administration of concentrated medications (diluted or undiluted) directly into peripherally or centrally inserted vascular access devices. Medication safety is a key priority and best practice standards are required to guide the safe preparation and administration of IVTM.  

Methods  

We will conduct a systematic review of the literature pertaining to the preparation and administration of intravenous therapy and medicines. Our search will include studies concerned with the preparation and/or administration of IVTM via peripheral or central vascular access devices. We will be guided by the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) in this review. Literature will include all trial designs, national/international guidelines, and expert consensus opinion made available in English from 2009 to present day. 

Conclusion  

We will synthesise the evidence concerning safe and effective preparation and administration of intravenous therapy and medicines to inform the development of a national guideline for healthcare professionals in Ireland. The availability of up-to-date, contemporaneous evidence-based practice standards will ensure quality and safety for service-users.",u3jbw,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/u3jbw/contributors/?format=json,,[],jwpvr

All data was collected through the online program Second Life (SL).This program allows users to create their own avatar (independent of how they actually look) and interact with other avatars controlled by people from around the world. In the current study, we used this platform as a means to assess social distancing from black avatars as a result of anti-black racism and how this experience affects the outgroup discomfort measures of the non-black users piloting black avatars.

During that time slot, a research assistant met the participant in the lobby and brought them into the lab. There, they sat at a computer with Second Life already on screen set to the virtual location, Frank’s Jazz Club. We chose this location because it is predominantly white and attracts many other Second Life users.

The effect of a daytime nap on memory consolidation of novel word learning in children,"Memory for novel words benefits from sleep, particularly from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and its features such as sleep spindles and slow oscillations.

How an “I don’t know” response option changes participants responses in the syllogistic reasoning task,"The psychology of reasoning investigates the cognitive processes driving human inferential mechanisms. In the syllogistic reasoning task, as a core domain of human reasoning research, participants are typically instructed to derive a conclusion from two quantified statements called the premises. The two premises each have one of four quantifiers, called moods, in their syllogistic combination: All (abbreviated by A), Some (I), None (E), and Some...not (O). The terms in the premises (the sets of entities) can be arranged in four different ways called figures. In combination, there are a total 64 different kinds of reasoning problems, one illustrated in the following example: 

All A are B.
Some B are C.
What, if anything, follows?

The task is to generate a response about the two unrelated terms, A and C, using one of the quantifiers (8 conclusions: e.g., “Some A are C”, “No C are A”, etc.) or to conclude that “no logically valid conclusion” – NVC for short – follows. Thus, in total, there are 9 different response options/ conclusions. Syllogisms where a conclusion with a quantifier logically follows are called valid and those were NVC is the logically correct response are called invalid syllogisms (which is the case in the given example).

In recent studies, we were able demonstrate that people greatly differ in their tendency to respond “NVC” (e.g., Ragni, Dames, Brand, &amp; Riesterer, 2019). It generally appears that participants interpret the “NVC” response option differently: For instance, while some participants seem to avoid this response option (possibly feeling uncomfortable concluding that one can infer nothing given two premises), others appear to assign it a meaning of “I give up” and use it frequently instead. From a diagnostical view, this is highly problematic: The way the syllogistic reasoning task is currently designed and used, individuals’ interpretations of a response option differ, thus, contaminating the actual measure of interest (individuals’ reasoning processes or abilities). This is particularly problematic in view of the fact that about two thirds of the 64 syllogism schemes do not allow for a logical conclusion, i.e. NVC is the logically correct answer. Thus, in many cases the logically correct answer coincides with the answer that is often chosen when respondents give up or avoid the NVC response options. This observation immediately raises the question whether an additional opt-out response option (e.g., “I tried my best, but I could not find a conclusion”) would solve this issue and provide a better estimation of participants’ actual reasoning processes.

The current experiment investigates this question by presenting half of the participants with only the 9 possible conclusions (control group) and the other half with an opt-out response option in addition to the classic 9 conclusions (experimental group).",x6d25,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x6d25/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Participants are recruited via a local web-based study participation platform where participants can sign up for studies they qualify for on the system.

The effectiveness of stress regulation interventions with athletes: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials,"Existing stress-regulation interventions in the sporting field target components of the stress process including: stressors (i.e., a demanding or challenging event that elicits a stress response; see Kerr &amp; Goss, 1996), appraisals (i.e., cognitive evaluation of the potential of the situation to cause harm to functioning; see Larsson, Cook, &amp; Starrin, 1988), affective responses (i.e., the emotional state of an individual following an event; see Wojcikiewicz &amp; Orlick, 1987), and/or coping efforts put in place (i.e., cognitive and behavioural efforts to manage stressors; see Haney, 2004). Cognitive (e.g., thought appraisal, self-talk), multimodal (e.g., cognitive and somatic relaxation training), and alternative (e.g., anger awareness, biofeedback) stress-regulation interventions appear promising for equipping athletes with the knowledge and skills to regulate their stressor experience effectively (Rumbold, Fletcher, &amp; Daniels, 2012). However, our knowledge of the nature of the most effective stress regulation interventions for athletes is limited in several ways. First, an integrative understanding of the effectiveness of stress regulation interventions for athletes is limited to narrative literature reviews (e.g., Rumbold et al., 2012), rather than a statistical synthesis that can provide insight into the magnitude of effect and extent to which the effects generalise across contexts. Doing so requires that we leverage the findings of randomised controlled trials because they provide high-quality evidence regarding cause and effect. Second, the content and structure of effective stress regulation interventions is limited to broad descriptions of the nature of the program (e.g., appraisals, biofeedback). As such, there is a need to interrogate the descriptions of stress regulation interventions in ways that clarify the active ingredients and processes by which these strategies are delivered to athletes to inform guidelines for best practice. Third, the effectiveness of stress regulation interventions is equivocal, so there is a need to explore these differential effects by examining the specific components and outcome measures used in stress regulation experimental designs.

INTRODUCTION
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to prolific publishing on this health issue. Here, we will assess the scientific literature to analyze the characteristics of articles published on COVID-19 during the first 3 months of this pandemic. We will assess the type, quantity, and quality of this literature to get an insight in the available knowledge base for controlling this pandemic early on. We will divide the literature in primary and secondary articles. Primary articles refer to original research studies that create new or confirming data on a problem, e.g. an health issue. Secondary articles use these data to assess the current knowledge status on this problem. We will also compare the publishing pattern during the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic with this pattern during the most recent pandemic, i.e., the H1N1 pandemic.

OBJECTIVES
Our main objectives are summarized in the following 3 research questions: 
(1) What is the prevalence of primary and secondary articles on COVID-19 in the first 3 months of the pandemic?
(2) What are the characteristics of both primary and secondary articles?
(3) How does the publishing pattern during the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic compare with the publishing pattern of the last pandemic, i.e., Swine Flu pandemic?

METHODS
Type of study
We will conduct a cross-sectional (meta-epidemiological) study.

Reporting of the study
We will use Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement as the framework for reporting this study (von Elm 2007). We will report our methods for the Swine Flu sample at the end of the methods section. 

Eligibility criteria
Any type of article published on COVID-19 will be eligible. This implies that a broad spectrum of articles ranging from letters to the editors to randomized controlled trials will be included. No eligibility criteria will be applied to specific participants, interventions, comparators, outcomes, endpoints, or settings of the articles. Articles that did not present an abstract as well as abstracts that were not reported  in English will be excluded.

Information sources and search strategy
We will search eligible articles on COVID-19  in PubMed (MEDLINE) till April 2 2020. Our search strategy for PubMed (MEDLINE) is presented in Table 1 and will be prepared for the eligible search dates. We will use the search string “(COVID-19 OR COVID)” and apply the filter ‘Abstract’.

Selection of articles and data extraction
Two operators (Nicola di Girolamo and Reint Meursinge Reynders) will conduct the selection of articles and the data extraction procedures independently. These operators pilot tested these methods on 40 articles to calibrate operators and to fine-tune research methods, e.g., the data extraction forms (Table 2). Disagreements during the selection of articles and data extraction procedures will be resolved through discussions between these operators. A methodologist will be consulted in the case of persisting disagreements. We will report the flow of our selection of articles and will include our raw data with the final research study.

Classification of the included articles
We will classify each included article as either a primary or a secondary article. Primary articles cover original research studies and secondary articles cover perspectives and syntheses of the available knowledge on COVID-19 such as, viewpoints, commentaries, guidelines, reviews etc. Primary articles will be divided in 5 groups, i.e., human medical research, in silico, in vitro, animal research, and surveys or studies on health professionals. These groups will be further subdivided according to the pertinent research designs.
Our classification of articles will not be exclusively based on the labels assigned by the authors of the articles, because of the potential risk of  mislabeling (Esene 2014). We will weigh the author’ labels before assigning our final classification. 

Abstract assessment
We will screen the abstracts to assess whether objectives and limitations of the article were reported or not. Limitations will be subdivided in methodological and general limitations. The former refers to reporting of at least one methodological limitation in the abstract. General limitations refer to reporting some sort of limitation not inherent to the design of the paper, e.g., further research on this topic is needed etc. 

Information sources and search strategy for the Swine Flu sample
We will search PubMed (MEDLINE) for eligible articles on H1N1 during the first 3 months of the Swine Flu outbreak (04/25/09-7/25/09). Our search strategy for PubMed (MEDLINE) is presented in Table 3. We will use the search string “((H1N1) OR ""swine influenza"")” and apply the filter ‘Abstract’. This search strategy will be prepared for the eligible search dates.

Selection of articles, data extraction, and classification of the included articles for the Swine Flu sample
For the selection of articles, data extraction, and the classification of the included articles for the Swine Flu sample we will adopt the methods presented for the COVID-19 sample. We will report on the classification of primary and secondary articles in this sample. 

Data analysis
We will use descriptive statistics expressed as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) and ranges or absolute counts and percentages. Multivariate logistic regression models will be developed to explore factors associated with the primary outcomes and to provide odds ratio adjusted for confounders (Peng &amp; So, 2002; Heck, Thomas &amp; Tabata, 2013). Variables will be retained in the models regardless of their statistical significance. Goodness of fit will be assessed with Hosmer-Lemshow test and Nagelkerke R squared. Data analyses and figures will be done with SPSS (version 24, IBM) and R 3.6.3 (R Core Team, 2020, www.R-project.org/). 

Outcomes
Table 4 summarizes our planned outcomes. For most of these outcomes we will calculate prevalence statistics. We did not involve patients or other stakeholders in developing our research questions or outcomes.

Differences between the protocol and the final study
Originally we also planned to extract whether included studies were part of multi center projects. After the completion of our pilot tests we decided not to extract these data, because they could not be extracted reliably. This manuscript represents the latest version of our protocol, i.e., the protocol after the completion of our pilot tests. All differences between this protocol and the methods used in the study will be reported in the final manuscript of the study with rationale.

Social isolation and vocabulary development: insights from British families with varying SES,"A convincing body of research has shown that shared book reading in early childhood promotes language development (O'Farrelly et al., 2018; Sénéchal and Young, 2008). Yet, families with low social economic status (SES) might provide less stimulating environment for language development to their children, as compared to families with high SES, as they have sparser access to books and engage less frequently in shared reading interactions (Kelly et al., 2011, Melhuish et al., 2008). For instance, it has been estimated, that by the age of 4 years, toddlers from low SES families have heard about 30 million less words than peers from higher SES families (Hart and Risley, 1995). The current longitudinal study aims to assess home activities and interactions that parents engage in with their 8 to 36-month-old infants during the period of coronavirus lockdown in the UK, and to examine their role in early vocabulary development of British infants across families varying in SES-background.

"Assortative mating, autistic traits, empathizing-systemizing, and digit ratio (2D:4D)","1. Background

Autism spectrum conditions are characterised by routine behaviours, narrow interests, and social and communicative difficulties (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).  There is a marked sex difference in autism diagnosis, with approximately four males being diagnosed per every one female (Fombonne, 2009), an effect that may (at least in part) be explainable in terms of atypical foetal sex hormone exposure (Auyeung et al., 2009; Baron-Cohen et al., 2015, 2019).  The prevalence of autism is approximately 1-2% (e.g. Baron-Cohen et al., 2009), which is a marked increase from Lotter's (1966) early estimate of 0.04%.  There are several reasons why prevalence might have increased, which include better recognition of autistic symptoms, growth of relevant services, and broadening of diagnostic criteria to include Asperger’s disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS).  However, it appears unlikely that these factors completely explain the effect.

With excellent attention to detail, and the ability to remain focussed on repetitive tasks, autistic people are often found to have an aptitude for working in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) industries (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, &amp; Clubley, 2001; Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Stott, Bolton, &amp; Goodyer, 1997).  This effect also appears to extend to the broader autism phenotype (BAP), those people who display higher than average levels of autistic traits, but who do not themselves warrant a clinical diagnosis.  It has also been suggested that autism might be subject to positive assortative mating (i.e., people who measure highly in autistic traits may be more likely than chance to have children together; Baron-Cohen, 2006a, 2006b).  However, there is more than once process by which this could operate.  For instance, it could be that individuals with similar levels of autistic traits consciously or unconsciously seek each other out as romantic partners (active assortment) or that individuals with similar levels of autistic traits are more likely than chance to share other characteristics, such as a working environment, which lead to increased chances of a relationship starting (social homogamy) (see Kardum, Hudek-Knezevic, Schmitt, &amp; Covic, 2017).  In addition, individuals may begin relationships with others who are more similar to themselves than expected by chance as regards autistic traits (initial assortment) or become more similar to their partner over the course of their relationship (convergence) (Kardum et al., 2017).

Evidence for the idea that autism is subject to assortative mating is provided by the observation that a person diagnosed with autism is 10-12 times more likely to marry or have a child with another autistic person than is someone without such a diagnosis (Nordsletten et al., 2016).  Furthermore, greater genetic similarity between the parents of autistic children than would be expected by chance has been reported (Connolly, Anney, Gallagher, &amp; Heron, 2019), as have positive spousal correlations for a quantitative measure of autistic traits (Constantino &amp; Todd, 2005).  Assortative mating may have important implications, and a greater recognition of such processes may help us understand geographical trends in autism prevalence.  This latter point is made clearer by the finding that rates of autism can sometimes cluster (Mazumdar, King, Liu, Zerubavel, &amp; Bearman, 2010; van Meter et al., 2010), with children in Eindhoven (i.e. the ‘Silicon Valley of Europe’) being twice as likely to be autistic as children from two similar sized cities (Utrecht and Haarlem) in the Netherlands (Roelfsema et al., 2012).

The proposed research aims to increase our understanding of the processes that might underpin assortative mating in autism.  More specifically, we aim to determine whether autistic traits, empathizing, systemizing, and prenatal sex hormone exposure (as indexed by 2D:4D ratio) are correlated between heterosexual dating couples.


2. Method

2.1 A priori power analysis

We conducted an a priori power analysis using G*Power 3.1 (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, &amp; Lang, 2009; Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007) to determine the sample size.  Assuming a medium effect size (r = 0.30) for intra-couple correlations on personality variables (e.g. Kardum et al., 2017) and 80% power, this analysis determined that a sample size of n=67 couples would be required to observe a statistically significant effect (p smaller than 0.05) with a one-tailed Pearson’s correlation test.

2.2 Apparatus/Materials

2.2.1 Demographics
Participants will report their sex, age, ethnicity, living status (i.e. whether or not living with their partner), length of relationship, marital status, educational level, student status, occupational status, and autism diagnostic status (see Appendix for wording of questions and response options).

2.2.2 Autistic traits and related measures
We will use the autism spectrum quotient (AQ; Baron-Cohen et al., 2001) to measure autistic traits, the Empathy Quotient (EQ; Baron-Cohen &amp; Wheelwright, 2004) to measure empathizing, and the Systemizing Quotient-Revised (SQ-R; Wheelwright et al., 2006) to measure systemizing.  In addition, we will use the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Hill, Raste, &amp; Plumb, 2001) and the Embedded Figures Test (Witkin, Oltman, Raskin, &amp; Karp, 1971), as behavioural tasks that tap into abilities prerequisite to empathizing and systemizing, respectively.

2.2.3 Digit Ratio (2D:4D)
Prenatal testosterone exposure will be estimated via the proxy measure of digit ratio (2D:4D), i.e. the ratio of length between the second (index) and fourth (ring) fingers (see Manning et al., 1998; Manning, 2008).  The second and fourth fingers will be measured directly from participants’ hands by Research Assistants and MSc students using digital Vernier callipers (see Manning, 2008).  Two sets of measurements will be taken in the following order: R2D, R4D, L2D, L4D.  These will then be used to calculate two sets of R2D:4D (R2D:4D1 and R2D:4D2) and L2D:4D (L2D:4D1 and L2D:4D2) measurements.  Assuming that the intraclass-correlation coefficients (ICC) for the two sets of measurements are high, these will be averaged to produce the R2D:4D and L2D:4D values used in all further analyses.  If the measurements are found not to be reliable, we will use whichever set of measurements provides the lower standard deviation.  M2D:4D will be calculated as the average of R2D:4D L2D:4D, and D[R-L] will be calculated as the arithmetic mean difference between R2D:4D and L2D:4D (see (Manning, 2002).


3. Study 1: Assortative Mating on Autistic Traits and Related Measures

3.1 Hypotheses and analysis plan

H1: There will be sex differences for each autism-related variable
	Paired samples t tests to examine the difference in partners’ AQ scores (predicted direction: males higher than females)
	Paired samples t test to examine the difference in partners’ EQ scores (predicted direction: females higher than males)
	Paired samples t test to examine the difference in partners’ SQ-R scores (predicted direction: males higher than females)
	Paired samples t test to examine the difference in partners’ D scores (predicted direction: males higher [i.e. more male-typical] than females)
	Paired samples t test to examine the difference in partners’ RMET scores (predicted direction: females higher than males)
	Paired samples t test to examine the difference in partners’ EFT mean response times (predicted direction: males faster than females)

H2: Variables related to social homogamy will be positively correlated within couples
	Pearson’s correlation test to determine the association between males’ age and the age of their female partners (predicted direction: positive correlation)
	Spearman’s correlation test to determine the association between males’ educational attainment and the educational attainment of their female partners (predicted direction: positive correlation)
	Chi-square test to determine whether males’ STEM status is associated with the STEM status of their female partners (predicted direction: males working/studying in STEM will be more likely than chance to have female partners working/studying in STEM)

H3: Autism-related variables will be positively correlated within couples
	Pearson’s correlation test to determine the association between males’ total AQ scores and the total AQ scores of their female partners (predicted direction: positive correlation)
	Pearson’s correlation test to determine the association between males’ total EQ scores and the total EQ scores of their female partners (predicted direction: positive correlation)
	Pearson’s correlation test to determine the association between males’ total SQ-R scores and the total SQ-R scores of their female partners (predicted direction: positive correlation)
	Pearson’s correlation test to determine the association between males’ D scores and the D scores of their female partners (predicted direction: positive correlation)
	Pearson’s correlation test to determine the association between males’ total RMET scores and the total RMET scores of their female partners (predicted direction: positive correlation)
	Pearson’s correlation test to determine the association between males’ EFT mean response time and the EFT mean response time of their female partners (predicted direction: positive correlation)

H4: Intra-couple similarity for autism-related variables will be higher for actual couples than for random male/female pairings
	Within couple difference scores for autism-related variables will be calculated by subtracting the standardised score for females from the standardised score for males (for each of AQ, EQ, SQ-R, RMET, and EFT, respectively [note that sex-specific standardised D scores will be calculated separately]).  We will then compute random-pairings' difference scores for each of these variables as averages of all other male/female pairings that are possible within the dataset.
	Within-subjects t tests will be used to compare the observed standardised difference scores (i.e. for actual couples) with the average similarity scores for random pairings.
o	It is predicted that observed standardised difference scores for AQ, EQ, SQ-R, D, RMET, and EFT will be smaller than the corresponding average standardised difference scores computed for all other possible male/female pairings.

H5: Intra-couple similarity for autism-related variables will reflect initial assortment rather than convergence
	Pearson’s correlation tests to determine the association between length of relationship and intra-couple similarity for autism-related variables (i.e. standardised female AQ, EQ, SQ-R, RMET, and EFT scores subtracted from male standardised AQ, EQ, SQ-R, RMET, and EFT scores, respectively [note that the difference in sex-specific standardised D scores will be calculated separately]) (prediction: no correlations)
o	No statistically significant (i.e. p smaller than 0.05, two-tailed) association between length of relationship and the outcome variable will signify initial assortment rather than convergence.
o	Convergence may be indicated if there is a significant negative correlation between length of relationship and intra-couple similarity (i.e. with low scores indicating greater similarity).  However, it should be noted that greater resemblance within couples who have been together longer could also indicate that couples who are more similarly matched at baseline are more likely to remain together compared to couples that are more disparate at baseline.

H6: Intra-couple similarity for autism-related variables may reflect social homogamy (in regard to age and educational attainment) or active assortment
	Pearson’s correlation tests to determine the association between intra-couple similarity in age (i.e. female age subtracted from male age) and intra-couple similarity in autism-related variables (i.e. standardised female AQ, EQ, SQ-R, RMET, and EFT scores subtracted from standardised male AQ, EQ, SQ-R, RMET, and EFT scores, respectively [note that the difference in sex-specific standardised D scores will be calculated separately]) (prediction: no direction of effects predicted)
	Spearman’s correlation tests to determine the association between intra-couple similarity in educational attainment (i.e. female educational attainment subtracted from male educational attainment) and intra-couple similarity in autism-related variables (i.e. standardised female AQ, EQ, SQ-R, RMET, and EFT scores subtracted from standardised male AQ, EQ, SQ-R, RMET, and EFT scores, respectively [note that the difference in sex-specific standardised D scores will be calculated separately]) (prediction: no direction of effects predicted)
o	No statistically significant (i.e. p smaller than 0.05, two-tailed) association between intra-couple similarity in age and/or educational attainment and intra-couple similarity in autism-related variables will signify active assortment rather than social homogamy.
o	Social homogamy will be indicated if intra-couple similarity in autism-related variables is positively correlated with intra-couple similarity in age and/or educational attainment. 

H7: Social homogamy regarding STEM status will influence intra-couple similarity for autism-related variables
	Between-subjects t tests to compare intra-couple similarity in autism-related variables (i.e. AQ, EQ, SQ-R, D, RMET, and EFT) between couples for whom both members work/study in STEM and couples for whom either one or neither member work/study in STEM (prediction: similarity in AQ, EQ, SQ-R, D, RMET, and EFT scores will be higher in couples for whom both members work/study in STEM areas)


4. Study 2: Assortative Mating and Digit Ratio (2D:4D)

Studies by Manning (2002, p. 50) and Voracek, Dressler, and Manning (2007) reported statistically significant positive correlations between the digit ratios of heterosexual partners.  However, more recent studies (e.g. Kalichman, Batsevich, &amp; Kobyliansky, 2019; Richards, Bellin, &amp; Davies, 2017) have not observed such effects.  We therefore intend to meta-analyse the available data to determine whether or not such effects exist.

It became obvious from initial literature searches that using relevant search terms (e.g. ‘assortative mating’, ‘spousal correlation’, ‘partner correlation’) would not return some of the studies of which we were already aware that include relevant data.  The reason for this is that studies that have collected 2D:4D from spouses have rarely done so specifically to investigate the possibility of assortative mating (e.g. Hauth, de Bruijn, Staal, Buitelaar, &amp; Rommelse, 2014).  For this reason, we do not intend to conduct a systematic literature review, but will use Review Manager (Cochrane Collaboration, 2019) to conduct quantitative meta-analyses for all relevant available data of which we are aware (including those of Study 1).  If a small number of studies with substantially different sample sizes are identified, we will compute fixed-effects models (i.e. to reduce the influence of imprecise small studies on the overall sample size estimate); if there is no large discrepancy in sample size (or we identify tens of relevant studies), we will conduct random-effects models.  Causes of between-study heterogeneity will be examined qualitatively, and the potential for publication bias will be evaluated via visual assessment of funnel plots.

4.1 Hypotheses and analysis plan

H1: R2D:4D will be positively correlated between romantic partners
H2: L2D:4D will be positively correlated between romantic partners
H3: M2D:4D will be positively correlated between romantic partners
H4: D[R-L] will be not be correlated between romantic partners

Complex interventions for type 2 diabetes in primary health care at low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analyses,"The International Diabetes Federation estimated that 425 million of the people worldwide have diabetes in year 2017 with a disproportionate distribution of 79% in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The cost of illness of diabetes will pressurize the health system in LMICs as primary health care (PHC) systems are traditionally organized for acute care and the main sources of health care financing are through general taxation and out-of-pocket payment.

With reference to Declaration of Alma-Ata, PHC includes both community and primary facility-based care, ranging from promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative services. Targeting PHC is a sustainable and relatively inexpensive approach in addressing the issues that contributes to the loses in care.

There were systematic reviews on effectiveness of different interventions on diabetes care carried out at the facility level. Systematic reviews that included studies from developed countries showed that multicomponent intervention improved T2D care. Outcomes measured by most of the systematic reviews are intermediate clinical outcomes (e.g. glycaemic control) and process of care. Despite a large body of literature on different interventions on diabetes management, little evidence is known for LMICs with different priorities, workforce and financial arrangement. There is also a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of complex intervention in this setting. Hence, we would like to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize evidence on complex interventions for type 2 diabetes in primary health care setting of LMICs.",p5rvj,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/p5rvj/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': ""Trials will be identified through systematic searches from inception of the following databases until date of search will be\nincluded:\n1.

Investigating the Effects of Linguistic Knowledge on Apparent Motion in Chinese Characters Across Visual Orientations,"“Chinese and Americans see opposite apparent motions in a Chinese character” by Tse and Cavanagh (2000) found that Chinese speakers report observing an apparent motion of the last stroke in the presentation of a Chinese character that accords with standard writing practices, while Americans report apparent motion in the opposite direction in accordance with Gestalt grouping principles. They take this as evidence for a top-down effect of linguistic knowledge on perceptual processing. Li and Yeh (2003) replicate and expand upon these results, finding evidence that this effect is only observed when the character is written in chirographic script (where stroke directional information is preserved) and when the strokes are presented in the order in which they are written. We will examine whether or not this effect persists when the orientation of the character is manipulated.",vreks,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vreks/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Recruitment: Subjects will be recruited online using Prolific.\nInclusion/Exclusion rules: Participants must be between 18 - 80 years old and be native Mandarin or English speakers.

The effect of individual differences in Episodic Future Thought on sketching true and false intentions,"This is the second study in a series of studies exploring whether differences in Episodic Future Thought ability (EFT; i.e., the ability to mentally visualise future events) affects the ability to lie about intentions. In study 1, we used 4 EFT tasks to examine which EFT measure best correlated with lying ability. The correlation between the 4 tasks was lower than we would have expected if the tasks were all measuring EFT. We therefore speculated that the 4 measures might be measuring some other aspect of the EFT tasks (e.g. talkativeness), rather than EFT itself. To test this, we intend to replicate our previous study, but ask participants to report the EFT via sketches as well as verbally. That way, if the verbal EFT task is predictive of lying in sketches, we will then know the task is measuring more than talkativeness.   
This study consists of 3 parts. Part A of the study consists of 2 tasks: a lying about intentions task and an episodic details task. Participants will then take part in the same lying about intentions experiment as study 1, which is largely based on Granhag and Knieps (2011). Participants will be asked to plan a mock criminal event (placing a memory stick containing illegal material on a specific shelf in the physics section of the university library) and plan a cover story to tell the interviewer in case they are intercepted.  Participants will also be asked to plan one of five randomly selected innocent tasks, such as buying two gifts for a friend from a local shop.  Just before the participant leaves the building, they will be intercepted by an interviewer and taken to a nearby room for questioning. The interviewer will be blind to which tasks are actually part of the study and the participant’s task is to deceive the interviewer successfully. The interviewer will first ask the participant about their intentions, followed by questions about any mental image that was activated during the planning of their task. Finally, participants will be asked to sketch a picture of their most dominant mental image of what it will be like when they complete their task. Participants will then return to the original room and complete a detailed post-interview questionnaire beginning with questions directly related to EFT, followed by questions adapted from the Memory Characteristics Questionnaire (MCQ, Johnson, Foley, Suengas &amp; Raye, 1988) relating to the phenomenological characteristics of their most dominant mental image including perceptual details.
To assess participant’s EFT ability, participants will complete an episodic details task adapted from D’Argembeau, Ortoleva, Jumentier and Van der Linden’s (2010) study. The episodic details task requires participants to imagine a possible situation that they may encounter in the future (‘imagine something you will do on your next holiday’). Participants will be told to describe the specific event as if they were physically present in the situation including as many details as possible. Participants will then respond to a series of questions adapted from the MCQ (Johnson et al, 1988) indicating their phenomenological experience of the task.  In the previous study (study 1), this EFT task was the most predictive measure of the amount of details and number of words participants used, when describing their true and deceptive intention. Participants will also complete the revised Hexaco Personality Inventory (Ashton &amp; Lee, 2009) in which they will rate 60 statements about themselves from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). This questionnaire measures six broad personality factors: Honesty-humility, emotionality, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience.
Participants will then take part in the same ‘intent to deceive’ experiment as study 1, which is largely based on Granhag and Knieps (2011). Participants will be asked to plan a mock criminal event (placing a memory stick containing illegal material on a specific shelf in the physics section of the university library) and plan a cover story in case they are intercepted.

Participants will then return to the original room and complete a detailed post-interview questionnaire beginning with questions directly related to EFT, followed by questions relating to the phenomenological characteristics of EFT.
In part B of this study, we will ask a separate group of participants to rate the veracity of the verbal descriptions of the truthful and deceptive tasks provided in part A. Participants will also rate their confidence in their veracity judgements as well as the plausibility of the story.
In part C of this study, we will ask participants to rate the veracity of the sketches collected part A. We will also ask them to rate the abstractness of the sketches.

A Study on COVID-19 Hand Hygiene Behaviours,"The importance of personal hygiene practices for preventing the transmission of pathogens is particularly relevant during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has recommended specific behavioural practices to limit the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. People are encouraged to protect themselves by washing their hands regularly with soap and water; and avoiding touching their face, including eyes, nose or mouth. This is to avoid infection through transfer of the virus from contaminated surfaces to the face or mouth by touching. The key question in health behaviour research is how to predict and modify the adoption and maintenance of these hand hygiene behaviours. Although intention to engage in these behaviours may by high among the general population, especially given the heightened threat of infection from this novel virus, previous research has demonstrated that individuals do not always enact their intentions. The present research aims to use a theory-based intervention to promote effective adoption and maintenance of hand hygiene behaviours to prevent the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
The study will adopt an implementation imagery intervention strategy to promote hand hygiene behaviour in the context of face touching, as recommended by the WHO for preventing pathogen transmission. The intervention will be based on two commonly used social psychological models that propose the determinants of social and health behaviours; the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991) and Health Action Process Approach (HAPA; Schwarzer, 2008; Schwarzer &amp; Hamilton, 2020). The models will inform the intervention content and to explain the mechanisms behind the proposed effects. The present study builds on our previous research that supports the predictions of the TPB and HAPA in the context of health behaviours, including hand hygiene behaviour (Reyes Fernández, Knoll, Hamilton, &amp; Schwarzer, 2016; Zhang, Fang, Zhang, Hagger, &amp; Hamilton, 2020). This research has identified key potentially modifiable determinants of health behaviour that can be targeted in interventions. The intervention will combine strategies that are closely matched with the determinants in the motivational phases of the TPB and volitional phases of the HAPA, including persuasive communication, implementation intentions, and mental imagery. 
The implementation imagery method used in this study was developed by the research team and has been successfully applied in several studies to date (e.g., Hamilton, Keech, Peden, &amp; Hagger, 2019; Hamilton, Keech, Peden, &amp; Hagger, under review; Keech, Hamilton, &amp; Hagger, in press). The intervention will be evaluated in an online randomised-controlled trial. The intervention will be embedded in an online survey which will be administered to a sample of the general population. The intervention will provide participants with information followed by a series of self-enacted exercises in which they are promoted to adopt the theory-based strategies likely to change their behaviour (e.g., actively making plans to enact the behaviour, and imagining the specific steps required to attain the goal, and mentally rehearsing the feelings that a person has when they have succeeded in performing an intended behaviour). The aim is to test the efficacy of a brief, potentially cost effective, theory-based intervention that involves minimal direct contact between participant and practitioner, and will use resources that can easily be implemented in real-world settings.
The intervention will target change in two specific hand hygiene behaviours: (1) avoidance of face touching whenever one is outside of the house (i.e., ‘face-touching avoidance’); and (2) washing hands every time before touching one’s face (i.e., ‘handwashing before face-touching’). The rationale for targeting these behaviours is that individuals touch many surfaces with their hands in the course of daily living, particularly when outside the house, which leaves them at risk of touching surfaces that harbour the virus. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to the individual’s eyes, nose, or mouth and infect them. It is, therefore, important that individuals avoid touching their face whenever they are outside of their house due to the many potentially contaminated surfaces they may touch when outside of their house. It is also important that individuals wash their hands before touching their face.",h3sqc,,,OSF Preregistration,True,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/h3sqc/contributors/?format=json,,,67qde

Use and appropriateness of Reporting Guidelines in physical therapy research:  a protocol for a meta-research study,"INTRODUCTION: Problems about reporting of a scientific study can affect dissemination of research in different manners. It is known that study methods are frequently not described in adequate detail and that results are presented ambiguously or selectively. To overcome these problems, reporting guidelines (e.g. CONSORT, PRISMA, STARD and STROBE statements) have been developed to increase the transparency of research. While recent evidence suggested that these guidelines are frequently used inappropriately in studies published in the major medical journals, the extent and appropriateness of use in physical therapy research has not been systematically evaluated. The aim of this meta-research study will be to evaluate the frequency of using reporting guidelines and their appropriate use in physical therapy published research.
METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis is planned on a random sample of 200 studies published in the last ten years (2010-2019) in the five generic rehabilitation journals with the highest 5-year impact factor. Randomization will be stratified for publication date to include an equal number of studies from 2010 to 2014 (n=100), and from 2015 to 2019 (n=100). Randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews, diagnostic accuracy studies and observational studies will be included. Crude prevalence estimates with 95% confidence intervals of using and appropriateness of using will be estimated. A bivariate analysis will assess the relationship between the use of reporting guidelines and the year of publication.
DISSEMINATION PLANS: Several studies have shown the positive influence of reporting guidelines on the completeness of research reporting but no one investigated the use and the appropriateness of reporting guidelines in physical therapy research. Therefore, this study will add relevant knowledge that may contribute to improve further the reporting of rehabilitation research. The results of this research will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and will be presented at relevant (inter)national scientific events.",st7h8,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/st7h8/contributors/?format=json,,[],8ugvq
Analysis of Open Data and Computational Reproducibility in Registered Reports in Psychology,"Ongoing technological developments have made it easier than ever before for scientists to share their data, materials, and analysis code. Sharing data and analysis code makes it easier for other researchers to re-use or check published research. These benefits will only emerge if researchers can reproduce the analysis reported in published articles, and if data is annotated well enough so that it is clear what all variables mean. Because most researchers have not been trained in computational reproducibility, it is important to evaluate current practices to identify practices that can be improved. We examined data and code sharing, as well as computational reproducibility of the main results, without contacting the original authors, for Registered Reports published in the in psychological literature between 2014 and 2018. Of the 62 articles that met our inclusion criteria, data was available for 40 articles, and analysis scripts for 37 articles. For the 35 articles that shared both data and code and performed analyses in SPSS, R, Python, MATLAB, or JASP, we could run the scripts for 31 articles, and reproduce the main results for 20 articles. Although the articles that shared both data and code (35 out of 62, or 56%) and articles that could be computationally reproduced (20 out of 35, or 57%) was relatively high compared to other studies, there is clear room for improvement.

Elevating dental training to reduce HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer incidence rates,"Background. Often, the first signs of oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), particularly Human papillomavirus infection (HPV)-related OPC, can be detected during a head and neck examination performed by an oral health care provider. Since the incidence of HPV-related OPC has increased significantly, it has become more important that these providers are familiar with the presenting signs and symptoms of OPC and its relation to HPV.  Furthermore dentists should be empowered to encourage vaccination against HPV, perform oral screenings, and educate patients around the risk factors for HPV-related OPC.  
Rationale. In accordance with Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA), standards for pre-doctoral dental education programs state that dental graduates should be prepared to: screen and assess for head and neck cancer, health promotion and disease prevention, (2-24) and have the interpersonal and communications skills to function successfully in a multicultural work environment (2-17).  Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive review of the literature to examine pre-doctoral dental students’ 1) awareness of the connection between OPC and HPV 2) readiness to assess OPC 3) delivery of patient education about OPC and its relation to HPV and 4) identify existing OPC and HPV training in the curricula.",hqf9y,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hqf9y/contributors/?format=json,,"['curriculum development', 'dental education', 'hpv', 'oral cancer']",pn2u9

COVID-19 and Political Attitudes in India,"That existential threats (e.g. terrorism or war) affect a variety of political attitudes and behaviors (e.g. incumbent support, rally effects, attitudes toward minorities) has been well-documented in the literature. Our study aims to extend this research by considering whether a different type of threat -- in this case the spread of the COVID-19 virus -- triggers certain attitudinal changes. Because of the large scope of the virus spread, we theorize that people will perceive the virus as not only being threatening to themselves individually but also to the society as a whole. As a result, we expect that there will be notable changes in people’s attitudes toward how close they feel to and support their society. We therefore aim to assess the impact of the COVID-19 threat on a cluster of features that relate to in-group bonding. These include patriotism, social trust, and social desirability. We plan to examine these relationships via an experimental design where a randomly-assigned portion of survey participants will be presented a COVID-19 related vignette, while others will be shown a placebo scenario.

The Influence of German Lexical Aspect on the Mental Representation of Events During Real-time Language Processing: A Visual World Eye-tracking Study,"Temporal information about the duration of events, as encoded in aspectual markers, is important in the construction of the mental representation of events. Verb aspect is thought to act as a processing cue since it has been shown that the construal of events when reading or listening to event descriptions is influenced by inflectional verb morphology. In English, the imperfective aspect (She was writing) can emphasize the dynamic, ongoing nature of events and can encourage an internal perspective (Madden &amp; Zwaan, 2003). Perhaps as a result, imperfective (vs. perfective) facilitates the processing of the location where the action takes place (seen as event background information, cf., Ferretti et al., 2007). In contrast, the perfective aspect (She wrote) could focus the interpreter’s attention on the static, completed end state of situations and encourage a goal-driven, external perspective. Relatedly, perfective (vs. imperfective) has been suggested to facilitate the processing of action-related instruments (cf., Ferretti et al., 2001).  However, much of this evidence is derived from English, which encodes aspect grammatically.    
	Languages vary in how they convey aspect, and it is possible this variation can have implications for how event knowledge is activated in response to aspect.  In English, aspect is conveyed grammatically by the verb phrase. Verbs assign thematic roles which can give rapid access to situation knowledge, and the grammatical form of a verb influences access to this knowledge.
However, in German aspect is expressed lexically through temporal adverbs among others. In this project, we explore to what extent and when aspectual adverbs in German rapidly shift a comprehender’s attention to event information.  Specifically, we ask whether German, like English, shifts attention towards locations (vs. instruments) when processing imperfective (vs. perfective) aspect markers and vice versa. If we find similarities in German and English, then this would suggest similarity in the mapping from grammatically- versus lexically-realized aspect to event representations.
If we find cross-linguistic differences in aspectual processing, then we would conclude that visual attention and the construction of event representations are influenced by the lexical (vs. grammatical) realization of aspect. However, subsequent studies using the same setup and design would have to be conducted both using lexical and (standard) grammatical aspect in English to underscore this conclusion.
We use as our launching point a previous (unpublished) visual-world eye-tracking study (here referred to as Experiment 1) that investigated whether lexical aspect in German (a non-aspect language) resembles grammatical aspect processing in English.  We measured whether event-related location and instrument information varies in sentences containing imperfective and perfective aspectual adverbs. German adults heard sentences with imperfective or perfective aspect and a location or instrument prepositional phrase (PP), e.g., (1) Das Mädchen schrieb geradeAdv / kürzlichAdv in der SchuleLOC_PP / mit dem FüllerINST_PP. Lit. trans.: ‘The girl wrote currentlyAdv / recentlyAdv at the schoolINST_PP / with the fountain penINST_PP.’, while inspecting four images: a verb-related instrument &amp; location and two distracters (see Figure 1). We recorded reaction times and accuracy in a post-trial task (click on the picture which matches the sentence).
	The findings of Experiment 1 illustrated that aspect influenced processing of event information in the eye-movement data, but not in the post-trial data.  Participants fixated the location (vs. instrument) picture more after hearing an imperfective (vs. perfective) aspect adverb marker and the instrument (vs. location) picture more when hearing a perfective (vs. imperfective) aspect marker. We assume that increased fixations to the location / instrument after processing the imperfective / perfective aspect marker indicate facilitation in processing the respective location / instrument PP upon it’s mention. This is in line with linking hypotheses in visual-world studies that have interpreted more fixations to an object as indicating attention to / thinking about that object (Pyykkönnen-Klauck &amp; Crocker, 2016) and with earlier studies investigating priming effects (e.g., Arai et al., 2007). However, the gaze pattern reported in Experiment 1 (see above) were not anticipatory, and only occurred in the PP (prepositional phrase) region (loc_PP, inst_PP, see (1)). No other effects (e.g., anticipatory effects in the aspect marker region) reached significance. The post-trial click data did not reveal any significant differences due to aspect.
	One question that arose in our analysis was whether the post-trial task might emphasize the importance of the location/instrument region of the sentence and hence might bias sentence processing away from the aspect marker and any potential anticipatory effects in the aspect region. The task in Experiment 1 was a post-trial task in which participants were asked to click on the picture mentioned in the sentence. We think that the post-trial task emphasized the PP because it is heard at the end of the sentence and participants’ task was to click on its referent (a location/instrument picture on the screen). Sentence aspect on the other hand did not play a role in fulfilling the task and might hence have been ignored. Additionally, although the instructions emphasized the importance of fast and accurate responses, the task was not challenging for participants, as evidenced by high accuracy values; they knew what to expect after every single trial. This task focus on the PP could have in turn also affected the real-time results. Perhaps, participants’ gaze in Experiment 1 did not show anticipatory aspect effects in the aspect region of the sentence and no interaction between aspect and location/instrument in the PP region because they waited until sentence end to identify the PP.
	Even though task effects in visual world eye tracking studies have been reported and discussed (cf., Altmann &amp; Kamide, 1999; Kreysa &amp; Knoeferle, 2011; Salverda et al., 2011; Tanenhaus et al., 2000), not many studies have explicitly investigated whether the reported effects may be task-specific or not. Altmann and Kamide (1999), for example, found delayed but qualitatively similar fixation patterns in a look-and-listen task compared to participants’ having to judge whether the sentence they heard “could in principle apply to the picture” (p. 251). Kreysa and Knoeferle (2011) on the other hand found qualitatively different response times but also differences in fixations patterns depending on the task. In the experiments participants watched a speaker in a video uttering either a German subject-verb-object (SVO) or object-verb-subject (OVS) sentence. The sentences were about characters performing actions towards each other. In addition, and simultaneously to seeing the speaker, participants also saw the characters displayed on a computer screen. Experiment 1 asked participants to identify the patients of the actions described in the sentences, in experiment 2 the task was to verify thematic role relations. Fixation patterns during sentence processing differed by task: When the task focused on patient identification, shifts in fixations to the target patient were greater in SVO than in OVS sentences since in OVS sentences, the patient had already been identified at the beginning of the sentence. When the task was to verify thematic role relations, gaze shifts to the patient were greater in OVS than SVO sentences. 
	These results suggest that the task mediates the distribution of attention in the visual world (cf., Salverda et al., 2011). Hence, if the effects that we observed in Experiment 1 during referent verification hold up across tasks we would assume that they are independent of task-specific allocation of attention and that they likely hold up during perhaps more natural look-and-listen tasks. If, however, we find different fixation and / or reaction time patterns when different tasks are employed, we might assume that task-mediated attention is a (strong) predictor of effects found in real-time language processing studies and more specifically can mediate event representations during aspectual language processing.
	This pre-registered first follow-up study will adapt the task to a look-and-listen paradigm that does not involve an overt response. We will encourage participant attention in the study by instructing them that they will be asked to perform a post-experiment memory/sentence-picture completion task after the eye-tracking portion of the study. The post-experiment memory/sentence-picture completion task will proceed as follows: participants will be presented with all items (and half of the fillers) again. They will see the exact picture quadruplets they encountered in the eye-tracking experiment. The critical sentence will be presented in text below the pictures. The critical sentence they heard in the experiment will be presented up to the aspect marker (e.g., Das Mädchen schrieb gerade/kürzlich…, lit. transl: The girl wrote currently/recently…). Their task is to choose the picture that completes the sentence they heard in the experiment (see Figure 1). We will measure reaction times to correct choices and choice accuracy. In this look-and-listen follow-up study, the focus on the PP region is hence reduced. As a result, their attention during the look-and-listen part of the experiment should be distributed more evenly across the whole sentence and the pictures. The post-experiment task, on the other hand, might highlight the aspect marker more than it was the case in the post-trial task and / or reduce the focus of attention on the PP region compared to the post-trial task in Experiment 1. Even though in the post-experiment task, participants still have to click on the location/instrument picture (i.e., the PP) which completes the sentence, the part of the sentence which helps them to complete the sentence correctly is only presented up to the aspect marker. Hence, the aspect marker becomes the final presented sentence region (in contrast to Experiment 1 in which the PP region was the final presented sentence region) and might be used as a cue, together with the verb, to trigger participants’ memories regarding the end of the sentence (i.e., the location vs. the instrument PP).",fp4wc,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'We will test German participants who have not learned a second language before age 6 between 18 and 31 years of age.

Online sports betting in the United States: A multilevel analysis of factors predicting the decision to bet,"Following the Supreme Court ruling that overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in 2018 (Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, 2018), there has been increased sports betting opportunities for gamblers in the United States (U.S.) (American Gaming Association, 2019). Despite the growth of legal markets, illegal sports betting (mostly through unregulated offshore sites) is still deeply entrenched across the country, including jurisdictions where domestically-licensed sportsbooks operate (American Gaming Association, 2019). These illegal sites are a problem for governments for many reasons – they may lack regulatory oversight and consumer protection mechanisms, and often enable financial crimes like money laundering and tax evasion (Albanese, 2018). 	Understanding consumers’ motivations for using illegal online sportsbooks is essential in developing policies to discourage the use of illegal sites as well as to encourage use of legal ones. However, little is known about U.S. consumer motivation in selecting legal versus illegal online sportsbooks. Therefore, the primary goal of this study is to determine the main factors that draw U.S. consumers to place a bet on illegal online sportsbooks instead of legitimate ones. In addition, we will examine the differences in demographics and gambling behaviors of people choosing between illegal and legal sites.

Emotion Regulation as a Resilience Factor For Internalizing Symptoms Following Early Adversity,"Early adversity (EA) can have deleterious impacts on one's well being. Specifically, being exposed to EA puts an individual at risk for atypical brain development as well as an increased susceptibility for the development of mood disorders later in life (Cicchetti &amp; Toth, 2005; Green et al. 2010; Kessler et al. 2010; Keyes et al. 2018; McLaughlin et al. 2010; Nusslock and Miller 2016; Pechtel and Pizzagalli 2011). For example, previously institutionalized youth (PI; youth who experienced orphanage care and were subsequently adopted) are at increased risk for internalizing disorders relative to their comparison (i.e., youth raised by their biological parents since birth) peers. 

Cognitive reappraisal is an emotion regulation strategy that involves changing one’s interpretation of emotional events and has been shown to be an important component of healthy social-emotional development in adolescents and adults (Cutuli 2014; Haga et al. 2009). Expressive suppression, by contrast, involves suppressing the outward expression of emotion and has been linked to decreased well-being (Cutuli 2014; Haga et al. 2009). Both cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression involve the down-regulation of emotion, however, their underlying processes and consequences are drastically different. Here we assessed the role of these two widely-studied emotion regulation strategies, cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression on the development of internalizing psychopathology (anxiety, depression, somatic complaints, and withdrawal) among PI versus comparison youths. 

While EA is a strong predictor for the development of psychopathology, less is known about what makes PI youth resilient. The present study sought to investigate whether engaging in effortful emotion regulation, such as cognitive reappraisal, would buffer PI youth against internalizing symptomatology compared to comparison youth. Identifying risk and resilience factors that modify links between EA and psychopathology is critical in order to optimize treatments tailored to the affected population.",ta9rh,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ta9rh/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': ""Participants: In total, 36 PI youths (23 girls and 13 boys; mean age = 14.47, SD = 1,92, range = 9-17) and 58 comparison youths (32 girls and 26 boys; mean age = 13.24, SD = 2.13, range = 9-17) participated in this study. Each youth’s caregiver participated in the study by completing child-report measures. \n\nRecruitment/Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Participants were recruited as part of a larger longitudinal study examining the long term effects of EA on brain, immune, behavioral, social, and emotional development. Participants were pulled from that larger sample based on their age (due to the use of caregiver report on internalizing psychopathology) and their completion of the two measures of interests (Emotion Regulation Questionnaire - Youth and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6-18)). Comparison youth (non-internationally adopted children and adolescents raised by their biological parents) were prescreened for any diagnoses of behavioral or psychological concerns, or learning disabilities.

An Essential Service Decision Model for Applied Behavior Analytic Providers During Crisis,"In the United States, applied behavior analysis (ABA) is broadly recognized as a medically necessary treatment for individuals diagnosed with autism and related disorders (Association of Professional Behavior Analysts, 2020). We argue that this designation should not be called into question in the light of a particular disaster and that it is critical to consider that an interruption of services can have long-lasting effects on the treatment of the individual (practitioners are ethically obligated to uphold the continuity of services while doing no harm). This dilemma might be ameliorated by a decision model that considers the prioritization of immediate needs, vulnerability of clients, and competency of service providers. Just as the medical field prioritizes immediate needs during crisis situations and defers routine appointments (e.g., physicals, check-ups, etc.), the ABA field can make similar evidence-based decisions. The purpose of the current paper is to provide a decision model for ABA practitioners who find themselves questioning the need for essential service delivery during the current Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The impact of this model goes beyond the needs of this crisis and can be applied to any emergency situation where services are at risk of interruption.",vdmxu,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/contributors/?format=json,,[],k97sa

Weakening the Ideological Immune System: Can Debiasing Techniques Reduce Confirmation Bias?,"Psychologists have identified confirmation bias as a significant obstacle to rational decision making. Given the role of confirmation bias in exacerbating conflict and ideological extremism, the development of cognitive debiasing techniques seems worthwhile. However, the efficacy of social science’s existing arsenal of debiasing techniques remains largely unknown, and the extant positive findings have often been inconsistent and in need of independent replication. In this proposed registered report, we aim to empirically test the efficacy of three cognitive debiasing techniques in mitigating confirmation bias: consider-the-opposite, psychoeducation, and a novel social norms manipulation. Being able to compare these strategies will have the benefit of providing theoretical advancement by shedding light on the processes that give rise to confirmation bias.

Threat messages in Hate speech on Social media,"Empirical data suggests that social media platforms such as Twitter are strategically used by supporters of extremist ideologies to promote hate speech and facilitate radicalization processes, but underlying psychological mechanisms remain unclear. What is more, the impact of hate speech messages on Twitter users has to the best of my knowledge not yet been examined. The present project aims to provide a more nuanced picture of the content and impact of tweets with hate speech content on their readers by detecting systematic patterns. 

The project examines the following research questions:  
1.	Does hate speech on German twitter contain messages paint immigrants and Muslims as a symbolic, realistic or safety threat?
2.	How do these threat messages differ with regards to their content and wording?
3.	Does the prevalence of threat messages in hate speech predict readers’ reactions in form of likes?

The study will use two data subsets from the POLLY dataset which together contain over 40.000 German tweets collected in 2017 and wereas made publicly available for academic purposes by the researchers Jaki &amp; De Smedt and has been anonymized in line with the EU’s new General Data Protection Regulation. 

Drawing on the concepts of Integrated Threat Theory, I expect content on German twitter, which is classified as hate speech, to contain significantly more threat perceptions than tweets which are not classified as hate speech.

The Effect of Masculine Honor Beliefs on Expectations for Bullying Victims,"Experiences of bullying have been found to contribute to adulthood anxiety and depression (Roth, Coles, &amp; Heimberg, 2002) and increased self-harm, violent behavior, and psychotic symptoms in adolescence (Arseneault &amp; Shakoor, 2010). Despite the unfortunate effects of bullying, many adults may hold expectations about how bullying victims should respond to this injustice, especially if the victim is a male. Masculine honor is an ideology in which men are expected to respond with aggression to threats or insults against themselves, family, or property (Cohen, 1998). We contend that masculine honor beliefs may help explain perceptions of bullies as well as possible expectations for bullying victims in responding to the bully. As our lab has previously shown, we expect that male victims will be expected to confront their bully violently, while female victims will not be expected to violently confront their bully. We expect that masculine honor beliefs will be associated with more negative perceptions of the bully, and the victim, unless the victim defends themselves violently rather than ignoring the threat or deferring the problem to a teacher or parent (especially young boys compared to girls) (O’Dea, Chalman, Castro Bueno, &amp; Saucier, 2018; O’Dea, Martens, &amp; Saucier, 2019).",3sfqt,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/3sfqt/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Adults over the age of eighteen will be recruited through Amazon’s CloudPrime software to complete a survey on Qualtrics.

Simulating the impact of the Gran Cruzada using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST),"Stunting is one of the most important child health issues globally. Guatemala has among the world’s highest prevalence of child stunting. In February 2020, the new Guatemalan government released the latest national nutrition strategy, the Gran Cruzada Nacional por la Nutrición. Like prior national nutrition strategies, the Gran Cruzada prioritizes scaling-up evidence-based, cost-effective preventative interventions delivered in the “1,000 days window.” 

Yet, the Gran Cruzada’s impact is uncertain. Nutrition interventions tend to have small effect sizes on linear growth in trials. Population coverage of interventions in Guatemala historically has been inconsistent. Finally, even with coverage improvements, it is not clear if the Gran Cruzada can reach its ambitious goals for child stunting, anemia, and other nutrition indicators.

Objective
This study aims to estimate the impact of the implementation of Guatemala’s new national nutrition policy, the Gran Cruzada. Realistic estimates of impact will be useful to nutrition policymakers and advocates in Guatemala who work to improve stunting. We plan to disseminate this work broadly in Guatemala and publish results as a peer-reviewed manuscript. 

Methods:
This study will use the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) to simulate policy implementation of the Gran Cruzada. LiST is a widely used modeling tool that uses publicly available data and intervention effect sizes to project maternal and child outcomes including stunting.

The primary outcomes of interest will be between-model changes in stunting prevalence and absolute number of stunted children ages 0-5 years. Secondary outcomes will include child mortality, maternal mortality, and anemia in women of reproductive age. Each of these outcomes corresponds with key nutrition indicators in the Gran Cruzada. We also plan to investigate the relative contribution of each intervention to these outcomes.

Overall, we plan to simulate multiple policy scenarios below. 

1. Static intervention coverage	4. Delayed implementation of Gran Cruzada
2. Continuation of historical trends	5. Scale-up to wealthiest quantile
3. Gran Cruzada scale-up by 2024	6. Aspirational coverage

Continuation of historical trends (model 2) will be based on regression models projecting future coverage expansion. The models will use population-averaged historical survey data in Guatemala and other sources recommended in LiST. We plan to fit logistic curves for coverage inputs and shift the trendline so that our projections match the most recent data available. Similar LiST forecasting method have been described previously. The key assumption of model 2 is that future coverage changes are predicted by past coverage trends.",2nu87,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2nu87/contributors/?format=json,,[],2kba7

Do the Spatial and Kinematic Properties of Facial Expressions Influence Emotion Recognition in Autism Spectrum Disorders?,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by difficutlies in social communication, and restricted and repetitive interests (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Given that the ability to infer emotion from facial expressions is crucial for social interaction, emotion recognition has long been suspected to be a core difficulty within ASD (Hobson, 1986). However, whilst many studies suggest a disparity in the facial expression recognition ability of autistic and neurotypical individuals (Ashwin, Chapman, Colle, &amp; Baron‐Cohen, 2006; Dziobek, Bahnemann, Convit, &amp; Heekeren, 2010; Lindner &amp; Rosén, 2006; Philip et al., 2010), there have been inconsistent findings, ranging from no differences between autistic and neurotypical individuals to large disparities (see Keating &amp; Cook, in press, and Uljarevic &amp; Hamilton, 2012 for reviews). Despite these inconsistencies, the evidence largely suggests that there are differences in facial expression recognition between autistic and neurotypical individuals. 

Only recently has there been a shift towards using dynamic depictions of faces (which include kinematic information) as opposed to static stimuli to assess facial expression recognition. Indeed, studies that employ dynamic tasks are profoundly under-represented in meta-analyses investigating the emotion recognition of autistic individuals (Keating &amp; Cook, in press.). This may be problematic given that naturally occurring facial expressions are inherently dynamic, and therefore may have greater ecological validity (Uljarevic &amp; Hamiltom, 2013; Krumhuber, Kappas &amp; Manstead, 2013). Amongst the few studies that have examined the influence of facial movement kinematics on emotion perception, there is a consensus that there are differences between autistic and neurotypical individuals. For instance, Sato and colleagues (2013) found that autistic children were more likely to rate slow-moving morphs as ‘natural’ looking than neurotypical children. Another study had a professional actress display emotional (joy, surprise, sadness and disgust), and non-emotional (porunication of A, O, I, and tongue protrusion) expressions slowly (Tardif et al., 2008). The speed of these videos were then manipulated to give three conditions (very-slow, slow, and normal). Importantly, in their post-hoc analyses, Tardif and colleagues (2008) identified that the autistic individuals had superior emotion recognition in the slow relative to the normal speed condition. 

The findings of these behavioural investigations resonate well with those from neurophysiological studies. Generally, this literature suggests that autistic individuals, relative to neurotypicals, exhibit slowed processing of static face images as indexed by N170 latency (see Kang et al., 2018 for a summary). As a whole, the evidence suggests that autistic individuals may experience improved emotion recognition for slow moving faces. However, more research employing dynamic stimuli is necessary to confirm the assertion that autistic individuals have better emotion recognition for slowed facial stimuli. 

A parallel literature concerns emotion recognition from body movements. Here it has been suggested that kinematic aspects of bodily movement contribute to emotion recognition, and may underpin the differences in emotion recognition between autistic and neurotypical individuals. Indeed evidence of this comes from studies using point-light displays (PLD)- a set of moving dots that convey biological motion. One study manipulated these PLDs in terms of acceleration and had participants rate the naturalness of the displayed movements (Lee &amp; Chang, 2019). This study found a robust association between performance on this biological motion naturalness task and attention switching domain scores on the AQ (Lee &amp; Chang, 2019). Therefore, it seems that kinematics may be implicated in the emotion recognition differences between those high and low in ASD traits. 

Indeed, recent developments in the face processing literature emphasize the importance of kinematic cues in emotion recognition. One study demonstrated this by utilisng point-light displays of the face (known as PLFs) which had been manipulated to achieve three spatial levels (S1 – 50% spatial; S2 – 100%; S3 – 150%) and three kinematic levels (K1 – 50% speed; K2 – 100%; K3 – 150%) (Sowden et al., under review). This study revealed that intensity ratings, given by neurotypical participants, were modulated as a function of both spatial and kinematic cues. Specifically, at the S1 and K1 levels (i.e. with less spatial movement/ lower speed), participants rated the PLFs as more intensely sad, and less intensely angry and happy, and at the S3 and K3 levels (i.e. with  more spatial movement/ greater speed), they rated the PLFs as less intensely sad, and more intensely angry and happy (Sowden et al., under review). This novel PLF task has great utility for investigating facial expression recognition as it eliminates contrast, texture, colour and luminance cues (e.g. a flushed face or tears), and other information (e.g. identity) that can be seen in photograph stimuli. Hence, this task allows us to investigate the importance of the kinematic and spatial aspects of facial expressions without these factors confounding the results. To the best of our knowledge it is also the first task which can index independent contributions of both spatial and kinematic cues in facial emotion recognition. Therefore, the present study will utilise dynamic face stimuli, that have been manipulated kinematially and spatially (Sowden et al., under review) to identify whether, compared to neurotypical individuals, those with ASD exhibit differences in processing the kinematic and/or spatial properties of facial expressions.

Alexithymia
When discussing the facial expression recognition of autistic individuals, it is also crucial to consider the role of alexithymia. Alexithymia is a subclinical condition characterized by difficulties identifying and expressing emotions (Kooiman, Spinhoven &amp; Trijsburg, 2002). Whilst the incidence of alexithymia in the neurotypical population is 13% (Salminen et al., 1999), in the autistic population these rates are elevated, with 40- 65% of autistic adults meeting criteria (Berthoz &amp; Hill, 2005; Hill, Berthoz &amp; Frith, 2004). 

Whilst some research has suggested that autistic individuals exhibit differences relative to neurotypicals in recognizing others’ emotion, there are considerable individual differences – not everyone with an autism diagnosis exhibit face processing differences (Harms, Martin &amp; Wallace, 2010; Uljarevic &amp; Hamilton, 2012). It has been proposed that alexithymia, and not autistic traits, may account for the reported impairments in facial emotion recognition, and this could explain the inconsistencies in previous research (Bird and Cook, 2013). Indeed the “alexithymia hypothesis” (Bird and Cook, 2013) postulates that alexithymia underpins the individual differences in emotion processing that are seen in the ASD population such that intact emotion recognition is typical in individuals that have an autism diagnosis without co-ocurring alexithymia . Indeed, this hypothesis is supported by the finding that there are no differences in facial expression recognition between autistic participants and neurotypicals when the two groups are matched in terms of alexithymia (Cook, Brewer, Shah, &amp; Bird, 2013). Moreover when the variables of this study were examined continuously, it was found that possessing alexithymic traits, but not autistic traits, was predictive of poorer performance on emotion recognition and empathy tasks (Cook, Brewer, Shah, &amp; Bird, 2013). Thus overall, it appears that alexithymia is heavily implicated in differences in facial expression recognition that are commonly (but not universally) documented within ASD populations. 

The current study
First participants will complete various questionnaires including the Autism Quotient (AQ; Baron-Cohen, et al., 2006), and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS; Bagby, et al., 1994). Next, participants will complete Sowden et al’s (under review) facial expression recognition task. In this task, participants will rate PLF (point-light face) stimuli regarding the extent to which they appear happy, angry and sad. These PLFs vary in emotion (happy, angry and sad), and have been adapted to achieve three spatial movement levels (S1 – 50% spatial movement; S2 – 100%; S3 – 150%) and three kinematic (speed) levels (K1 – 50% speed; K2 – 100%; K3 – 150%). Then, participants will complete two adapted PLF tasks in which they rate the naturalness of facial expressions that have been manipulated spatially and kinematically. Finally, participants will complete the Matrix Reasoning Item Bank (MaRs-IB; Chierchia et al. 2019), which assesses non-verbal reasoning.",kpefz,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kpefz/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Participants aged 18-65, will be recruited to take part in the study.

Coronavirus Risk Perception,"Covid-19 is a highly-contagious, novel coronavirus disease that originated as a local outbreak in Wuhan (Hubei, China) in December 2019 and is now classified as a world pandemic by the WHO with over half a million confirmed cases in the United States (US) at the time of this preregistration (Dong, Du, &amp; Gardner, 2020). Risk perceptions play a crucial role in preventative health behavior (Ferrer &amp; Klein, 2015) and there is vast evidence that individuals express optimistic bias, an underestimation of health risks in comparison to others (Helweg-Larsen &amp; Shepperd, 2001). This study will explore risk perceptions for coronavirus in real-time as the pandemic unfolds among a representative sample of US adults recruited via Prolific.

Expressions of negative affect are utilised by third-party observers to classify an action as inappropriate and to infer what makes it inappropriate.

Considering the antecedents of those emotions in a normative context, we expect the two expressions to impose diverging group values, and different outcomes on perceptions of warmth and competence characteristics. In a within-subjects design participants will be exposed to short written vignettes depicting Person A engaging in an ambiguous behaviour and group member B observing and/or reacting with gratitude, admiration or neutral reaction.

This causal knowledge allows us to predict future events and perform actions to generate desired outcomes [1-2]. However, acquiring such knowledge directly from the world is costly in both time and effort [3-4]. Thus, it is vital to transmit already acquired causal knowledge effectively, in order to facilitate quick decision-making and advance collective understanding [5-6]. 

The present study explores visualizations as a means overcoming these limitations by conveying causal knowledge in a condensed, exportable format over large gaps in space and time. We capitalize on prior work that has examined how the spatial layout of elements in well-designed visualizations mirrors the placement and relations of elements in the physical world, making it easier to grasp the correspondence among elements in each domain [7-10]. Visualizations have also been shown to promote inference of abstract relations by leveraging a small set of relational symbols, such as lines and arrows [11-12]. 

In particular, participants will draw simple machines (gears, levers, and pulleys), which comprise a unique class of objects that can be rich in both visual appearance and causal information. The study thus explores how prompts to generate visual explanations (e.g., of how a machine functions) or visual depictions (e.g., of what a machine looks like) may affect what participants choose to include in their drawings. Specifically, the study probes drawing behavior by examining how factors such as ink usage, number of strokes, and drawing time differ between conditions.",q3s5n,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/q3s5n/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Drawing Data Collection\nWe plan to include 50 English-speaking adults.

Do Binaural Beats affect Vigilance?,"Binaural Beats have two different frequency tones which oscillate to produce different effects. Each of these beats operates in different frequencies thus having different sound production: theta, delta, alpha, beta, and gamma. In the experiment beta Binaural Beats with frequencies of 200 and 216 Hertz, Hz (unit of measurement for frequency), were used with a control of 200 Hz flat noise. The experiment utilized the psychomotor vigilance task to measure changes in response times and utilized Affectiva to measure changes in facial musculature. The response times were then analyzed to explain why the Binaural Beats condition had significantly shorter response times compared to the control group throughout the task. In terms of emotional change, some trends were noticed for the Binaural Beats and the control condition; however, none of the trends were significant. Moving forward with the experiment, an increased number of participants can be recorded to strengthen the validity and test different frequencies of Binaural Beats for accuracy.",xaywg,True,False,Prereg Challenge,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xaywg/contributors/?format=json,We will collect students until we have reached about 210 participants in total.

Grit is defined as the propensity to sustain the interest and effort needed to achieve long-term goals (e.g. passion + perseverance). We predict that Grit will be seen more in students who are highly involved on campus. These involved students will also show high academic self-efficacy, which could indicate grit is a moderating factor in the relationship between academic self-efficacy and campus engagement.

"The ""Food Studies"" Corpus","This dataset is part of a study that used scoping review methodology to collect and verify the applicability of the phrase ""Food Studies"" in bibliographic records across five databases. Five large bibliographic databases were identified for size, relevance to food studies, and subject metadata standards. These were ProQuest Central (PQC), EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS), Web Of Science (WOS), PubMed (PM), and PubAg. The phrase “food studies” was then searched within each database, using a scholarly or peer-reviewed filter. The date range for the articles was all-time, through the date of the final search (December 3, 2019.) 

Each database’s search results were exported, transferred, and pooled into bibliographic management software (EndNote). Using endnote, the author verified “food studies” in the metadata, and prepared the metadata for screening. (No deduplication methods were used in this or the next phase because metadata can differ between duplicates.) Eligibility criteria for results were determined to be any peer-reviewed article’s record that contained data in its keyword, index term, subject, or heading fields, and had the phrase “food studies” anywhere in its metadata. 

The results were then imported into ES management software (Covidence), where all records were screened for relevance or irrelevance. Two major exclusion parameters were used in this phase.

Does providing authors with customized article templates including items from reporting guidelines improve completeness of reporting? A randomized trial,"There is evidence that, although most reputable medical journals endorse the use of reporting guidelines, authors still find it difficult to identify the most appropriate one and use it effectively to improve the completeness of their article.  

We have developed an online tool called GoodReports (www.goodreports.org) to help researchers find and use reporting guidelines. The tool currently helps researchers identify the most appropriate single reporting guideline (e.g., CONSORT, STROBE, or PRISMA) and delivers an online, editable checklist that can also be downloaded. The checklist can be annotated to indicate where in the manuscript each item has been reported, then submitted to a journal alongside an article manuscript. However, pilot data collected as part of a collaboration with a medical journal indicated that when a checklist was delivered immediately before submission, it did not lead to authors making significant additions to their manuscript.  

Therefore, we plan to 

1. Develop the functionality of the GoodReports tool to deliver an article template to be used during writing. 

2. Combine items from more than one reporting guideline into a single article template, where appropriate.

PSA [006] - Moral thinking across the world,"Research on moral reasoning is centered around moral dilemmas in which deontological perspectives (emphasizing individual rights) are in conflict with consequentialist reasoning (also referred to as utilitarian; following the greater good). A central finding of this field is that people in certain situations are more likely do go with deontological considerations, while in other cases they are more likely to decide based on consequentialist reasons. In their seminal article, Greene et al. (2009) tried to investigate the effect of situational and psychological factors (e.g., intent of the agent, or physical contact between the agent and victim) on people’s moral decisions, but their work could not explore the effect of a potentially important component: culture. Therefore, the goal of the present research proposal is to empirically test the universality of utilitarian and deontological responding by directly replicating Greene et al.’s experiments on non-WEIRD samples as well as to explore the influence of culture and economic status on moral reasoning.",pwtaj,True,False,Registered Report Protocol Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/pwtaj/contributors/?format=json,,[],efy2w

Backlash against gender-deviating children,"Gender backlash is typically characterized as social and economic penalties for men and women when they do not conform to prescriptive and proscriptive gender stereotypes (Sullivan, Moss-Racusin, &amp; Williams, 2018; Prentice &amp; Carranza, 2002). Importantly, these gender stereotypes dictate how men and women should and must behave—women must be communal (supportive, nurturing), while men must be agentic (independent, possess leadership qualities). Research suggests that when women take on leadership roles, communicate with an assertive demeanor, and exhibit self-promoting behavior, they are perceived less favorably than men (Rudman &amp; Glick, 2008; Bosak, Rudman, Kulich, &amp; Kinahan, 2016; Infanger, Rudman, &amp; Sczesny, 2016; Rudman, Moss-Racusin, Phelan, &amp; Nauts, 2012). Although dominant women are perceived as high in competence, they are viewed as unlikable, suggesting that women who act in accordance with gender stereotypes are viewed as incompetent, but likable (Rudman &amp; Glick, 2008; Bosak et al., 2016). This emphasizes the gender paradox women face— when women are dominant, they are viewed as unlikable, but when they are communal, they are viewed as incompetent, but likable. While most research has focused on backlash against women, Heilman and Wallen (2009) found that men are penalized as much as women when they do not conform to gender stereotypes. Research demonstrates that men are viewed as less competent when they are other-advocating rather than self-advocating in a work environment, when they violate gender stereotypes, and when they display feminine qualities (Bosac et al., 2016, Moss-Racusin &amp; Johnson, 2016, Moss-Racusin, 2014, Rudman &amp; Glick, 2008). Specifically, one study found that men who exemplify more feminine characteristics are less likely to receive financial rewards because they are viewed unfavorably by adults (Rudman &amp; Glick, 2008). This pressure to be both strong and unemotional influences men’s mental and physical health, suggesting that backlash drastically deters men from counter-stereotypic behaviors (Levant &amp; Pollack, 1995). In general, it appears that backlash effects are stronger for men than women (men face penalties for pre- and proscriptions and women may only face effects from violating proscriptions). While backlash effects are robust in the adult literature, only one study to date has focused on backlash against children who violate gender stereotypes. Sullivan and colleges (2018) sought to explore how adults perceive children who violate gender stereotypes. Consistent with adult research, they found that there were a large number of prescriptive and descriptive traits for boys and girls governing how children are supposed to behave. Importantly, when displaying feminine characteristics, boys were rated as significantly less likable than girls and their traits were perceived as undesirable. Additionally, they found that political orientation and sexist beliefs both predicted backlash in term of likability, willingness to interact with the children, and perceptions of the children’s parents. While this study explored perceptions of gender deviating kids, it remains unknown how adults perceive parental responses to children’s gender deviant behavior. In study 1, we found that parents were viewed as incompetent and unlikable when they punished their children for gender deviance. In addition, both girls and boys were rated as likable even when they behaved in counter stereotypic ways. However, it remains unclear if the salience of children’s gender deviant behavior was apparent. Therefore, we hope to explore if the inclusion of more specific behavior will influence adult’s perception of parents when they punish gender deviance. In all three conditions, the children will exhibit gender deviant behavior and the parents will either affirm the behavior (affirmation), confront the child (backlash), or not respond (control).",jzg8v,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/jzg8v/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': ""Participants will be recruited from Amazon's TurkPrime software and will complete the study on Qualtrics online survey software.

"Parenthood and Health: Measuring the Effects of Maternity Leave, Paternity Leave, and Child Care","The birth of a child dramatically changes parents’ lives. Lack of sleep, new social roles, emotional stressors, and neurobiological changes for both mothers and fathers all impact parents’ health and well-being. If health suffers after a baby arrives in the home, at what point, if ever, does health recover? Do parental support policies, such as maternity leave, paternity leave, or subsidized childcare, improve outcomes? These questions are difficult to answer due to limits in longitudinal data collection. It is hard to track large numbers of parents over time consistently, particularly in conjunction with external variation in family support policies. To examine how these policies affect health, we need detailed, consistent, longitudinal health data matched to births that happen in different policy periods. 

U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) administrative records provide a novel opportunity to explore the impacts of family support policies. The DoD is the world’s largest employer, with rich data covering a significant portion of the U.S. population. It offers active-duty service members paid caregiver leave and subsidized childcare, though the quantity and availability of both have varied over time. As such, the DoD presents a unique chance to study the effects of several policies on repeated, consistent measures of health including inpatient and outpatient medical care, physical health, mental health, and substance use.",v4pdn,True,False,Preregistration Template from AsPredicted.org,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/v4pdn/contributors/?format=json,,[],s97rh

Test can facilitate forgetting of tested items.,"Previous research has shown that taking a test facilitates memory retention on later retesting, although facilitation is stronger when retesting is delayed. On the basis of the finding that testing prevents later forgetting without affecting memory recovery, we investigate immediate effects of taking a test on retrievability of a tested item. In experiment, participants recall studied items, then perform a retest of the studied items (test condition) and a non-episodic-memory task (distractor condition), and immediately afterward re-recall the items. The test condition should elicit more item losses than the distractor condition, whereas there are no condition differences in the number of item gains. These results would suggest that taking a test on a target item facilitates forgetting of the very same item for a short interval of time, a possible reason for the late appearance of the testing effect.

The Effect of Partisan Conflict and Game Frames on COVID-19 Attitudes and Behaviors,"Political Communications scholars have long noted – and generally bemoaned – the tendency for the media to cover political issues using “partisan conflict” or “game” frame (Patterson 1993, Capella and Jameison 1997, Paterson 2015). Partisan conflict frames describe political events as sites for conflict between the two parties (Han and Federico 2017). Partisan game frames take this a step further, describing political events in terms of who “won” or “lost,” instead of in terms of the events’ substantive importance (Patterson 1993). This coverage, sometimes referred to as “horse-race” coverage in the context of political campaigns, is thought to reflect a reflex among journalists to see politics as a game played by key individuals to gain personal power and advancement (Weaver 1972). While game-frame coverage is most studied in political campaigns, it is a common element of most political news, including coverage of Congress, the President, and even the bureaucracy (Lichter and Amundonson 1994, Lawrence 2000, Cohen 2008). Game frame coverage has been blamed for producing a less-informed public, creating cynicism and reducing public interest in government, and of warping the issue agenda by emphasizing issues that are controversial over those that are substantively important. Frames that emphasize partisan wins and losses also exacerbate affective polarization by turning politics into a game played by two side trying to win rather than an attempt by disagreeing actors to arrive at good public policy (Han and Federico 2017, 2018). Apologists for game frame coverage argue that emphasizing the competitive aspects of politics increases political interest by producing journalism that is more compelling.

What happens, however, when the journalistic instinct to frame issues as in terms of conflict runs into a global public health crisis such as the one created by COVID-19? Conflict and game frame coverage of political campaigns can be justified by the fact that elections are, in fact, contests with winners and losers. This can hardly be said about the response to COVID-19, where we might hope that policy response will be guided by scientific experts to minimize harm to the public. Yet, while the federal government’s legislative response to COVID-19 has been characterized by a previously unthinkable amount of partisan unity, the pandemic has been the occasion for considerable partisan in-fighting as well. Democrats’ messaging strategy around the pandemic has emphasized quick action to stem the pandemic, but also sharp criticism of Republican officeholders’ response to this threat. Some Republicans, on the other hand, have attempted to downplay the threat posed by COVID-19, while criticizing Democrats for either politicizing the pandemic or fumbling the response in states with Democratic governors. These conflicts provide the opportunity for journalists to employ game or partisan conflict frames in their coverage of the pandemic, turning the issue from a global health threat into a partisan issue. Indeed, polling shows sizable gaps between Republicans and Democrats in concern about the COVID-19, as well as health behaviors and policy preferences in response to the pandemic (Gadarian, Goodman, and Pepinsky 2020).

In this article we evaluate the effect of game or conflict frames on public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesize that conflict framing, and especially game framing, will exacerbate the partisan divide in concern about the pandemic, support for drastic action to reduce its spread, and willingness to engage in personal actions to avoid contracting or disseminating the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Further, we test whether these frames increase cynicism about and reduce trust in the government’s ability to respond to the pandemic. Finally, we test the hypothesis, suggested by defenders of game framing in political campaigns, that these frames increase interest in the issue, as compared to coverage that does not frame the pandemic in game or conflict terms. We evaluate these using a framing experiment in which individuals are randomly assigned to read newspaper articles that frame legislative action in response to the pandemic using game frames, conflict frames, or a substantive frame that emphasizes the substantive effects of the policy.",6aehg,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6aehg/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Participants will be 3,711 subjects recruited by Lucid to take part in a “Study on COVID-19 Coverage.” We use Lucid’s measure of party identification to classify participants as Republicans or Democrats, including leaners as partisans.

Manipulation von IAT-Effekten durch evaluatives Lernen - Eine Überprüfung mit dem ReAL Modell,"Former studies showed that implicit attitudes/IAT-effects can not just be manipulated by experience based learning procedures (e.g. evaluative conditioning) but also by presentation of verbal evaluative statements. Though this can hardly be explained by dual-process theories of evaluative processes, which form the basis of the IAT, these results can raise the question, which processes underlie the IAT and its effects. One can assume that in addition to implicit attitudes there are further processes that can effect subject's behavior in the IAT-procedure. Replicating the effects of repeated evaluative pairings (evaluative conditioning) and evaluative statements on IAT by using the ReAL-Model of the IAT, could promote a better understanding of the particular processes that are effected by these manipulations. The ReAL-Model can discriminate between 4 processes which drive behavior that leads to an IAT-Effect: the Recoding of the task in the compatible block of the IAT, the associations between target and attribute, and the Label-based identification of the correct response. There is the hypothesis, that the two types of manipulation have a differential effect on those processes.",zbkyn,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/zbkyn/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,[],x895h

Profiles of Major Life Events,"Research on major life events (MLEs) has often ascribed life events certain characteristics (e.g., marriage has a positive valence) without thoroughly examining these claims. This led to two problems: First, any variation in how people experience MLEs was disregarded because each event was ascribed one typical profile. It is, for example, often assumed that all marriages are the same instead of considering individual variations in people’s perception of this event. Second, this typical profile was often created by one or few expert raters without examining how it relates to the actual perceptions of people experiencing the MLE. In this study, we will collect ratings of characteristics of MLEs from external (lay-)raters to examine how these external ratings relate to event characteristics as they are perceived by those who actually experienced the MLE.

To do so, we will compare data on perceived characteristics of MLEs from three sources:
- Ratings of individual perceptions of event characteristics of MLEs by persons who have actually recently experienced it (henceforth: in situ ratings)
- Ratings of individual perceptions of event characteristics by persons who have not experienced it (henceforth: individual ex situ ratings)
Instructions approximately “Imagine you would experience the following life event: _______. How would you probably perceive it?” 
- Ratings of typical perceptions of event characteristics by external raters (henceforth: generalized ex situ ratings): 
Instructions approximately “How do you think young adults experiencing the life event __________ typically perceive it?” 


These data will be used to examine the following research questions. 

1. Research questions regarding in situ ratings:
- How are characteristics of MLEs on average perceived in situ?
- How much do individual in situ perceptions of event characteristics vary within an MLE?
- Are there differences in the variability of perceptions of event characteristics between MLEs or between event characteristic dimensions?

2. Research questions regarding generalized and individual ex situ ratings:  
- How are characteristics of MLEs on average perceived ex situ?
- How much do ex situ raters agree in their ratings of characteristics of MLEs?
- Are there differences in the cross-rater agreement between MLEs or between event characteristic dimensions? 

3. Research questions regarding the relation between the different types of ratings:
- Are there differences between the means of in situ ratings, individual ex situ ratings, and generalized ex situ ratings of characteristics of MLEs?
- Are there differences between the variances of in situ ratings, individual ex situ ratings, and generalized ex situ ratings of characteristics of MLEs?",jmb5z,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/jmb5z/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Data from several studies will be used for this project.

"Replication of Cialdini et al., 1990, Study 3","We are conducting a replicating of Study 2 from Cialdini, Reno and Kallgren (1990). The study investigates conformity to social norms via norm activation (i.e. salience). We are interested in three conditions of Study 2, namely the clean condition, 1 piece of litter, and fully littered condition (conceptually replicated by Cialdinis et al, 1990 Study 3).
 
Study 2 supported that participants are more likely to litter as the amount of littering increases in the environment. Importantly, Study 2 found that people were least likely to litter in a condition including one single piece of litter rather than the clean environment.

The authors explained the effects as saliency of descriptive norms, such that a fully littered environment signals that other people are littering in this environment, while a clean environment signals that people do not litter in this environment. The one piece of litter also signals that other people do not litter in this environment, but the norm is made more salient in this condition than the clean condition due to the one person who has littered. Hence, saliency of the anti-litter norm is strongest in the setting with one piece of litter.

We are replicating this study in a supermarket: placing fliers on “self-scanners”, manipulating the environment (clean, 1 littered flier, and 8 littered fliers), and observing participants frequency of littering the flier.",d65t8,True,False,"Replication Recipe (Brandt et al., 2013): Pre-Registration",False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/d65t8/contributors/?format=json,,[],vd6uk
Exploring cancer patient needs for personalized statistical information,"In this study, we aim to investigate the boundaries of general and personalised statistical information for cancer patients. From earlier research we know that patients increasingly use the internet as a source for information about their disease such as incidence, treatment options, survival outcomes or quality of life after treatments. Usually, such information is communicated by using statistics. With the improvement of technology, such statistical information can be tailored by using characteristics of the individual patient. What is unclear however is if patients actually want to receive such personalised statistics. Additionally, research has shown that information coping styles, levels of anxiety and numeracy skills can all influence general information needs. In this study, we aim to explore cancer patient need for both general and personalised statistical information.

Therefore, the aim of this research is twofold: (1) to investigate the needs of cancer patients for receiving personalized statistical information about treatment outcomes, and (2) to determine how individual difference factors of patients (e.g., information coping style, numerical skills, and anxiety levels) are related to their needs.

The main research questions of our project are:
RQ 1: What are cancer patient needs for receiving general and personalized statistical information about treatment outcomes?
RQ2: How do individual difference factors relate to cancer patient needs for receiving personalized statistical information about treatment outcomes?",48yz9,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/48yz9/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,"['Anxiety', 'Cancer', 'Data science', 'Individual differences', 'Information coping style', 'Information needs', 'Information provision', 'Numeracy', 'Patients', 'Personalization', 'Personalized information', 'Risk communication', 'Shared decision-making', 'Statistical information']",qv35z
Altering the way we operationalize multiracials,"Recent research has found that biracial categorization accuracy is far below monoracial categorization accuracy. This is troublesome for both internal reliability and ecological validity. As a response to the lack of biracial categorizations and reliability in real biracial stimuli, we have developed a set of altered (“biracialized”) faces.

Our recent research has found that perceived “unusualness” or “distinctiveness” of the faces partially explains biracial categorization accuracy. If this is true, then enhanced unusual traits (e.g., eye color, freckles) and the interaction between traits (e.g., blue eyes with darker skin tone) may increase unusualness ratings. Our biracialized faces, altered in photoshop to enhance these unique features, might therefore be a solution to increase biracial categorization accuracy. 

The purpose of our research is to compare our biracialized stimulus set to existing biracial stimuli that are commonly used in the field. Existing research on the racial categorization of biracial individuals has heavily relied on the use of morphed faces to represent real biracial people (Minear &amp; Park, 2004; Peery &amp; Bodenhausen, 2008; Chen &amp; Hamilton, 2012). Morphed faces are usually created using morphing software (e.g. Fantamorph) and combine two monoracial parent faces to create 50/50 morphs. For example, morphs are commonly made by combining a Black face and a White face to create a Black-White biracial face. In morphed stimuli, hair is usually left out of the final image due to the unsatisfactory product of morphing two different hair styles. Therefore, we will test our biracialized stimuli against these cropped morphed faces. We will also test them against real biracial faces from a new expansion to the Chicago Face Database (Ma, Kantner, &amp; Wittenbrink, submitted for publication). 

 Moreover, we also want to examine the underlying factors resulting in categorization differences across face types. The traits we plan to examine are: attractive, unusual (would stand out in a crowd), feminine, baby-faced, and artificial-looking. These are based on existing research in the field and our prior research.",fhte2,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fhte2/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'We are collecting our data from the psychology student pool at our university.

The Beneficial Effects of Exercise Intervention for Mental Health:  An fMRI Activation Likelihood Estimation Meta-Analysis,"Abstract
Purpose: To first investigate the effects of exercise interventions on mental health through coordinate-based meta-analysis across neuroimaging studies, exploring relevant activated brain regions and interplay among them.
Methods: Literature search was conducted from an inception to March 2020, through four electronic databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, PsychInfo, and Embase).  After screening, a quantitative Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analysis was performed in 15 studies (19 experiments, 189 foci) with 593 participants to evaluate the contrast pre- versus post- exercise effects on mental health. Additionally, subgroup analyses for memory, executive function, intervention term and age group were carried on as well.
Results: Following the physical exercising intervention, the activation of the left cerebellar tonsil, the right precuneus and the right inferior frontal gyrus were increased while the activation of the right red nucleus, the right caudate head, the left precuneus and the right declive were decreased. Besides, primary activation in precuneus and red nucleus for memory, and cerebellar tonsil for executive function were also observed.
Conclusion: This article demonstrates that cerebrum, cerebellum (especially posterior lobe) and brainstem (red nucleus) all attribute to the improvement of mental health by exercise intervention via different pathways based on structural and functional evidences. Future diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of mental health illness should put the brain regions mentioned and their roles in network into full consideration, for it is what we usually neglect that may leave lasting impacts on patients’ daily living activities and quality of life.

Social isolation and vocabulary development: insights from families with varying SES (Polish),"Family socioeconomic status (SES) can indirectly influence child language development, as it is linked to the quantity and quality of speech heard by children (Hoff, 2003; Rowe, 2012). Discrepancies between low- and high-SES families in the quantity of language input may be as high as 30 million word tokens heard by a child over the first three years of life (Hart &amp; Risley, 1995). Such diminished quantity of speech heard by children directly impedes their early language development (Hart &amp; Risley, 1995) and has lasting consequences for their subsequent school outcomes (Hart &amp; Risley, 2003). However, since many Polish toddlers spend most of their waking time outside of home, in kindergartens or day cares, it is difficult to extract the influence of family SES on their development. Such opportunity came with the spread of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the general lockdown in Poland, which forced all the children to stay at home with the parents. In the present study we investigate home activities and parental interactions with 8-36 month-old infants and toddlers in families with various SES background. We compare children’s early vocabulary knowledge at the beginning of lockdown and after the kindergartens are re-opened. The present study is part of a larger international project “Social isolation and vocabulary development: insights from families with varying SES” (https://osf.io/3ayc6/).",4tuyp,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4tuyp/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': ""We will contact, via social media, Polish parents of infants and toddlers from 8 to 36 months of age and will invite them to take part in the current longitudinal study.

A Social Ecological Approach to Adolescent Mental Health in the Digital Age - An ABCD Study Analysis,"Adolescence is a dynamic time in development which is associated with enhanced opportunities and vulnerabilities due to vast physical, psychological, and social changes. A rising prevalence of depression and anxiety among adolescents in the U.S., with approximately 22% with severe impairments (Bose, 2017; NIMH, 2019), has evoked growing concerns around causes for this rise, especially considering the digital age. Adolescents are the largest adopters of technology, with approximately 95% having access to a mobile device, 71% using one or more social media platforms, and 45% claiming to be online “almost constantly” (Pew Research Center, 2018). While many studies have shown associations between screen time and poor mental health outcomes (Kırcaburun et al., 2018; Lemola et al., 2015; McBride, 2017; Sampasa-Kanyinga &amp; Lewis, 2015; Stiglic &amp; Viner, 2019; Twenge &amp; Campbell, 2018; Twenge et al., 2018), recent reviews of the literature show mixed and inconsistencies in these findings (Best et al., 2014; Odgers, 2018; Rideout, 2018; Sarmiento et al., 2018; Wartella et al., 2016). 

A recent rigorous analysis of large-scale datasets by Orben and Przybylski (2019) revealed associations between screen time and wellbeing in adolescents suggesting small effects sizes which can be comparable to many other possible and unrelated correlates to mental health outcomes in adolescents. This posits a greater consideration that must be made in statistical inferences in efforts to address the complex nature in the rise of internalizing behaviors such as depressive and anxiety symptoms in youth. 

Many established lines of research investigating predictors, beyond individual factors such as screen time (Odgers, 2018) and cognitive functioning (Shortt &amp; Spence, 2006), to poor mental health outcomes in adolescents include family (Sander &amp; McCarty, 2005) and peer factors (Garland &amp; Fitzgerald, 1998; MacPhee &amp; Andrews, 2006), school functioning (Juvonen et al., 2000; Fröjd et al., 2008), neighborhood (Aneshensel &amp; Sucoff, 1996) and community factors (Huynh &amp; Fuligni, 2010). This multi-level perspective echoes the social ecological framework (Bronfenbrenner &amp; Morris, 2006; Stokols, 2018), which recognizes the interplay of the various ecologies, proximal and distal to the individual, on mental health during this developmental period. The objective of this study is to investigate the social ecological factors associated with adolescent mental health in the digital age. Using a multimodal baseline dataset from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (Volkow et al., 2017), we will be able to characterize correlates to mental health outcomes of a diverse U.S. adolescent cohort, inclusive of the various ecological factors. The aims of this study are threefold: (1) to evaluate the associations between screen time and internalizing behaviors, (2) to evaluate the associations between multi-level ecological factors previously identified as risk factors for increases in internalizing behaviors among adolescents, and (3) explore differences in these associations stratified by socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups.",5j7yt,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/5j7yt/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Recruitment for this study is across 21 catchment areas in the mainland United States and data from children and parents are stored in the main data management site of University of California, San Diego.

Effectiveness of information-based versus structural interventions on food choices by socioeconomic position: a randomized controlled trial in an experimental online supermarket,"People of lower socioeconomic position (SEP) are more likely to have obesity than people of higher SEP and SEP inequities in obesity in Europe are widening (World Health Organization, 2014). Lower socioeconomic position (SEP) is associated with a more energy dense diet (Aggarwal et al., 2011; Monsivais &amp; Drewnowski, 2009). Consumption of more energy dense foods has been consistently linked to higher energy intake in experimental studies (Karl &amp; Roberts, 2014) and results from prospective cohort studies have shown a positive association between energy density (ED) of the total diet and BMI (Karl &amp; Roberts, 2014). Thus, the association between SEP and obesity may be mediated, in part, by the consumption of a more energy-dense diet (Drewnowski &amp; Specter, 2004). Interventions that reduce dietary energy density would benefit public health, particularly among people of lower SEP.

In the UK, 26% of the adults eat meals out one or more times per week and 20% eat takeaway meals at home one or more times per week, suggesting that the major part of the meals consists in food prepared at home (Goffe et al., 2017). People from lower SEP tend to spend a greater proportion of their average food expenditure on prepared-at-home produce (such as products purchased in supermarkets) as opposed to catering services than people of higher SEP (lowest equivalised disposable income decile group: 74% vs. highest: 60%) (Office for National Statistics, 2019). Thus, nutrition interventions targeting supermarket purchases provide an opportunity to benefit the diet of all of the population and people of lower SEP in particular.

Information-based nutrition interventions are one of the most common approaches to improving diet (Capewell &amp; Capewell, 2017; Frieden, 2010). An example of an information-based intervention is menu energy labelling in restaurants (VanEpps et al., 2016). This type of interventions has been suggested to be less effective among people of lower compared to higher SEP (Beauchamp et al., 2014; Sarink et al., 2016). However, systematic reviews of the impact of menu energy labelling has highlighted the limited quality of evidence supporting this hypothesis (Crockett et al., 2018; Sarink et al., 2016). It has been suggested that structural interventions that target core features of the food environment (i.e., reducing portion sizes, increasing the availability of heathier food options) and require individuals to use a low level of agency may be most effective and most equitable (Adams et al., 2016; Backholer et al., 2014; Capewell &amp; Capewell, 2017). However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support this hypothesis.

Information-based interventions typically rely on people being motivated by health in their food choices (Dubé &amp; Cantin, 2000). Yet, health may be a less influential motive for food choice among people of lower SEP (Pepper &amp; Nettle, 2017). Thus, SEP based differences in food choice motives, and notably health motivation, may explain why information-based interventions could be less effective among people of lower vs. higher SEP.

The aim of this study is to examine how an information-based intervention (labelling of lower ED food products) and a structural intervention (greater proportion of lower ED options in food product ranges) affect the ED of food purchases within a virtual online supermarket (Forwood et al., 2015) in participants of lower vs. higher SEP. The primary hypothesis is that labelling will reduce the ED of virtual online supermarket food purchases to a greater extent in participants of higher SEP vs. lower SEP. Conversely, we hypothesise that a greater proportion of lower ED options will decrease the ED of food purchases equally among participants of lower and higher SEP. The secondary hypothesis is that differences in health-based food choice motives in participants of lower vs. higher SEP will mediate the differential effect that ED labelling has on ED of food purchases among participants of lower vs. higher SEP.

Acupuncture for patients with GLP-1 RAs-induced nausea and vomiting: a systematic review protocol,"As the most common adverse effects, nausea and vomiting can be triggered by many treatment agents. Although not life-threatening, drug-induced nausea and vomiting affect the popularization of plenty of effective agents. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are a class of such agents.The GLP-1 RAs class agent has grown rapidly in the last decade due to its effects on lowering HbA1c and weight with a low risk of hypoglycemia. However, all GLP-1 RAs experiments report gastrointestinal side effects as most frequent adverse events among which nausea and vomiting rank first, negatively lowering quality of life thus reducing adherence to treatment. As an attractive option of Diabetes and Obesity, GLP-1 RAs deserves better application. If nausea and vomiting are well treated, this class agents can be used more properly and extensively.
Acupuncture is one of the essential parts of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which has been used for thousands of years. Accumulated evidence proved that acupuncture could properly treat nausea and vomiting caused by a variety of reasons.

Changes in inter-personal trust over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in China,"In the present project, we investigated how the COVID-19 pandemic affected inter-personal trust in a cultural context. We administered an explicit and implicit trustworthiness task to a sample of healthy individuals from China. During both tasks, individuals had to make trustworthiness decisions about other individuals who were either Caucasians or Chinese. However, no information was provided about the trustworthiness of the other individuals. As a consequence, the individuals had to base their trustworthiness decisions on the facial appearance of these individuals. 
As we were interested to learn how the COVID-19 pandemic changed individuals’ trustworthiness decisions, we administered the tasks at different time points of the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing a longitudinal and cross-sectional study design, the tasks were administered before the first confirmed cases of the COVID-19 (t0: October 2019 to December 2019) pandemic and after the decline of the COVID-19 pandemic (t1: March 2020). For the cross-sectional study design, we administered the tasks to 100 individuals at t0 and 100 individuals at t1. For the longitudinal study design, we re-administered the tasks at t1 to the 100 individuals that already completed the task at t0. 
It is important to note that COVID-19 pandemic and its impact differed markedly between these time points. Whereas there was an increase in COVID-19 infections from December 2019 to January 2020, there was a decrease in COVID-19 infections from February 2020 to March 2020. However, the dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic differed between Eastern countries like China and Western countries like Germany. The number of new infections decreased from December 2019 to March 2020 in Eastern countries but the number of new infections in Western countries increased from December 2019 to March 2020. Paralleling this change in infection rates, there was an increase of new infections in China from external visitors to China, including people Western cultures who entered China since February 2020 (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/china-reports-no-domestic-cases-of-coronavirus-for-first-time-since-outbreak-began). Media articles reported that as a consequence, there was an increase in prejudices / xenophobia against Western individuals in China since February 2020 (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/china-coronavirus-anti-foreigner-feeling-imported-cases). This increase in prejudices may be driven by evolutionary models of disease transmission that state that prejudices constitute a protective mechanism against diseases that are transmitted by unknown and unfamiliar individuals (Neuberg, Kenrick, &amp; Schaller, 2011). Based on these models it can be hypothesized that individuals’ performance on the implicit and explicit trustworthiness tasks towards should change throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. More precisely, it could be expected that the COVID-19 pandemic led to less favorable trustworthiness decisions for Caucasian than Chinese individuals. We, thus, hypothesized that Chinese individuals would display less trust towards Caucasian than Chinese individuals over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.",dsf84,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dsf84/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Using public advertisement, we recruited healthy individuals from a student population in China.

Socioeconomic position and the effect of kcal labelling and PACE labelling on self-served portion size,"Socio-economic position (SEP) has a key-role in health and several studies have highlighted differences in dietary behaviour between people of lower and higher SEP as potential mediators of this relationship (Giskes et al., 2010; Mackenbach et al., 2019; Pigeyre et al., 2016). It has been shown that people of lower SEP are more likely to behave in ways that increase the likelihood of developing cardiovascular diseases and obesity (e.g., higher consumption of meat and fatty foods, alcohol consumption and smoking) (Adler et al., 1994; Méjean et al., 2013). In developed countries, the prevalence of obesity and other chronic diseases has dramatically increased within all the socio-economic groups (WHO/FAO Expert Consultation, 2003) but to a larger extent among poorer and less educated groups (Burkert et al., 2013). This social gradient might be explained by lower SEP being associated with increased energy intake (Cardel et al., 2016; Sim et al., 2018; Wijayatunga et al., 2019).

Nutritional labelling is one of the most common intervention that has been implemented to reduce energy intake (Crockett et al., 2018). Nutritional labels provide consumers with different types of information (e.g. nutritional composition, energy content) in various ways (e.g. numerical, daily recommended intake, traffic lights) and may have a positive impact on food choices and energy intake (Crockett et al., 2018). However, Sarink et al. (2016) investigated the impact of kcal labelling in people of lower vs. higher SEP and showed that it may benefit more people of higher SEP than people of lower SEP, which may in turn increase health inequalities (Sarink et al., 2016).

A novel form of labelling is Physical Activity Calorie Equivalent (PACE) which may be an alternative to numerical energy labelling (Daley et al., 2019). PACE labelling aims to encourage healthier eating behaviours by providing an interpretation of the energy content of a food in terms of energy expenditure: how many minutes (time) or how many kilometres/miles (distance) of physical activity (e.g. walking, running, swimming, bicycle) are needed to burn off the corresponding energy (Daley et al., 2019). PACE might be easier to understand compared to other nutritional labels because consumers do not need health literacy or have advanced numeracy skills to understand PACE (Reale &amp; Flint, 2016). However, in a recent study, Antonelli &amp; Viera (2015) showed a stronger effect of PACE among people of higher compared to lower SEP, in particular among richer people (Antonelli &amp; Viera, 2015).

The food choices of people of higher SEP are more motivated by health than those of people of lower SEP (Konttinen et al., 2012). As information-based interventions typically rely on people being motivated by health in their food choices (Dubé &amp; Cantin, 2000), the presence of nutritional labels may lead to healthier eating behaviours primarily among people of higher SEP.

Primary objective

To investigate the effect of labelling (kcal or PACE) on the total self-served energy among participants of lower and higher SEP.

Secondary objective

To investigate the psychological processes that may explain the different effect of the intervention and whether health motivation and physical activity level mediate the differential effect of labelling (kcal or PACE) on total self-served energy among participants of lower and higher SEP.

legal youth gambling April 2020,"The UK is unique in having allowed under 18s to legally engage in a number of gambling or “gambling-like” activities for a number of years.

This is a retrospective study correlating recollected usage of these legal youth gambling products with current gambling problems in a group of UK adult gamblers. This study is relevant to the current landscape, where a number of gambling-like opportunities have recently become accessible to under 18s (e.g., “loot boxes” in video games), but not enough time has yet passed to see how these new products might contribute to later life gambling problems and harm.

"Crime Victimization, Inequality and Preferences for Protection in Brazil","Crime and violence have spiked in Latin America's democracies, not only in urban centers but all over the continent. While there were 6.1 homicide victims per 100,000 population on average around the world in 2018, Latin America recorded almost three times this rate, with 17.2 victims per 100,000. Survey data indicates that, on average, 20 percent of the population in every Latin American country has been a victim of crime in the past 12 months, and concerns about security have shown high salience among citizens in these countries (Muggah and Tobon, 2018; Perez, 2015). Although criminal violence ranks as a crucial issue for citizens' concerns in Latin America, as a field, political science has not yet paid sufficient attention to the changes of political attitudes and behavior brought by a rise in crime on new democracies. 

In this pre-analysis plan, I discuss a set of experiments specifically designed to understand citizens' preferences for security policies and to describe how past experiences of crime victimization and income inequality shape citizens' strategic decision-making on preferences for security. How do citizens make strategic decisions about security policies on violent democracies? Does exposure to crime affect citizens' willingness to prefer more public investment in security? Does income inequality explain strategic decision-making in voter support for protection? How do concerns about crime enter into the electoral arena, and to which degree does crime exposure, and income differences explain the support for tough-on-crime policies? These are some of the questions I answer with these experiments.

To derive my hypotheses, I use a model that develops micro-level foundations to understand individual preferences for security, and how crime exposure and income heterogeneity affect citizens' strategic decisions.  I argue that the theoretical and methodological challenges of explaining individual-level decisions to support more protection from the State bear striking similarities to the economic models describing welfare preferences. Economic models of welfare provisions assume individuals shape their choices by considering the social policies' redistributive and insurance effects. Existing models of welfare preferences argue that individuals decide their level of support for social systems considering: i) the net impact between paying taxes and receiving social policies provision by the State (Meltzer and Richard, 1981; Rueda and Stegmueller, 2015;Lupu  and  Pontusson,  2011), and ii) how much protection one needs from the State to counteract uncertainty of an exogenous income loss due to fluctuation of the labor market (Moene and Wallerstein, 2001; Iversen and Soskice, 2001; Rehm, 2016. I propose a framework that expands on this logic behind welfare models to understand individuals' preferences for protection when concerns about crime affect their strategic decisions. Although I work on a general theory of preferences for protection, the empirical work focus in Brazil, a textbook case of a violent democracy.

The plan describes two online experiments embedded in a national online survey in Brazil. The first experiment measure respondents' sensitivity to protection as a consequence of spatial information about crime, income inequality, and population. The survey presents the respondent with a short vignette and three maps varying the distribution of crime, income, and the city's population. Faced with the three treatments, I ask the respondents to act as a social planner deciding the location of six police stations on this map. The survey measures the area in the map of the police stations under the three distinctive treatment conditions, which I use as a latent measure to understand how information about crime, income, and population shape how people make strategic decisions about police allocation. 

The second experiment estimates the willingness-to-invest on public protection. I employ a paired conjoint analysis in which two police stations are presented simultaneously to respondents; these stations vary on some key institutional features and sociodemographic features of the area in which the station is located. These dimensions are theoretically motivated by the insurance model. After showing the paired stations, respondents will be asked to decide i) how much, from a limited budget, they would invest in each station in order to reduce crime; ii) how much, from a limited budget, they would invest in each station in order to reward excellent performance of the station, iii)  which station the respondent would prefer to have close to her residency.",xy9r3,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xy9r3/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Probabilistic sample recruitment by LAPOP-Vanderbilt, based on an agreement with Netquest to use their standing panel.\n\n'}, 'uploader': {'extra': [], 'value': ''}}","['Crime Victimization', 'Income inequality', 'Survey Experiments', 'Violence']",smv9p

The National Citizen Service and political engagement: encouraging political letter writing,"Young people participate in formal political activities – voting, contacting politicians, petitioning and protest – in relatively low numbers (Ipsos MORI 2015 &amp; 2017). Many democratic governments have in recent decades implemented programmes of ‘service learning’ that aim to increase the level of civic engagement amongst young people. The evidence on the causal relationship between service learning and political participation can be improved in three respects. First, the studies that have tried to identify causal effects have suffered from small sample sizes and weak identification strategies (Burth 2016, p.61). Study 1 in this thesis addresses this gap in the literature with a large-N study that uses a matched difference-in-differences design to test the effects of participation in a service learning experience (the National Citizen Service) on future political participation and political self-efficacy. Second, there is a lack of studies that attempt to systematically describe how a service learning experience might affect an individual’s political participation (Ayala 2000, p.100; DSDL 2019). Study 2 addresses this second gap by developing our understanding of the causal mechanisms that link a service learning experience to an individual’s future political participation, as well as the factors that moderate this effect, through interviews with past participants of NCS.

Third, there is a large amount of evidence to suggest that ‘Get Out the Vote’ (GOTV) campaigns can increase voter turnout, and to tell us what form and content a message should take to be most effective in this context (Arceneaux 2007; Gerber &amp; Green 2000; Green &amp; Gerber 2019; Nickerson 2006; Nickerson 2007). There is less evidence, however, on the effects of such campaigns on non-electoral political participation, and none at all when the target population is young people who have participated in national voluntary service. This is an important final gap in the literature. Both non-electoral participation and programmes of national voluntary service are on the rise, and non-electoral participation makes an important contribution to a strong democracy (Han 2016, p. 296). Programmes such as the National Citizen Service (NCS) are uniquely placed to encourage democratic participation post-service, but there is no direct evidence to suggest how this could be done most effectively. This study addresses this final gap, using a large (N=227,372) three-arm randomised controlled trial to test the effects of three different email messages on young people’s participation in a political letter writing competition.",59wqc,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/59wqc/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'See attached study protocol'}, 'uploader': {'extra': [], 'value': ''}}",[],fhu8w

Clinical efficacy and safety of somatostatin in the treatment of early postoperative inflammatory small bowel obstruction: A protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Early postoperative inflammatory small bowel obstruction (EPISBO), a very common complication following colorectal operation, often occurs in the early stage after abdominal operation (within 2 to 3 weeks). The primary cause of EPISBO is a kind of mechanical and dynamic abdominal adhesion of the intestinal tract due to wall edema and exudation because of injury of abdominal operation and post-operative abdominal inflammation, but intestinal strangulation rarely occurs. EPISBO occurs in the early stage after operation, and the major symptom is abdominal distension with or without mild abdominal pain. Adnominal inflammation-induced intensive intestinal adhesion is the major cause of the disease.Somatostatin was extracted from hypothalamus by Brazeau et al. in 1973 for the first time. Its full name is growth hormone-inhibiting hormone, a kind of cyclic peptide hormone consisting of 14 amino acids. It is widely distributed in pancreatic D cells and gastrointestinal autonomic nerves and can obviously inhibit the secretion of digestive juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Studies have shown that SS is used in treating EPISBO as it can significantly reduce the accumulation of digestive juice in intestinal canal above the obstructed segment, reduce dilatation and ischemia of intestine due to the accumulation of a large amount of fluid, accelerate the recovery of intestinal wall blood circulation and promote inflammation resolution. In order to explore the effectiveness and efficacy of SS as one of conservative therapy in treating EPISBO, we carried out a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the included randomized controlled trials so as to assess its effectiveness and efficacy in an objective manner.",ryd2g,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ryd2g/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': '1.

The Role of Cultural Capital in College and University Admissions Practices: An Audit Study,"We are examining whether signals of cultural capital (e.g., tastes in music and leisure activities) influence interactions with key gatekeepers to social mobility--college and university admissions counselors. We explored this question in the context of an audit study in which we sent emails to admissions counselors at colleges and universities around the country, ostensibly from a high school student interesting in applying. Counselors were randomly assigned to receive one of two versions of the email. In the lowbrow condition, the email referenced extracurricular activities associated with lower-class cultural capital (e.g., action films, pick-up soccer), and in the highbrow condition, the email referenced extracurricular activities associated with upper-class cultural capital (e.g., independent films, skiing). The perceived gender of the student was also manipulated. We hypothesize that counselors will be more likely to respond, and will respond more positively, when the student is expressing highbrow tastes compared to when they are expressing lowbrow tastes.",xj5e8,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xj5e8/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'We emailed a total of 973 admissions counselors, one at each institution in our list.

We filtered our list to only include selective and highly selective public and private colleges and universities; all other college tiers were not included (e.g., community colleges, for-profit colleges). This yielded a total of 1,130 institutions. We then instructed research assistants to navigate to each institution’s admissions website and pick an admissions counselor to contact. Given that our emails will be ostensibly sent by a high school student from the San Francisco Bay Area, when possible, we selected admissions counselors whose territory included this area. If counselors were not assigned a territory, our assistants selected one at random. Schools with no admissions counselors listed on the website (i.e., only a general email was included) were excluded from our sample for consistency, thus resulting in a final sample of 973 counselors (658 from private institutions, 315 from public institutions).

Association between Diastolic Dysfunction and Postoperative Outcomes After Renal Transplantation,"Background/Significance: 

Cardiovascular disease remains the most common cause of death after kidney transplantation worldwide, with the highest event rate in the early postoperative period1. The current AHA cardiac risk stratification of patients undergoing renal transplantation does not address Diastolic dysfunction (DD)2. Nearly 50% of heart failure patients are characterized by normal systolic and abnormal diastolic function3, 4. Several studies reporting data on perioperative diastolic dysfunction have observed adverse outcomes among patients undergoing cardiac and vascular surgery as well as in critically ill patients5, 6. Not surprisingly, the diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction carries profound implications for risk stratification7 and appropriate patient management8 in the perioperative period. Despite the expected significant implications of the presence diastolic dysfunction on outcomes, these outcomes have not been investigated in patients undergoing renal transplantation. To address this question, we designed an observational study to assess whether preoperative diastolic dysfunction as measured by transthoracic echocardiography is associated with worse postoperative outcomes in patient undergoing renal transplantation. 

Hypothesis: 
We hypothesize that diastolic dysfunction may be an important risk factor for adverse postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing renal transplantation surgery.

Aim:
To determine if preoperative diastolic function, as defined by the ASE criteria, is associated with postoperative Major Adverse Events (AE) in a cohort of patients undergoing renal transplantation surgery.

Specific Design and Procedures:
Patients over 18 years of age undergoing kidney transplants between 01/2011- 08/2019 with a preoperative transthoracic echo within a year of transplant will be included in the study. The exclusion criteria include baseline EF&lt;55%, heart kidney transplants, pre-operative non-sinus rhythms, mitral valvular disorders (any degree of mitral stenosis or moderate to severe mitral regurgitation), mitral annular calcification, aortic valve disorders (moderate to severe aortic stenosis or regurgitation). 
Data will be collected from the electronic medical records or institutional MPOG and SRTR databases. The variables pertinent to diastolic function will be abstracted by review of the transthoracic echography reports and classified based on the criteria of the ASE guidelines9.


Methods of analysis, including statistical techniques:
The primary aim of the study is to evaluate if diastolic function (DD)
is associated with poor postoperative outcomes. Per the ASE guidelines patients will adjudicated for the present or absence of DD.  Our primary study endpoint is the occurrence of postoperative Major Adverse Events (MAE). MAEs are defined as a composite of in hospital mortality, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, stroke, need for postoperative dialysis, prolonged postoperative mechanical ventilation (postoperative mechanical ventilation &gt;24 hours postoperatively) and atrial fibrillation. Our secondary endpoints will be 30-day and 1-year mortality. 

Variables that will be recorded are listed in the attached document. Briefly, following variables will be recorded:
Age, gender, race, weight, BMI, smoking status, ASA status, COPD requiring oxygen at baseline, selected preoperative medications, duration of surgery, intraoperative crystalloids, intraoperative colloids, intraoperative blood product transfusion.

Statistics:
Patients will be divided in two groups based on the preoperative presence of diastolic dysfunction. Baseline characteristics will be compared between the two groups. Categorical variables will be described using frequency distribution. Medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) and means with standard deviations (SD) will be used to describe continuous variables. Chi-square or two-sample Student’s t-test will be used to compare categorical and continuous variables between the two groups , respectively. 

For the primary endpoint, in univariate analysis, we will compare the incidence of postoperative complications (MAE) between the groups using simple logistic regression. To account for potential confounders, we will use multivariable logistic-regression.  The model will adjust for a priori defined potential confounders such as age, gender, BMI, and ASA physical status. The model will also adjust for variables that are thought to be associated with outcomes such as smoking status, medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors), COPD, operative time and ischemia time.

In secondary analysis, we will fit the same regression model to estimate the associations of diastolic dysfunction with the secondary endpoints of 30 day and 1-year mortality. A two-sided alpha level of 0.05 will be required for significance. All statistical analyses will be performed using STATA version 13.0 or R statistical software package (version 3.0.2). 

Sample size considerations. Based on prior reports, we expect an incidence of diastolic dysfunction among patients presenting for kidney transplantation to be approximately 34%10. Assuming a MAE incidence of 15% in patients with DD, an assuming a power of 80%, to detect a 10% difference in MAE between patients with a without diastolic dysfunction, a total sample size of 397 patients would be required.

Adanya pandemic coronavirus diseas (Covid) 19 menjadikan produk undang-undang dalam UU kekarantinaan kesehatan menjadi penting. Kemampuan virus menyebar dengan cepat dan kemampuannya dalam menimbulkan dampak yang fatal bagi kesehatan menyebabkan karantina kesehatan harus segera dilakukan. Penulis ingin mengkaji permasalahan yang muncul yaitu tentang legal positivsme untuk penerapan UU Nomor 6 Tahun 2018 serta dampak yang ditimbulkan jika asas tersebut tidak dilakukan di tengah pandemic Covid-19 ini. Dari hasil kajian, ditemukan bukti bahwa pemerintah belum menjalankan amanat dalam UU Kekarantinaan Kesehatan dengan tidak melakukan karantina wilayah secara ketat, yang berakibat meluasnya dampak yang ditimbulkan yaitu kasus positif bertambah banyak dan kematian meningkat. Hal ini disebabkan karena kurangnya sarana prasarana dalam memenuhi Alat Pelindung Diri (APD) dan alat-alat medis (pemeriksaan penunjang) termasuk ketersediaan bed isolasi dan ventilator yang sangat terbatas. Pandemi ini juga mengakibatkan terhambatnya roda perekonomian dengan banyaknya sekotr-sektor yang mengalami kerugian. Pemerintah tidak mengupayakan adanya karantina wilayah dikarenakan mempertimbangkan faktor ekonomi serta kemungkinan adanya kekhawatiran jika pemerintah tidak mampu membiayai seluruh masyarakat yang terdampak jika nanti karantina wilayah benar-benar diberlakukan.

A prospective examination of relationships between social media use and body dissatisfaction in a representative adult sample,"Body dissatisfaction is not only associated with negative emotions but also is a risk factor for the development of depressive and anxiety symptoms, poor quality of life, health risk behaviours, disordered eating and clinical eating disorders in males and females (McLean &amp; Paxton, 2019).  Consequently, understanding risk factors that contribute to the development of body dissatisfaction has been a focus of research (e.g., Rodgers, Paxton, &amp; McLean, 2014).  Risk factor research has been guided by a number of theoretical models, but a dominant one is the Tripartite Influence Model (Thompson, Heinberg, Altabe, &amp; Tantleff-Dunn, 1999).  This model emphasises sociocultural risk factors, particularly social environments in which there are high levels of exposure to society’s appearance ideals (i.e., thin for females, and lean and muscular for males) including family, peers and media environments (Rodgers, McLean, &amp; Paxton, 2015).  Of these environments, recent research has examined the potential risk factor role of high levels of exposure to social media, the focus of the present research in which data were collected annually across three years (2016, 2017, 2018) in a large representative community sample of adult New Zealanders.

Exposure to social media has been proposed to be a risk factor for the development of body dissatisfaction for a number of reason (see Tamplin, McLean, &amp; Paxton, 2018).  A combination of peer and media environments, social media is highly visual and content frequently shows idealised images. It is proposed that these images create unrealistic appearance standards that are, for most people, impossible to attain and thus result in negative self-evaluation of one’s own body (Tamplin et al., 2018).  Further the highly interactive nature of social media is likely to add to their negative impact in this regard (McLean, Paxton, Wertheim, &amp; Masters, 2015).
Empirical research provides support for a relationship between greater social media exposure and greater body dissatisfaction.  For example, a meta-analysis of cross-sectional relationships found a significant but small, positive relationship between social media use and body dissatisfaction (Saiphoo, &amp; Vahedi, 2019).  In addition, experimental studies find that exposure to idealised social media images compared to non-appearance social media images have a negative impact on short-term body dissatisfaction (e.g., Tamplin et al., 2018). 

However, these studies do not provide information about the temporal relationship between social media use and body dissatisfaction, for which prospective studies are required.  One prospective study reflects on this issue.  In a study of adolescent girls and boys, De Vries, Peter, de Graaf, and Nikken (2016) found that higher social media use predicted body dissatisfaction up to 18-months later.  However, a major limitation of research in this area is the lack of longitudinal data in adult community samples that allows examination of the temporal relationships between social media use and body image.  Although the Tripartite Influence Model proposes elevated (social) media use will increase risk of future body dissatisfaction, it is also feasible that body dissatisfaction may increase social media use (Saiphoo &amp; Vahedi, 2019), perhaps in an attempt to seek appearance related information to guide self-improvement.  Although prospective relationships in both directions are plausible, previous data do not exist to guide predictions as to the strength of the relationships. Thus, we will compare the strength of proposed relationships in each direction.

We propose to overcome this limitation regarding lack of examination of temporal relationships between social media use and body dissatisfaction in adults by examining data from the large longitudinal study of a representative sample of New Zealand adults, the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS).  We will examine relationships between self-reported frequency of social media use and body dissatisfaction at three time points, 2016, 2017, 2018. We propose that social media use will predict increases in body dissatisfaction across three time points.

Further, an exploratory aim is to examine the moderating role of gender, age and body mass index (BMI).  There is relatively little data to guide hypotheses regarding moderators. However, we propose that gender will not moderate the relationship between social media use and body image across time, as one systematic review did not find gender moderated cross-sectional relationships between these two variables (Holland &amp; Tiggemann, 2016).  In relation to age, although body dissatisfaction is frequently present in midlife (McLean, Paxton, &amp; Wertheim, 2010), a 20-year follow-up study of college students found body dissatisfaction to be lower in midlife than in college years (Keel, Baxter, Heatherton, &amp; Joiner, 2007).  Thus, there may also be a change in factors that influence body dissatisfaction across age.  In relation to BMI, although higher BMI typically predicts the development of body dissatisfaction (Paxton, Eisenberg, &amp; Neumark-Sztainer, 2006), there has been little examination of BMI as a potential moderator of the influence of social media on body dissatisfaction.  It is feasible that individuals with higher compared with lower BMI would be more negatively affected by the idealised appearance images presented on social media.  We plan to explore this possibility.

Finally, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES) and relationship status, have been observed in some research to have an impact on the development of body dissatisfaction (Laus, Almeida &amp; Klos, 2018; Paxton et al., 2006).  However, these variables are not the focus of the present research and so will be controlled for in analyses.

In summary, this study will examine bi-directional prospective relationships between social media use and body dissatisfaction in a large representative sample of New Zealand adults. Analyses will control for SES, ethnicity and relationship status and also examine the moderating role of gender, age, and BMI, predicting that the relationship between social media use and body dissatisfaction will be stronger in younger participants and participants with higher BMI. Gender is not expected to moderate the prospective relationships between social media and body dissatisfaction.",spbn9,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/spbn9/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) is a nation-wide study that has been assessing the socio-political attitudes of New Zealanders each year since 2009.

AD Biomarkers and prognosis of subjective cognitive decline,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common reason for dementia. Pathophysiologically it is based on neurodegeneration, which is associated with brain amyloid ß (Aß) deposition and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) burden. Both processes are known to begin years before the first symptoms of cognitive decline.The stage of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a preclinical stage of AD and describes a condition where healthy adults are concerned about a cognitive decline, while performance on neuropsychological testing is within normal limits and activities of daily living are preserved. Individuals with SCD with a biomarker-based evidence of AD are at higher risk for developing cognitive decline.

Within this systematic review and metaanalysis we want to investigate the estimated clinical progression rate to dementia in individuals with subjective cognitive decline with regard to their biomarker profile for Alzheimer's disease. 

Method:
This systematic review employs a four-step search strategy. 1) First, search terms and search strings are developed and pretested in PubMed. Search strings are three-parted with one section referring to subjective cognitive decline, another to the biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and a third fraction consisting of the clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease. All parts will be combined using the Boolean Operator “AND”. 2) After the pretest, key publications will be identified and analyzed for wording used in title and abstract as well as index terms. This step
aims at expanding and adapting search terms to cover additional and divergent wording. 3) After search terms and search strings are finalized for PubMed, the search strategy will be adapted to each of the additional databases and
the actual search will be conducted in the following databases: 1. PubMed 2. Cochrane Library 3. PsycINFO. The reference list of all publications included in the review will be hand searched for additional studies that meet the following inclusion criteria: To be included in this review articles must be published in a peer-reviewed journal and written in English with full-text available. No time filters will be employed. Studies must include the detection of biomarkers for AD in CSF or by means of neuroimaging, such as Amyloid- and/or Tau-PET-CT. Articles will be screened by title and abstract for eligibility by two independent reviewers using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any discrepancies will be resolved through discussion and when necessary through review by a third reviewer. If eligibility is unclear, full text review will be undertaken of studies deemed potential eligible by title/abstract screening. Articles selected for full-text review will then be reviewed employing the same standard. Excluded articles will be coded for reason of exclusion. Data synthesis will be assisted by an evaluation matrix developed for the purpose of this review. Categories and codes will be predefined based on the research question and will be further developed during the data extraction process.The quality of included studies will be evaluated independently by two reviewers using a standardized set of criteria such as the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomized studies and ROBIN-I for non-randomized studies.",udn38,True,False,OSF-Standard Pre-Data Collection Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/udn38/contributors/?format=json,,[],9fd7a

Moral values,"Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) purports to identify five essential ""foundations"" of human morality.  MFT also suggests that liberals have a narrower morality by attending to only the ""individualizing foundations"" (harm and fairness), contrasted to the broader morality of conservatives, who attend more to the ""binding"" foundations (authority, loyalty, and purity).  The present project suggests, instead, that MFT misses fundamental value tradeoffs made by liberals and conservatives by defining morality, or moral values, too narrowly.  To challenge MFT, I select from the broader framework of Schwartz Value Theory, abstracting four values (obedience, status, universalism, and self-direction) from the Schwartz value circumplex.  To enable a direct comparison with the five foundations of MFT, I “translate” these four values into the exact operational language of MFT (i.e., using scale items assessing moral relevancy and moral judgment).  In Study 1, multidimensional scaling of these nine moral constructs (5 foundations + 4 values; n=129) produced a moral circumplex consistent with SVT.  The pattern suggests MFT’s individualizing and binding foundations capture only two narrow slices of the broader moral circumplex.   Further, the predicted trade-offs emerge (e.g., obedience and universalism occupy opposing sides of the circumplex and correlate negatively).  Further, the broader model improves prediction of ideological commitments (e.g., low universalism and low self-direction improve prediction of economic conservatism).  

The Study 2 proposed here will extend Study 1 findings.  Specifically, I seek to develop a fifth SVT value to improve the prediction of conservatism, namely ""security.""  I also add a validated measure of social and economic conservatism to better compare predictive validity of the MFT and SVT models.  In general, I hope to replicate the basic multidimensional scaling outcome from Study 1 to demonstrate that MVT identifies only a subset of a broader set of moral concerns.  In addition, I hope to compare the ability of the two models to predict overall ideological orientation and position on specific political issues (e.g., abortion and gun control).",b72p6,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b72p6/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Exclusion rules: An increasing percentage of mTurk participants have learned to correctly answer typical attention check items (e.g., instructions to select ""strongly disagree for a particular item) and yet not provide adequate engagement with the survey.

Programmatic influences on questionable research practices in final-year psychology dissertations,"Preregistration prepared by Caroline Elliott
In the last decade, there has been an increased focus on Open Science and the reasons behind the nonvalidity and reproducibility of psychological research (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). Gigerenzer (2018) postulates that researchers’ widespread faith in statistical ritual is a contributing factor, and the possibility that the emphasis on statistical significance (via p-values) could alter research design and analysis. These attitudes, held by researchers, can lead to scientific misconduct (Tijdink, Verbeke and Smulders,2014) or at the very least honest errors (Sacco and Brown, 2019). 
This study examines a set of actions that sit within a grey area called Questionable Research Practices (QRP’s), which are often open to interpretation and differing tolerance levels within Higher Education establishments. The variation in student attitudes has been demonstrated to be directly influenced by the attitudes and endorsements of dissertation and thesis supervisors (Krishna and Peters, 2018). 
The aim of the study is to examine the programmatic influences on final year undergraduate students’ perception of QRP’s. The study will conceptually replicate the previous work of Krishna and Peters (2018) with a focus on programmatic influences and not on supervisor attitudes. The questionnaire used is a combination of a replication of Krishna and Peters’ and additional adapted questions to examine programme effects.
The study is a collaboration between 13 University psychology departments, each has contributed a set of questions to a main Qualtrics questionnaire. This main questionnaire is answered in full by all participants, however I have only used data from my own contributed questions. Therefore, I have excluded data from other universities that is not relevant to my research question.
In addition to the student Qualtrics questionnaire I have compiled an additional questionnaire for the programme leaders. It evaluates their perception as to the level of knowledge of QRP’s that psychology graduates would have upon completion of their statistics, methods and analysis programme (based on the inclusion of Open science teaching within their programme). The questionnaire also explored whether Open Science and reproducibility is included in any other modules within the programme.

Framing effects on the effectiveness and virality of health messages related to COVID-19,"Humor appeals can help draw audiences’ attention, and improve engagement with the information, which is why they are often deployed as a creative alternative to more didactic messaging appeals (Nabi, R. L., Moyer-Gusé, E., and Byrne, S., 2007; Cline, T. W., &amp; Kellaris, J. J., 2007; Blanc, N., &amp; Brigaud, E., 2014). Thus, humorous appeals to persuade individuals to follow COVID-19 related preventative measures may help engage audiences and increase behavior change. Humorous messages, however, can take various forms, including, but not limited to irony, sarcasm, mockery and satire (Holbert et al., 2011; Polk et al., 2009). In the current study, we focus on mocking forms of humor, which can lead to more unfavorable evaluations of the target of the joke (Becker, 2012). By mocking the behavior of individuals who do not follow physical distancing recommendations when they could, we might encourage audiences to follow these recommendations when possible. Here, recognizing that not everyone has the luxury to avoid all contact with others, we manipulate humor in appeals such that these humorous messages ridicule individuals who are not following social distancing recommendations, despite being in positions that afford them the ability to do so. 
Here, we will focus on participants who will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions, as part of a larger study (https://osf.io/8hn2g/) that has 5 total conditions.

In this study, participants will either be exposed to 1) messages framed humorously, or 2) control messages. We test the effects of these messages primarily on (1) perceptions of norms about social distancing, (2) favorability of message (i.e., the extent to which the message makes the person want to follow social distance recommendations), and (3) intention to share the message. We compare the effects of humorous messages, and control messages which are not framed humorously.

Maternal Sensitivity to Distress versus Nondistress as Predictor of Dysregulation in Infants,"Sensitive caregiving is characterized as responsiveness to infant cues in a consistent and appropriate manner, and is a widely studied construct in developmental psychology (Ainsworth et al., 1978). Research has shown that early sensitivity is a strong predictor for many different developmental outcomes including cognition, behavior, and language (Marvin, Britner, &amp; Russell, 2016; Cassidy, 2016; Page, Wilhem, Gamble, &amp; Card, 2010).  

To date, and to the best of our knowledge, only two studies address context specific sensitivity and socioemotional outcomes. Leerkes, Blankson and O’Brien (2009) reported that maternal sensitivity to infant distress, but not sensitivity to nondistress, predicted better socio-emotional adjustment. Additionally, Wright, Hill, Sharp, and Pickles (2018) reported that low sensitivity to distress predicted an elevated risk for callous-unemotional (CU) traits. Taken together, these studies suggest that a mother’s responsiveness to their child’s distress may foster their ability to appropriately self-regulate, whereas sensitivity to nondistress is not a sufficient predictor of adaptive socio-emotional regulation. 

This study aims to examine whether maternal sensitivity to distress versus nondistress cues are uniquely associated with infant dysregulation. Dysregulation during infancy involves problems with sleeping, feeding, or negative emotion. Dysregulation early in life forecast problems later in life. For example, Bilgin, et al. (2020) reported that early crying, sleeping, and feeding problems that co-occur and persist are associated with increased odds of attention problems and ADHD diagnoses from childhood to adulthood. These findings underscore the importance of identifying parental behaviors that can support healthy regulation early in life. More specifically, the current study addresses gaps in literature regarding the unique relationship between maternal sensitivity to distress versus nondistress during infancy and later dysregulation.",7bqa9,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7bqa9/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to analysis of the data,[],zun5b
Voting for Law and Order in Mexico,"Over the past decade, criminal activity in Latin America has grown exponentially. According
to the 2014 survey of the Latin American Public Opinion Project, one third of Latin Americans
identified crime as their country's main problem. Such violent reality has already had important political consequences across the region. Academic research has revealed the political consequences of criminal violence and victimization experiences in Latin America, mainly focusing on democratic values and participation. Several works found that victims of crime are less likely to trust democratic institutions and support democratic attitudes (Fernandez and Kuenzi, 2010; Blanco, 2013; Carreras, 2013). Moreover, violence has also been shown to increase support for iron fist policies (Holland, 2013; Krause, 2014a; Visconti, 2019). Another set of studies has shown that crime is associated with higher levels of non-electoral forms of participation (Bateson, 2012), while at the same time diminishing electoral participation (Carreras and Trelles,2012; Cantu and Ley, 2017; Ley, 2018).

Overall, prevailing evidence suggests that violence shapes citizens' views on politics, their
interaction with government authorities, and their preferences for security policies (Krause,
2014b; Visconti, 2019; Garcia-Ponce et al., 2019). However, extant works have mainly focused
on mano dura policies , disregarding other policy approaches to crime. Additionally, political
scientists have largely dismissed the processes through which preferences for security policies are shaped, failing to address how voters react to a potentially wide supply of policy approaches. In fact, what we know about how citizens form their electoral preferences amid violence is fairly limited (Ley, 2017).

In this pre-analysis plan, we present a conjoint experiment specifically designed to (a) understand citizens' preferences for security policies; (b) explain how and when different candidate and policy profiles can gain electoral support among voters; and (c) examine the effects of partisanship on preferences for security. In our experiment, respondents are presented with two hypothetical candidates for a municipal election in Mexico that vary along four different attributes, policy proposal for public security, gender, work experience, and political party, and are asked to indicate their preferred candidate. How do citizens make strategic decisions about security policies in violent democracies? What is the role of victimization experiences and fear of crime on voters' electoral and policy preferences? How do voters process candidate profiles amid security concerns? These are some of the questions we seek to answer in this study.",wajmf,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wajmf/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Probabilistic sample recruitment by LAPOP-Vanderbilt, based on an agreement with Netquest to use their standing panel.'}, 'uploader': {'extra': [], 'value': ''}}","['Criminal Violence', 'Political Behavior', 'Security Policies']",5ja6k

Establishing the social licence to introduce tracking technologies to address COVID-19,"The novel coronavirus or COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11th, 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020). The COVID-19 virus transmits early in its life cycle relative to other coronaviruses, (e.g., SARS), during which time many individuals present as asymptomatic (Zhou et al., 2020). The moderate to high transmissibility of this virus has required governments to consider moderate to extreme measures in order to prevent further transmissions. Indeed, the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic may require governments to use big data technologies to help contain its spread (Bonsall, Parker, &amp; Fraser, 2020). 

Countries that have managed to “flatten the curve” - the process of slowing the exponential transmission rate of the virus, for example, Singapore and Taiwan - have employed collocation tracking through mobile Wi-Fi, GPS, and Bluetooth as a strategy to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020). Through collocation tracking, government agencies may observe who you have been in contact with and when this contact occurred, allowing for the rapid implementation of appropriate measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. 

The effectiveness of collocation tracking relies on the willingness of the population to support such measures, implying that government policy-making should be informed by the likelihood of public compliance. Gaining the social license - broad community acceptance beyond formal legal requirements - for collocation tracking requires the perceived public health benefits to outweigh concerns of personal privacy, security, and any potential risk of harm. 

In the current study, we propose a longitudinal cross-cultural study mapping the evolution of people’s attitudes towards government tracking during the COVID-19 crisis. We aim to understand (1) the factors that influence the social license around governmental use of location tracking data in an emergency, (2) how this may change over time, and (3) how it may differ across cultures. We will present participants with one of two scenarios describing mild or severe government tracking methods that may reduce the spread of COVID-19, and then question participants’ attitudes towards the proposed methods.",z2tw9,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/z2tw9/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': ' A representative sample of 1000 Australian participants aged 18 or older will be recruited through the market research platform ‘Dynata’ once every week for four weeks.

"Social ties, norms and threat perception in the face of COVID-19","Minimising physical contact with others is one of the most effective measures to alleviate the spread of COVID-19, and to enable the health systems to cope with the disease (WHO, 2020). This measure, also called “social distancing”, represents a paradigmatic, yet unprecedented form of collective action. It is paradigmatic because it relies on individuals’ readiness to change behaviour, invest effort and agree to self-sacrifices for a collective benefit (Zomeren &amp; Iyer, 2009). It is unprecedented  because it needs to happen fast under threat conditions and it aims at a collective benefit which spans multiple geographical scales, from one’s own household to the entire planet.

In such threatening contexts, people typically seek further affiliation and social contact (Dezecache, 2015; Dezecache et al., 2017). Yet, what is currently required is to decrease the amount of physical social interactions, which poses a unique challenge for collective action. Sustaining such collective action can be materially and mentally costly to the individual by virtue of affecting daily life, causing cognitive dissonance, triggering moral re-evaluations and deviating from familiar behavioural norms (Strong, 1990). Having a supportive social network can help with sustaining collective action by improving psychological well-being (Helliwell &amp; Putnam, 2004), providing a support network (Oliver &amp; Marwell, 1988) and fostering a sense of normativity (Ostrom, 2000). Relatedly, research suggests that sustainable behaviour change depends not only on what one personally believes is right (unconditional norm-following) but also on what one thinks others in their social networks believe is right (conditional on normative social expectations) and de facto do (empirical social expectations; Bicchieri, 2016). Building on a “conditional norm-following” framework has proven to be effective in other contexts, for instance when initiating collective actions in India related to hygienic norms (World Bank Group, 2008). Can perceived threat, social ties and normative social expectations explain commitment to the collective action required to combat COVID-19 as well?",hyjq9,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyjq9/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'We aim to collect longitudinal data from 13 target countries (i.e., Australia, Bangladesh, China, France, Germany, Italy, Iran, Lebanon, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, UK, USA) to have a representative, non-WEIRD sample (Henrich, Heine &amp; Norenzayan, 2010) at six time-points that are two weeks apart from each other.

This question is explored by re-imagining Malinowski’s classic ethnographic case study of the Kula in light of a contemporary social exchange theory of negotiation networks.  We propose: (1) sub-institutional patterns of power-dependence form a structural foundation for the rise of tacit meanings, which evolve through social negotiation into explicit, cultural meaning agreements; (2)  crucial sub-cultural categories form around the pursuit of both agentic  benefits and communal benefits; (3) an individual is culturally shaped through externalization, socialization, and internalization to value and seek both kinds of benefits; (4) an individual faces the existential task of navigating both agentic and communal situations across the negotiation network; (5)  the basic individual mechanism underlying such navigation entails motivated behavioral choice and motivated cultural cognition; (6) a behavioral choice rests on automatic, largely implicit and hot cognitive processing; (7) motivated cultural cognition rests mostly on the deliberate, mostly explicit, and cool selection of materials from the prevailing cultural toolkit for assembling a justification, but whose underlying trajectory is biased by an automatic, hot value-position, whether agentic or communal.

Proportionate Immigration Control,"Immigration is one of the most complex challenges of an increasingly globalized world.  It is the issue that many scholars argue is at the heart of the populist backlash that has recently characterized the Western political landscape.  There is a deep and diverse literature that has explored the sources of resistance to immigration among native citizens.  However, these explorations are often very narrow in scope, with people being polled about their general support for immigration, which specific groups should be allowed to immigrate, and which services they should have access to.  A great deal less is known about how people consider and potentially support different methods of exclusion or removal, such as visa processes, detention, and the use of violent force.  The characterization is similarly limited among political philosophers, with theorists either supporting broad immigration controls or not, or supporting the admitting of some groups or not.  There is little work on whether certain means of immigration control are justified. 

The present work first identifies a key principle – the principle of proportionality – that is present in other areas of political philosophy concerning the use of coercive force. It considers how this principle might be applied to immigration control, concluding the following ethical philosophical principle: the more force that is necessary for preventing a migrant from remaining in a country, the less justified such prevention is. We then establish whether this general philosophical principle is supported by citizens. We do so by presenting subjects with experimental vignettes of migrants who failed to obtain a visa to live in the UK, with the level of force necessary to deport the migrant varying. Subjects are asked to decide if and to what extent excluding this migrant is reasonable, helping us evaluate the extent that citizens view force as lowering the justification for excluding a migrant.",3a4hx,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/3a4hx/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Payment and experiment completion time (finalized following pilot testing): \n£3.20 for a 25-minute experiment completed online.\n\nSubject selection method: \nThe sample of subjects for the online experiment will be collected from Prolific Academic and will be composed solely of individuals classified as British nationals. \n\n\n'}, 'uploader': {'extra': [], 'value': ''}}","['Enforcement', 'Immigration', 'Political Philosophy', 'Political Psychology']",8vtbp

"Purpose in life, health messages receptivity, and loneliness among older adults during COVID-19 pandemic","***** See https://osf.io/39vfg for an updated version ***** 
The COVID-19 pandemic is posing a direct threat to the health of millions across the globe. In particular, elderly population faces the highest risk of severe illness and mortality from COVID-19, such that 8 out of 10 deaths caused by COVID-19 in the U.S. have been in adults 65 years old and older (CDC.gov). Avoiding close contact with others by putting physical distance between people, or “social distancing,” has been considered one of the most effective strategies to slow the spread of coronavirus and is strongly recommended and/or enforced by many nations across the world. While social distancing is critical to stay safe during pandemic, it can also increase risks associated with social isolation and loneliness, especially for older adults who are already vulnerable due to various conditions that prevent them from maintaining close social contacts. In the U.S., for example, older compared to younger adults are more likely to live alone (1) with reduced mobility, and their social circles tend to be smaller due to loss of friends and family (2). Further, they tend to suffer more from social isolation (3) compared to younger counterparts, with often fewer resources to carry out daily activities independently and cope with feelings of loneliness. Feelings of loneliness might also motivate older adults to downplay the importance of social distancing and venture out of their homes to social gatherings, which may expose them to greater dangers of infection during pandemic. Therefore, testing effective psychological interventions that may increase the likelihood for older adults of maintaining social distance while not increasing loneliness is critical. This way, vulnerable older populations are protected from direct threats of infectious disease as well as indirect threats of loneliness and social isolation that may result from measures taken to prevent the spread of virus.

Having a strong sense of purpose in life, or a set of goals derived from an individual’s core values, has been consistently associated with a wide range of positive health outcomes. Having a higher sense of purpose in life is uniquely associated with increased longevity (4), reduced risk of age-related conditions such as heart diseases (5) and cognitive impairment (6), and healthier lifestyles that are key to wellbeing in old age, including physical activity (7) and the use of preventative health services (8). Importantly, purpose may decrease loneliness and promote receptivity to health messaging. Higher purpose has been associated with less perceived loneliness among older adults (9), though less is known about the causal link. Further, our previous work suggests that purpose in life may increase receptivity to health messages, such that individuals with greater sense of purpose in life showed lower conflict-related neural responses while exposed to health messages, which then predicted the likelihood of them agreeing with the self-relevant health messages (10). Together, evidence suggests that increasing purpose might be an effective strategy to shield older adults from the virus as well as loneliness during times of global pandemic.

The proposed study will test the effects of purpose in life on loneliness and receptivity to COVID-19 messages in older adults. Study 1 will test the links among individual differences in purpose in life, perceived loneliness, and COVID-19 related responses (i.e., intentions, norms, and beliefs). Study 2, which will be amended to this preregistration after initial rounds of pilot will causally manipulate purpose in life by reminding people of values shared across their social group and test its effects on perceived loneliness and responses to COVID-19 related measures.

Underlying data and CONSORT checklist for Using pens as an incentive for questionnaire return in an orthopaedic trial: an embedded randomised controlled retention trial,"Background: We did a ‘study within a trial’ (SWAT), evaluating the effectiveness of the inclusion of a pen with a postal questionnaire, compared to no pen being included, on the retention rate in a large orthopaedic trial.
Methods: The SWAT was embedded in the KReBS trial. The primary outcome was the proportion of 12-month questionnaires returned. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of questionnaires completed and time to questionnaire return. Binary data were analysed using logistic regression and time to return using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) are presented, with associated 95% confidence intervals and p-values. 
Results: In total, 2308 participants were randomised into the SWAT. In the pen group, 1020/1146 (89.0%) of participants returned a questionnaire, compared to 982/1147 (85.6%) in the no pen group. The absolute difference in questionnaire return rate was 3.4% (95% CI: 0.7% to 6.1%; p=0.01). There were statistically significant differences in questionnaire return rate (OR 1.34; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.72; p=0.02), questionnaire completion rate (OR 1.39; 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.76; p&lt;0.01) and time to questionnaire return (HR 1.16; 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.27; p&lt;0.01) favouring the pen group.
Conclusion: This SWAT adds to the growing evidence base for whether pens are effective as an incentive for retention, and indicates their potential effectiveness.",bepn3,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bepn3/contributors/?format=json,,[],x9vyu

Behavioural characteristics associated with successful weight loss in overweight and obese women undergoing a 14-week diet,"The purpose of this study is to understand whether free-living movement behaviours (physical activity [PA], sedentary behaviour [SB] and sleep) and free-living eating behaviours (total energy intake [EI] and/or macronutrient composition) predict clinically significant weight loss (≥5%) following a weight loss diet. The study is a secondary analysis of data collected from a trial that is reported in detail elsewhere (Buckland et al. 2018) and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (#NCT02012426). Women participants with overweight or obesity followed a 14-week weight loss diet. Outcome measure including body mass, body composition, waist circumference, resting metabolic rate, free-living movement behaviours and free-living eating behaviours were completed at the start and the end of the weight loss programmes.

Women participants with overweight or obesity (aged 18-65 years; body mass index (BMI) 28-45 kg/m2) were recruited by advertisement from the University of Leeds. Inclusion criteria were: provided written informed consent, healthy women, aged 18-65 years, BMI between 28-45 kg/m2, reporting an interest in weight loss and not actively participating in a commercial weight loss programme, not increased PA levels in the past 4 weeks, able to eat most everyday foods and fruits and vegetables. Exclusion criteria were: significant health problems, taking any medication or supplements known to affect appetite or weight, pregnant, planning to become pregnant or breastfeeding, history of anaphylaxis to food, known food allergies or food intolerance, smokers and those who have recently ceased smoking (within the last 3 months), participants receiving systemic or local treatment likely to interfere with evaluation of the study parameters, those who have taken part in a commercial weight loss programme in the last 2 months, individuals who work in appetite or feeding related areas, unable to consume foods used in the study, individuals who have had bariatric surgery, history of an eating disorder, presence of untreated hypothyroidism, insufficient English language skills to complete study questionnaires. \nDesign\nThe study was a non-randomised, parallel group design to explore whether there are behavioural characteristics associated with ≥5% or ≤3% weight loss following a 14-week diet. BM was measured with shoes and heavy clothing removed on the first day of the weight management programme using electronic scales. Participants’ self-reported adherence to the intervention each week by responding to ‘How well have you managed to stick with the weight control programme?’ on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) anchored at each end with ‘Not at all well’ and ‘Very well’. Between weeks 2 and 14 participants visited the laboratory in the Human Appetite Research Unit (HARU) at the University of Leeds for measurement days. Participants received payment of £250 on completion of the study to reimburse them for their time and expenses. The study procedures and all study materials were reviewed and approved by the School of Psychology Ethics Board at the University of Leeds (14-0090).\nWeight management programme\nParticipants either followed the commercial diet (Slimming World) or the self-led diet (NHS Choices) for the 14-week intervention period. The commercial diet encouraged ad libitum intake of low energy dense foods as part of a balanced diet, with weekly weigh-ins, group support, weight loss goals and access to online support. The self-led diet group accessed free online resource and a self-led diet programme which recommends reducing calorie intake by 600 kcal/d. Both diet programmes also encouraged individuals to self-monitor and to increase the amount of physical activity they do.\nFor the purpose of this study, data were analysed with both diet intervention groups combined and participants were then categorised based on their percentage change in BM, but programme type was controlled for in all analyses. There were no specific research questions pertaining to the type of diet used to induce weight loss. Rather, the study sought to explore behavioural characteristics associated with the degree of diet-induced weight loss success.\nProcedures\nBM was measured on the first day of the weight management programme using electronic scales (commercial diet group: recorded as part of their first weigh-in at a support group meeting; self-led diet group: recorded by a researcher at the HARU). BM was measured with shoes and heavy clothing removed.\nFor all laboratory visits (measures and probe days) participants were instructed to be fasted from 10:00 pm the previous night and to abstain from strenuous exercise and alcohol consumption for at least 24 hours before all laboratory visits. Compliance was checked on arrival via self-report.\nMeasures days\nParticipants completed two measurement days; one during week 2 and one during week 14 at the end of the intervention. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured (GEM, NutrEn Technology Ltd, Cheshire, UK) with participants laying supine for 40 min during which expired air was collected using a ventilated hood system. VO2 and VCO2 values were sampled every 30 seconds. The average of the final 30 min values was deemed to be the RMR expressed as kcal/d. BM and body composition (fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM)) were measured using the BODPOD (Body Composition Tracking System, Life Measurement, Inc., Concord, USA) which uses air displacement plethysmography. Participants wore tight clothing and a swim cap to allow for an accurate measure of body volume. Height was measured using a stadiometer (Seca Ltd., Birmingham, UK) and waist circumference (WC) was measured horizontally in line with the umbilicus. \nFree-living energy intake\nParticipants completed a 7-day weighed food diary during weeks 3 and 12. Electronic scales and training were provided to ensure detailed descriptions (e.g. brands) and consumed weights of foods and beverages were reported. Total EI, macronutrient composition and energy density were calculated from the food diary. Energy density was calculated from the contribution of all food and milks (excluded all other drinks) (total EI divided by total weight intake) based on criteria previously used (Wrieden et al. 2015). Data were analysed using WISP 4.0 (Tinuviel Software 2013).\nFree-living physical activity, sedentary behaviour and energy expenditure\nFree-living PA and SB was objectively measured during week 3 and 12 using the SenseWear Armband mini (SWA; BodyMedia, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA), as has previously been described (Myers et al., 2016). Participants were instructed to wear the SWA on the posterior surface of their upper non-dominant arm for a minimum of 22 hour/d for ≥6 days (except for the time spent showering, bathing or swimming). For the SWA data to be valid &gt;22 hours of data per day had to be recorded on at least five days (midnight to midnight) including at least one weekend day.\nClassification of responders and non-responders\nTo identify differences that could account for individual variability in weight loss, participants were grouped based on their diet-induced BM change between week 0 and week 14. Participants were classified as responders if they lost ≥5% and non-responders if they lost ≤3% of their initial BM.\n\nAll participants who completed both measures days and both free-living PA and EI measurement periods will be included in the analyses.

s news to blame?  Analyzing the effects of more news on affective polarization and other outcomes,"Many scholars accept that democracies function best when citizens are up-to-date on political events and knowledgeable about the issues of the day (e.g., Delli Carpini &amp; Keeter, 1996). Thus, news exposure has been seen as normatively beneficial, and citizens are expected to attend to the news (as reected, for instance, in social desirability bias leading to overreporting of news consumption in survey self-reports; Prior, 2009). Yet, the current media environment makes it possible for citizens to avoid news altogether, which could decrease political knowledge and engagement (Delli Carpini &amp; Keeter, 1996). It may be equally problematic that those who decide to tune in to political outlets have unprecedented opportunity to consume like-minded news, which may in part be to blame for increasing attitude (e.g., Levendusky, 2013) and affective polarization, or the animosity between people who identify with opposing political parties (e.g., Garrett et al., 2014). In this project, we problematize the notion of news exposure being necessarily democratically desirable and, in so doing, we offer a novel take on the problem of polarization.

We propose that increasing people's news exposure will exacerbate both attitude and affective polarization. We rely on group identity as a major mechanism underlying these effects. As people are exposed to news, political issues, parties, policies, and different sociopolitical groups become more salient in their minds, regardless of the ideology of the news consumed. Therefore, people learn and/or are reminded of the positions of their political in-group as well as the out-group. Because people tend to use group cues and their own political identity to make sense of the political world, they often adopt an opinion that more closely matches their in-group, increasing attitude polarization. During this process, group identity also becomes more salient, increasing affective polarization or negative attitudes toward the political out-group.

We also suspect that increasing news exposure will lead to more negative perceptions of the political system, lowering support for compromise and also increasing perceived levels of polarization and of attribution to negative intentions to the out-party (i.e., attribution of malevolence). In addition to these effects, we also explore the effects of increased news consumption on an under-studied factor, namely individual general well-being. Finally, in order to provide a balanced perspective on the impact of news, we also address the expected democratically beneffcial effects of increased political knowledge and participatory intentions.

In sum, this project addresses a fundamental question: ""In what ways is news of any kind harmful, and in what ways is it beneffcial?"" To test these effects, we incentivized participants in our ongoing panel to increase their news consumption for 12 days (the treatment). We include this experiment at the end of the second wave of a 3-wave panel study in Poland. 2,138 respondents completed wave 1 and were invited to the second wave. We randomly assign wave 2 respondents into this ""more news"" treatment group with a .6 probability. The rest are assigned to a control group and do not receive any instructions regarding altering their news diet. Our approach is novel in that we look at the effects of increasing news consumption in general (i.e., altering an individual's news diet) as opposed to the effect of exposure to a single article or browsing session, using an experimental design in a naturalistic setting. This may also be the first study to address various distinct effects of news consumption using both self-reported measures as well as observational methods in the form of online browsing data that the study participants voluntarily submitted.

In the analyses, we aim to establish the effects of increasing news exposure while also testing whether these effects depend on people's prior levels of (likeminded) news consumption.",7zg68,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7zg68/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'See ""more_news_experiment_prereg-analysisplan.pdf"" attached to the ""Study design"" section.'}, 'uploader': {'extra': [], 'value': ''}}","['affective polarization', 'experiment', 'media effects', 'news effects']",hvckf

Survey Experiments on Stigma and Narratives,"This study seeks to examine the role of narratives in mitigating the effects of a stigma, specifically the stigma of a criminal record in the search for employment. Prior research has examined the ways that narratives impact the experience of stigma for the identity construction of the stigmatized individual and have theorized that narratives have the potential to mitigate stigma in how others treat the individual with the stigmatized status. Yet no research of which we are aware has tested such a stigma mitigation hypothesis in the context of criminal record stigma in the labor market. This study will test this hypothesis by presenting survey respondents recruited through Amazon MTurk with the task of evaluating a fictitious job applicant for a fictitious job. We will randomly assign survey respondents to either a job applicant without a criminal record or one of several job applicants with criminal records who present different narratives about their lives since they acquired the record. The goal is to test the hypothesis that job applicants with different narratives about their criminal record and subsequent lives will experience different stigma from the criminal record (as measured by different evaluations by the survey respondents).",uwmja,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/uwmja/contributors/?format=json,Registration following analysis of the data,"['audit study', 'employment', 're-entry']",9vbgx
"Influence of Smartphone notification bings on affect (valence, activation) and happiness","The usage of smartphones for scientific purposes is gaining more and more popularity (e.g., Fisher &amp; To, 2012). Indeed, smartphones as research tools in the field of psychology bear multiple significant advantages (see Miller, 2012; Raento, Oulasvirta, &amp; Eagle, 2009):

Smartphones seem to be ideally suited as tools for Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM; Hektner, Schmidt, &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2007). Experience Sampling  is aiming at studying everyday psychological phenomena in naturalistic settings, asking participants about their momentary behaviour, thoughts, or emotions at various moments. While traditional methods rely on retrospective or generalized self-reports, ESM provides in-situ and in-vivo self-report data (Kahneman, Krueger, Schkade, Schwarz, &amp; Stone, 2004; Mehl &amp; Conner, 2012), thus phenomena are captured where and when they actually occur. Considering repeated measurements in the field, ESM is promising the advantage of enhancing or maximizing ecological validity. Due to their versatile properties, smartphones have eventually already replaced other devices in the ESM context. 

A distinctive characteristic of smartphones compared to other methods is that in most cases they are already owned and used by the respondents. What is an obvious benefit from an economic point of view, could at the same time raise concerns regarding the validity of the results:

Paper-pencil- and PDA-based diaries are designed or programmed for one specific purpose, namely gathering data within the framework of a study. Smartphones, however, already fulfil a vast number of other functions apart from serving as survey tools (e.g., social interactions, information gathering). In the United States, users have on average 35 apps installed on their smartphone, using about one third of these on a daily basis . Pielot, Church, and de Oliveira (2014) found in their study that participants (N=15) received on average 65.3 notifications from different apps per day. Given this vast volume of notifications, smartphone users have to deal with every day, feelings of information overload and satiation seem plausible. Unlike with PDAs, smartphone notifications from several apps must compete for the attention of their users, the rising number of apps installed making it more difficult to distinguish between more or less important bings. Regarding this aspect, participant burden in smartphone-based studies might not be as low as it is believed to be.

It could be shown that notifications can induce negative affects to their recipients: Objective and subjective e-mail and social network (but not messenger) notification counts are positively correlated with negative emotions like the increased feelings of being overwhelmed, stressed, interrupted and annoyed (Pielot et al., 2014). Furthermore, when apps subjectively not perceived as useful continue sending notifications, users become annoyed and consider deleting them from their phones (Felt, Egelman, &amp; Wagner, 2012).
Weber, Voit, Auda, Schneegass, and Henze (2018) allowed their participants (N=16) to explicitly “snooze” the notifications of all apps installed on their smartphones via NHistory, an app specifically developed for this purpose. Main motives for deferring notifications included avoidance of switching contexts, being unable (e.g., while driving), or not being in the mood to react to the prompts. 

In the context of smartphone-based ESM studies, participants typically respond to 2–12 bings per day (see Reis &amp; Gable, 2000). In accordance to app notifications in general, frequent notifications of research apps evoke feelings of annoyance (Church &amp; de Oliveira, 2013; Klasnja, Harrison, LeGrand, LaMarca, Froehlich, &amp; Hudson, 2018; see also van Berkel, Ferreira, &amp; Kostakos, 2017).

Recently, several smartphone-based ESM studies have been conducted measuring affect in different contexts, applying signal-contingent designs. The devices were either provided by the researcher (e.g., Bujarski, Roche, Sheets, Krull, Guzman, &amp; Ray, 2015; Timmons et al., 2017) or the respondents installed a research app on their proprietary smartphones (e.g., Stieger &amp; Lewetz, 2018; Wouters, Jacobs, Duif, Lechner, &amp; Thewissen, 2018). Therefore, the question arises whether the negative mood elicited by the notifications, spills over to the assessment of affect within the ESM design.",aks7u,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/aks7u/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,[],pf43s

Framing effects on the effectiveness and virality of health messages related to COVID-19,"The opinions and behaviors of peers are potent factors influencing human decision making (Cialdini &amp; Goldstein, 2004). As such, a number of studies have demonstrated that descriptive norm-based messages can be effective at influencing individuals’ behavior through changing their perceived norms. Such health campaigns have been carried out in the U.S., Canada, and the UK, and targeted a number of risky and health behaviors, such as drug use, alcohol consumption, and tobacco use (e.g. Arbour-Nicitopoulos, Kwan, Lowe, Taman, &amp; Faulkner, 2010; Cislaghi &amp; Heise, 2018; Donaldson et al., 1994; Larimer &amp; Neighbors, 2003; Liu &amp; Shi, 2019; Neighbors et al., 2004). In addition to descriptive norms, other persuasive appeals (such as autonomy and humor) have shown to be effective at influencing people’s health-related beliefs and behaviors. In the proposed study, we assess the social relevance and favorability of norm-based covid-19 social distancing messages (e.g. messages that highlight people staying home and avoiding crowds) as well as their effectiveness in shifting people’s perceived social distancing norms. In addition, we will examine the interaction effects of individuals’ interdependent self-construal and experimental condition (norms/autonomous/humor) on perceived social distancing norms.",xg4sa,True,False,Preregistration Template from AsPredicted.org,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xg4sa/contributors/?format=json,,"['covid', 'covid19', 'health', 'message intervention', 'norm', 'persuasion']",8hn2g
Influence of COVID-19 pandemic on misinformation susceptibility and problem solving,"While misinformation has been a feature of human experience for as long as people could formulate arguments, the rise of the internet and social media
has created conditions in which individuals or groups can create fake news capable of reaching millions of people in short order. Fast circulation of fake news has become particularly pernicious during the state of social panic created by the COVID-19 pandemic, where people are forced to make fast decisions and solve problems in a very short time. In this study we aim to understand how fear and the feeling of panic modulate believing in fake news, and investigate what reasoning abilities (specifically insight problem solving) might diminish
susceptibility to believing in misinformation. Previous research from our group has shown that performance of insight problem solving predicts differences in susceptibility to fake news, bullshit receptivity, and overclaiming. Yet, whether this relation holds during conditions of panic and fear remains unexplored.

Distinct relationships between youth depression and within-network functional connectivity of the fronto-parietal and default mode networks,"This project aims to examine the relationship between functional connectivity (FC) and youth depression both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, particularly with respect to the default mode network (DMN) and the frontoparietal network (FPN). The subjects consist of 124 youths aged between 6 and 13 who had available FC data at the first fMRI wave of data collection. I hypothesize that depressive symptoms will be negatively associated with FC during rest within the FPN and positively associated FC during rest within the DMN at the first fMRI assessment wave of the Preschool Depression Study (PDS).

Fostering prosocial responses to the COVID-19 pandemic,"How do we unite against a common threat such as COVID-19? How can we harness the collective (“we”) instead of the individual (“I”), in curbing its spread? As the pandemic unfolds, some people might mitigate the negative situation by cooperating by default (Drury, Cocking &amp; Reicher, 2009). However, others might be more inclined to act in a more individualistic way (e.g., panic buying) instead of more collectively (e.g., buying enough for themselves and preserving more for others). In the current pandemic, the general advice is that people need to (1) act not only to protect themselves, but also the most vulnerable and (2) do something counterintuitive: protect the more vulnerable by increasing the physical distance to them, when in fact decreasing social distance is a natural tendency in cooperation (Klein, 2020). How can we overcome the ‘individualistic’ impulse and adopt counter-intuitive behaviour? In three studies, we will test three methods that can improve the public’s response to the current pandemic, based on social identity theories and individual differences that tell us who is more and less likely to follow recommendations (e.g., trust, political ideology, conspiracy mentality, individualism, susceptibility to the virus).",gha5z,True,False,OSF-Standard Pre-Data Collection Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gha5z/contributors/?format=json,,[],4xdpa

Efficacy and Safety of Chinese Herbal Medicine for COVID- 19: a protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The patients of COVID-19 usually present with fever, cough, while about 23.7% of patients are accompanied by at least one coexisting disease. The disease is highly contagious with a R0 value about 3-4. The rapid increase in the number of patients put great pressure on the health care system. With the aggravation of the shortage of medical treatment, the mortality rate of the disease increases. As of 15:00 on March 31, 2020, 793278 people were diagnosed with the disease and at least 38545 died. At present, there is no specific cure for this disease, and the clinical management mainly depends on supportive treatment. Lopinavir-Ritonavir was once thought to be a promising medicine on COVID-19, but a recently published clinical trial found that the effect was limited. As excessive immune response is an important reason for the progression of the patient's condition, the researchers turned their attention to immunosuppressants. In a small sample clinical trial, the researchers found that Hydroxychloroquine could improve the state of patients' lungs and increase the probability of the virus turning negative. However, the sample size of this study is small, and there may be some defects in the research design. In a case report, Remdesivir has shown good efficacy in patients with COVID-19, and larger clinical trials are currently under way. Therefore, it is an important and urgent task to explore new therapeutic agents. In the fourth edition of the diagnosis and treatment guideline of COVID-19 in China, Lianhuaqingwen capsule was listed as one of the recommended medicines. In addition, traditional Chinese medicines (CHM), including Qingfei Paidu decoction, Huanglian Jiedu decoction etc., are also widely used in the adjuvant treatment of COVID-19. In terms of clinical research, many scholars have carried out clinical trials on the efficacy of CHM in treating COVID-19. However, these studies are only carried out in local areas, so they fail to provide definite evidence to prove the effectiveness of CHM. In this study, we aim to summarize the current evidence of CHM in treating COVID-19 through systematic review and meta-analysis. This study is necessary before further large-scale clinical studies being carried out. For clinicians, this study can provide some direction and guidance for clinical practice.",c693z,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/c693z/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Three English database including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials and four Chinese databases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, the VIP information resource integration service platform (cqvip), China Biology Medicine Disc (Sino Med) will be searched from its inception to April 1, 2020 without language limitation.

Latent Correlations Between Trait Aggression and Trait Antagonism,"In this follow-up study, I will again test the prediction that the antagonism (low agreeableness) factor of the Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality will account for the overwhelming majority of the variance in trait aggression (latent correlations &gt; .60). Other FFM factors will exhibit latent correlations &lt; |.60|. 

Exploratory analyses with the IPIP-NEO-120 FFM and Brief Aggression Questionnaire supported these predictions. Subsequent confirmatory analyses with the Big Five Inventory and full Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire only weakly supported these predictions. This may be due to the different content in the Agreeableness subscales of the NEO and BFI.

I will now seek to confirm the exploratory analyses by replicating them in a dataset from an existing laboratory study with 424 undergraduate participants who completed the 12-item Brief Aggression Questionnaire measure of trait aggression and the 60-item NEO-Five Factor Inventory scale.

I will use the lavaan package for R to run factor analyses for each FFM facet using the following design:

LatentCorr.mod &lt;- 'BAQtotal =~ BAQphysical + BAQverbal + BAQanger + BAQhostility
IPIPagreeableness =~ NEO.4 + NEO.9 + NEO.14 + NEO.19 + NEO.24 + NEO.29 + NEO.34 + NEO.39 + NEO.44 + NEO.49 + NEO.54 + NEO.59
IPIPconscientious =~ NEO.5 + NEO.10 + NEO.15 + NEO.20 + NEO.25 + NEO.30 + NEO.35 + NEO.40 + NEO.45 + NEO.50 + NEO.55 + NEO.60
IPIPextraversion =~ NEO.2 + NEO.7 + NEO.12 + NEO.17 + NEO.22 + NEO.27 + NEO.32 + NEO.37 + NEO.42 + NEO.47 + NEO.52 + NEO.59
IPIPneuroticism =~ NEO.1 + NEO.6 + NEO.11 + NEO.16 + NEO.21 + NEO.26 + NEO.31 + NEO.36 + NEO.41 + NEO.46 + NEO.51 + NEO.56
IPIPopenness =~ NEO.3 + NEO.8 + NEO.13 + NEO.18 + NEO.23 + NEO.28 + NEO.33 + NEO.38 + NEO.43 + NEO.48 + NEO.53 + NEO.58'

fitmod &lt;- cfa(LatentCorr.mod, data=[Dataset], missing='ML')

summary(fitmod, fit.measures=TRUE, standardized = TRUE)

I will then report the standardized latent correlations for each FFM factor.

"The Relationship Among Chronic Stress, Anxiety, and Attentional Control","Attentional Control Theory (ACT), which has received consistent support (Shi et al., 2019), proposes that the ability to successfully shift and focus attention is interrupted by anxiety, as attention is allocated to perceived threatening information (Eysenck et al., 2007). Emerging adulthood tends to be a time of increased anxiety symptoms (Barsy et al., 2010; Daviu et al., 2019; Edwards et al., 2017; Hidalgo et al., 2001; Kumsta et al., 2017; McLaughlin &amp; Hatzenbuehler, 2009; Miloyan et al., 2018), and AC is especially important at this time in order to excel in undergraduate programs. Thus, it is important to study potential mechanisms that contribute to the anxiety – attentional control (AC) link during this period. 
Stress, which is also highly prevalent in young adults, specifically college undergraduates, is a well-known risk factor for anxiety (Sarafino &amp; Ewing, 1999) and has also been correlated with impaired AC (Bardeen &amp; Daniel, 2017; Gulley et al., 2016; Jonsdottir et al., 2017; Kushner &amp; Tackett, 2017; Laceulle et al., 2015; Liston et al., 2006, 2009; Orem et al., 2008; Shields et al., 2016; Skosnik et al., 2000). The well-established relation between stress and anxiety may help explain the negative relation between stress and AC. Therefore, since stress is a known risk factor for both anxiety and impaired AC, and anxiety is known to impair AC, anxiety may mediate the relation between stress and AC. The current study assessed whether anxiety mediates the effect of stressful life events on AC over time.",dwymq,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dwymq/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to accessing the data,[],rb7wz

The Stability of Infant Physiological Reactivity from Seven to 18 Months,"Physiological reactivity refers to changes in the body in response to environmental stimuli. For the purpose of this study, the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) will be discussed as a measurement of physiological reactivity. The PNS is a marker of physiological arousal and regulation when individuals are faced with stressful or challenging situations in the environment (Beauchaine, 2001). Researchers can reliably measure PNS activity through respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), which reflects the variation of heart rate during the respiration cycle (Barbosa, Beeghly, Moreira, Tronick &amp; Fuentes, 2018; Beauchaine, 2001). RSA is driven by  the withdrawal or activation of the vagus nerve. During stressful or challenging states, the vagus nerve withdraws its influence on heart rate, thus allowing an increase in heart rate and a decrease in RSA (Porges, 2003).
	
Extensive research has explored the associations between infants’ physiological responses to stress and their caregiving experiences, attachment patterns, and emotion regulation abilities (Barbosa et al., 2018; Beauchaine, 2001; Conradt &amp; Ablow, 2010; Ham &amp; Tronick, 2009; Holochwost, Gariépy, Propper, Mills, &amp; Moore, 2014; Moore, Cohn &amp; Campbell, 2001; Moore, Hill-Soderlund, Propper, Calkins, Mills-Koonce, &amp; Cox, 2009). However, little is known about infants’ autonomic response trajectories across time. One study that has examined these longitudinal patterns is Alkon, Lippert, Vujan, Rodriguez, Boyce and Eskenazi (2006), which measured infants’ RSA during stressful and resting states at six and 12 months. Their results demonstrated that although infants’ RSA responses increased with development, infants’ individual rank order was relatively stable within that time frame. Further, Jewell, Suk and Luecken (2018) studied infants’ RSA trajectories from six weeks to two years of age. However, because only baseline activity was used for their analyses, this study lacked RSA reactivity during states of arousal.

The Still Face Paradigm (SFP) is commonly used to assess physiological responses to resting and challenging states of arousal for infants between the ages of four and nine months (Barbosa et al., 2018; Braugart-Rieker, Zentall, Lickenbrock, Ekas, Oshio, &amp; Planalp, 2014; Conradt &amp; Ablow, 2010; Holochwost et al., 2014; Moore, Cohn &amp; Campbell, 2001; Moore et al., 2009). The standard SFP consists of three episodes (play, still-face, and recovery) in which the caregiver is instructed to either interact with their infant as they normally would or hold a neutral facial expression (Conradt &amp; Ablow, 2010). Infants’ RSA levels tend to decrease be-tween play and still-face episodes as the infant becomes distressed in response to the caregiver’s neutral facial expression. Although RSA levels typically return to baseline levels between still-face and recovery episode (Barbosa et al., 2018; Conradt &amp; Ablow, 2010; Ham &amp; Tronic, 2009; Holochwost et al., 2014; Jones-Mason, Alkon, Coccia, &amp; Bush, 2018; Moore &amp; Calkins, 2004; Moore et al., 2009; Qu &amp; Leerkes, 2017; Weinberg &amp; Tronick, 1996), the rate of recovery can depend on a variety of parent-child factors such as attention, parental sensitivity and socioeco-nomic status (Conradt &amp; Ablow, 2010; Jones-Mason et al., 2018; Moore et al., 2009).

The Strange Situation Procedure (SSP) is commonly used to assess physiological responses to stress for infants between the ages of 12 and 24 months. The SSP consists of eight episodes (1: baseline; 2: mother-child play, 3: mother-child-stranger; 4: child-stranger [1st separation]; 5: mother-child reunion; 6: child alone [2nd separation]; 7: child-stranger; and 8: child-mother reunion; Qu &amp; Leerkes, 2017; Smith, Woodhouse, Clark, &amp; Skowron, 2016). Infants’ RSA levels typically decrease from baseline starting on episode 5 reach the lowest point during episode 7, and then increase and partially recover during the final episode (Hill-Soderlund, Mills-Koonce, Propper Calkins, Granger, Moore, Gariepy, &amp; Cox, 2008; Kohler-Dauner, Roder, Krause, Buchheim, Gündel, Fegert, Ziegenhain, &amp; Walter, 2019; Roder, Koehler-Dauner, Krause, Prinz, Rottler, Alkon, Kolassa, Gündel, Fegert, Ziegenhain, &amp; Walter, 2020; Smith et al., 2016).
	
To our knowledge, no studies have examined the longitudinal associations between pat-terns of RSA reactivity during the SFP and the SSP. Assessing these longitudinal patterns will provide researchers with a deeper understanding of the stability of physiological patterns during this important developmental period. With this in mind, the present study aims to investigate whether infant’s mean RSA levels at seven months of age during the SPF predict mean RSA levels at 18 months of age during the SSP.",2dsgc,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2dsgc/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'As described by Lin, Kaliush, Conradt, Terrell, Neff, Allen, Smid, Monk &amp; Crowell, (2019), recruitment for this study was carried out from January 2016 to October 2018.

Research questions
This study tests the effects of an unlimited leave policy at a bank in the Netherlands on their employees’ levels of autonomy, work happiness and work-related well-being among other things. Specifically, some of the research questions we aim to address include the following:  

1.	Effects of unlimited holidays
a.	What effects does unlimited leave have on employees? Specifically, do employees benefit from unlimited leave compared to employees who do not have unlimited leave? 
b.	What effects does unlimited leave have on an organization? Specifically, do organizational outcomes improve with unlimited leave compared to the regular leave policy? 
c.	Does unlimited leave have any undesired effects (e.g., elevated work pressure or social conflicts within teams)? 
d.	Does unlimited leave influence employees’ perception of the organization, and foster a cultural change towards autonomy and self-management at the organization?
2.	Role of individual characteristics and work context
a.	Do some employees benefit more from unlimited leave than others, and what are the characteristics of these employees in terms of personal, organizational, task or team variables? 
b.	Are there environmental and organizational factors that support or hinder positive effects of unlimited leave to unfold? 
c.	Regarding organizational factors, which steps of the implementation of unlimited leave are related to the experience of more or less autonomy and employees’ happiness?

Latent Correlations Between Trait Aggression and Trait Antagonism,"Trait aggression remains an imperfectly understood personality construct without a major theoretical framework in which to reside. In this project, I will test the prediction that the antagonism (low agreeableness) factor of the Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality will account for the overwhelming majority of the variance in trait aggression (latent correlations &gt; .60). Other FFM factors will exhibit latent correlations &lt; |.60|. These predictions are supported by a wealth of evidence that places antagonism at the core of aggressive behavior:

I ran an exploratory analysis on the data of 355 undergraduates who completed the Brief Aggression Questionnaire (BAQ) and the IPIP-NEO-120. This factor analysis modeled the latent correlations between trait aggression (indicated by the Physical Aggression, Verbal Aggression, Anger, and Hostility subscales) and all five FFM factors (each factor indicated by its six underlying facets), simultaneously. This model revealed that the antagonism facet of the FFM accounted for the overwhelming majority of the variance in trait aggression (latent r = .90), whereas the other four factors only accounted for a relatively small amount of variance in trait aggression (latent rs: conscientiousness = -.29, neuroticism = .22, extraversion = -.01, openness = -.03).

I will now seek to confirm these analyses by replicating them in a combined dataset constructed from several existing laboratory studies on undergraduate participants who completed the 29-item Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire measure of trait aggression and the 44-item Big Five Inventory (7 studies, combined N = 893).

I will use the lavaan package for R to run factor analyses for each FFM facet using the following design:

LatentCorr.mod &lt;- 'BPAQtotal =~ BPAQphysical + BPASverbal + BPAQanger + BPAQhostility
BFIagreeableness =~ BFI.2 +  BFI.7 +  BFI.12 +  BFI.17 +  BFI.22 +  BFI.27 +  BFI.32 +  BFI.37 +  BFI.42
BFIconscientious =~ BFI.3 +  BFI.8 +  BFI.13 +  BFI.18 +  BFI.23 +  BFI.28 +  BFI.33 +  BFI.38 +  BFI.43
BFIextraversion =~ BFI.1 +  BFI.6 +  BFI.11 +  BFI.16 +  BFI.21 +  BFI.26 +  BFI.31 +  BFI.36
BFIneuroticism =~ BFI.4 +  BFI.9 +  BFI.14 +  BFI.19 +  BFI.24 +  BFI.29 +  BFI.34 +  BFI.39
BFIopenness =~ BFI.5 +  BFI.10 +  BFI.15 +  BFI.20 +  BFI.25 +  BFI.30 +  BFI.35 +  BFI.40 +  BFI.41 + BFI.44'

fitmod &lt;- cfa(LatentCorr.mod, data=[Dataset], missing='ML')

summary(fitmod, fit.measures=TRUE, standardized = TRUE)

I will then report the standardized latent correlations for each FFM factor. I will interpret that my hypotheses if the latent correlation between trait aggression and agreeableness is more negative than -.60, and if the latent correlations between trait aggression and the four other FFM factors are &lt; |.60|.",bh5fx,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bh5fx/contributors/?format=json,,[],73ngb

Precarious Manhood Beliefs: Isomorphism and Links to Gender Beliefs Across Cultures,"It has been 30 years since a large cross-cultural study was carried out testing people's understanding of masculinity and femininity (Williams &amp; Best, 1990).

This study is part of a larger, umbrella project that is collecting data from over 40 countries to determine how people think about men and women today.

In this project, we examine the isomorphism of a brief measure of precarious manhood beliefs. Precarious manhood beliefs are beliefs that manhood, relative to womanhood, is a social status that (1) is hard to earn, (2) is easy to lose, and (3) must be demonstrated repeatedly via public action.  

We test whether the brief, 4-item Precarious Manhood Beliefs (PMB) scale demonstrates statistical isomorphism across at least 45 (and up to 56) countries.  We also examine the unique associations of the PMB with two cross-culturally validated measures of gender beliefs: the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (Glick &amp; Fiske, 1996), and the Ambivalence toward Men Scale (Glick &amp; Fiske, 1999).  Finally, we examine whether the PMB correlates with country-level indicators of gender equality (the Global Gender Gap Index) and human development (the Human Development Index).",ckumd,True,False,"Pre-Registration in Social Psychology (van 't Veer & Giner-Sorolla, 2016): Pre-Registration",False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ckumd/contributors/?format=json,,"['Benevolence toward men', 'Benevolent sexism', 'Cross-cultural', 'Global Gender Gap Index', 'Hostile sexism', 'Hostility toward men', 'Human Development Index', 'Isomorphism', 'Measurement invariance', 'Precarious manhood']",u9xfg

Investigating the impact of thought probe format on the measurement of mind wandering,"Over the past decade, research on the topic of mind wandering has grown substantially, providing us with new and exciting insights into human attention and cognition, more broadly.  One issue within this line of research that has received little attention, however, is the heterogeneity in researchers’ conceptualizations of mind wandering. Many researchers differ in their definitions of mind wandering and, naturally, construct thought sampling probes aimed at measuring rates of mind wandering according to their held definitions. In spite of this, researchers tend to cite findings from studies on mind wandering assuming they all refer to the same phenomenon. The present study aims to test this assumption. In this study, participants completed a SART containing thought probes taken from three of the most commonly cited papers on mind wandering.

(2011) claimed that the Japanese individuals are highly sensitive to social signs of disapproval (such as the disappearance of happiness) compared to the Americans, because in their cultural contexts, where interdependence is prevalent, it is imperative that they adjust to their social environments. This claim was evidenced by the fact that the Japanese judged the offset of happiness earlier than the Americans, while observing individuals gradually changing their facial expressions from happiness to neutral. However, the pattern was not the same for sadness. The present study aims to conceptually replicate the previous findings, incorporating new conditions where sadness or happiness appears on a neutral face.

The effect of ESM on the participants’ emotional awareness ,"Frequent measurements direct participants to become aware, label and report their emotional experiences multiple times a day. Repeatedly directing attention to one’s inner state has previously been shown to increase trait mindfulness and emotional differentiation, constructs which are conceptually greatly overlapping with emotional awareness. The question that we propose in this study is whether repeated measures of ESM similarly increase participants’ emotional awareness over time and if this increase is related to the sampling frequency. Our goal is to analyze how the participation in ESM affects emotional awareness of the participants.  To this end, 164 participants were randomly assigned to receive questionnaires 3, 6, or 9 times per day over 14 days. Different measures will be used to study within-subject changes in trait and momentary emotional awareness over time, as well as to compare these changes between the different conditions.",hwu4a,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hwu4a/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Participants were eligible for inclusion if they were Dutch speaking, between 18-30 years old, currently enrolled as a student at a university or hogeschool, and had never taken part in a study that used a phone app before. Participants were recruited via advertisements on Facebook groups for research participants and flyers that were placed on different campuses of KU Leuven and in local bars. Recruitment started on 17.12.18 and testing was conducted between 11.02.19 and 18.07.19.\n\nOf the 164 participants that took part in the baseline session, 3 participants had to be excluded because they were not currently enrolled as a student, 2 dropped out during the ESM period, 4 missed more than 1 full day of data because of technical problems (for one participant the battery of the phone broke, for 3 people the time of the phone was reset for unknown reasons which led to beeps not being delivered), for 2 participants the time on the phone was off by more than 1 hour (which lead to the beeps being delivered at wrong times), and 1 participant failed to meet the minimum compliance requirement of one third of the ESM questionnaires started. For all these participants new participants were recruited. The reasoning for this decision was to assure that we would have at least 25 participants per condition in all analyses. Since it was uncertain whether technical problems would appear or participants would complete the study, more participants were included than our original inclusion goal. As soon as it was clear that every group had 25 ‘valid’ cases, no further participants were recruited.\n\nESM data collection procedure: \nThe ESM period lasted 14 days and was signal contingent. Participants received 3, 6, or 9 beeps, depending on the condition they have been assigned to during the baseline session. Beeps were semi-randomly spread between 9 am and 10:30 pm. In the 3-beep condition, beeps were scheduled randomly in each of three 4 h 30 min windows. In the 6-beep condition, the day was split into six 2 h 15 min windows and a beep was scheduled randomly in each of the windows. In the 9-beep condition, the day was split into 9 1h 30 min windows and one beep scheduled in each of them. There was a no beep window of 20 minutes between consecutive beeps.\n\nOn day 3, 6, 9, and 12, an instructed response item (i.e., a trick item that was supposed to function as a test if participants were paying attention to the questionnaire) was added to one of the questionnaires. It was always presented at the middle beep in the 3 beep condition and switched between the third and fourth beep in the 6 beep condition. In the 9 beep condition, it was shown once at the fourth beep, once at the sixth beep, and twice at the fifth beep. Due to constraints by the program used, no no-beep window of 20 minutes could be guaranteed between the last beep before the questionnaire with the instructed response item and the questionnaire with instructed response item (i.e., the last beep before the beep with the instructed response item could be less than 20 minutes before the beep with the instructed response item). The same applies to the first questionnaire after the questionnaire with the instructed response item.\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned to receive either a short (~30 items) or long questionnaire (~60 items) during the study. Following a pilot test, we estimated the completion time for the short questionnaire to be around 1,5 min and 2,5 min for the long questionnaire. The phone beeped or vibrated for 90 seconds or until the participant started filling in the questionnaire. After 90 seconds, the questionnaire became unavailable. Once participants started filling in the questionnaire, they had 90 seconds until time out per question (in case of time out, the questionnaire stopped and no subsequent questions were shown). Participants received a phone (motorola DEFY+) with the app mobileQ (Meers et al., 2019) installed on it. Other functions of the phone were fully disabled. At every beep, a start screen of the questionnaire was displayed automatically. Participants had to press “start survey” on this start screen to proceed to the first question. Sound and vibration could be turned on and off separately by the participants, but they couldn’t be disabled at the same time (if sound was switched off, the vibration was turned on automatically). Notifications did not require an internet connection to be delivered.\n'}, 'uploader': {'extra': [], 'value': ''}}",[],4p7bf
Efficacy and Safety of Chinese Herbal Medicine for COVID- 19: a protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by the Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The patients of COVID-19 usually present with fever, cough, while about 23.7% of patients are accompanied by at least one coexisting disease. The disease is highly contagious with a R0 value about 3-4. The rapid increase in the number of patients put great pressure on the health care system. With the aggravation of the shortage of medical treatment, the mortality rate of the disease increases. As of 15:00 on March 31, 2020, 793278 people were diagnosed with the disease and at least 38545 died.
At present, there is no specific cure for this disease, and the clinical management mainly depends on supportive treatment. Lopinavir-Ritonavir was once thought to be a promising medicine on COVID-19, but a recently published clinical trial found that the effect was limited. As excessive immune response is an important reason for the progression of the patient's condition, the researchers turned their attention to immunosuppressants. In a small sample clinical trial, the researchers found that Hydroxychloroquine could improve the state of patients' lungs and increase the probability of the virus turning negative.

Trolls Psyc 2017,"The Dark Tetrad is made up of four different personalities: Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and sadism. We encounter these personalities every day; the Machiavellian who has tricked you into giving something up, the narcissist who constantly brags about themselves, the subclinical psychopath who has physically hurt you, and the sadist who hurts people for fun. Cyberbullying is prominent in today’s society, as well as other online behaviors such as trolling. Trolling involves being deceptive online for no reason and towards people the person doesn’t know, and tricking people into humiliating themselves (Buckels, Trapnell, &amp; Paulhus, 2014). Online trolls are individuals who partake in deceptive, destructive, or disruptive behavior in a social setting on the Internet with no apparent instrumental purpose (Buckels, Trapnell &amp; Paulhus, 2014). There are many possible predictors of social media trolling behavior, specifically psychosocial disorders. As these individuals have no apparent purpose, we need an explanation for the behavior displayed by these online trolls is searched for. With research, one can gain an understanding of these behaviors. To begin to conduct research in order to understand trolling behaviors, one has to understand why these behaviors are prevalent in certain individuals. Research also indicates that those who are narcissists and those with antisocial personality disorder use social media more often than others (Rosen, Whaling, Rab, Carrier &amp; Cheever, 2013). An online “troll” is a separate personality related entity, and in order to understand this identity, one must understand the self- presentation that’s goes into its construction (Fox &amp; Rooney, 2015).
The behavior displayed by trolls over the Internet can not only give a lot of insight into the psychosocial disorders an individual may or may not possess or develop, but can also have severe effects on the individual on the receiving end of the trolls’ malicious behavior. By understanding the psychosocial predictors of social media trolling, the online behavior may be prevented along with its substantial and negative consequences to its victims (Howard, Zolnierek, Critz, Dailey &amp; Ceballos, 2019). There is a relationship believed to be between the Big Five personality traits, Dark Triad traits, and sadism with bullying and/ or cyberbullying (van Geel, Goemans, Toprak &amp; Vedder, 2017).If there is a relation between theses personality disorders and cyberbullying, as well as with increased social media use, then the negative behavior of online trolls can be predicted and prevented. This would solve the issue of the negative consequences trolling can have, while addressing the psychosocial disorder the ‘troll’ is experiencing. Understanding the meaning of an online “troll” and what traits they possess can also help society establish constructs of identity, as traits from the Dark Triad can manifest in both trolls and victims (Linton &amp; Power, 2013).",egth2,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/egth2/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to any human observation of the data,[],6tqk3

Efficacy and Safety of Chinese Herbal Medicine for COVID- 19: a protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The patients of COVID-19 usually present with fever, cough, while about 23.7% of patients are accompanied by at least one coexisting disease. The disease is highly contagious with a R0 value about 3-4. The rapid increase in the number of patients put great pressure on the health care system. With the aggravation of the shortage of medical treatment, the mortality rate of the disease increases. As of 15:00 on March 31, 2020, 793278 people were diagnosed with the disease and at least 38545 died. At present, there is no specific cure for this disease, and the clinical management mainly depends on supportive treatment. Lopinavir-Ritonavir was once thought to be a promising medicine on COVID-19, but a recently published clinical trial found that the effect was limited. As excessive immune response is an important reason for the progression of the patient's condition, the researchers turned their attention to immunosuppressants. In a small sample clinical trial, the researchers found that Hydroxychloroquine could improve the state of patients' lungs and increase the probability of the virus turning negative. However, the sample size of this study is small, and there may be some defects in the research design. In a case report, Remdesivir has shown good efficacy in patients with COVID-19, and larger clinical trials are currently under way. Therefore, it is an important and urgent task to explore new therapeutic agents. In the fourth edition of the diagnosis and treatment guideline of COVID-19 in China, Lianhuaqingwen capsule was listed as one of the recommended medicines. In addition, traditional Chinese medicines (CHM), including Qingfei Paidu decoction, Huanglian Jiedu decoction etc., are also widely used in the adjuvant treatment of COVID-19. In terms of clinical research, many scholars have carried out clinical trials on the efficacy of CHM in treating COVID-19. However, these studies are only carried out in local areas, so they fail to provide definite evidence to prove the effectiveness of CHM. In this study, we aim to summarize the current evidence of CHM in treating COVID-19 through systematic review and meta-analysis. This study is necessary before further large-scale clinical studies being carried out.

Objective: We aim to test the effect of a guidance approach on review effectiveness and efficiency. This effect is expected to work by lowering the cognitive load of the task; thus, we analyze the mediation relationship as well.
Method: To investigate this effect, we employ an experimental design where professional developers have to perform three code reviews. We use three conditions: no guidance, a checklist, and a checklist-based review strategy. Furthermore, we measure the reviewers’ cognitive load.
Limitations: The main limitations of this study concern the specific cohort of participants, the mono-operation bias for the guidance conditions, and the generalizability to other changes and defects.",r2u3b,True,False,Registered Report Protocol Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r2u3b/contributors/?format=json,,"['Checklist', 'Code review', 'Empirical Software Engineering']",5fptj

To investigate this, a large sample of actual dating site users were presented with real dating profile texts. Participants assessed the profiles’ originality, the profile owners’ perceived attractiveness and their intention to date the profile owner, and rated the profile owners on the mediation variables perceived intelligence, sense of humor, and oddness.

The second goal of this study is to examine in a more exploratory way what characteristics in dating profile texts enhance perceptions of text originality. To do so, all profile texts are manually coded on different meaning and form characteristics that could be indicators of profile text originality. Participants’ scores given to perceived profile text originality scores are then used to indicate what online daters perceive as original meaning and form characteristics, and whether different characteristics of profile text originality affect impression formation differently.",qm4v9,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/qm4v9/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,[],yns83

Bouba-Kiki Effect Applies to Meaning as well as Shape,"This experiment explores the idea of sound symbolism (i.e., the phenomenon that different language sounds tend to reflect different meanings). In this case, the idea that different phonemes have different affective associations. Specifically, /^/ (as in ""glum"") is associated with negative affect whereas /i:/ (as in ""gleam"") is associated with positive affect. Our recent findings have established that people perceive /^/ words as more emotionally negative than /i:/ words (which we have named the gleam-glum effect). Our goal is to further support this hypothesis  using a paradigm similar to the bouba-kiki paradigm. In our experiment, we present pairs of existing words: one with extremely positive affective valence and the other with extremely negative affective valence. Participants are then given a choice between two monosyllabic non-words, which differ only in their vowel. One having the /^/ vowel and the other having the /i:/ vowel. Participants are asked which word provides the best translation for which non-word. For example, given the meanings (words) ""good"" and ""sick"" and the non-words ""bleem"" and ""blum"", participants can assign the meaning ""good"" to either ""bleem"" or ""blum"" and by default the meaning ""sick"" to the other.
In addition, the difference in affective valence for each pair will vary to explore the extent to which the effect is indeed driven by affective valence.",cf9gw,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/cf9gw/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,[],bsnpg

Context-nonspecific familiarity and novelty detection deficits in subclinical paranoia and referential thinking,"Patients with schizophrenia show impaired episodic and recognition memory (Aleman et al., 1999), but the mechanisms by which such impairments may participate in the formation or maintenance of psychotic symptoms such as delusions remain unclear. The ability to detect novel stimuli relies on one’s capacity to hold and contrast items and events in memory. Detecting novelty in one’s environment is a key process in flexible learning and belief updating; decreased sensitivity to novel information may interfere with one’s ability to form new associations. Past research has shown abnormalities in novelty detection among individuals with schizophrenia (Schott et al., 2015; Weiss et al., 2004; Weiss et al., 2008) and, more specifically, susceptibility to and/or overconfidence in “false memories” (i.e., a false positive on a memory task, often using lures that are semantically related to targets as in a Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm; Evans et al., 2019; Bhat et al., 2010; Moritz et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2007). However, neither the processes that support these aberrancies nor the broader implications for delusional belief have been fully explored. To this end, the present study aims to investigate how delusion-prone individuals experience novel stimuli and how the detection of novelty may be impaired due to over-reliance on non-contextually-specific familiarity cues.

In the absence of clear episodic recollections, low-level “fluency” heuristics may guide memory judgements. Past research has probed this phenomenon via “Remember-Know” paradigms, which have provided evidence that individuals with schizophrenia are particularly reliant on familiarity assessments as a basis for retrieval (e.g., Achim &amp; Lepage, 2005; Erp et al., 2008; Libby et al., 2013). Over-reliance on familiarity-based heuristics makes it difficult to tag particular instances of a stimulus to a particular learning context and could thereby contribute to undue salience of stimuli incidental to the current context – a phenomenon thought to participate in delusions such as paranoia and referential thinking (Kapur, 2003), possibly through its contribution to the precision of prediction errors (Diaconescu et al., 2019; Fletcher &amp; Frith, 2009). Furthermore, cognitive models of delusional belief put forward a bias towards “liberal acceptance” as a key contributor to the formation of fixed false belief, drawing from evidence that delusional individuals tend to employ liberal decision thresholds, collecting less evidence before arriving at a highly confident conclusion (Moritz et al., 2008). In the context of a recognition memory paradigm, task-irrelevant familiarity information may thus be sufficient to surmount delusional individuals’ already-liberal “old/new” decision thresholds (also supported by Erp et al., 2008), manifesting in an impaired ability to detect stimuli that are contextually, but not absolutely, novel. If individuals high in delusionality are reliant on such fluency cues in recognition memory, one would expect memory performance to be impaired for familiar stimuli but relatively more intact for stimuli to which they have had no prior exposure. In other words, delusional or delusion-prone individuals would be predicted to show a greater propensity to report false alarms (i.e., mistaking a “new” stimulus for an “old” stimulus) in the context of stimuli that are encountered with high frequency (i.e., multiple contexts) in everyday life relative to stimuli to that are unfamiliar. In conjunction with delusional individuals’ tendency to report high confidence in errors (see Balzan et al., 2016 for a recent review), such an effect may manifest as overconfident failures in novelty detection that are particularly pronounced among familiar stimuli.

To explore these predictions, the present study seeks to determine whether over-reliance on fluency-based mechanisms during retrieval is associated with higher levels of delusion-proneness in the general population by testing whether the relationship between delusionality and memory deficits is more pronounced in the context of familiar stimuli (i.e., real words) relative to unfamiliar stimuli (i.e., pseudo words). More specifically, this study seeks to replicate and extend preliminary findings that point to an association between paranoia and deficits in novelty detection specifically in the context of familiar stimuli by a) replicating findings in a larger sample and b) testing this effect in individuals who endorse ideas of reference as well as paranoia. Characterizing this phenomenon may help to answer broader questions regarding the circumstances under which new information – which, in the real world, can come in the form of novel evidence that disconfirms strongly held beliefs – may fail to be detected by delusional individuals and how this may relate to experiences of aberrant salience.",hnj2w,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hnj2w/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': '275 participants will be recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform to complete an online Qualtrics survey.

The inclusion criteria were mother-baby pairs from selected villages in the community, and those who visited Ngora Health Center IV for routine immunization with babies under the age of five years.  For this study, we defined a baby as any person under the age of five years and a mother was considered as either biological or any other female in the direct care of the baby for at least four weeks. This was aimed at comparing samples from the baby, and the person in closest contact with the baby for the longest duration of time in the most recent past to allow presumed cross-transmission/cross-infection. Exclusion criteria were babies above five years, and those presented by male care takers as those were presumed to spend less time with the babies as is the general practice. Mothers who did not consent, or opted out at any stage of the research were excluded as well. The purpose of the research was explained to the mothers and they were asked to voluntarily participate in the research. Demographic data was captured using a pretest questionnaire. The questionnaire was pre-tested with 10 mother-baby pairs at Mbale regional referral hospital Young Child Clinic (YCC) because the mother-baby pair in Mbale hospital had homogenous characteristics with our target population in Ngora district. After pre-testing of the questionnaires, some questions were rephrased for clarity. Consecutive sampling was used to recruit participants meeting the criteria of inclusion at the young child clinic and in randomly selected villages in the community until the required sample size was achieved.

Defining Cheating Using Multiple Models,"Extradyadic romantic behavior in committed relationships, referred to here as “cheating,” is a common occurrence. For the purposes of this study, we define cheating as romantic or sexual behaviors that occur outside of a committed romantic relationship and that violate the expectations of the relationship. This definition can be broken down into two parts: the behavior that occurred and the judgment of whether that behavior constitutes cheating. Previous research has explored these two different parts separately, but have not included both parts of the definition, thus limiting the utility of their measures as they do not encapsulate the full construct. Given the inconsistent theoretical approaches and lack of full inclusion of the definition of cheating in research, our goal for the current project is to investigate whether a conceptualization of cheating that includes explicit cheating behaviors and the judgments of the behaviors as cheating fits the underlying structure of the construct. Specifically, we plan to investigate both explicit cheating behaviors as dimensional, as has been the standard in the research literature, and the judgments of the cheating behaviors as both a categorical and dimensional judgment.

Helping or Harming? The Effect of Trigger Warnings on Individuals with Trauma Histories,"Trigger warnings alert trauma survivors about potentially disturbing forthcoming content. However, empirical studies on trigger warnings suggest that they are functionally inert or cause small adverse side effects. We conducted a preregistered replication and extension of a previous experiment. Trauma survivors (n = 451) were randomly assigned to either receive or not receive trigger warnings prior to reading passages from world literature. We found no evidence that trigger warnings were helpful for trauma survivors, for those who self-reported a PTSD diagnosis, or for those who qualified for probable PTSD, even when survivors' trauma matched the passages' content. We found substantial evidence that trigger warnings countertherapeutically reinforce survivors' view of their trauma as central to their identity. Regarding replication hypotheses, the evidence was either ambiguous or substantially favored the hypothesis that trigger warnings have no effect. In summary, we find that trigger warnings are not helpful for trauma survivors.

Nevertheless, reliable data is crucial for clinical prevention measures such as medication reviews. In order to address this problem, we will conduct a systematic literature review to provide a synopsis of current evidence.

Sleep during the coronavirus pandemic,"Sleep quality is affected by several factors such as routine (Zisberg et al. 2010), natural light exposure (Wams et al. 2017), use of media devices (Carter et al. 2016), health status (Ohida et al. 2001), anxiety and depression (Alvaro et al. 2013), and post-traumatic stress disorder (Spoormaker and Montgomery 2008).

Covid-19 emerged at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China - and spread globally in the first few months of 2020 - leading to 'lockdown' in different areas around the world. This situation has led to seismic changes in day-to-day life, with people having been told to 'socially distance', 'socially isolate', work from home and stay indoors. This stressful situation and this dramatic change in day-to-day life in society is likely accompanied by multiple changes that impact upon sleep - including changes to working arrangements, routine, exercise, diet, stress levels, anxiety and depression, and health as well as time spent using electronic devices and in isolation. 

While many of these factors are typically associated with reduced sleep quality - there are other changes that could also result in increased opportunity for sleep - including a reduction in commuting time, and less time spent on other activities (outdoor activities and social activities) - increasing the time available to sleep. 

We started collecting cross-sectional data on sleep (in the context of a wider study focusing more generally on touch) in January and will continue collecting until the end of March. Given our large sample size, we plan to study responses received at different time points in order to examine changes in sleep over this unusual period in history.  

This study investigates sleep quality during the first 3 months of the COVID-19 outbreak. Cross sectional data regarding sleep quality and quantity and diurnal preference was collected among the population during the first 3 months of 2020.

DynaCORE-C: The DynaMORE cross-sectional survey study on psychological resilience to the mental health consequences of the Corona crisis,"The current Corona pandemic is not only a threat to physical health. First data from China and the United Kingdom indicate that symptoms of anxiety and depression and perceptions of stress rise significantly as a consequence of the pandemic. There are also anecdotal reports in the general media of increased domestic violence, divorce and suicide rates. Hence, the Corona crisis is also a mental health crisis. Threats to public mental health are likely to further increase with the spread of the virus across the world and the potentially severe economic, societal and political side effects of the pandemic. In this situation, there is urgent need for knowledge about factors that can protect mental health in this world-wide crisis and that can be harnessed in the service of public mental health promotion. DynaCORE-C attempts to identify these protective factors (resilience factors) with the help of an internet-based cross-sectional questionnaire survey for adults available in multiple languages. 

Our dependent variable is resilience. In keeping with current conceptualizations of this construct (Bonanno et al., 2015; Kalisch et al., 2017), we define resilience as an outcome of good mental health despite exposure to adversity (outcome-based resilience) and measure it by relating mental health outcomes to experienced stressors (Kalisch et al., 2015), which we extensively sample. That is, we do not rely on resilience questionnaires to obtain our dependent variable. In defining our hypotheses about independent variables (resilience factors), we focus on modifiable factors that can be targeted by prevention measures. Specifically, we hypothesize that social support, an increase in social support during the Corona crisis, optimism, general self-efficacy, good stress recovery, positive appraisal style (primary hypothesis), positive appraisal specifically of the Corona crisis, and behavioral coping are positively associated with resilience (outcome), while neuroticism is negatively associated with resilience. We also hypothesize that the expected positive effect of social support on resilience is positively mediated by its effect on positive appraisal style, and that the expected positive effect of positive appraisal style on resilience is positively mediated by its effect on stress recovery. Open questions in the survey allow for detecting potential non-hypothesized resilience factors. 

Analyses will be conducted in the whole sample. Subgroup analyses will be conducted for socio-demographic and health characteristics such as gender, country of residence, occupation, or belonging to a risk group. Further, different phases of the crisis (during official general movement or contact restrictions and after the loosening of these restrictions) will be considered. This will allow us to gain insights into which resilience factors are most effective in which groups and at what times of the crisis and how preventive interventions can be optimally targeted.",r6btn,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r6btn/contributors/?format=json,,[],5xq9p

The effects of person-first language on stigmatization of mental illness,"The American Psychological Association (APA) advocates the use of person-first language to refer to individuals with mental illnesses in scholarly writing. The rationale behind this is based on the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which posits that language shapes cognition, and therefore, the use of person-first language can reduce bias. The aim of this study is to determine whether person-first language effectively reduces bias, and, if so, are there differences between disorders. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions based on language use. The conditions will be (1) person-first language, (2)  identity-first language, and (3) noun-based language. For each, they will read and rate three job applications with three different disorders: (1) schizophrenia, (2) major depressive disorder (MDD), and (3) epilepsy.  We will also examine whether perceived social status, perceived dangerousness, and level of contact with mental illness would moderate this relationship.",ga8fr,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ga8fr/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Participants will be recruited from the University of California, Berkeley Department of Psychology’s Research Participation Program (RPP) website and through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk).

Helping or Harming? The Effect of Trigger Warnings on Individuals with Trauma Histories,"Trigger warnings alert trauma survivors about potentially disturbing forthcoming content. However, empirical studies on trigger warnings suggest that they are functionally inert or cause small adverse side effects. We conducted a preregistered replication and extension of a previous experiment. Trauma survivors (n = 451) were randomly assigned to either receive or not receive trigger warnings prior to reading passages from world literature. We found no evidence that trigger warnings were helpful for trauma survivors, for those who self-reported a PTSD diagnosis, or for those who qualified for probable PTSD, even when survivors' trauma matched the passages' content. We found substantial evidence that trigger warnings countertherapeutically reinforce survivors' view of their trauma as central to their identity. Regarding replication hypotheses, the evidence was either ambiguous or substantially favored the hypothesis that trigger warnings have no effect. In summary, we find that trigger warnings are not helpful for trauma survivors.

Adverse effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in COVID-19 and other viral respiratory infections: Rapid Review,"Background
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most commonly used drugs, and have a wide range of uses, including treatment of acute and chronic pain, fever, and inflammations of infectious and non-infectious etiology. NSAIDs include unselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors (such as ibuprofen, aspirin (acetylsalicylate), diclofenac and naproxen) as well as selective COX 2 inhibitors (such as Celecoxib, Rofecoxib, Etoricoxib, Lumiracoxib, and Valecoxib). 

Concerns have been raised that NSAIDs may be associated with an increased risk for adverse effects when used in patients with acute viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19 (caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS, caused by SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, caused by MERS-CoV), and other coronavirus infections. These concerns apply both to the use of NSAIDs prior to the infection, and to the use of NSAID during the infection.

Objectives
To assess the effects of prior and current use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with acute viral respiratory infections on acute severe adverse events (including mortality, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute organ failure and opportunistic infections), on acute healthcare utilization (including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, supplemental oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation) as well as on quality of life and long-term survival. 

Setting of the review question and protocol development
The overall review question was set by the World Health Organization (WHO), which commissioned this review. At WHO, clinical experts and methodologists were involved in defining the review question. The protocol was developed by PvP and ER drawing on Cochrane Rapid Review guidance [1] and with input from Susan Norris (WHO), Gerald Gartlehner (Cochrane Austria) as well as AM, JB, JMS, KS, LMP and SD. Outcomes were set by WHO and refined by PvP and ER drawing on guidance from the WHO Working Group on the clinical characterization of COVID-19 infection (Annex 1) [2] and Susan Norris.",snrp4,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/snrp4/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Eligibility\nTables 1 and 2 provide an overview of inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nStudies that include both patients with conditions considered in this review (i.e. acute viral respiratory infections or conditions commonly caused by respiratory viruses) and patients with other conditions (e.g. bacterial infections, conditions treated with antibiotics) will be included at title and abstract screening stage. We will decide at full text screening stage on how to proceed with these.\nAs the methodological approach to monitoring adverse events as well as their occurrence is often poorly reported in peer-reviewed publications, we will adopt an inclusive approach. During full text screening we will take note of all studies that do not explicitly report on severe adverse events or the method to identify these but where it may be possible to assume that no such events occurred (e.g. because the study reports adverse events classified as mild or moderate or because the study reports that no severe side effects were recorded). After full text screening we will decide on a consistent approach with regard to these studies. \nSecondary outcomes are of interest to WHO but we will not screen for these during title/abstract or full-text screening. Where a study reporting on a primary outcome also provides data on these secondary outcomes, we will attempt to extract them if this is feasible within the time frame of the review.\nStudies that report both outcomes considered in this review (e.g. acute complications) and outcomes not considered in this review (e.g. long-term gastrointestinal adverse effects) will be included, but data extraction will be limited to relevant outcomes.\nWe will include any systematic empirical study design reporting primary data on at least 10 patients (Table 1). For COVID-19, SARS and MERS, studies of any size will be eligible for inclusion.\n\nSearch methods for identification of studies\nWe will perform searches in MEDLINE and EMBASE, using the Ovid search interface. We will use existing systematic and narrative reviews and included studies to perform backward- and forward-citation searches in Scopus. In addition, the review team will search the WHO Database of publications on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [3].\nOur search strategy is based on two sets of search terms (NSAIDs, and viral respiratory infections), and was reviewed by an experienced information specialist (Irma Klerings). All searches will be conducted in English and abstracts screened in English only. Database searches will be limited to studies published in English or German. For studies on the current COVID-19 outbreak, we will consider studies in English, French, German and Italian. No restriction based on the year of publication will be applied.

The status of semantic memory in MTL amnesia varies with demands on scene construction,"To investigate whether semantic memory impairments in MTL amnesia can be understood with reference to a deficit in scene construction, the current study examined knowledge of scripts that vary in the extent to which they play out in a scene context in nine patients with MTL amnesia and eighteen healthy control subjects.  Scripts are routine activities characterized by an ordered set of actions, including some that are essential for completing the activity. Comparing performance on scene-based scripts (e.g., buying groceries at the grocery store) and object-based scripts (e.g., addressing a letter), we found that patients generated the same number of total action steps as controls for both types of script, but patients were selectively impaired at generating essential actions steps for scene-based scripts.  Furthermore, patients made more sequencing and idiosyncratic errors than controls in the scene-based, but not in the object-based, scripts.  These findings demonstrate that the hippocampus plays a critical role in the retrieval of semantic knowledge about everyday activities when such retrieval entails scene construction.

Expression and Prognostics Significance of MT1 isoforms in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma,"Metallothioneins (MTs), a family of low-weight cysteine-rich proteins, play key roles in tumor biology, such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and drug resistance. Clinical studies have demonstrated that deregulation of MTs in various types of solid cancers. However, a comprehensive overview of MT1 isoforms expression and clinical relevance in clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC) is lacking. The present study explored mRNA expression levels and prognostic values of MT1 isoforms in ccRCC tissues using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Profiling and Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and Oncomine database. The study observed that mRNA expression levels of six members of MT1 isoforms decreased in renal cancer tumor tissues compared with normal tissues. We further found that high-expression of MT1G, MT1H, MT1F and MT1X was related with poor overall survival time in ccRCC patients and high-expression of MT1G, MT1F and MT1X were inversely associated with disease-free survival time in ccRCC patients. Based on the correlation analysis, MT1G was identified to be co-expressed with MT1H and MT1F in ccRCC tissues.

Prospective Intention-Based Lifestyle Contracts: mHealth technology and responsibility in healthcare,"As the costs of lifestyle-related diseases place increasing strain on public healthcare systems, individuals’ role in disease may be proposed as a healthcare rationing criterion. Literature thus far has largely focused on retrospective responsibility in healthcare. The concept of prospective responsibility in the form of a lifestyle contract warrants further investigation. The responsibilisation in healthcare debate also needs to take into account innovative developments in mobile health technology, such as wearable biometric devices and mobile apps, which may change how we hold others accountable for their lifestyles. Little is known about public attitudes towards lifestyle contracts and the use of mobile health technology to hold people responsible in the context of healthcare. This paper has two components. Firstly, it details empirical findings from a survey of 81 members of the United Kingdom general public on public attitudes towards individual responsibility and rationing healthcare, prospective and retrospective responsibility, and the acceptability of lifestyle contracts in the context of mobile health technology. Secondly, we draw on the empirical findings and propose a model of prospective intention-based lifestyle contracts, which is both more aligned with public intuitions and less ethically objectionable than more traditional, retrospective models of responsibility in healthcare.",f6xnr,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/f6xnr/contributors/?format=json,,[],e2vjd

Are categorization effects enhanced by meaningful vs. arbitrary labels in a breathing paradigm?,"Precise monitoring of body sensations (""interoceptive accuracy"", Khalsa et al., 2018) is essential to maintain homeostasis and can even be lifesaving, e.g. in asthma. Previous research showed that basal perceptual processes such as stimulus organization are at work in interoception: When comparing somatic stimuli in a breathing paradigm, type of categorization (arbitrary vs. continuous categorical organization) influenced magnitude estimations as well as breathing behavior in healthy participants (Petersen, Schroijen, Mölders, Zenker, &amp; Van den Bergh, 2014). Specifically, different breathing resistance loads were perceived as more similar within than between categories. In addition, self-reported number and frequency of somatic symptoms were associated with an overestimation of stimulus intensities at category borders (Petersen, Van Staeyen, Vogele, von Leupoldt, &amp; Van den Bergh, 2015). Next to arbitrary categories, previous research showed that interoceptive perceptions are also influenced by contextual information. For example, Bogaerts et al. (2008) found lower interoceptive accuracy of breathing sensations in high symptom reporters in a symptom-related, but not in a neutral context. 

The predictive coding theory of symptom perception assumes that symptom predictions influence body perception (Van den Bergh, Witthöft, Petersen, &amp; Brown, 2017). Arbitrary and continual categories might influence such predictions and thereby change perceptions. This in turn may help explain the development and maintenance of somatic symptom disorders. 

The present study was designed to 1) replicate findings of a basic categorization effects on the classification of breathing sensations (Petersen et al., 2014), 2) examine whether meaningful labels (categories “sensations” and “symptoms”) produce stronger categorization effects than arbitrary labels (categories “A” and “B”), and 3) relate potential categorization effects to psychopathological measures such as symptom reporting and illness anxiety.",6ajbr,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6ajbr/contributors/?format=json,,[],ajdh9

Social and non-social wellbeing during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic,"Covid-19 emerged at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China - and spread globally in the first few months of 2020 - leading to 'lockdown' in different areas around the world. This situation has led to seismic changes in day-to-day life, with people having been told to 'socially distance', 'socially isolate', work from home and stay indoors.  During this period we were collecting cross-sectional data on social (loneliness) and non-social wellbeing (in the context of a wider study focusing more generally on touch) - start date of data collection 21/01/20, end date of data collection 30/03/20. Given our large sample size, we plan to access study responses linked to social and non-social wellbeing and examine responses at different time points in order to examine changes in social and non-social wellbeing over this unusual period of time.  We propose a number of projects that will investigate how any changes in social and non-social wellbeing associated with the coronavirus pandemic are associated with the following: 1) touch attitudes, 2) attachment, 3) age, and 4) gender. We propose to address these questions in a typical UK adult sample (where we expect the majority of our opportunity sample to reside). Depending on sample characteristics (to be confirmed after final data is accessed - expected on 31/03/20) we will also seek to examine social and non-social wellbeing during the coronavirus pandemic in the following groups should we reach minimum power requirements: UK adults from countries outside of the UK; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Mobile Impaired; Visually Impaired.",tc8zs,True,False,Preregistration Template from AsPredicted.org,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/tc8zs/contributors/?format=json,,[],mhkxt

How can social psychology contribute to understanding and managing pandemics? A Delphi study for identifying research priorities,"*** This is a correction of the previous registration of the same study with the research protocol outlined in summary section and the abstract outlined in the description section; all other information is identical to the previous registration of the study. ***

The purpose of the present research is to gauge expert derived opinion and (if possible) reach consensus regarding the relevance of social psychological theory and research for understanding and managing pandemics, and identifying research priorities (for the field of social psychology). This is particularly relevant given the current COVID-19 pandemic. The research therefore seeks to employ a consolidated approach to identifying research priorities for social psychology and social psychologists. To this end, the Delphi method has been selected, which aims to obtain consensus on the opinions of experts (panel members) through a series of survey rounds.

How can social psychology contribute to understanding and managing pandemics? A Delphi study for identifying research priorities,"BACKGROUND
 
Pandemics have sporadically occurred over the course of human history and have varied in their impact on the human population. For example, the recent 2009 H1N1 swine flu infected approximately 1.4 billion people across the globe and killed between 151,700 and 575,400 people (Centers for Disease Protection and Control (CDPC)), n.d.). Moreover, the most severe pandemic in recent history that infected one third of the world population – which also involved the H1N1 virus – occurred in 1918 and resulted in the death of approximately 50 million people (CDPC, n.d.). The current COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, with hundreds to thousands of deaths daily, and it is highly unlikely going to be the last pandemic to emerge. Evidently, pandemics raise scientific challenges, cause major human suffering, and impose significant economic damage (The World Health Organization (WHO), 2007, 2020), requiring a multidisciplinary approach to devise holistic interventions. Health authorities actively adopt a variety of measures found to be effective in controlling pandemics, including issuing facts and precautionary measures (e.g., limiting mobility and promoting social distancing and good respiratory etiquette, such as coughing into a tissue) (Bell, 2004; Dorfan &amp; Woody, 2011; Yang &amp; Chu, 2018). Most of the relevant behaviours and perceptions are social in nature and are implicated by social factors. For example, people are more likely to be influenced by and accept advice from people they trust (Koenig, Clément, &amp; Harris, 2004; Sniezek &amp; Van Swol, 2001; Van Swol, 2011). Social psychology as a discipline should therefore be in a good position to contribute to tackling the challenges posed by pandemics; however, little (if any) research currently exists to provide guidance about the relevance and priorities for the discipline for understanding and managing pandemics. To this end, this Delphi study will recruit a panel of experts whom will provide their expert opinion on the relevance of social psychological theory and research for understanding and managing pandemics and identifying and reaching consensus (if possible) about research priorities (for the field of social psychology). The study therefore effectively employs a consolidated approach to identifying research priorities for social psychology. 

The aim of this study is to garner expert opinion on: 
(1) how social psychological theory and/or research can contribute to inform knowledge and management of pandemics; (2) what research topics social psychology/social psychologists should prioritise to (further) inform knowledge and management of pandemics; and (3) what strategies social psychology/social psychologists should implement to conduct research that will (further) inform knowledge and management of pandemics. 


METHODS

Design

A modified e-Delphi method will be employed (for an overview, e.g., see Hsu &amp; Sandford, 2007; Keeney, Hasson, &amp; McKenna, 2011). The method involves consulting a panel of experts (panel members) about their views on a topic, in at least two survey rounds (up to three sequential rounds will be used in this study), to measure opinions and/or establish whether consensus is possible. Each round is refined based on the results from the previous round. The method it is typically used for topics wherein there is little or no existing knowledge or empirical evidence to inform theory, policy, and practice. 

The responses to the open-ended questions will be collated and categorised into themes (items), through the use of content analysis, and become part of the survey tool used for subsequent Delphi rounds. Panel members will rate their level of agreement with each close-ended question on 5-point Likert-type scales. Descriptive data analyses of the panel members’ responses to the close-ended questions will be employed (i.e., measures of central tendency and level of dispersion). Consensus will be deemed to have been achieved if at least 70% of the panel members score either strongly disagree/disagree or agree/strongly agree on an item. Items that achieve consensus in a round will not be included in subsequent rounds. In the second and (possibly) third round, panel members will receive the panel’s previous responses and be asked to re-evaluate their original responses to items for which consensus was not achieved.


Participants

Panel members will comprise (full) professors of psychology who categorise themselves as social psychologists and/or one of their main areas of expertise as situated in the field of social psychology. This will be ascertained through the identification of participants (see below) and through the following yes/no answer questions to be included in the first survey round: (1) Are you a (full) professor in psychology?; (2) Do you categorise yourself as a social psychologist and/or does one of your main areas of expertise lie in the field of social psychology?

No exclusion criteria regarding age, gender or location will be applied. Potential panel members have primarily been identified based on their occupation of leadership roles on editorial boards of prominent social psychology journals and executive committees of prominent social psychology societies/associations. Efforts have been made to identify experts beyond the West (i.e., USA and Europe) to include a diverse panel of experts based in other continents of the world. Potential panel members will be invited to take part in the study via e-mail. E-mail addresses will be obtained through internet searches or by requesting the contact details from the respective potential panel member’s university affiliations. Panel members who decline participation will be asked to suggest a colleague(s) with similar background to replace them. Both purposive and snowball sampling will therefore be employed. Approximately 150-200 potential panel members will be sent the invitation to partake in the study. However, due to the well-known non-response and attrition rates associated with Delphi studies, it is not possible to provide a reliable indication of how many will respond to the e-mail (e.g., Hsu &amp; Sandford, 2007).


Materials and Data Analysis

Two close-ended and three open-ended questions that have been developed for the purposes of this study will be employed in the first Delphi round. 

Panel members will rate their level of agreement with each close-ended question on 5-point Likert-type scales (1 = Strongly disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Undecided, 4 = Agree, 5 = Strongly agree). The close-ended questions are as follows: (1) Social psychological theory and/or research can make a significant contribution to knowledge about pandemics; and (2) Social psychological theory and/or research can have a significant impact on how pandemics are managed. 

The open-ended questions are as follows: (1) How can social psychological theory and/or research contribute to inform knowledge and management of pandemics?; (2) What research topics should social psychology/social psychologists prioritise to (further) inform knowledge and management of pandemics?; and (3) What strategies should social psychology/social psychologists implement to conduct research that will (further) inform knowledge and management of pandemics?

The responses to the open-ended questions will be collated and categorised into themes (items), through the use of content analysis, and become part of the survey tool used for subsequent Delphi rounds. Descriptive data analyses of the panel members’ responses to the close-ended questions will be employed (i.e., measures of central tendency and level of dispersion). Consensus will be deemed to have been achieved if at least 70% of the panel members score either strongly disagree/disagree or agree/strongly agree on an item. Items that achieve consensus in a round will not be included in subsequent rounds. In the second and (possibly) third round, panel members will receive the panel’s previous responses and be asked to re-evaluate their original responses to items for which consensus was not achieved.

Procedure 

Potential panel members will be invited to partake in the study via e-mail. This e-mail will include an explanatory statement about the study, a link to the first survey round (hosted on the survey platform www.qualtrics.com), and relevant time-frames. The potential panel members will also be informed that £10 will be donated to the WHO COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for each expert panel member that completes all rounds of the Delphi. Those who decline participation will be encouraged to recommend a colleague(s) with the appropriate expertise to replace them. Potential panel members will be given ten days to complete the first survey round – a reminder e-mail will be sent after four and seven days; potential panel member who do not respond before the deadline will not be invited to any further rounds of the study. 

The first survey will first present panel members with an information sheet outlining what participants will be asked to do, what the study concerns, how long it typically takes to complete the study, what will happen to their data, and points of contact. They will be informed that participation is voluntary and quasi-anonymous; however, panel members can choose to have their name included in the supplementary materials of any presentations/reports of the study findings (i.e., to communicate the expertise of the panel members). Likewise, the information sheet emphasises that the data the participants submit may be used for academic dissemination (e.g., conference presentations and publications). Additionally, participants are informed of their right to withdraw from the study, how they can do this, and what will happen to their data if they choose to do this. Next, potential panel members will be presented a consent form to complete if they wish to participate. They will subsequently be asked to provide demographic data (e.g., their name, age, gender, country of residence, year PhD was obtained, area(s) of expertise, and e-mail address). The remainder of the survey contains the close-ended and open-ended questions, brief instructions on how to complete the survey and what will happen after completion (i.e., that another round (or summary of the final results if last round) will be sent approximately five to ten days after the preceding round terminated to allow the researcher to analyse and collate the data). The subsequent survey rounds will also contain this information. 

The same procedure as for the first round will adopted for the second and (possibly) third round, with some modifications. That is, no information sheet or consent form will be included in these rounds (as only panel members who provided their informed consent and completed the first round will be included) and the study items to be included are wholly dependent on the outcome of preceding rounds. As such, in the second and (possibly) third round, panel members will receive an e-mail containing a link to the next survey in which they will be asked to review the items summarised by the researchers based on the responses in the preceding round; they will be asked to re-evaluate their original responses in light of the results from the previous round. Open-ended questions in rounds two and (possibly) three will also ask panel members to provide recommendations regarding any additions, clarifications, alterations, and/or deletions of items and for any other comments/suggestions. A summary of each round will be fed back to the panel members. The only demographic data participants will be asked to provide in the second and (possibly) third round pertain to their name and e-mail address, to allow the researchers to track their responses. The survey can be completed over several sessions to allow panel members to review their answers before final submission of responses.",vpuqx,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vpuqx/contributors/?format=json,,"['COVID-19', 'Delphi Method', 'Social Psychology']",ngycp

Alternative A and C motivations,"Participants will be asked to imagine their romantic partner engaging in relationship behaviors described in a series of vignettes, and asked for their responses to and causal interpretations of these behaviors. We will also measure participants' attachment styles, relationship satisfaction, and demographics information.

Rationale:
Avoidant and anxious attachment are described as the tendencies either to deactivate or hyperactivate the attachment system in response to threat. Avoidant attachment is therefore usually identified in both the research and popular psychology literatures as a habitual avoidance or fear of intimacy itself, and anxious attachment as a habitual approach towards or desire for intimacy itself. We propose that these descriptions inaccurately characterize the motivations driving avoidant and anxious attachment behaviors. 
	We propose, instead, and in keeping with the ontogenetic origins of avoidant and anxious attachment styles, two alternative goals and characterizations of avoidant and anxious attachment styles:

1.	The goal of avoidance is actually to maintain proximity by maintaining one’s ability to identify and fulfill one’s own needs and desires, without disrupting one’s relationships, and is adopted on the basis of a fear that one’s needs and desires are incompatible with one’s relationships and will lead to the discovery of relationship incompatibility and the dissolution of the relationship. This proposal is in keeping with the finding that avoidant attachment in infants is predicted by having attachment figures who move farther away rather than closer in response to their infants’ displays of distress and attempts to seek proximity. It is also theoretically consistent with the Dynamic Maturational Model’s characterization of avoidant attachment as based in compliance, with avoidance behavior being one component of the overarching strategy.
a.	(The goal of maintaining existing proximity is also consistent with conceptions of attachment to systems and the role of deactivation/palliation more broadly, e.g. system justification, just world beliefs, etc. and their effect on system-support at the sociopolitical level.)
2.	The goal of anxiety or preoccupation is actually to render the attachment relationship effective in its evolutionary and interpersonal function of protection from threat, and is adopted on the basis of a fear that despite having the relationship, the attachment figure will not fulfill one’s needs and desires. This proposal is in keeping with the finding that anxious attachment in infants is predicted by having attachment figures who are distracted and interfering or intrusive, but who respond to (i.e., whose caregiving can be regulated by) exaggerated proximity-seeking, or protest behaviors. It is also theoretically consistent with the Dynamic Maturational Model’s characterization of anxious attachment as based in coercion, with anxiety or preoccupation behavior being one component of the overarching strategy.

This alternative conceptualization of the motivations of avoidant and anxious attachment is also in keeping with Mikulincer and Shaver’s (2003, p.23) observation that “dismissing individuals possess available representations of self during security-enhancing interactions with an attachment figure and can use them in threat contexts,” whereas preoccupied individuals do not possess these available representations. As Schafer (1968, p.9) describes, “internalization refers to all those processes by which the subject transforms real or imagined regulatory interactions with his environment, and real or imagined characteristics of his environment, into inner regulation and characteristics.” Whether real or imagined, avoidant individuals seem to have positive if idealized representations of experiences with attachment figures, whereas anxious individuals seem to lack even realistic (flawed, non-idealized) representations of satisfying experiences with attachment figures, leading the former to seek to protect and maintain potential access to these experiences, and the latter to seek to render their relationships more satisfying of their needs and desires.

Rationale In Brief:
•	NOT
o	Avoidant attachment: Fear of and avoidance of intimacy
o	Anxious attachment: Desire for and preoccupation with intimacy
•	BUT RATHER
o	Avoidant attachment: Concern with retaining relationship
o	Anxious attachment: Concern with receiving sufficient caregiving",sp2hq,True,False,Preregistration Template from AsPredicted.org,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/sp2hq/contributors/?format=json,,['Attachment'],k74gw

"Choice, Cognition, and Affect during the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic","The 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic is an unprecedented event inducing similarly-unprecedented levels of chronic, sustained stress and anxiety on a global scale; thus, the downstream effects of these affective responses on behavior are currently unknown. Previous characterizations of stress and its effects on cognitive performance, using lab inductions of acute stress and measurements of naturally-occurring chronic stress, are arguably of a different magnitude than the intense stress and anxiety induced by the pandemic, due to its life-or-death, quickly changing, pervasive and uncontrollable nature. The current moment is thus a unique opportunity to understand how intense, real-world stress and anxiety influence fundamental cognitive processes, including the ability to flexibly allocate mental resources using cognitive control, and the evaluation of risk and basic construction of value. Understanding how these cognitive abilities and behaviors shift during a pandemic could provide crucial, missing, and foundational information about the human mind and brain under severe stress. Characterizing such effects could prove crucial to the development of strategies, interventions, and policies that address, account for, and mitigate changes in individuals’ choices and cognitive performance in response to intense, real-life, stressors. 

To study this, we are conducting an experiment on Pavlovia, where U.S.-based participants complete both laboratory-quality behavioral tasks and self-report surveys. In particular, participants will complete a risky decision-making task (Sokol-Hessner et al., 2016) dissociating and quantifying risk attitudes, loss aversion, choice consistency, and context effects, and a cognitive control task measuring proactive versus reactive control (an AX-CPT paradigm; adapted from Gonthier et al., 2016). Performance in both of these tasks has been shown to shift in response to affective and stress influences (e.g., risky decision-making: Sokol-Hessner et al., 2009, 2015a, 2015b, 2016; AX-CPT: Chiew &amp; Braver, 2013, 2014; Yang, Miskovich, &amp; Larson, 2018), but these effects have typically been characterized in the laboratory using experimentally-induced manipulations of affect and stress. In the present study, we propose to examine shifts in decision-making and controlled performance as a function of pandemic-related stress, which we will characterize using a combination of subjective self-report measures and objective measures indexing pandemic progression using epidemiological data. In addition to behavioral task performance, we will obtain self-reported measures of state and trait anxiety, perceived stress, subjective loneliness, and perceptions of the pandemic and its personal risk.

Metanalysis of eye-movements deficits in psychotic patients,"This study aims to shed new light on the use of Eye Movements Disorders (EMD) as an informative biomarker for psychiatric disorders.

The importance of metanalysis is increasingly stressed in the era of the replication crisis in psychology, as it provides more precise estimates of an original study or claim, and can contribute to theoretical advance by identifying new relations among variables (Cumming, 2014; Cumming and Calin-Jageman, 2016).",g4wvf,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/g4wvf/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to any human observation of the data,"['eye-movements', 'meta-analysis', 'Psychiatry Meta-analysis Eye movements', 'psychosis', 'schizophrenia']",jr9qs

TETRIAS,"In 2018, the universities of applied sciences (UASs) in the Netherlands signed the Dutch code of conduct on research integrity (RI). By doing so, the UASs have committed themselves to taking care of an open and safe research culture, a proper management of research data, honest and open agreements on the research data, setting research ethics standards and advice, and to the training of their researchers. However, so far UASs themselves hardly offer any systematic training in the field of RI.
Our goal is to enable the UASs in The Netherlands to meet their obligation to provide their researchers access to a basic training course in the field of RI. To that goal we will systematically develop a blended training course that provides online information on integrity topics and offers researchers the opportunity to deepening important, and for their specific situation relevant topics through group-discussions and meetings with experts.
The training is to be tailored to the needs of the researchers in UASs. For that purpose, focus group discussions will be organised prior to designing the training. Topics to be discussed in the focus groups are: what makes a good UAS researcher; which norms of the Dutch Code of Conduct researchers do and do not recognise, and which needs for RI training do they identify? Based on this input learning objectives will be drawn up.
Secondary aim of the focus group discussions* is to pilot test several training methods that are already applied in RI training in other settings (i.e. the VIRT2UE training program). These methods will be embedded in the focus group discussion guide.

perceived as an extremely altruistic act. Furthermore, media appeals highlight the shortage of organs, which 
reinforces the concept that people, in general, do not cooperate and free-ride by not registering to donate. In 
contrast, the virtues of the opt-out default increasing the number of organs available are highlighted as its major 
benefit. Thus, a supply-demand effect may operate to account for the reduction in living donations, especially to 
strangers, under an opt-out default. That is, people perceive more organs are available under the opt-out default 
and as a result feel less inclined to donate as a living donor especially to a stranger. In contrast under an opt-in 
default, where free-riding is predominant, any donation is seen as an extreme act and conditional cooperation 
would suggest that people will be more like to donate a living organ if they perceive that other also donate under 
opt-in.  
But is it really the organ donation policy that leads to more or less people being willing to make living 
donations? Or is it just a matter of whether people believe that there are enough donors or not?",s4zv6,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s4zv6/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,[],5kbha

"Choice, Cognition, and Affect during the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic","The 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic is an unprecedented event inducing similarly-unprecedented levels of chronic, sustained stress and anxiety on a global scale; thus, the downstream effects of these affective responses on behavior are currently unknown. Previous characterizations of stress and its effects on cognitive performance, using lab inductions of acute stress and measurements of naturally-occurring chronic stress, are arguably of a different magnitude than the intense stress and anxiety induced by the pandemic, due to its life-or-death, quickly changing, pervasive and uncontrollable nature. The current moment is thus a unique opportunity to understand how intense, real-world stress and anxiety influence fundamental cognitive processes, including the ability to flexibly allocate mental resources using cognitive control, and the evaluation of risk and basic construction of value. Understanding how these cognitive abilities and behaviors shift during a pandemic could provide crucial, missing, and foundational information about the human mind and brain under severe stress. Characterizing such effects could prove crucial to the development of strategies, interventions, and policies that address, account for, and mitigate changes in individuals’ choices and cognitive performance in response to intense, real-life, stressors. 

To study this, we are conducting an experiment on Pavlovia, where U.S.-based participants complete both laboratory-quality behavioral tasks and self-report surveys. In particular, participants will complete a risky decision-making task (Sokol-Hessner et al., 2016) dissociating and quantifying risk attitudes, loss aversion, choice consistency, and context effects, and a cognitive control task measuring proactive versus reactive control (an AX-CPT paradigm; adapted from Gonthier et al., 2016). Performance in both of these tasks has been shown to shift in response to affective and stress influences (e.g., risky decision-making: Sokol-Hessner et al., 2009, 2015a, 2015b, 2016; AX-CPT: Chiew &amp; Braver, 2013, 2014; Yang, Miskovich, &amp; Larson, 2018), but these effects have typically been characterized in the laboratory using experimentally-induced manipulations of affect and stress. In the present study, we propose to examine shifts in decision-making and controlled performance as a function of pandemic-related stress, which we will characterize using a combination of subjective self-report measures and objective measures indexing pandemic progression using epidemiological data. In addition to behavioral task performance, we will obtain self-reported measures of state and trait anxiety, perceived stress, subjective loneliness, and perceptions of the pandemic and its personal risk. Demographic measures including age, gender identity, socio-economic status, race, ethnicity, and state and county location will also be measured.

Importantly, we will recruit a sample stratified by state and associated pandemic progression (measured using epidemiological data from state and federal public health agencies) and propose to collect participant data in two phases. In Phase 1, we will collect data every 24 hours over a 20-day period, enabling us to examine whether and how task performance and psychological measures shift across participants as the pandemic progresses over time. Pending funding, Phase 2 will commence immediately after Phase 1 (i.e., 20 days after commencing data collection in Phase 1). Phase 1 participants will be invited to re-enroll in the study and complete task and self-report measures again. Re-enrolled participants will take part in Phase 2 following their participation in Phase 1 as closely as possible (i.e., if a participant was recruited and participated on Day 4 of Phase 1, we will aim to re-enroll them and have them participate on Day 4 of Phase 2).",dsp6c,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/dsp6c/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Using Pavlovia.org, we will collect data from a U.S.-based online sample over a 20-day period (Phase 1) followed by a second 20-day period during which time Phase 1 participants are invited to participate a second time (Phase 2). \n\nImportantly, we will collect data from a sample stratified by pandemic progression.

Clinician Scientist in Rehabilitation and Medicine: A Scoping Review Protocol,"ABSTRACT
Background: Clinician scientists play a role in bridging the gap between research and practice. However, the role of a clinician scientist is less established for healthcare professionals in rehabilitation in comparison to medicine and nursing. Purpose: The purpose of this scoping review is to explore the different roles and models of a clinician scientist in rehabilitation and compare this to medicine and nursing. Methods: This review was structured according to the Arksey and O’Malley framework for scoping reviews. A literature search will be conducted from the following databases: EMBASE, MEDLINE, AMED and Web of Science, as well as a grey literature search from MacSphere, ProQuest, DuckDuckGo and Google. This scoping review will look at all publications that describe the role of a clinician scientist in rehabilitation or in medicine, across all health care settings. Researchers will review titles and abstracts independently, in groups of two, followed by a review of full articles. Data will be extracted from all sources and pooled together in a table with common themes to synthesize the results. The authors will provide a summary of the information in relation to the research question of this scoping review. Conclusion: The results of this scoping review will help identify the current roles and models that exist for a clinician scientist in rehabilitation, in comparison to medicine.",utkvy,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/utkvy/contributors/?format=json,,[],u7keh

Effect of APOE polymorphism on cognition and brain in the CamCAN cohort,"Polymorphisms in the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene have been associated with individual differences in cognition, brain structure and brain function. For example, the ε4 allele has been associated with cognitive and brain impairment in old age and increased risk of dementia, while the ε2 allele has been claimed to be neuroprotective. According to the “antagonistic pleiotropy” hypothesis, these polymorphisms have different effects across the lifespan, with ε4 for example postulated to confer benefits on cognitive and brain functions earlier in life. Using the rich cognitive and brain measures in the CamCAN cohort (www.cam-can.org), we will investigate the “antagonistic pleiotropy” hypothesis by testing for allele-by-age interactions in approximately 600 people from across the adult lifespan (18-88 years), on six outcome variables related to cognition, brain structure and brain function (fluid intelligence, verbal memory, hippocampal gray matter volume, mean diffusion within white matter, and resting-state connectivity measured by both functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography).",bufc4,True,False,Registered Report Protocol Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bufc4/contributors/?format=json,,['APOE cognition brain antagonistic pleiotropy'],ehs9n

Moving in Unison after perceptual interruption,"Humans interact in groups through various perception and action channels. The continuity of interaction despite a transient loss of perceptual contact often exists and contributes to goal achievement. Here, we study the dynamics of this continuity, in two experiments involving participants (N=7) synchronizing their movements in space and in time. We show that behavioural unison can be maintained after perceptual contact has been lost, for about 7s. Agent similarity and spatial configuration in the group modulated synchronization performance, differently so when perceptual interaction was present or when it was memorized. Modelling these data through a network of oscillators enabled us to clarify the double origin of this memory effect, of individual and social nature. These results shed new light into why humans continue to move in unison after perceptual interruption, and are consequential for a wide variety of applications at work, in art and in sport.",3drfp,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/3drfp/contributors/?format=json,,[],er8x5

The interplay between dopamine genes and diet,"The neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role in several cognitive domains such as motivation, reward-processing, reinforcement learning, decision-making and executive functions including working memory and attention (Arnsten, Wang, &amp; Paspalas, 2012; Logue &amp; Gould, 2013; Rogers, 2011; Schultz, 2002; Volkow, Wise, &amp; Baler, 2017). Results of our recent studies point towards prominent alterations in these domains in overweight and obesity and suggest the existence of a non-linear relationship between markers of obesity and central dopamine tone (Horstmann, Fenske, &amp; Hankir, 2015). Dopamine tone in the brain depends on both genetic and environmental factors. Genetic differences in important genes within the dopaminergic synapse, i.e. COMT (important for dopamine degradation) and dopamine receptor D2 (A1 allele of Taq1A), lead to altered dopamine signaling and can therefore contribute to higher vulnerability for diet-induced obesity (Annerbrink et al., 2008; Epstein et al., 2007). One important environmental factor that is hypothesized to affect dopamine transmission in obesity is an unhealthy diet. Accumulating evidence from animal research suggests that observed differences in dopamine signaling in obesity may be induced by diet rather than obesity (Geiger et al., 2009; Narayanaswami, Thompson, Cassis, Bardo, &amp; Dwoskin, 2013; van de Giessen et al., 2013; Vucetic, Carlin, Totoki, &amp; Reyes, 2012). However, the evidence for diet-induced alterations in dopamine signal transmission and their effects on dopamine-mediated cognitive processes in humans is scarce. In the proposed study, we aim to address the effect of diet high in fat and sugar on dopamine signal transmission in the brain and on dopamine-mediated cognitive performance.",w9e5y,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/w9e5y/contributors/?format=json,,[],vs8cm

Adverse events associated with botulinum toxin A injection in the treatment of the upper and lower limbs muscles spasticity and dystonia: a systematic review with meta-analysis.,"Neuromuscular block with the injection of botulinum toxin type A is one of the treatment of spastic hypertonia or dystonia. To date, this treatment is considered safe, severe adverse events are described in few cases, most of harms are minor and tolerable. In previous published reviews, authors analysed only partially the most frequent aspects related to the usual clinical setting in which our group operate (e.g. works which did not consider all the botulinum toxin type A formulations, or limited to restricted anatomical districts, or focused just on post-stroke spasticity).  Specifically, the aim of this review is to add further information to the actual knowledge by searching for studies which considered all the botulinum toxin type A  formulations in the management of limbs’ muscles spasticity or dystonia as positive features of upper motor neuron syndrome. At this point, to better quantify the safety and adverse events related to neuromuscular block with botulinum toxin, we consider important that the comparison should be made with placebo or other treatment.

Same same OR Different?,"With this project, I aim to investigate combinations of characteristics within people.


While trying to determine the universal building blocks of personality, it seems that researchers have focused on similarities rather than differences; In both regards: Similarities between people, as well as between personality characteristics. Accumulating research is now challenging prominent conceptualizations of personality and with it the method of aggregation. By aggregating item responses into sum scores and individuals into groups, relevant differences between them might have been overlooked. Our goal is to offer new levels of explanation to allow the integration of findings.
To this end, we will cluster people by their item-response-patterns. We will investigate the heterogeneity of these clusters, and assess if similar levels (i.e. sums scores) on the five domains of the five factor model can reduce heterogeneity by accounting for similarities between item-response-patterns. Next to this confirmatory part, we aim to largely explore the combinations of characteristics within people by describing the possible cluster solutions. We will split our sample into three samples to be able to test any findings the result from exploration.

Effect of Metric Variation in Object Shapes and Colours on Cross-Situational Word Learning in Adults,"Cross-situational word learning (CSWL) is the ability to overcome ambiguity in individually ambiguous scenarios by tracking word-object co-occurrence statistics over multiple such naming scenarios to learn correct word-object mappings. Force choice tests of adults in lab experiments on CSWL has demonstrated adults’ ability to learn words under referential uncertainty (Trueswell, Medina, Hafri, &amp; Gleitman, 2013). Furthermore, eye-tracking data in these and other studies (Yu, Zhong, &amp; Fricker, 2012) demonstrate that participants who are better at learning such words spend more time looking at the target object when named, indicating that eye-movements are a fair reflection of learning accuracy in such tasks. These looking behaviours may, however, be influenced by the perceived characteristics of the object, prior knowledge of the word referent pairs, familiarity with words, and the competition due to other distractors (Yu et al., 2012). In particular, while there is strong evidence to suggest that object properties (like colour and shape) directly affect object categorisation and learning their names (Jiang &amp; Chun, 2001; Landau, Smith, &amp; Jones, 1988; Smith, Jones, Landau, Gershkoff-Stowe, &amp; Samuelson, 2002), the effect has never been demonstrated in cross-situational word learning with systemic property variations. Therefore, in this experiment we plan to use object stimuli of systematic variations in colour and shape properties in a cross-situational learning task and employ eye-tracking to understand the effect of these metric variations on real-time attention and word learning. To assess the metric effects, we will control the difference between the object properties on each training trial to create two conditions:
The ‘Near’ condition where the two objects on each learning trial are very similar either in shape or in colour. 
The ‘’Far condition where the objects presented within a learning trial are very different in shape and colour.
Critically, the same objects are used in both conditions: it’s just the pairing that creates metric conflict in the moment. Importantly, in the ‘Near’ condition, there is always similarity in one of the feature dimensions.",rbg7m,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rbg7m/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Participants will be recruited through the Sona recruitment system provided by UEA for undergraduate psychology students to take part in experiments.

Moving beyond Associative Learning and Hypothesis Testing: How Stimulus Exposure Times and Looking Behaviours Conspire in Cross-Situational Word Learning,"Strong evidence suggests that adults can acquire novel word-object relationships via cross-situational word learning (CSWL) wherein a learner gradually resolves the referential ambiguity in individual naming scenarios by tracking the co-occurrence statistics of words and referents across multiple naming events in time. The literature is divided into two major accounts regarding the type of processing that underlies CSWL:  Hypothesis Testing (HT) and Associative Learning (AL). While AL account suggests that learners accumulate graded statistical information of all referents for each word across all the word-object presentations (McMurray, Horst, &amp; Samuelson, 2012), HT accounts suggest that learners form a single hypothesis/mapping on each presentation that in a subsequent presentation gets confirmed if correct or else rejected causing the learner to build and test a new hypothesis for every word (also known as propose and verify; Trueswell, Medina, Hafri, &amp; Gleitman, 2013).

Previously, Trueswell et al. (2013) paired novel words to a set of 12 everyday objects and asked participants to guess the most-likely referent for each word presented over a set of 5 trials. Trueswell &amp; colleagues found that if learners guessed an incorrect object for a given word on a trial, their guesses on a follow-up trial for that word was at chance. This happened even though the correct referent had co-occurred with the tested word in prior trials and, therefore, should have been the preferred choice for the word. Trueswell et al. (2013) interpreted this finding as showing that participants had not tracked multiple possible referents for a given word, as they did not show a preferred second choice. Thus, this supports propose and verify -- an HT account. Importantly, eye-tracking data also supported the HT account showing that participants did not look significantly more at the statistically more-frequent referent than the alternatives. 

To understand such behaviours at a process level, we recently designed a computational model (WOLVES) that simulates looking and learning dynamics at a moment-to-moment and trial-to-trial scale in CSWL tasks (Bhat, Spencer, &amp; Samuelson, 2018, 2020). Our model simulations of the Trueswell et. Al. (2013) task showed similar results as those reported by Trueswell et. Al. (2013) even though WOLVES is not a HT model but is a non-linear associative learning model. WOLVES suggested that the short exposure time of each trial in the Trueswell’s task only allowed for one look on average during each trial which therefore enabled formation of typical only one association on each trial. WOLVES simulations suggest that modifying the Trueswell et. Al. (2013) task by allowing the participants to look at objects long enough to register multiple associations would show a different behavioural pattern wherein learners would not restart from scratch if their previous guess was wrong, but use their previously remembered associations to show preferential looking to targets.

Our aim in this study is to see whether the WOLVES model predictions hold true and therefore if it is the duration of trials (and consequent looking times) that are affecting the results of this experiment. Hence, this follow-up experiment extends trial durations in Trueswell et al (2013) task to test whether participants can track multiple associations per trial and thereby show associative learning.",htd7p,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/htd7p/contributors/?format=json,"{'question': {'extra': [], 'value': 'Participants will be recruited through the Sona recruitment system provided by UEA for undergraduate psychology students to take part in experiments.

Genetic Predispositions and Caregiving Behaviour interact in modulating Virtual Social Attitudes in Humans,"The interaction between parental care and the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene affect social behaviours in adulthood. Serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms (5-HTTLPR) and early parent-infant interaction influence adults’ relationship with intimate partners. However, human conspecifics socially act towards the real and virtual world in displaying multiple and complex social interactions. Hence, the mechanisms underlying the virtual social relationship in humans remain largely unknown. We hypothesized interaction between genetic factors (three polymorphisms from the oxytocin receptor, OXTR, and the serotonin transporter, 5-HTTLPR), parental bonding patterns (PBI) and adults’ interactional patterns (ASQ, ECR-R) in shaping virtual social behaviour (Instagram, Facebook). Self-reported questionnaires were used to evaluate participants’ (n= 61) parental bonding patterns (Parental Bonding Instrument, formed by four subscales Maternal Care, Paternal Care, Maternal Overprotection, Paternal Overprotection), interactional patterns towards peers (Attachment Style Questionnaire formed by five subscales Confidence, Discomfort in Intimacy, Relationship as Secondary, Need for Approval, Worry about Relationship) and the quality of bond with intimate partners (Experience in Close Relationship Scale formed by two subscales Anxiety, Avoidance). Social media activities were collected applying an automatic Python algorithm through which eight indexes were extracted: Instagram number of following users, followers, posts and tags from other users’ posts and Facebook number of friends, interests, published pics and given likes. Buccal mucosa cell samples were collected to assess participants’ genetic predispositions, and regions OXTR/rs2254298 (G/G homozygotes vs A carriers), OXTR/rs53576 (G/G homozygotes vs A carriers) and 5-HTTLPR/rs255331 (G/G homozygotes vs A carriers) were genotyped. We hypothesize multiple gene*environment interactions on different parameters and indexes calculated on the social media variables as Instagram Followers/Following ratio (“Social Desirability Index”).

Evidence of integrated primary-secondary health care in  low-and middle-income countries: protocol for a scoping review,"Integrated care is a people-centered health delivery approach that ensures the comprehensiveness, quality, and continuity of service across the settings and levels of health systems. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends integration across levels and building-blocks of health systems as a prerequisite of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). While health systems of low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are often fragmented and led by siloed service delivery structure, several LMICs – including India – have attempted health system integration. Several systematic reviews of evidence on healthcare integration from developed countries exist, but to date, no synthesis from LMICs was reported. This review will provide an overview of existing Integrated Primary Secondary Care Systems (IPSCS) in the context of LMICs, aiming to support policy decisions for the effective integration of health delivery systems in India. 

The review will be conducted following the six steps recommend by Arksey and O’Malley. Scientific and grey literature will be systematically selected from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Global Index Medicus, and electronic repositories of the WHO, World Bank, Health Policy Plus and OpenGrey. Using a comprehensive search strategy, literature written in English and published between 2000-2019 will be selected, and two independent authors will screen their titles and abstracts. The result will be charted using a data extraction form and reported using tables, figures, and in narrative form. 

No ethical approval is necessary for the review. The review will be conducted between December 2019 and April 2020. The final report will be developed with the consultation of other stakeholders and disseminated through workshops, conference papers, and peer review articles. The review will serve as a guiding tool to approach, implement, and test the IPSCS model in India and other LMICs.",kjhzt,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kjhzt/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to analysis of the data,[],qxked

Temporal discounting does not influence Body Mass Index,"The prevalence of obesity has driven searches for cognitive or behavioural economic factors related to Body Mass Index (BMI). One compelling candidate is delay discounting: those who prefer smaller sooner rewards over larger but later rewards are hypothesised to have higher BMI. The findings in the literature are mixed however, with meta analyses suggesting only a very small correlation between discounting and BMI. Here we present novel empirical data (N=381) and Bayesian analyses which suggest no such relationship between discounting of either monetary or weight loss rewards and BMI. We also find evidence against our novel proposal that discounting moderates the rate of BMI gain over time. We also present our data in the context of a random effects Bayesian meta-analytical result which does suggest the presence of a small correlation overall. The strength of the correlation is so weak (2.25% shared variance) that its practical significance may be minor to non existent. However because we found decisive evidence for unaccounted for study-level variance, due to study heterogeneity, we argue that we should treat such meta-analytic correlations with extreme caution. While the relationship between discounting and health outcomes such as BMI remain theoretically appealing, our empirical and meta-analytic results suggest we should be cautious in inferring a correlational, let alone a causal, role for discounting processes in driving BMI or moderating BMI gain with age.",yfq96,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/yfq96/contributors/?format=json,,"['body mass index', 'delay discounting', 'inter-temporal choice', 'meta-analysis', 'obesity', 'temporal discounting', 'underweight']",ncmf5

Varenicline Versus Cytisine for Smoking Cessation in the Primary Care Setting  - a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Brief Summary:
The overall goals of this study are to 1) assess awareness of an interest in the use of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in Croatia and Slovenia, countries in Central Europe with very high smoking prevalence, and 2) investigate whether cytisine is at least as feasible and effective as varenicline in helping smokers to quit in a real-life setting: family medicine practices in Croatia and Slovenia. The investigators propose to survey patients from 40 primary care practices (20 in Croatia and 20 in Slovenia) to assess the desire to quit smoking and awareness and interest in pharmacotherapy. Additionally, 380 patients with interest in quitting smoking will be randomly assigned to use varenicline or cytisine to help quit smoking.

The investigators hypothesize that cytisine is at least as feasible and effective as varenicline in helping smokers from primary care practices in Croatia and Slovenia to quit smoking",wme27,,,OSF Preregistration,True,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wme27/contributors/?format=json,,,73hx6

Debias effects in a public administration context (Master Thesis),"This study examines the debias-literature in the context of public administration. Debias strategies are ‘techniques that undermines bias’ (Lilienfeld et al, 2009). For long, studies in the Public administration context have focused on documenting bias – eg. Negativity bias or motivated reasoning when processing performance information (Moynihan, 2018). This study aims to meet Donald Moynihan’s call for “using psychology to design ways to overcome biases and improve outcomes (Moynihan, 2018: 5)    This study asks whether citizen exposure to contextual debias-frame (comparing with experts) will reduce the effects of framed performance information when evaluating danish hospitals. Furthermore, we ask whether the debias effects last when exposed with a second framing of performance information. The study tests 1) debias-effects in the context of public administration 2) if the debias effects last over ‘time’.    In relation to the empirical tests, the study will elaborate a large theoretical overview of the debias-literature. This registration will primarily contain the empirical part of the study, which contains a survey experiment, and the empirical expectations in relation to this survey experiment.",gjpwy,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/gjpwy/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to accessing the data,[],uc3rq

Neurodynamics of affect from the fMRI emotional picture viewing task in the MIDUS Refresher neuroscience project,"The Midlife in the United States study (MIDUS) is a longitudinal national study of adults in the United States that began in 1995. MIDUS consists of several projects, including Survey, Daily Diary, Cognitive, Biomarkers, and Neuroscience projects. The original MIDUS sample was assessed between 1995-1997 (MIDUS 1), again between 2004-2009 (MIDUS 2), and again starting in 2013 (data collection ongoing; MIDUS 3). To replenish the original sample, new participants were added to the protocol between 2011-2014 (MIDUS Refresher).   This OSF page is intended to serve as the basis for several projects relating to the MIDUS Refresher neuroscience project functional MRI data. We outline here the details of how MIDUS Refresher fMRI data were collected, cleaned, and processed by our group.

Trust in experts during an epidemic,"Trust in science is extremely important in times of epidemics.
Policy makers who face rapidly evolving situations with few available policy tools need to understand first how trust in experts evolves while an epidemic is underway, in order to prevent small-scale outbreaks from escalating into large-scale emergencies, and second how to effectively reduce misperceptions and increase the reception of scientific information among a vast public.
This project seeks to understand these processes in the context of the unfolding of the real-time, high-impact epidemic of the COVID-19 in Italy. The digital revolution, brought about by the diffusion of the internet and mobile phones, together with the large-scale adoption of online social networking platforms, offers opportunities to track the evolution of trust in real-time. This paper leverages this potential by drawing on data collected from three online social networking platforms -- Twitter, Facebook, and Telegram -- to: 1) describe how trust in science evolves during an epidemic, and 2) study how to curb misinformation in times of epidemics.",txby2,True,False,OSF-Standard Pre-Data Collection Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/txby2/contributors/?format=json,,[],8bhn4

Clinical prediction model for the diagnosis of asthma in children and young people in primary care,"This project aims to derive and validate a clinical prediction rule for the diagnosis of asthma in children and young people in primary care. Code lists will be used to create variables from anonymised routinely collected medical records.

The code lists deposited are lists of Read code (version 2) that were used to identify the presence of:
1) an asthma specific code
2) evidence of lung function or reversibility testing having been considered or completed

Both code lists are based on published work: Nissen F, Morales DR, Mullerova H, Smeeth L, Douglas IJ, Quint JK. Validation of asthma recording in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). BMJ open. 2017 Aug 1;7(8):e017474 (2017) http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017474

London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom. https://doi.org/10.17037/DATA.210. It was modified for the current project by converting from Medcode to Read code.

2) Nissen, F and Quint, JK (2017) used a list of Read codes to identify reversibility. The list was expanded upon (over 150 additional codes) to incorporate evidence of lung function or reversibility testing having been considered or conducted.

Resting state functional connectivity of emotion regulation regions in aging,"Amygdala is a region critical for emotions (Davis &amp; Whalen, 2001). Regulation of one’s emotion is thought to result from top-down influences of cognitive control regions (prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex) on the amygdala (Ochsner &amp; Gross, 2005). Previous brain imaging studies suggest that when individuals are reappraising their emotions compared to maintaining them, the neural connectivity of those regions become stronger (Banks, Eddy, Angstadt, Nathan, &amp; Phan, 2007). Also, while many domains of executive control show age-related decline (for a review, see Braver &amp; West, 2011), emotion regulation ability improves as individuals get older, such that older adults can regulate negative emotions better when facing negative stimuli due to greater prefrontal cortex activity (Nashiro, Sakaki, &amp; Mather, 2012).    	The question for the current study is to determine to what degree individual differences in emotion regulation can be predicted from the baseline interactions of cognitive control regions with amygdala, as measured through resting state functional connectivity (RSFC). RSFC has been shown to be relatively stable within subjects across time and predict several individual characteristics, including depression, neuroticism and extraversion, and impulsivity (Greicius et al., 2007; Hsu, Rosenberg, Scheinost, Constable, &amp; Chun, 2018; Li, et al., 2013). Across-network interactions can also predict the interactions between distinct processes, such as interactions between memory and reward processing regions predicting the degree to which a person’s memory is affected by reward (Frank, Preston, &amp; Zeithamova, 2019). Here, we propose to use the existing Cam-CAN dataset (Shafto et al., 2014; Taylor et al., 2017) to determine to what degree emotional regulation ability can be predicted from the pattern of resting state connectivity between the emotion and cognitive control regions. As a second goal, as Cam-CAN contains data across lifespan, we are interested in whether there are age-related differences in emotion regulation and whether the relationship between the resting state functional connectivity and the ability to regulate emotions changes as a function of age.",az9wh,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/az9wh/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to analysis of the data,[],qewam

"Socioemotional competencies, student engagement and performance at university – a cross-cultural project","Students at university go through adolescence to adulthood. While acquiring new knowledge and competences, university students also deal with significant challenges, such as identity exploration and balance achievement between academic obligations, leisure time and house demanding tasks. Therefore, college students may experience mental health issues, substance use problems, which can lead to a lack of involvement with university, academic performance decrease, absenteeism, or even dropout. Positive Youth Development (PYD) focus on the enhancement of youth strengths to achieve a healthy, productive and meaningful youth (Lerner et al., 2011; Shek, Dou, Zhu, &amp; Chai, 2019). PYD is associated with emotional competence (Lau &amp; Wu, 2012) and may depend on several situational factors such as the academic context (Årdal, Holsen, Diseth, &amp; Larsen, 2018; Matos, Santos, Reis, Goméz-baya, &amp; Marques, 2018). Grounded in the PYD framework and accounting for both cultural and individual variables, this project has two principal aims:  
1)	to study emotional competence and prosocial behaviour as predictors of student engagement (study 1);
2)	to study the moderator effect of resilience internal assets on the relationship between psychosocial difficulties and academic performance (Study 2).",q5nb2,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/q5nb2/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to accessing the data,[],hqkgw

Overall database of 98 studies on cognitive malingering,"The present database contains 98 studies on the assessment of neuropsychological feigning.

We selected 3 types of contrasts between groups: honest vs malingering (hon vs mal), malingering vs malingering (mal vs mal), and honest vs honest (hon vs hon). Two studies included an extra category of participants labeled indeterminate, which generated two new contrast possibilities: honest vs indeterminate (hon vs indeterm), and indeterminate vs malingering (indeterm vs mal). Test means and SDs were extracted for each group of participants, on each scale/indicator of included measures. Extracted data also includes: sample size of experimental and control groups, type of participants (normal/diagnoses for clinical patients), type of feigning, type of research design, type of investigated cognitive process, type of indicator used by the corresponding scale, type of detection strategy, and type of stimulus.",yrgu2,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/yrgu2/contributors/?format=json,Registration following analysis of the data,[],dhxa8

"Inclusion, Identity, and the Corona Pandemic","Brewer’s (1991) Optimal Distinctiveness Theory (ODT) suggests a two-dimensional model of inclusion (See Figure 1). She argues that for an individual to identify with a group, the individual does not only need to assimilate with the group members, but simultaneously satisfy differentiation needs. The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus in Europe in late February and early March has affected societies dramatically, such that schools and universities were closed, regions were isolated from the rest of the country, or travel bans were administered. Governments call citizens to responsibility, such that they ask to unify against this collective challenge and adhere to governmental regulations. Meanwhile, specific subgroups – such as individuals from particular areas, the elderly, chronically ill people, or families – have special needs that citizens are being asked to take care for. We thus expect this corona pandemic to increase both superordinate collective identity and subgroup identities as the virus develops. The virus seems to become a more serious issue in the US as of March 12th, 2020. We will thus immediately assess baseline measures (t1) of identities, well-being, and perceived threat and examine how these measures develop while the corona virus continues to spread (t2 in two weeks and t3 in four weeks). The main question is: Do the levels of assimilation and differentiation increase during the corona crisis and how does that affect levels of group identities and well-being?",pqwrv,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/pqwrv/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,"['corona', 'identity', 'optimal distinctiveness', 'quasi-experimental design', 'well-being']",egpq3

TEAM-LEVEL HUMAN RESOURCE ATTRIBUTIONS AND PERFORMANCE,"Drawing on attribution theory, this study explores the relationship between team-level human resource attributions (HRAs) and team performance, and explains how transformational leadership moderates this relationship. The data were collected from leaders and subordinates across 77 work teams, for a total of 708 participants employed in seven manufacturing and service organizations in China. The study finds that the relationship between commitment-focused team-level HRAs and team performance is mediated by team engagement, and that transformational leadership significantly strengthens the positive relationship between these variables. However, these moderating and moderated mediation relationships are not evident between control-focused team-level HRAs and team performance. The study is among the first to explore team-level HRAs and contributes to the scholarly debates on the role of attributions in explaining the so-called “black box” between HRM and performance.",qb4yj,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/qb4yj/contributors/?format=json,,[],z38ax

Replication: A Temporal Discontinuity in the Sting of Inferiority at BYU-I Winter 2020,"The level of jealousy and envy felt towards an individual who is experiencing something one desires should be the same regardless of whether the desired experience has already happened or has yet to happen. However, past research has found that timing is an important factor in the amount of jealousy felt when the participants compare themselves to others. Understanding how people react to envy is important in our society where social inequality is continuing to grow. With the growing use of social media, the amount of social comparison among individuals has increased leading to more envy. This study seeks to find potential ways to regulate the amount of envy felt.
This is a replication study and we expect to find more envy and jealousy will be felt before the event has occurred, as the original study did.

Furthermore, despite efforts by Universities to develop effective suicide prevention policies, there appears to be a gap between the individuals and the support services offered by the University. One possibility is that current approaches may not adequately account for help-seeking barriers that students perceive to restrict their access to services.

Potential Effectiveness of Danlou Tablet in Patients with Chronic Stable Angina: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the diseases with the highest morbidity and mortality, also the major public health problem worldwide. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 showed that the population of CAD had reached 110 million in 2016. And approximately 8.92 million died of CAD in this year alone. The most common manifestation of CAD is chronic stable angina (CSA) that makes patients suffer a lot. It’s also associated with increased risks of major adverse cardiovascular events, such as cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for myocardial infarction, or heart failure. Currently, the aims of treatment of CSA are relieving of symptoms and preventing cardiovascular events. The major treatments include drug treatment (beta-receptor blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers and antiplatelet agents) and revascularization. However, in 2019 AHA Scientific Sessions, the ISCHEMIA study showed that heart procedures added to taking medicines and making lifestyle changes did not result in a reduced rate of heart attack or death compared with medicines and lifestyle changes alone. In addition, heart procedures did not reduce symptoms appreciably or improve the quality of life compared with medicines and lifestyle changes alone. This allows us to reconsider how to increase the clinical benefits of patients who have already received medication. In China, traditional Chinese medicine therapies are commonly applied in the treatment of CSA, including herbal medicine, acupuncture, Chinese patent medicine.  Clinical studies have established that these therapies can alleviate chest pain, improve cardiac function and quality of life. Danlou tablet (DLT) is one of Chinese patent medicine, which approved by China Food and Drug Administration. It is originated from a TCM prescription named Gualou Xiebai Banxia Decoction recorded in Synopsis of Golden Chamber, which has been used to treat chest pain for more than 2000 years in China. Clinical studies have showed DLT could reduce the frequency and duration of angina pectoris, and improve cardiac function.

The tDCS effect on visual working memory over DLPFC and PPC,"Working memory (WM) is a cognitive system that provides access to temporarily maintained information for further processing (Miyake &amp; Shah, 1999). Visual WM (VWM) refers to maintaining and directing the visual information needed for higher cognitive processing in the present moment (Luck &amp; Vogel, 2013). WM performance is a mixture of the quantitative number of objects that can be held in WM (capacity) and the qualitative resolution of the representations of these objects (precision). 

Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have gained growing research interest as a promising intervention tool to enhance WM performance  (Andrews et al., 2011; Birba et al., 2017; Brunoni &amp; Vanderhasselt, 2014; Bystad et al., 2016; Fregni et al., 2005; Hoon Ohn et al., 2008; Molaee-Ardekani et al., 2013; Nikolin et al., 2017). TDCS delivers weak current from anode to cathode through the skull, generating electric fields to modulate cortical activities and facilitate neuroplasticity (Ruffini et al., 2013; Roche et al., 2015). 

More recently, inconsistent tDCS effects on WM performance have been reported. Some research has found that WM capacity can be improved by tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and/or posterior parietal cortex (PPC; Andrews et al., 2011; Arciniega et al., 2018; Fregni et al., 2005; Li et al., 2017). Likewise, one study by Heinen et al. (2016) showed that PPC stimulation can potentially enhance WM precision. However, other authors found no effects on WM performance by tDCS over either or both brain regions (Brunoni &amp; Vanderhasselt, 2014; Friedrich et al., 2019; Horvath et al., 2015; Robison et al., 2017). These contrary findings suggest further investigation in tDCS effects on both WM capacity and precision, comparing the stimulations between DLPFC and PPC. 

Wang et al. (2019) recently reported a particularly intriguing finding. They tested the effects of 15-minute anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC and the right PPC relative to a sham condition for 20 participants in a within-subject design. VWM capacity and precision were measured with a continuous reproduction task. In this task, participants memorised the orientations of 2, 4, or 6 bars on a screen. Participants were then asked to reproduce the orientation of one of the bars by mouse-click. The deviation of the reproduced orientation from the original orientation was then used to estimate VWM capacity and precision for each participant, set size, and stimulation condition. Wang et al. observed a selective increase in VWM capacity at set size 6 after PPC relative to sham stimulation, but not after DLPFC stimulation, any other set size, or on VWM precision. 

The potential of brief tDCS to enhance VWM capacity renders it important to test the replicability of this finding. In addition, several aspects of Wang et al.’s (2019) study are potentially problematic and warrant addressing. First, the small sample size translates into low statistical power even for moderate effect sizes, and low statistical power can lead to false-positive findings (Button et al., 2013). The reported effect size is very large (d = 1.028), but this may reflect an overestimate (cf. Halsey et al., 2015). Second, Wang et al. (2019) administered only 60 trials per design cell, which may have led to unreliable estimates of VWM capacity and precision. Third, Wang et al. (2019) failed to assign an equal number of participants to every possible counterbalanced sequence. Therefore, carryover effects across sessions (e.g., practice) have not been adequately controlled in the given VWM tasks. Finally, because Wang et al. (2019) used rotated bars as stimuli, the unique angles of their stimuli effectively ranged only from 0° to 180°, leaving room for developing task-specific strategies. Some, but not all, participants may have realized they could simply memorize the location of just one end of the bar rather than the actual orientation of the bar, thereby making the task considerably easier. This could be problematic in particular in combination with the incomplete counterbalancing and the small number of participants.

In this preregistered experiment, we will conceptually replicate Wang et al.’s (2019) study and address the potential issues of their study by using a bigger sample size, larger number of trials, complete counterbalancing, and stimuli that use the full space of possible angles (360°).",n9fkp,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,"['tDCS', 'working memory']",92k4w

Recent models suggest that AUD patients could also suffer from dehumanization processes (Fontesse et al., 2019) without specifying if dehumanization is expressed through traits (such as uniquely human and human nature traits attributions; dehumanization dual model, Haslam, 2006) or abilities (such as agentism and experience; mind perception model, Gray, Gray, &amp; Wegner 2007) attributions.

Using virtual reality to test fears among adolescents with social anxiety disorder: A multiple case series,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterised by a fear of negative evaluation leading to severe distress and avoidance. SAD is common and can have a significant negative impact on many aspects of life in both childhood and adulthood (e.g. on school attendance and attainment, relationships and jobs). It is often diagnosed in early adolescence, with a median age of onset of 13 years. However, when left untreated, SAD typically persists into adulthood. As such, effective, early interventions are important. SAD in young people is particularly resistant to the current psychological treatments that are used, but recent evidence suggests that an approach that is used successfully to treat SAD in adults may also be successful in treating SAD in young people. However, this treatment involves young people entering social situations to test out theories about the consequences of feared situations. This can be difficult to do within therapy sessions in practice, particularly due to limited access to relevant environments and the increased burden this causes in terms of therapist time and resources. Recently, virtual reality (VR) software has been applied as a means to conduct exposure to social situations and, for example, for conducting behavioural experiments within treatment of adults with paranoid delusions. Given its success so far, the current study seeks to conduct a preliminary investigation of the potential use of VR in the treatment of performance fears among adolescents with SAD by assessing whether young people experience performance fears and negative thoughts in VR social scenarios, whether these change after conducting a behavioural experiment to test out fears in the VR environment, and whether any new learning generalises to real world scenarios.",ekjzg,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ekjzg/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,[],879zg

The humiliation of women in situations of sexual harassment at the workplace: the role of the perpetrator's status and power over the victim and the victim's sexism as moderators.,"Se han estudiado tanto las valoraciones cognitivas que subyacen a la humillación como distintos factores que la facilitan, pero hasta la fecha no se ha estudiado esta emoción en el contexto de las relaciones de género conflictivas. En esta investigación estamos interesados en concreto en las situaciones de acoso sexual en el trabajo.  Hay evidencia de la existencia de un efecto del estatus (débil) en la experiencia emocional de la humillación, siendo más probable esta emoción cuando un perpetrador de alto estatus devalúa a la víctima en comparación con uno de bajo estatus (véase Fernández, Halperin, Gaviria, Agudo y Saguy, 2018). Pero hasta ahora no se ha estudiado este efecto en el contexto que proponemos en la presente investigación. En consonancia con estos resultados, diversos estudios han encontrado que cuando el perpetrador tiene más estatus y poder, el acoso es percibido como más grave (e.g., Cortina, Fitzgerald y Drasgow, 2002; O’Connell y Korabik, 2000).  En concreto, estamos interesados en la dependencia económica como una manifestación de la subyugación de la víctima al poder del perpetrador. Nuestra hipótesis fundamental al respecto, es que cuanto más poder tenga el perpetrador sobre la víctima y, por consiguiente, más dependencia tenga la víctima de su perpetrador, la humillación será mayor. Por otro lado, estudiaremos las valoraciones claves de la humillación: la valoración cognitiva de injusticia y la internalización (Fernández, Saguy y Halperin, 2015) en relación a la ira y vergüenza y cómo afectan éstas a las mujeres que son víctimas de este tipo de agresión.  Esperamos que el efecto de las dos variables independientes (estatus y poder) se traslade a las variables dependientes (las emociones) a través de las valoraciones cognitivas clave de nuestro modelo (valoración cognitiva de injusticia e interiorización de la devaluación del yo) de forma congruente con lo que dicho modelo predice: la humillación vendrá precedida de una interiorización de la devaluación del yo que es simultáneamente valorada como injusta, mientras que la vergüenza y la ira serán precedidas únicamente por la valoración cognitiva correspondiente que las caracteriza (la interiorización el caso de la vergüenza y la injusticia en el caso de la ira). Proponemos, además, que la respuesta de las víctimas humilladas será de impotencia-sumisión; si, por el contrario, no interiorizan la devaluación, las víctimas sentirán más ira y orgullo, siendo sus respuestas más empoderadas.  Asimismo, las personas que mantienen actitudes de rol de género tradicionales tienden a justificar y legitimar la violencia contra las mujeres (Berkel, Vandiver y Bahner, 2004; Hlavka, 2014; Willis, Hallinan y Melby, 1996). Por este motivo pretendemos analizar el efecto moderador del sexismo en este nuevo escenario y así, identificar un posible efecto que facilite la aparición de esta emoción en aquellas mujeres que no son sexistas, porque no van a legitimar esas acciones y las valorarán como injustas. Por último, un objetivo secundario de este estudio es analizar la humillación del hombre cuando es perpetrada por una mujer e identificar las diferencias de género existentes. Esperamos que los resultados obtenidos puedan arrojar luz sobre este grave problema social y puedan aportar la base teórica tanto para el diseño efectivo de programas de prevención en potenciales víctimas, como los de intervención para el tratamiento de las humilladas por acoso sexual en el trabajo.

Action Effects on Visual Perception of Distances: A Multilevel Bayesian Meta-Analysis,"Some studies suggested that action constraints influence visual perception of distances. For instance, the greater the effort to cover a distance, the longer people perceive this distance. The present multilevel Bayesian meta-analysis supports the existence of a small action constraint effect on distance estimation, Hedge’s g = 0.29, 95% CrI [0.16, 0.47] (Nstudies = 37, Nparticipants = 1035). This effect slightly varied according to the action constraint category (i.e., effort, weight, and tool-use) but not according to participants’ motor intention. Some authors argued such effects reflect experimental demand biases rather than genuine perceptual effects. Our meta-analysis did not allow to dismiss this possibility, but it did not support it. We provide field-specific conventions for interpreting action constraint effect sizes and minimum sample size to detect them with various levels of power. We encourage researchers to update this meta-analysis using our online repository (https://osf.io/bc3wn/) to send their published or unpublished data.

These expected relationships are shown in figure 1. At the end of the research, it is expected to find erectile disorder and premature ejaculation will show changes according to circumcision age. Sexual dysfunction symptoms will increase, and sexual satisfaction will decrease according to age with the effects of the mediators. To be clearer, as the age increases, sexual dysfunction symptoms will also increase, and sexual satisfaction will decrease.",9wxfr,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/9wxfr/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,[],fdbhq

Reading time regularity,"Investigating natural text reading as complex, dynamical process

How can we quantify the coupling between a text and reading performance? The hypothesis of reading time regularity (RTR) states that the degree of regularity in measures of the reading process (e.g., reading times or eye movements) is informative about reading fluency and comprehension. Hence, RTR captures the extent to which relevant linguistic information of a text controls its perceptual-cognitive processing during reading. Our project aims at investigating this hypothesis.

Broker Accountability and Candidate Selection,"Clientelist brokers are often caught between two informal sources account-
ability: politicians and voters. Recent advances in the literature on clien-
telism have shown that the degree to which brokers are accountability to
everyday people can impact the ability of voters to extract bene?ts from
the state (Auerbach, 2016; Gottlieb, 2017; Nathan, 2019). I present a re-
search design to be ?elded in March and April of 20201 that tests the e?ects
of bottom-up broker accountability on a broker's candidate choice. Taking
advantage of upcoming elections for neighborhood association presidents,
who are the de facto community brokers in many parts of Colombia, I col-
lect unique data on bottom-up broker accountability, including re-election
rates, margins of victory, and voter participation. This observational data
is joined with in-depth broker interviews and a discrete-choice experiment
that allows us to see with greater precision how brokers facing di?erent
accountability constraints choose candidates to work with. I expect that
bottom-up accountability impacts both the extent of rent-seeking behav-
ior and the permissiveness of undesirable candidate traits like allegations of
corruption.",htk8q,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/htk8q/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to any human observation of the data,[],wc9af

"Turtles, Task Ninjas, and Time-Wasters","Standard approaches for identifying task completion strategies, such as precrastination and procrastination, reduce behavior to single markers that oversimplify the process of task completion. To illustrate this point, we consider three task completion strategies and introduce a new method to identify their use. This approach was tested using a historical dataset (N = 8,655) of the available electronic records of research participation at our institution. The approach out-performed standard diagnostic approaches and yielded an interesting finding: several strategies were associated with negative outcomes. Specifically, procrastinators and precrastinators both struggled to finish tasks on time. Together, these findings underscore the importance of using holistic approaches to determine the relationship between task characteristics, individual differences, and task completion.",s78wf,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s78wf/contributors/?format=json,,"['discounting', 'Latent Profile Analysis', 'precrastination', 'procrastination', 'task completion', 'task valuation']",t3ek6

Accessing prior lexical knowledge when learning words from stories,"In previous experiments, we taught children and adults pseudowords of varying numbers of word-form neighbours to examine the influence of prior knowledge on learning and consolidation (https://osf.io/s2628/). In this project, we examine how these effects might change when pseudowords are encountered incidentally in stories, compared to previous explicit teaching paradigms. 

Experiment 1 examined pseudoword learning from stories in children. We thank Rhiannon Pearce, Caroline Korell, &amp; Charlotte Dean, for adapting the materials for their MSc projects. Rhiannon Pearce is credited for all artwork associated with the experiments. 

Experiment 2 examined pseudoword learning from stories in adults, in an online study.

Alcohol consumption during adults’ drinking occasions: using decision tree modelling to identify predictive contextual characteristics and their potential interactions,"The contexts of drinking events – such as the locations, timing, and participants – influence levels of alcohol consumption. Research in this area tends to focus on a small number of contextual characteristics and overlook their interconnections. We conceptualise drinking occasions as practices – routinized types of human activity consisting of connected elements. For example, ‘going out with friends’ involves drinking with a group of friends in licensed premises at the weekend. This study will identify which contextual characteristics are the strongest predictors of alcohol consumption within drinking occasions (and should therefore be included in future analyses) and explore potential interactions between these. We will also test whether considering interactions between contexts improves the prediction of alcohol consumption.",42epd,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/42epd/contributors/?format=json,,[],u8b73

"Exclusive breastfeeding policy, practice and influences in South Africa, 1980 to 2018: A mixed-methods systematic review","Abstract Background  In 2011, South Africa committed to promoting exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for six months for all mothers, regardless of HIV status, in line with World Health Organization recommendations. This was a marked shift from earlier policies, and with it, average EBF rates increased from less than 10% in 2011 to 32% by 2016. Objectives  The aim of this mixed-methods systematic review was to describe EBF practices in South Africa and their multi-level influences over four policy periods. Methods  We applied PRISMA guidelines according to a published protocol (Prospero: CRD42014010512). We searched seven databases [Africa-Wide, PubMed, Popline, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Global Health, and The Cochrane Library] and conducted hand searches for eligible articles (all study designs, conducted in South Africa and published between 1980–2018). The quality of articles was assessed using published tools, as appropriate. Separate policy analysis was conducted to delineate four distinct policy periods. We compared EBF rates by these periods. Then, applying a three-level ecological framework, we analysed EBF influences concurrently by method. Finally, the findings were synthesized to compare breastfeeding influences by policy period, maintaining an ecological framework. Results  From an initial sample of 20,226 articles, 72 unique articles were reviewed, three of which contributed to both quantitative and qualitative analysis. Despite the large sample, several provinces were poorly represented (if at all) and many studies were assessed as low to moderate quality. Despite these limitations, our historical lens enabled us to explore why South African progress on increasing EBF practices has been slow. The review reflects a context that increasingly supports EBF, but falls short in accounting for family, community, and workplace influences. The findings also highlight the unintended damage caused by rapidly adopting and introducing global guidelines to an unsupported health workforce. Conclusions  From a South African perspective, we identified geographic and methodological biases, as well as gaps in our understanding and potential explanations of inequities in EBF. Our recommendations relate to policy, programming, and research to inform changes that would be required to further improve EBF practice rates in South Africa. While our review is South Africa-specific, our findings have broader implications for investing in multi-level interventions and limiting how often infant feeding guidelines are changed.",hyed8,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyed8/contributors/?format=json,,"['capacity strengthening', 'HIV prevention', 'infant feeding', 'social determinants of health']",njwrz

Humor and Opinion Frames in Political Podcasts,"The proposed experiment is part of a larger project seeking to categorize and assess the effectiveness of political podcasts on strengthening political attitudes and enhancing political knowledge. Prior to this outlined experimental testing, a first phase of content analysis was undertaken to determine which framing tactics are used most frequently in the most popular current affairs podcasts. The analysis found that two of the most popular framing tactics were humor and opinion. These two tactics will be compared with traditional hard news framing tactics in the proposed survey experiment, and the study will use a pro-attitudinal design in an attempt to recreate more realistic media consumption habits.

Humor at first sight: The role of positive humor in human-robot interaction in groups,"Humor is a key aspect of social interactions that can enhance Human-Robot Interactions (HRI). We propose to explore how positive styles of humor (affiliative and self-enhancing) can influence HRI in groups, in terms of (a) robot perception, likability and acceptance; (b) user enjoyment; (c) intention to engage in future interactions. For this purpose, we will validate a set of jokes and test our research question using two card-game scenarios (Card Against Humanity (CAH) and Sueca). We expect participants to respond to the robot more positively in the condition in which it shows a congruent style of humor with that of the participant. We expect this effect to be stronger in the humorous task (CAH), than in the other task. We add to the literature by investigating the role of humor in HRI and creating a dataset of jokes that can foment more research and the development of better robots.",k769n,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/k769n/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,[],64msb

HRV changes after cognitive and emotional challenges in high and low ruminators,"Abstract

Background: Recovery from stress is a predictive factor for cardiovascular health and HRV is suggested to be an index of how well people physiologically recover from stress. Biofeedback interventions that include guided breathing have shown to be effective in increasing HRV and facilitate stress recovery.  
Objective: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a brief app-based biofeedback breathing intervention (BioBase) in enhancing physiological recovery among employees who were induced to cognitive and emotional stress in the laboratory.
Methods: In total 75 full-time employees took part. Inter-beat-intervals (RR) were recorded continuously for 5 min. of baseline, followed by cognitive and emotional stress induction. The session ended with a 5 min. recovery period during which participants were randomly allocated in three conditions: control, mindfulness or app-based biofeedback breathing (BioBase). Subjective tension was assessed at the end of each period.
Results: Levels of subjective tension significantly increased following the stress induction. HRV significantly decreased following the stress period. At the recovery phase there was a significant increase in the root mean square of successive differences (p=.002), the percentage of successive RR that differ by &gt;50ms (p=.008) and high frequency (p=.012) for those in the BioBase breathing condition than the mindfulness and the control group.
Conclusions: Biofeedback breathing interventions digitally delivered through a commercially available app. can be effective in facilitating stress recovery among employees. These findings contribute to m-health literature on the beneficial effects of brief biofeedback interventions on employees’ cardiovascular health.

Structure and Demographic Correlates of Individual Trait Responses to Emotions,"The purpose of this study is to determine the empirical relationships among trait responses to emotion (e.g., control, approach, escape, and avoidance) using a large, diverse sample. The first aim of this study is to develop a multidimensional model of the empirical relationships among trait responses to emotion to characterize their relationships. The second aim includes exploring the correlations between each individual’s dimension scores and demographic variables such as age, gender, early socioeconomic context (SEC), and early life experiences. 

AMENDMENT: Please note an error in wording in the Variables section, found on 2/25/20 at 4:27 pm EST, for the SEC variable. Rather than saying ""We will then utilize publicly available data from Social Explorer, a website that provides access to United States census data, to look at county-specific demographic information (i.e., population, percent unemployed, median household income) to assess early life SEC"", this section should say that ""We will then utilize publicly available data from Social Explorer, a website that provides access to United States census data, to look at county-specific demographic information (i.e., percent unemployed, median household income, and education) to assess early life SEC"" since education, not population, is necessary for analyzing SEC.

Supplemental materials for preprint: UPAYA MENGURANGI MISKONSEPSI PADA PEMBELAJARAN FISIKA MELALUI PENERAPAN MODEL CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING,"The purpose of this paper is to describe efforts to reduce misconceptions in learning physics through the application of creative problem solving models. This writing is motivated by the large number of students who still experience misconceptions in learning physics. For this reason, efforts need to be made to reduce misconceptions in learning physics by applying the creative problem solving model. The method used in this paper is the study of literature by studying some literature to be analyzed and made conclusions. The results of this paper indicate that the application of this creative problem solving model can be a solution in an effort to reduce misconceptions in learning physics. Because, creative problem solving models can improve students' understanding of concepts and skills, so students will better understand the concept by searching for themselves and solving problems independently but still not free from teacher guidance. Teachers can also actively involve students in the physics learning process.",74jem,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/74jem/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to analysis of the data,"['Miskonsepsi, Creative Problem Solving, Pembelajaran Fisika']",3xuen

Facial Anomalies and Visual Attention (FAVA),"Recent evidence suggests people experience biases against those with facial anomalies. Although biasing effects have been reported in the literature for both explicit and implicit attitudes, implicit biases have been shown to be particularly robust. The effects of such biases on behavior, however, are poorly understood. It is unknown, for instance, whether implicit bias modulates visual attention paid to facial anomalies and, if observed, whether such effects are attenuated following surgical correction. Furthermore, psychological dispositions like empathy and disgust sensitivity have been hypothesized to shape bias, although additional empirical work is necessary to test these hypotheses.",rw3ck,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rw3ck/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,[],9kvtg

Steroidhormon som prediktor,"Approximately 70% of breast cancer tumors express estrogen and/or progesterone receptors (ER and PR). For this breast cancer subtype, endocrine treatment represents the mainstay of systemic treatment for both early and metastatic disease. However, a subset of patients will develop endocrine resistance, manifesting as relapse or progression. Side effects of endocrine treatment are well described, including thromboembolic problems, stroke, menopausal symptoms, and tiredness (fatigue). For many who receive systemic therapy the relative benefits may be small and not outweigh the associated costs of side effects. Although recent advances in transcriptomics research have given us a glimpse into the heterogeneity within subgroups, it is not possible to precisely predict a tumor’s response to therapy. Obesity is a risk factor for ER positive breast cancer and correlates with poor prognosis of breast cancer. However, the mechanism of how obesity correlates with endocrine treatment resistance remains unclear. In this project, by use of metabolomics approaches, we will examine steroid hormone metabolomics in breast tumor tissue and serum obtained from a regional breast cancer biobank. We aim to identify novel biomarkers for predicting endocrine treatment resistance and treatment-induced side-effects in both non-obese and obese breast cancer patients.

Probing ovulatory cycle shifts in women’s preferences for men’s behaviors,"The existence of ovulatory cycle shifts in women’s mate preferences has been discussed controversially. There is evidence that naturally cycling women in their fertile phase, compared to their luteal phase, evaluate specific behavioral cues in men as more attractive for sexual relationships. However, recent research has cast doubt on these findings. We addressed this debate in a large, pre-registered within-subject study including salivary hormone measures and luteinizing hormone tests. One-hundred-fifty-seven female participants rated natural videos of 70 men in dyadic intersexual interactions on sexual and long-term attractiveness. Multilevel comparisons across two ovulatory cycles indicated that women’s mate preferences for men’s behaviors did not shift across the cycle, neither for competitive, nor for courtship behavior. Hormone levels and relationship status did not affect these results. Hormonal mechanisms and implications for estrus theories are discussed.",zgtnw,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/zgtnw/contributors/?format=json,,"['attractiveness', 'fertility', 'mate preferences', 'ovulatory cycle', 'steroid hormones']",8ntuc
Pubertal development and self-regulation of behavior: a systematic review,"Self-regulation of behavior is an essential ability for living a healthy and productive life. It matures during adolescence, when self-regulation failures are still likely to be involved in higher risk taking and behaviors that increase vulnerability. Most studies have addressed this issue considering development over chronological ages, which happens in tandem with changes in adolescents’ environment and social milieu, as well as with changes in pubertal status. The timing and tempo of pubertal development, however, varies widely among individuals and so it is not adequately represented by age. Recent studies have suggested that puberty may in fact be a more important factor in determining brain and behavioral changes in adolescence than age. Understanding how puberty influences the development of self-regulation may therefore enable a better understanding of how this crucial function develops during adolescence, which could in turn be useful for designing public policies for prevention and intervention to promote adolescents’ health and well-being, to create better educational strategies and to determine adolescents’ rights and their accountability. Recent years have seen a growing interest on puberty, which led to an increasing number of studies incorporating measures of pubertal status. But how much knowledge about the effects of puberty on self-regulation have we gained from these studies? How much progress have we made in disentangling the effects of puberty on self-regulation from the effects of other changes happening during adolescence, such as those more closely correlated with increases in age or grades? To answer these questions we will apply the methods of systematic review to locate and integrate the literature studying the development of self-regulation along pubertal development.",urmbx,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/urmbx/contributors/?format=json,,[],xfnuz

Systematic Review: Temporal Network Approach to Psychological Constructs,"Temporal network analyses are relatively recent, as the methodology required to compute network analyses on time series data was only recently developed (Bringmann et al., 2013). The number of studies investigating temporal network dynamics has been steadily increasing, however, since this type of analysis allows a micro-level investigation into how variables interact with one another over time. Despite their potential, however, there are no accepted best practices for the data collection, methodology, and analyses related to temporal network analyses. For example, there is not yet an accepted standard regarding sample size or number of total timepoints, nor standard assumption checks for the analyses, nor ways to assess the stability and robustness of analyses, and so on. We plan to conduct a systematic review to carefully audit all the current methodological practices and analyses used for temporal network analyses, to potentially develop a set of guidelines for future studies.",nf3v7,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/nf3v7/contributors/?format=json,,[],8647n

"Activity Diversity, Hippocampal Volume, and Cognitive Functioning","The hippocampus, which is involved in learning and memory, is one of the few structures in the brain that demonstrates neurogenesis across the lifespan (Eriksson et al., 1998; Spalding et al., 2013). This neurogenesis is hypothesized to support the ability to flexibly navigate novel situations and environments (Kempermann, 2008). In humans, the extent of navigational abilities has been related to hippocampal volume (Maguire et al., 2000; Maguire, Woollett, &amp; Spiers, 2006), and in genetically identical mice greater hippocampal neurogenesis was related to a greater range of territory explored independent of total amount of movement (termed “roaming entropy”; Freund et al., 2013). Hippocampal volume, then, may be a marker of exposure to and engagement with novel events and environments. Activity diversity, or the range and evenness of participation in daily activities, has previously been associated with better executive functioning in humans (Lee, Charles, &amp; Almeida, in press), which is characterized by the ability to adapt cognitively to different situations, but has not yet been examined in relation to hippocampal structure. The present research will examine how hippocampal volume relates to activity diversity, above and beyond total activity time, in two samples of US adults across the span of 8 days. Furthermore, the relationship between hippocampal volume, activity diversity, and cognitive functioning will be explored.

Development of an Evidence and Gap Map of Interventions to increase Smoking Cessation: A Study Protocol,"Introduction:
Smoking remains one of the leading risk factors contributing to the global burden of disease. Sub-optimal implementation of evidence-based tobacco control and smoking cessation practice is a major challenge despite a substantial evidence base for interventions to increase smoking cessation globally. We aim to develop an Evidence Gap Map (EGM) to collate the existing evidence and identify the gaps in research on interventions to increase smoking cessation worldwide. An EGM creates a visual framework to collate the current evidence on interventions and their outcomes
Method:
A conceptual framework was developed followed by the formulation of a search strategy with, key search terms and search period (1970-till date). The search will be conducted in relevant bibliographic, systematic review and impact evaluation databases (including MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS,3ie Impact Evaluation repository),with support from a research librarian. Subsequently, two coders will screen and retrieve systematic reviews and individual impact evaluation studies. The adapted SURE (Supporting the Use of Research Evidence) checklist will be used to evaluate the quality of the included systematic reviews and impact evaluations. A narrative synthesis from the systematic review findings and line listing of the impact evaluations will form the basis of this EGM. The EGM report will be presented in an interactive visual format. 
Ethics and dissemination: 
As this research involves published articles, it is exempted from ethical approval.  We will disseminate the research findings including the interactive map at relevant conferences and via peer-reviewed publications. 
Conclusion: 
The proposed EGM will organise the pieces of evidence generated in systematic reviews and impact evaluations on smoking cessation interventions and identify the current research gaps, if any. The findings will inform evidence-based practice and future research.",4vqty,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4vqty/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,"['Evidence and Gap Map', 'Smoking cessation', 'Smoking cessation intervention', 'Tobacco smoking']",h72w5

Genetic Predispositions and Caregiving Behaviour interact in modulating Virtual Social Attitudes in Humans,"The interaction between parental care and the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene affect social behaviours in adulthood. Serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms (5-HTTLPR) and early parent-infant interaction influence adults’ relationship with intimate partners. However, human conspecifics socially act towards the real and virtual world in displaying multiple and complex social interactions. Hence, the mechanisms underlying the virtual social relationship in humans remain largely unknown. We hypothesized interaction between genetic factors (three polymorphisms from the oxytocin receptor, OXTR, and the serotonin transporter, 5-HTTLPR), parental bonding patterns (PBI) and adults’ interactional patterns (ASQ, ECR-R) in shaping virtual social behaviour (Instagram, Facebook). Self-reported questionnaires were used to evaluate participants’ (n= 61) parental bonding patterns (Parental Bonding Instrument, formed by four subscales Maternal Care, Paternal Care, Maternal Overprotection, Paternal Overprotection), interactional patterns towards peers (Attachment Style Questionnaire formed by five subscales Confidence, Discomfort in Intimacy, Relationship as Secondary, Need for Approval, Worry about Relationship) and the quality of bond with intimate partners (Experience in Close Relationship Scale formed by two subscales Anxiety, Avoidance). Social media activities were collected applying an automatic Python algorithm through which eight indexes were extracted: Instagram number of following users, followers, posts and tags from other users’ posts and Facebook number of friends, interests, published pics and given likes. Buccal mucosa cell samples were collected to assess participants’ genetic predispositions, and regions OXTR/rs2254298 (G/G homozygotes vs A carriers), OXTR/rs53576 (G/G homozygotes vs A carriers) and 5-HTTLPR/rs255331 (G/G homozygotes vs A carriers) were genotyped. We hypothesize multiple gene*environment interactions on different parameters and indexes calculated on the social media variables as Instagram Followers/Following ratio (“Social Desirability Index”).

During the viewing of audio-visual materials, similarities in HRV may exist across audiences, indicating the impact of the content regardless of genre, be it comedy or tragedy. Furthermore, with reference to audiences’ HRV responses, it is possible to trace back and filter out more emotionally arousing footage for re-editing audio-visual storytelling materials.

Acupuncture for Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis：A Systematic Review Protocol,"Introduction Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a distressing symptom experienced by patients. Many methods are used to treat, including pudilan anti-inflammatory oral liquid and doxycycline and laser therapy, but these take a long time to produce positive effects and compliance is low. Previous reviews into acupuncture for RAS has been growing, but a systematic review is not available. Therefore, this protocol was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture on RAS, by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods and analysis The following databases will be searched from their inception to 1 February 2020: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in English or Chinese associated with acupuncture for patients with RAS will be included. Eligible study conference abstracts and reference lists of manuscripts will also be searched. The data collection and analysis will be conducted independently by two reviewers. The risk of bias of each study will be conducted by the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The heterogeneity will be measured by the I2 statistic. According to heterogeneity testing, data will be synthesized using a fixed-effects model or a random-effects model. A meta-analysis will be performed using Rev Man V.5.3.5 statistical software for each outcome. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis are planned according to clinical evidence. Mean difference or standardized mean difference for continuous data and risk ratio for dichotomous data will be calculated. 
Ethics and dissemination This protocol will not involve individual patient information and endangering participant rights. The results will be reported in a peer- reviewed journal or disseminated in relevant conferences.

Examining the effect two-dimensional inclusion on group and identification when inclusion becomes an necessity,"Although the claim made by Optimal Distinctiveness Theory (ODT; Brewer, 1991) that inclusion (assimilation + differentiation needs) predicts group identification and well-being better than assimilation only, it has, to our knowledge, never been tested. Recent attempts to experimentally manipulate the two dimensions fell short in distinguishing them, such that participants generalized one dimension over the other. Assuming that inclusion might perhaps only have superior prediction over assimilation if inclusion becomes a necessity (i.e., if it is relevant that both dimensions are satisfied), we test longitudinal effects of a two-dimensional conceptualization of inclusion on group identification and well-being. Using existing data from the LISS panel, we additionally assess two forms of inclusion necessity (1. Identity threat and 2. Chronically high inclusion necessity)

Deployment-related outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of individual and job-level predictors,"Operational deployment reflects a significant period in military service. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among military personnel is an issue that receives a large amount of attention, particularly in the context of operational deployment in relation to the experience of potentially traumatic events (e.g., Adler et al., 2008). A recent meta-analysis of military personnel investigating PTSD following deployment to the Iraq and Afghanistan conflict identified 49 papers emerging between 1991 and 2012 (Hines, et al., 2014). Yet, there is a dearth of meta-analysis investigating the role the job-related demands and resources play in relation to deployment related-outcomes. Personnel serving in deployment contexts also experience other demands, such as sleep disruption, barriers to fulfilling goals, ethical challenges (Kok, Herrell, Grossman, West, &amp; Wilk, 2016; McCauley, Liebling-Kalifani, &amp; Hughes, 2012). Other job-related demands also play a role in individual vulnerability to PTSD. Personnel serving in deployment contexts also experience such demands as sleep disruption, barriers to fulfilling goals, and ethical challenges (Kok, Herrell, Grossman, West, &amp; Wilk, 2016; McCauley, Liebling-Kalifani, &amp; Hughes, 2012). Other job-related demands also play a role in individual vulnerability to PTSD, as do recent life stressors (Bonanno, Galea, Bucciarelli, &amp; Vlahov, 2007). Thus the backdrop of stressors has implication for the emergence of PTSD. Moreover, deployments may result in a range of other debilitating mental health concerns including: cognitive functioning, anxiety, depression, and burnout (Alder, et al., 2017; Black, et al., 2004; Booth-Kewley, et al., 2012). These may arise as a consequence of other job-related factors that have not yet been the focus of attention in the military context.",ywh4d,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ywh4d/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,[],4ruvx

Effects of instructions on performance and motivation for participants high and low in approach and avoidance motivation,"We are students at Walsh University who are interested in how motivation plays a role in ones performance. In order to test this, we will provide participants with either approach or avoidance motivation instructions and then ask them to complete a 2 minute anagram task containing 3 practice sets and 7 experimental sets. Participants will either be told they have the opportunity to earn 2 tickets if they successfully find 90% or more of the possible words in the anagram (approach motivation), or that they should not miss more than 10% of all the possible words in order to not lose their tickets (avoidance). Finally, in order to measure how much a participant identifies with a certain motivational style, they will be given a BIS/BAS questionnaire that provides a score based on motivation. We hypothesize that those who are given instructions that match their motivational style reported on the BIS/BAS will perform better on the anagram task than those who experience a mismatch. We also hypothesize that overall, those who are approach motivated will perform better than those who are avoidance motivated.",7pmak,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7pmak/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,[],85pj2

Experience and confidence,"This is an experimental study to explore how different forms of presenting information (described or experienced information) to decision makers affect their confidence in choice and confidence in the realiability/trustworthiness of the information.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Decision makers use estimates of the reliability of the information they encounter to make a decision under uncertainty (Aitchison et al. 2015). For example, a manager will wait until the information she consults is deemed sufficiently reliable and trustworthy to make an important strategic decision. These perceptions of the reliability of the information they use can be communicated to third parties to reflect confidence in their beliefs or opinions, which can be useful in group discussions or leadership roles. 
The information used by decision makers to make a choice can typically be accessed in two broad ways: either it is access through their own experience (a sample of previously encountered choices) or through convenient descriptions of the probabilities and outcomes of the choice problem.
In this study, we ask whether the source of information (experience or convenient descriptions) affects decision makers’ confidence level. More precisely, we ask whether the source of information affects two aspects of confidence: (1) confidence in the reliability of the information they used to make the choice, and (2) confidence in having made the right choice. 
Previous studies have emphasized the idea that experience breeds confidence even in settings where skills or expertise do not increase with experience (superstitious learning account). Yet, these changes in confidence have not been compared to other ways of learning about a task (e.g. descriptions of risky choices). We wonder whether some of the differences in choice behavior observed in the ‘DE gap’ literature may relate to differences in confidence brought about by the source of information.

"Review Protocol for the Systematic Mapping of Well-Being in Lawyers, Accountants, Investment Bankers, and Management Consultants, and an In-Depth Synthesis Review of Lawyers’ Well-Being","Rising reports of poor well-being in the legal profession have been noted in multiple countries and jurisdictions. With increased global concerns about lawyer well-being, the amount of practitioner and academic literature has also increased. However, the literature remains fragmented and disparate, with a lack of comprehensive review in this area. A systematic scoping (mapping) of the literature is therefore needed to characterise the current body of knowledge, identify key concepts and contexts thought to influence lawyer well-being, and collate this knowledge in the form of a searchable database. The creation of this new knowledge will enable a synthesis review to be performed to integrate and analyse the available evidence and perspectives published globally within this emerging field. The review will also systematically scope the literature concerning well-being in three other professional groups which operate within similar work environments to lawyers, namely accounting, investment banking, and management consulting. By including these professional groups in the review, an important source of knowledge will be created, against which the well-being of lawyers can be compared and synthesised. This review will adopt a two-staged approach. The first stage will scope and map the current literature using systematic mapping methodology and stakeholder involvement. Using outputs from the systematic mapping stage, an in-depth thematic synthesis review of lawyers’ well-being will then be conducted.",ty4cb,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ty4cb/contributors/?format=json,,"['Accountants', 'Employee', 'Investment Bankers', 'Lawyers', 'Legal Profession', 'Management Consultants', 'Mental Health', 'Occupation', 'Organization', 'Professional Services', 'Review', 'Wellbeing', 'Well-Being', 'Work']",9c3bk

Randomized Control Trial of the Federal Work-Study Program,"Federal Work-Study (FWS), which was introduced as part of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, subsidizes up to 75% of eligible students’ wages and encourages institutions to employ students on campus in part-time, educationally relevant jobs. FWS has already been operating at scale for over 50 years—serving over 600,000 students per year at a cost of $1 billion dollars annually—and yet it has never been rigorously evaluated. We will estimate the effect of receiving an FWS offer on students’ academic outcomes at a large, multi-campus public university system (MCS) using a randomized controlled trial.

Influence of Unpredictable Context on Error Related Negativity,"The error related negativity (ERN) is a negative deflection typically appearing in centro-frontal regions after an error has been committed (Hajcak 2012). It is considered to reflect individual sensitivity to threat and to be modulated by unpredictable contexts. In this study we aim to replicate and expand previous data showing that the amplitude of the ERN is increased when unpredictable but not predictable tones occur in the background (Jackson et al., 2015). Participants will perform a Flanker task in four different conditions: during a predictable pattern of tones, during an unpredictable pattern of tones (replication part), during a predictable pattern of mildly painful cutaneous stimuli and during an unpredictable pattern of mildly painful cutaneous stimuli (expansion). The order of the stimuli will be counterbalanced across participants. High density (129 channels) EEG will be recorded. Participants will rate for each condition their anxiety, the un-/predictability, the unpleasantness and the intensity of the stimulus. In addition, participants will fill in the questionnaires - Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) (Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1984; Engelen, De Peuter, Victoir, Van Diest, &amp; Van den Bergh, 2006), Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI, Deacon et al., 2004; Peterson &amp; Heilbronner, 1987), Intolerance of Uncertainty (IoU) (Helsen, Van den Bussche, Vlaeyen, &amp; Goubert, 2013), Life Orientation Test-Revised (Scheier et al. J Pers Soc Psychol. 1994), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) (PCS, Sullivan, 1995), and Dyspnea Catastrophizing Scale (DCS).

"Science beliefs, political ideology, and cognitive sophistication","Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain why individuals hold pro- or anti-science beliefs. Some models focus on the role of political ideology and motivated reasoning, arguing that greater cognitive sophistication enables individuals to interpret evidence in an identity-consistent manner. Other models focus on the roles of basic science knowledge and cognitive sophistication, arguing that more general science knowledge and greater cognitive sophistication facilitate pro-science beliefs. To test these competing accounts, we identified a large range of controversial issues that are ostensibly subject to ideological disagreement and examined the relative roles of political ideology, science knowledge, and cognitive sophistication. Our results, which are consistent across two different nationally representative samples of Americans (N = 1,709), indicate that a combination of basic science knowledge and cognitive sophistication contribute more to science beliefs about various topics than political ideology. Furthermore, we found limited evidence for identity-protective cognition (i.e., motivated reasoning). By investigating a broad array of science-related beliefs, our results adjudicate between four accounts of science attitudes and suggest that educators and policymakers should focus on increasing basic science literacy and critical thinking instead of focusing on the ideological factors that divide people.

Comparing the influence of inclusion vs. assimilation on group identification and well-being when inclusion becomes a necessity.,"Following ODT (Brewer, 1991), we will test the premise that inclusion (conceptualized as the combination of assimilation and differentiation needs) predicts group identification and well-being  better than assimilation alone. The prediction of group affiliation status on identity and well-being is suggested by the Inclusion Identification Model (IIM; Adams et al., in prep). Due to theoretical considerations, we expect that the superior prediction of inclusion over assimilation will only hold when inclusion becomes a necessity (i.e., when it is relevant to the individual to be both assimilated and differentiated). This pre-registration describes a 2 (differentiation: high vs. low) x 2 (inclusion necessity: high vs. low) lab experiment.",7k4eg,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7k4eg/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,"['experiment', 'identity', 'inclusion', 'ODT', 'optimal distinctiveness', 'well-being']",a75ky

Sweet as sugar: The effect of fasting and glucose or stevia load on the acute stress response,"One purpose of the acute stress response is the support of an organism’s survival through mobilization of energy. Hereby, The release of adrenaline and cortisol triggers a wealth of different physiological processes that eventually lead to increased glucose availability (de Kloet, Joëls, &amp; Holsboer, 2005). Paradoxically, a sufficient blood glucose level seems to be necessary for an HPA axis response to stress (Rohleder &amp; Kirschbaum, 2007). n 1997, Kirschbaum and colleagues observed that fasting study participants with low euglycemic blood glucose levels showed no rise in cortisol in response to acute psychosocial stress, while study participants who had fasted but consumed a glucose-rich beverage just prior to the stressor had normal cortisol responses to stress (Kirschbaum et al., 1997). A follow-up study demonstrated that neither fat nor protein consumption prior to stress had a similar effect (Gonzalez-Bono et al., 2002), suggesting that glucose consumption prior to the stressor is key. 
With this project, we aim at disentangling the potential hedonic and metabolic effects of glucose by independently manipulating the sweetness and the energy content of a beverage that a participant consumes before being exposed to a psychosocial stressor. Furthermore, we want to explore whether the knowledge about the content of a drink is sufficient to change the physiological reaction to it.",pfxe8,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/pfxe8/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to analysis of the data,[],ceqw4

Efficacy and Safety of Shenqi Compound for the Treatment of Diabetic Macroangiopathy: A Protocol for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Diabetic macroangiopathy is a further complication of diabetes mellitus and is the leading cause of death for diabetic patients. Shenqi compound is a traditional Chinese medicine formula widely used in the treatment of diabetes and diabetic macroangiopathy. At present, there is only one systematic review on shenqi compound in the treatment of diabetes. However, no meta-analysis has evaluated the efficacy and safety of shenqi compound on diabetic macroangiopathy.
From its establishment to March 1, 2020, three English databases and four Chinese medical databases will be searched. Then, according to the established inclusion and exclusion criteria, the two methodologically trained researchers will select qualified articles by reading titles, abstracts and full texts. The deviation risk will be assessed using the tools of Cochrane Collaboration. We will conduct a meta-analysis of fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin and other results. We will also complete heterogeneity assessment, subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis for the data.
The results will be published at a peer-reviewed journal.
 In this study, we will systematically evaluate the evidence of shenqi compound in the treatment of diabetic macroangiopathy. Our research is supposed to provide evidence-based support for clinical practice.",tw9ma,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/tw9ma/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,[],4cyba

Penerapan Model POE2WE Berbasis Blog Wordpress sebagai Inovasi Pembelajaran Digital di Sekolah Menengah Atas,"Tujuan penulisan artikel ini adalah untuk menggambarkan aplikasi kreatif model POE2WE berbasis blog wordpress sebagai inovasi pembelajaran. Tulisan ini dilatarbelakangi oleh kurangnya pemahaman siswa dalam penguasaan materi sehingga pembelajaran tidak maksimal. Untuk alasan ini, ada kebutuhan untuk inovasi dalam belajar dengan menerapkan model POE2WE secara kreatif berbasis blog wordpress. Model POE2WE sebagai proses solusi melalui pendekatan konstruktivistik disertai dengan blog wordpress sehingga siswa menjadi termotivasi dan dapat meningkatkan hasil belajar mereka. Metode yang digunakan dalam artikel ini adalah studi literatur atau pustaka. Data dari literatur dikumpulkan dan dianalisis untuk disajikan dalam hasil dan diskusi untuk menarik kesimpulan. Hasil penulisan menunjukkan bahwa aplikasi kreatif model POE2WE berbasis blog wordpress sebagai inovasi pembelajaran dapat menjadi solusi untuk masalah yang dihadapi dalam proses belajar mengajar di kelas. Model POE2WE diterapkan untuk siswa sekolah menengah atas dalam beberapa tahap, yaitu: siswa membuat dugaan masalah, setelah masalah ditelusuri atau diamati, peserta didik menjelaskan pelajaran yang berkaitan dengan masalah itu dan menerapkan konsep pembelajaran dalam masalah tersebut di kehidupan sehari-hari, kemudian para siswa membuat komunikasi tertulis melalui blog wordpress, kemudian melakukan proses evaluasi dan seleksi untuk menemukan solusi atas masalah yang telah diprediksi dan ditemukan. Setelah itu, para siswa berdiskusi dengan yang kelompok lain melalui blog wordpress yang dapat diakses dan dikonsultasikan oleh kelompok lain selama pembelajaran. Mempelajari POE2WE secara kreatif menggunakan blog wordpress dapat memungkinkan partisipasi siswa secara maksimum di kelas. Maka, perlunya siswa untuk siap menerima berbagai inovasi.",cq5ds,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/cq5ds/contributors/?format=json,Registration following analysis of the data,"['Inovasi Pembelajaran', 'POE2WE', 'Wordpress blog']",5xdgn

The Relationship Between Uncinate Fasciculus Integrity and Daily Emotional Experiences,"The Uncinate Fasciculus (UF) is a white matter tract in the brain that connects the amygdala, which is involved in initial processing of emotional material, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which plays a role in emotion regulation. Given its anatomical location and findings that depression is linked to less UF structural integrity (de Kwaasteniet et al., 2013; Taylor, MacFall, Gerig, &amp; Krishnan, 2007;  Zhang et al., 2012), the UF has been implicated in emotional stability. UF integrity has also been linked to how quickly people respond to emotional provocation in the laboratory (Pedersen et al., 2020), where greater UF integrity was related to quicker recovery after viewing negative images as measured via facial EMG. The present project will examine how UF integrity relates to emotion experienced outside of the laboratory in daily life.

One reason to explain the limited effectiveness of current suicide policies may be that we still understand little about the reasons that stop people from killing themselves. Therefore, in contrast to classical bottom-up approaches that seek to determine the factors that may lead to, and contribute to, suicidality, we intend to investigate the reasons that Reddit users have for not engaging in suicidal behaviours.

Human visual perception is not a mere photography of physical stimuli, but rather undergoes several alterations, as demonstrated by visual illusions. Since perception has been shown as a form of unconscious inference where our experience can influence what we perceive, an open question in the research on perceptual inference is whether and how we employ it when we interact with other social agents. From this basis, this experiment aims to understand whether the belief of interacting with a partner affects the inference of our prior experience on perception of space given by the perceptual mechanism of the Central Tendency Effect.",6mutk,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6mutk/contributors/?format=json,,[],kmuc8

The Two Dimensions of Social Inclusion: Testing Optimal Distinctiveness Theory in Six Experiments,"Brewer’s (1991) Optimal Distinctiveness Theory (ODT) suggests a two-dimensional model of inclusion (See Figure 1). She argues that for an individual to identify with a group, the individual does not only need to assimilate with the group members, but simultaneously satisfy differentiation needs. In this set of six studies, we test this assumption by comparing how the four cells of ODT predict identification with superordinate and in-group (i.e., subgroup, subordinate) identities and well-being. These mediations have been suggested by the Rejection-Identification Model (RIM; Branscombe, Schmitt, &amp; Harvey, 1999), the Rejection-Disidentification Model (Jasinskaja-Lahti, Liebkind, &amp; Solheim, 2009), and the Inclusion-Identification Model (IIM; Adams et al., in prep.). Note that we do not test these mediations in the six students pre-registered here. We only compare how the conditions affect identities and well-being, respectively. Mediation will be assessed in follow-up projects.",s84h5,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s84h5/contributors/?format=json,,[],75uja

Individual trajectories of psychological symptoms and resilience outcomes in children exposed to traumatic events in humanitarian settings in low- and middle-income countries,"There are few longitudinal investigations that have explored the natural course of psychological symptoms over time and the effect of the exposure to multiple types of trauma in children exposed to war/conflict and not receiving psychosocial interventions. An important opportunity to understand the longitudinal trajectories of mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of conflict-affected children concerns the analysis of control groups in intervention studies. In this study, we aim to take advantage of a series of four cluster randomized trials with identical design that focused on a classroom-based intervention with conflict-affected children in Burundi, Indonesia, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. In the present project we aim to analyze: 1) the different directions that children responses to conflict-related events may take in terms of psychological symptoms and resilience outcomes over time; 2) the impact of the number of types of traumatic events on psychological symptoms and resilience outcomes over time.

Two racial groups, Asians and Blacks, will be used to assess this relationship. Generalized racial essentialism is comprised of two subtypes detailed in the following pages: essentialist entitativity and essentialist naturalness. Dehumanization is the denial of someone’s humanity. The objective of the study is to determine if the punishment applied to Asians and Blacks is contingent upon how others conceptualize social groups, particularly if they believe those groups are cohesive and naturally occurring. Additionally, the study will explore if believing those groups possess a nonhuman nature is important in determining how to punish a group member for an offense.

Expectation and Experience: What do meat eaters think about the taste of a plant-based burger?,"The demand for animal protein is becoming more concerning due to its adverse effects on health, environment and animal welfare.  The majority of people in the UK are categorised as ‘high meat consumers’, suggesting dietary Green House Gas (GHG) emission is one of the big contributors of climate change (Scarborough et al., 2014). Therefore, many food scientists are putting effort to develop strategies to encourage consumers to have a plant-based diet (Smil, 2002). However, a change in eating habits can be challenging and met with resistance. This study aims to understand i) how meat eaters perceive plant-based foods, ii) what their expectations are of these sources and iii) how much their expectancy and experience is consistent in tasting a plant-based burger. To investigate these aims, we will recruit 72 participants from community members and students (UoB) and 48 participants will be meat eaters and 24 participants will be vegans and vegetarians. They will be randomly allocated into three conditions. Conditions will have the same food (plant-based burger) with different neutral descriptions. In condition 1, the burger will be labelled as ‘plant-based burger’ and meat eaters will be in this condition. In the second condition the burger will be presented as a ‘meat burger’ to the other 24 meat eaters. In the third condition, there will be no manipulation and vegans and vegetarians will be offered a plant-based burger labelled as ‘plant-based burger’.  Appetite ratings (liking, fullness and satisfaction) will be measured twice (expected and after eating) by using a standard 100mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).  There will a digital hand dynamometer as an additional measure to understand how eating affects acute strength. We predicted that participants in plant-based condition will report less enjoyment and less satisfaction compared to participants in meat burger condition. In addition, in plant-based burger condition, there will be a significant difference in expected liking and experienced (during eating) liking. Overall, this study will help researchers to develop new interventions to encourage consumers to eat more plant-based foods to reduce dietary GHG emission.",ag4ke,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ag4ke/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,"['Meat eaters vs. vegans and vegetarians', 'NBU', 'Plant-based burger', 'Pleasantness', 'University of Bristol']",cbvrm

Milestones in the transition from non-oral feeding to oral feeding in preterm infants: a scoping review.,"The crucial aim of scoping review is the identification of the steps that the premature infants experience during the development of swallowing skills, going from non-oral feeding until reaching full oral feeding. 

The project has a general and broad purpose because of the area chosen. It is well recognized that premature infants could have difficulties initiating oral feeding. However, the weight of this challenge, as well as the steps that the premature babies pass by, going through nonoral feeding or disorganized feeding to complete oral feeding, are not fully understood.
 
For the reasons above mentioned, the following research question was identified: 
How does the literature describe the developmental trajectory of feeding, eating, drinking, and swallowing skills for preterm infants who show signs of an abnormal swallow, as they progress from non-oral feeding to oral feeding?

Accordingly, the first project aim summarized how the different types of research in the literature describe the swallowing development in premature babies. This objective focused on the procedure that clinicians utilized in their recommendation of feeding difficulties. In addition, attention was given to the outcome measures as well as the description used to define the swallowing function. 

The subsequent aim was the identification of the main steps which the premature population follow from the non-oral feeding until they complete oral feeding. Accordingly, the expectation was to define a clearer image of all the milestones that the premature population could pass through during the swallowing maturation. 

In conclusion, the expectation is to describe the swallowing development phases of the studied population. By examining the pathway that premature infants go over the first period of life, the chance of a positive impact on clinicians' awareness of it is auspicial. Likewise, a deeper understanding of procedures and practice for the description steps could serve at the clinicians as a practice guide for assessment and intervention readiness.",mzq2h,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mzq2h/contributors/?format=json,,"['mileston', 'oral feeding', 'premature babies', 'premature infant']",f7p8j

Review of school psychology articles: A snapshot of school psychology research in the last three years,"The purpose of this research is to better understand the types and focus of research published during the past five years. Bliss et al. (2005) found that, despite the applied focus of school psychology, very few experimental studies were conducted in generalist school psychology journals. Additionally, Bliss and colleagues found that few published papers in their five year window had female scientists as first-authors. This study replicates Bliss et al (2005), reviews the past 5 years (2015-2019) to detect recent trends, and extends past research by investigating whether school psychological research has adopted open science practices. We adopt strategies developed by Price et al (2011). This project is largely descriptive/exploratory.

In this project, we developed a new scale for measuring three proposed drivers of participation in collective action to address VAW in the context of urban informal settlements in Mumbai, India: perceived legitimacy, perceived efficacy, and collective action norms. Using a household survey of over 2,500 men and women, we examined its item, construct, and criterion validity. A valid scale would provide useful insight into modifiable beliefs and attitudes that community mobilisation interventions can address to inspire activism in low-resource contexts.",4sf3b,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4sf3b/contributors/?format=json,,[],p52sc

Sleep-Impulsivity-Behaviour Project,"Self-injurious behaviour, such as biting, scratching and head banging, occurs at very high rates in children with autism and intellectual disability (ID). As many as 1 in 2 children with autism and ID will self-injure, and in most cases these behaviours persist beyond childhood. Unfortunately, self-injurious behaviour is a primary cause of family stress, and often leads to placement breakdown resulting in children requiring specialist residential placements away from the family home. The Sleep-Impulsivity-Behaviour (SIB) Study investigates two potential causes or drivers of self-injurious behaviour. First, we examine a fundamental brain-based capacity. Our work suggests that children who self-injure have problems stopping and starting their own behaviour; this brain-based capacity is called inhibition. Second, we investigate whether poor sleep makes self-injurious behaviour more likely. We are particularly interested in whether specific sleep difficulties, for example problems with falling asleep, problems with staying asleep, or problems with sleeping at the wrong time in a 24-hour cycle, lead to more frequent and more severe self-injury. To complete the SIB Study, we will bring together these two strands of work. In children without autism and ID, sleep is also known to influence inhibition. Therefore, we think that inhibition may explain part of the relationship between poor sleep and self-injurious behaviour. We will test this idea by running a plan to improve children’s sleep. We will measure inhibition and self-injurious behaviour to see if improvements in inhibition explain some of the changes in self-injury. Together, all three of these pieces of work will show whether poor inhibition and poor sleep cause self-injurious behaviour in children with autism and ID. Positive findings will inform interventions for self-injurious behaviour, with sleep and inhibition as new, preventative intervention targets.",k5qpx,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/k5qpx/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,"['Autism', 'Behaviour', 'Executive Function', 'Impulsivity', 'Inhibition', 'Intellectual Disability', 'Self-harm', 'Self-Injurious Behaviour', 'Self-Injury', 'Sleep']",gfbve

The Perception of Cognitive Triad According to Attachment Styles with Pets and Parents,"Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) is a supportive approach to the improvement of mental health using the healing side of the interaction between humans and animals in the treatment of individuals with chronic disorders that cause a negative impact on their quality of life. As a result of the cooperation of the multidisciplinary team, important developments can be achieved on the psychological, emotional, social and physical well-being of the patients. In Turkey, in the absence of this special method of therapy it is not applied itself as a science-based technical expertise; however, it is included as a short-term application in the well-structured intervention processes of patients. For this reason, it is thought that the number of studies which can offer theoretical support to AAT should be increased. The purpose of this study is to examine how attachment styles to pets and parents are reflected in the cognitive triad for individuals through various variables. In this context, the historical development of AAT, its contributions to the field and its limitations in practice will be discussed in the light of the relevant literature; how independent variables are determinate and differentiated in predicting cognitive triad. In this context the historical development of this specific therapy method, its contributions and limitations will be discussed.",bvaq4,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bvaq4/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to accessing the data,"['Animal Assisted Therapy', 'Attachment Styles', 'Cognitive Triad']",n7a29

"Relationship risk regulation, brand choice, and happiness","This is a collaboration between Peter Caprariello, Danielle Brick, and Isabelle Oakland. The idea began as Isabelle Oakland's senior honors thesis at Stony Brook University, developed in the fall of 2018. At the time of this writing, three studies have been conducted, and selected results from these three studies have been presented at Stony Brook's Undergraduate Research Symposium (URECA; spring 2019) and have been submitted to the Society for Consumer Psychology's (SCP) 2020 conference as a poster. 

In these three studies we found evidence that relationship-specific power changes the associations of different self-relevant brands with life satisfaction. We distinguished aspirational brands (reflecting a person’s ideal-self) from expressive brands (reflecting a person’s present-self) and found that thinking about aspirational brands is better for high-relationship-power consumers whereas thinking about expressive brands is better for low-relationship-power consumers. The effect disappears when perceived partner judgments are removed. We interpreted these findings using risk-regulation models of relationship security, in which insecurity (e.g., low relationship-power) is associated with need for partner approval when considering relationship-external growth or expansion.

We have chosen to pre-register our hypotheses and intended procedures for a fourth study. The goal of the fourth study is to replicate the basic idea, but removing some internal weaknesses and old ideas that we no longer endorse.

An anticommons game with uncertainty and accountability,"Previous research has shown that people tend to be less cooperative in an anticommons dilemma than in a commons dilemma. However, whereas a lot is known about commons dilemmas, very little is known about the factors that influence decisions in anticommons dilemmas. In the present research, we investigate – in a 3-person anticommons game - how uncertainty about the price a buyer is willing to pay for a set of valuable goods (WTP) influence the prices that sellers are willing to accept for them (WTA). To investigate this, we will use an experimental anticommons paradigm developed by Glockner et al.(2015), and manipulate uncertainty in 3 levels (no vs. low vs. high uncertainty). The expectation is that sellers will demand more money for their good if uncertainty is high (see De Kwaadsteniet et al., 2006). Additionally, we will investigate whether accountability (i.e., having to justify one’s decisions to the other group members) might counter this effect of uncertainty, making group members become more cooperative under accountability.",pf5xk,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/pf5xk/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,[],gex5j

Do age differences in 1/f noise affect age-related slowing of resting EEG alpha?,"Age related changes in neural oscillations, such as a slowing of frequency and a decrease in power, have been well established in previous research. However, neural “noise” has also been shown to change with age. This noise is considered an aperiodic component of the neural signal and has been shown to affect periodic components of the signal (i.e. oscillations), making it physiologically meaningful. Further, the 1/f component of the aperiodic signal has been found to represent the decoupling of population spiking activity from oscillatory synchronization. This desynchronization leads to a flatter 1/f slope which could help explain a decrease in cognitive function with age. In this study, we investigate how the role of the 1/f component of the aperiodic signal changes with age.",njzsf,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to analysis of the data,[],7gext
Another’s Pain in my Social Brain: The Effects of Placebo (Empathy) Analgesia on Social Behavior,"The shared representations account of empathy suggests that sharing other people’s emotions relies on neural processes similar to those engaged when experiencing such emotions oneself.

However, what has not been investigated yet, but is of much greater relevance, is whether the effects of placebo analgesia transfer to actual behavior. In other words, it is still not clear if the reduced empathic abilities, induced with placebo analgesia, have an influence on moral social behavior, that we show towards other, e.g. helping someone in need. With this project we therefore want to investigate in greater detail, to what extent placebo analgesia shows an effect on prosocial behavior.

Separating conceptual priming from perceptual priming and stimulus-response learning,"It is likely that both component processes and stimulus-response (S-R) learning contribute to priming and repetition suppression (RS). However, questions concerning S-R learning remain and we aim to distinguish the neural correlates of perceptual and conceptual components of priming, and S-R learning in the current investigation. The first purpose is to separate conceptual priming from perceptual priming and S-R learning. We will test if any region shows RS in a condition without perceptual overlap and without facilitation by S-R binding. Second, we will compare the amount of priming and RS in “orthogonal” approach with “changing referent” approach. We aim to answer whether two orthogonal conceptual tasks that access different semantic information can still cause conceptual priming and RS. Finally, we aim to replicate the findings that showed perceptual RS in the right fusiform gyrus (FG) and S-R learning in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG).

Psychosocial disparities as mediators of increased risky sexual behaviour in sexual minorities: A twin approach,"Non-heterosexual individuals (i.e. those who identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual) report higher rates of mental health problems such as depression, suicidality, anxiety and substance use problems as well as social problems such as childhood adversity and intimate partner violence. These psychosocial difficulties have in turn been shown to be associated with increased risky sexual behaviour and risk for HIV infection in the general population and among non-heterosexual men. 
There is evidence that shared genetic and environmental factors respectively influence the association between mental health problems and sexual orientation, and risky sexual behaviour. The aetiology of the relationship between sexual orientation and disparities in psychosocial risk and risky sexual behaviour is not yet well understood. 
We recently demonstrated that increased mental health problems partly explained increased risky sexual behaviour among non-heterosexual individuals and that this mediation relationship was not confounded by shared aetiological influences. However, measures of social disparity were not included and the assessment of risky sexual behaviour was mostly based on the number of sexual partners. It will be informative to test this genetic model in a different sample incorporating better psychosocial variables and a broader index of risky sexual behaviour.",bdfxz,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/bdfxz/contributors/?format=json,,[],hxmp8

(Re)Building Trust. Investigating the effects of open science badges  on perceived trustworthiness in journal articles.,"The Replication Crisis diminishes trust in empirical sciences and with it the perceived value of science (Lupia, 2018). Open Science Practices (i.a. open data, open analysis script, open materials) are an increasingly popular approach to deal with challenges in replication and to rebuilt trust (Geukes, Schönbrodt, Utesch, Geukes, &amp; Back, 2016). First investigations could, however, deliver no evidence toward the effects of Open Science Practices (OSP) on trustworthiness (Wingen, Berkessel, &amp; Englich, 2019). The study investigated the effect on a discipline level (psychology) with an abstract description of OSP. Within the ongoing discussion about incentives for OSP (e.g. badges), we want to shift the focus from discipline level to concrete individual journal articles and consider epistemic beliefs of readers to play a moderating role (Merk &amp; Rosman, 2018): Will visible OSP (vs. not visible vs. visibly non-OSP) foster perceived trustworthiness when reading journal articles of empirical studies? Will multiplistic epistemic beliefs moderate the relationship between OSP and trustworthiness?

The design will include three conditions: visible Open Science Practices (visOSP), Practices not visible (nonvis) and visible non-Open Science Practices (nonOSP). Two of the conditions are randomized within person. Realizing all three conditions within person would highlight the variation between conditions as too obvious and thus undermine blinding of subjects.
visOSP condition: Subjects receive a title page of an empirical study (Title, Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, ...) together with three Open Science badges. The badges are explained using hints in style of speech bubbles and indicate that the authors engaged in the OSP open data, open analysis script and open materials.
nonvis condition: Subjects receive a title page of an empirical study (Title, Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, ...) with no further information on Open Science, reflecting a ""standard"" journal article.
nonOSP condition: Subjects receive a title page of an empirical study (Title, Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, ...) together with three Open Science badges. The badges are explained using hints in style of speech bubbles and indicate that the authors did not engage in the OSP open data, open analysis script and open materials. As participants are exposed to more than one condition, we create all three conditions for three different empirical studies (topics). This way we avoid participants to see one study topic twice under different conditions, which would undermine the blinding.
Measured variables are perceives trustworthiness: We apply the Muenster Epistemic Trustworthiness Inventory (Hendriks, Kienhues, &amp; Bromme, 2015) with all three subscales. However, as dependent variable we will only employ the subscale integrity. The other two subscales are used for further exploratory analyses. Topic-specific multiplism: We apply the subscale of topic specific multiplism from Merk et al. (2017) Topic-specific consistency: We apply the three item-measure from Merk et al. (2017), Treatment check: We test the perceived openness/ transparency of the empirical study. Additional small set of demographic variables will be assessed.",ybs7f,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ybs7f/contributors/?format=json,,"['MetaSciLog', 'Open Science Badges', 'Trustworthiness']",vgbrs

Responsible Product Design and Other Interventions to Mitigate Excessive Gambling: A Scoping Review,"Researchers and others have developed a number of game-based responsible gambling tools and interventions (i.e., mechanisms that directly and specifically engage with standard gambling game processes and progress to support responsible gambling) that are intended to mitigate risks for excessive gambling. The taxonomy of such tools is unclear, as is their associated strength of evidence. Such information is necessary to identify appropriate developmental and evaluative next steps for advancing comprehensive gambling safety efforts. Consequently, we plan to conduct a scoping review of the literature associated with game-based responsible gambling tools and interventions. We will search several electronic databases and chart included studies on a number of characteristics. We will construe “gambling” broadly, to encompass the full spectrum of gambling behavior (i.e., from gambling participation to clinically diagnosable Gambling Disorder). This scoping review will identify any potential gaps in knowledge and suggest key areas of research needed to advance gambling-related product safety tools and practices.",7dze4,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7dze4/contributors/?format=json,,[],m3nju

A meta-analytic database of randomised trials on psychotherapies for depression,"Background. The number of trials on psychotherapies for adult depression is very large and is quickly growing. Because of this large body of knowledge, it is important that the results of these studies are summarized and integrated in meta-analytic studies. More than a decade ago we developed a meta-analytic database of these trials, which was updated yearly through systematic literature searches. Recently, we developed a new version of this meta-analytic database, built on the systems and experience from our earlier database, but with completely new searches and improved methods. In this paper we will describe the methods and some first results of this database.
Description. We conducted systematic literature searches in bibliographical databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials to identify all trials on psychotherapy for adult depression (deadline January 1st, 2019). We excluded trials on maintenance and relapse prevention, dissertations, collaborative care, and studies not published in English, German, Spanish or Dutch. After reading 21,976 records (16,701 after exclusion of duplicates), we included 661 randomized trials. We distinguished the following categories of trials: Psychotherapy versus pharmacotherapy (65 studies), combined treatment versus pharmacotherapy alone (46), combined treatment versus psychotherapy alone (29), combined treatment versus psychotherapy plus placebo (18), psychotherapy versus control (335), psychotherapy versus another therapy (109), psychotherapy for inpatients (34), unguided self-help interventions (48), comparisons of different treatment formats (38), cognitive bias modification (14) and other comparisons (99). 
Over the years we have published several dozens of meta-analyses using this databases (including its previous versions).
Conclusion. Psychotherapy for depression is definitely the best studied type of psychotherapy for any mental health problem. We hope that our database can be used as a resource for researchers who want to conduct systematic reviews and meta-analyses of subgroups of these studies.

prereg,"Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are highly prevalent and debilitating, and standard treatment rates are poor. Cognitive biases, such as difficulty in ignoring cues in the environment that signal the availability of alcohol, have been shown to contribute to relapse in AUD. In recent years, cognitive bias modification (CBM) protocols have been developed in order to re-train and reduce these cognitive biases towards alcohol. These protocols involve simple computer tasks where participants are repeatedly trained to turn their attention (or responding) away from alcohol and towards non-alcohol related drinks. A number of studies have demonstrated that offering CBM alongside treatment as usual (approximately 4-6 sessions over the course of two weeks) can reduce the rate of relapse one year later, relative to patients in an active control group. Although promising, the effect sizes are small and there is scope to improve the current CBM protocols. 

The innovation of the current project is to modify current CBM protocols by introducing a financial incentive to perform well on the CBM tasks. This financial incentive provides an additional motivational route to control attention and inhibit responding directed towards alcohol. In this treatment context, harmful alcohol usage could potentially be reduced even further. To this end a pilot study will be conducted among alcohol-dependent outpatients to compare the preliminary efficacy of revised protocols for CBM in reducing rate of relapse, compared to an active control.  In addition, all treatment providers will be interviewed in regards to implementation issues and future strategies that could improve delivery of CBM in the clinical context.

This project involves an active network of researchers and clinical-facing experts, paving the way for future projects than can improve treatment outcomes for adults living with mental health issues (including AUD). This study protocol pertains to inpatients recruited from Jarrah House in the first instance (with the potential addition of other sites) and is closely related to an existing protocol for a parallel study with outpatients. This project is well-supported by collaborative partners (clinical and research experts both national and international) and has the potential to deliver significant health outcomes and opportunities for future development and roll-out.

The Affiliative Consequences of Same-Race and Cross-Race Mimicry,"Posted are the experimental materials and data for the paper ""The Affiliative Consequences of Same-Race and Cross-Race Mimicry"" (Journal of Social Psychology) with the following abstract: Few studies have replicated and extended the classic mimicry to liking effect. The present research sought to (a) replicate the affiliative consequences of mimicry; (b) test whether the affiliative consequences hold in a context where mimicry may not be normative (i.e., cross-race interactions); and (c) investigate how excluded individuals respond to same- versus cross-race mimicry and non-mimicry. Participants wrote about a control topic or social exclusion and then engaged in a brief laboratory interaction in which they were mimicked or not mimicked by a confederate who was either same-race or cross-race. Then they reported how much they liked the confederate. Within the control condition, the effect of mimicry on affiliation depended on the race of the confederate—but this pattern did not emerge for excluded individuals. The study was unable to conclusively replicate and extend previous findings. The authors make recommendations to promote a more cumulative science of behavioral mimicry.

Mistakes were made: Episodic retrieval of erroneous responses,"In this study we investigated processes of stimulus-response binding and retrieval for erroneous responses. Are mistakes stored and retrieved from memory, like correct responses, leading to a perpetuation of erroneous behavior? Or do people take into account that an error was made, storing and retrieving only correct or corrected responses? Two experiments were designed to assess SR binding and retrieval effects in a sequential prime/probe design using a colour classification task, with an orthogonal variation of response relation (colour repetition vs. change) and stimulus relation (word repetition vs. change). Experiment 1 (n=83) measured SR binding and retrieval for errors that occurred under time pressure (chance errors), while Experiment 2 (n=81) required participants to deliberately respond erroneously (instructed errors) in some of the trials. We found standard SR binding effects following accurate responses in the prime in both experiments. However, no significant SR binding effects were obtained in trials following erroneous prime responses, indicating either that errors are not bound and/or retrieved from memory, or that retrieval of both erroneous and corrected responses might have neutralized each other.",y23et,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/y23et/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,[],zynqh

"An examination of the effects of a patient-designed-and-informed participant information sheet in comparison with a standard, researcher-designed information sheet on recruitment, retention and understanding: Protocol for a study-within-a-trial","Ireland - Background: This protocol describes a double-blind, randomised non-inferiority study-within-a-trial (SWAT), comparing the effects of a patient-designed-and-informed participant information sheet with a standard, researcher-designed participant information sheet on recruitment, retention, decision certainty, participant information sheet understanding and likeability. The SWAT is part of a larger trial that aims to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a cognitive occupation-based programme for people with MS (COB-MS) on cognitive and daily functioning for people with multiple sclerosis.  Methods: One-hundred and twenty people with multiple sclerosis will be randomly allocated to one of the two groups, where they will either receive a standard Participant Information Sheet or a patient-designed Participant Information Sheet. Recruitment and retention will be analysed, as well as decision certainty, likability and understanding.  Discussion: Results will provide recommendations for recruitment, consent and retention for future trials, as well as shed some light on the factors influencing the understanding and likeability of a trial’s participant information sheet. Recommendations will also be made regarding patient and public involvement in developing and/or aiding the development of participant information sheets.

The Psychophysics of ON- Versus OFF- Pattern Recognition and Myopia,"the prevalence of myopia was around 10%, but today nearly 90% of young adults are
afflicted [1]. In the United States and Europe, the prevalence has doubled over the last
half-century with half of young adults now having myopia[1]. The consequence of myopia
extends beyond the inconvenience of using optical correction. Myopia is associated with
increased incidence of diseases such as retinal damage, cataract, and glaucoma [1]. Increased
levels of near-work have commonly been associated with the onset of myopia [2]. It is therefore
important to gain a better understanding of what is happening from a functional and anatomical
standpoint when subjects complete near-work tasks.
There are two different types of text, texts that have positive contrast (white text on a
darker background) and texts that have negative contrast (black text on a lighter background).
Aleman et. al (2018) found that negative contrast texts produced a thinning effect on the choroid
(-16.13土4.54 μm), and positive contrast produced a thickening effect on the choroid(9.96土
6.51μm) [3]. Aleman et. al interpreted these results in the context of ON and OFF pathways in
the visual system [4]. They suggested negative contrast texts stimulate the OFF pathway, while
positive contrast texts stimulate the ON pathway. Choroidal thickening and thinning in both
chicks and marmosets has been observed to be a precursor to a decrease or an increase in axial
growth respectively [5, 6, 7]. The latter leading to the development of myopia. Trolio et. al
documented 20 μm of choroidal thinning in myopia induced marmoset eyes and 12 μm of
thickening in eyes induced with hyperopia [5]. It is hypothesized that the choroid either acts as a
mechanical buffer or a diffusion barrier for the sclera [5].
Qualitatively, Aleman et al’s data showed the thinning effect was more pronounced in
myopic individuals as compared to their emmetropic counterparts [3], but their sample size was
insufficient to draw quantitative conclusions. The plasticity of the human choroid is an important
link to animal models. For example, Read et. al found that among a group of 39 myopic
individuals subfoveal choroidal thickness was 50 μm thinner than nonmyopic age-matched
children [8].
Retinal Ganglion Cells are organized in an ON center OFF surround arrangement or vice
versa [2]. ON cells become depolarized to an increment in light, while OFF depolarize in
response to decrements in light. OFF retinal ganglion cells are twice as numerous and half the
size of ON rental ganglion cells in the fovea. Several studies such as Mazade et. al, Lu et. al, and
Tyler et. al corroborated the different spatial tuning and cortical connectivity of the ON and OFF
pathway [9, 10, 11]. Mazade et al showed maximal cortical responses for small fast stimuli in the
OFF pathway and maximal cortical responses for slow slow global stimuli in the ON pathway
[10]. Zhong-Lin et. al found negative stimuli (or decrements in light) to be 25% more effective
than equal magnitude positive stimuli (or increments in light) across eleven different types of
stimuli [11]. Taken together, these studies support a distinct roles for the ON and OFF pathways
in the visual system.
The goal of our study is threefold. We aim to replicate the changes in choroidal thickness
in response to negative and positive contrast with a larger subject group. We aim to measure the
sensitivity to positive and negative contrast tasks and compare the ratio of contrast sensitivity to
these two contrast types among refractive error/axial length. Finally, we will monitor the changes
in sensitivity to positive and negative contrast as the session proceeds as to understand the
functional implications choroidal thickness changes may have.",4bj72,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4bj72/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to any human observation of the data,[],an3w4

Testing the undoing hypothesis in athletes–A pilot study,"Positive Psychology has gained a respectable amount of research for the past two decades and there are recent efforts to link this research field to sport psychology (Mann &amp; Narula, 2017). Thereby, positive sport psychology could focus on the well-being and positive emotions in the context of sport (Mann &amp; Narula, 2017, p. 153) and close the research gap in sport psychology which has mainly focused on emotional problems, stress, or anxiety (Salama-Younes, 2011, p. 112).
The broaden-and-build theory (Fredrickson, 1998, 2001) states that positive emotions “broaden people’s awareness in ways that, over time and with frequent recurrence, build consequential personal resources that contribute to their overall emotional and physical well-being” (Fredrickson &amp; Joiner, 2018, p. 194). Part of the theory is the undoing hypothesis which describes positive emotions to act in service of homeostasis (Fredrickson &amp; Levenson, 1998, p. 193). In detail, after a stressor, positive emotions are assumed to lead to a faster cardiovascular recovery which eventually is presumed to lead to better cardiovascular health. Research focusing on the undoing hypothesis so far applied hardly comparable designs due to the use of different stressors (e.g., active vs. passive), different positive emotion inductions (e.g., film, articles, cartoons, sound) and different cardiovascular outcome measurements (e.g., heart rate, heart rate variability, skin conductance, pulse transmission time; see review of 24 studies by Cavanagh &amp; Larkin, 2018). Regardless of those different designs, none of the studies has focused on athletes so far.
However, the undoing hypothesis might be fruitful especially for this population. Athletes are not only under a lot of pressure and experience psychophysiological stress prior to competition (Ehrlenspiel, Graf, Kühn, &amp; Brand, 2011), they (in some sports) have several competitions on one day. As psychophysiological stress is known to impact (sports) performance (see e.g., review by Rumbold, Fletcher, &amp; Daniels, 2012; Salvador &amp; Costa, 2009), it appears relevant to quickly recover from the first stressor (i.e., first competition) in order to be ready for the second stressor (i.e., second competition). Thus, it could for example be beneficial for athletes to be exposed to positive emotion inductions between competitions within one day. 
The previous research focusing on the undoing hypothesis might however, not be applicable for athletes as they differ with respect to psychophysiological stress responses in comparison to the previously studied populations. Athletes have shown to exhibit lower levels of cortisol (i.e., stress hormone), heart rate and state anxiety responses due to a psychosocial laboratory stressor (i.e., Trier Social Stress Test, TSST; see Rimmele et al., 2009). It is unclear whether this might also be true with respect to recovery from stress. Therefore, in a first step, the aim is to investigate the assumed effects of the undoing hypothesis in athletes.

Sex differences in misperceptions of sexual interest can be explained by sociosexual orientation and men projecting their own interest onto women.,"Sex differences in misperceptions of sexual interest have been well documented; however, it is unclear whether this cognitive bias could be explained by other factors. In the current study, 1226 participants (578 men, 630 women) participated in a speed-dating study, where participants rated their sexual interest in each other as well as the sexual interest they perceived from their partners. Consistent with previous findings, we found that men tended to overperceive sexual interest from their partners, while women tended to underperceive sexual interest. However, this sex difference becomes negligible when considering potential mediators, such as the raters’ sociosexual orientation, and raters projecting their own levels of sexual interest onto their partners. These findings challenge the popular notion that sex differences in misperceptions in sexual interest have evolved as a specialised adaptation due to different selection pressures in men and women.",u27db,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/u27db/contributors/?format=json,,[],je4h7

Will Dolphins Save the World? Russian Conversations about the Sacralization of the Beautiful,"In the monograph, through the method of ethical questioning, a special place of open scientific thinking in the development of national culture is revealed. On the one hand, culture is conceived as a determinant of personal self-determination, which forms a person as an elementary unit and measure of a value system, on the other hand, it is an object of theoretical reflection, a complex systematic phenomenon causing social changes and the course of history. The book is written for students of social and humanitarian disciplines, scientists, philosophers and educators.
В монографии посредством этического вопрошания раскрывается особое место открытого научного мышления в становлении отечественной культуры. С одной стороны, культура мыслится в качестве детерминанты личностного самоопределения, формирующей личность как элементарную единицу и мерило ценностной системы, с другой — является объектом теоретической рефлексии, сложным системным феноменом, обуславливающим социальные изменения и ход истории. Книга адресована студентам социальных и гуманитарных дисциплин, ученым, философам и педагогам.

Person-Role Fit and Self-Esteem in Parents,"Research has shown that the transition to parenthood is associated with changes in new parents’ self-esteem. The degree an individual’s personality fits to the demands associated with the parent role may help explain individual differences in self-esteem during the transition to parenthood. This preregistered study examines the association between personality-role fit and self-esteem in 241 first-time parents. Specifically, we examined the extent to which alignment between parents’ Big Five personality traits and their beliefs about a prototypical parent’s personality predicts levels of self-esteem while entering the parent role. We first evaluated consensus in couples’ ratings of a prototypical parent’s personality. We then used response surface analysis to test whether the correspondence between self-rated and prototypical parent personality traits predicted parent’s self-esteem assessed before and after the transition to parenthood. Discussion focuses on the relevance of person-environment fit during major life transitions.",wfj9m,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wfj9m/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to analysis of the data,[],nh5s8

Somatosensory aspects of mandibular motor control in adults who do and do not stutter,"A broad range of physiological and behavioral research has demonstrated that people who stutter (PWS) have deficits in the ability to process auditory feedback and utilize it in the regulation of speech motor control. Atypical features of central neurophysiology include diminished grey matter development and integrity of white matter tracts between key auditory processing and premotor areas involved in speech planning and production (Beal 2015; Kell et al. 2009; Chang et al. 2008; Watkins et al. 2008; Chang et al. 2018; Neef et al. 2015). Characteristic modulation of auditory cortical activity immediately prior to speech production is also absent in PWS (Daliri &amp; Max 2015a, 2015b; Daliri &amp; Max 2018), which may reflect inefficient priming of sensory cortices necessary to detect unexpected feedback errors in the upcoming utterance (Eliades &amp; Wang 2008; Eliades &amp; Tsunada 2018). Indeed, there is a wide range of evidence showing that PWS have reduced adaptive speech responses to predictable auditory feedback perturbations (Daliri et al. 2018 [adults only]; Daliri &amp; Max 2018), as well as diminished online responses to unexpected single-trial perturbations (Cai et al. 2012; Loucks et al. 2012). Thus, the dysregulated cortical network connectivity in PWS appears to manifest as a specific deficit in auditory feedback processing for the regulation of ongoing speech motor control.
Conversely, less is known about the ability of PWS to process somatosensory feedback in the regulation of orofacial movement control. In people who do not stutter (PWNS), the role of somatosensation has been demonstrated through jaw and orofacial kinematic responses to both predictable (Nasir &amp; Ostry 2006; Tremblay et al. 2003; 2008; Lametti et al. 2012; Feng et al. 2011) and unexpected online (Abbs &amp; Gracco 1984, Folins &amp; Abbs 1975; Tiede et al. 2006) physical perturbations to the articulators during speech and non-speech movements. However, the profile of these responses in PWS is unknown. Clearly there are structural abnormalities in the neural connections between auditory processing and speech motor cortical areas in PWS, but there are also specific abnormalities within (pre-)motor areas which may limit integration of other sensory signals for speech motor control too (for reviews see Neef 2015; Chang 2018). Given that PWS also show atypical movement characteristics during basic non-speech movement control (Daliri, Propenko, Flanagan &amp; Max 2015; Forster &amp; Webster 2001; Max, Caruso &amp; Gracco 2003), it may be that they experience generalized sensory processing difficulties which affect multiple sensory domains and effector systems. Alternatively, it could be that somatic sensorimotor processing is relatively intact for PWS and that stuttering arises from problems specific to auditory-motor integration or a conflict between somatosensory and auditory processing during speech motor control.
As such, this project broadly aims to investigate how PWS differ from neurotypical controls in their ability to integrate somatosensory feedback in the regulation of mandibular speech and non-speech movement control.

Randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate Youth Advocate Programs (YAP): Providing Intensive Mentoring and “Wraparound” Supports for Disengaged Chicago Youth,"This project is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Youth Advocate Programs’ (YAP) community-based intensive mentorship and “wraparound” support program. YAP’s year-long programming helps at-risk youth in Chicago re-engage in school and avoid contact with the criminal justice system. The program pairs youth with a dedicated mentor (“advocate”) who is on call 24/7 to provide mentoring and “wraparound” support services. These services are aimed at helping youth meet basic needs (transportation, clothes, etc.), helping them reconnect with school and succeed in the classroom, and providing motivation and direction toward completing larger goals such as employment or college. Advocates often come from the same neighborhoods as the youth and have confronted many of the same challenges. Advocates develop strong trusting relationships with youth outside of school, helping them address their diverse needs and supporting youth in achieving their long-term goals.

While the YAP program has not yet been evaluated as part of an RCT, components of the program model are backed by promising evidence from prior RCTs. These include: (i) an RCT of Big Brothers Big Sisters (a community-based mentoring program for disadvantaged youth) which found promising reductions in violent behavior and substance use; (ii) an RCT of Becoming a Man (a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy intervention for high-risk young men) which found promising reductions in arrests and arrests for violent crimes; and (iii) an RCT of the Quantum Opportunities Program (an after-school program that offered mentoring services and educational services to low-income youth) which found promising increases in high school graduation.

Under this project, researchers will recruit a sample of approximately 1,300 youth from two Chicago neighborhoods who are at risk for violence involvement or academic disengagement (e.g., youth who are gang-affiliated, on juvenile probation, chronically truant, and/or a victim of, or witness to, traumatic violence). Half of the students will be randomly assigned to be offered YAP services while the other half will not receive an offer of YAP services. The researchers will use administrative data from the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) and the Chicago Police Department (CPD) to measure the effects of YAP on (i) whether youth remain enrolled in, or complete, high school; and (ii) the number of youth arrests for violent offenses. Both outcomes will be assessed over the two years following random assignment.

Female fans of these subgenres buy posters, albums, and shirts with graphic depictions of depraved acts towards their own gender. It is not clear how women in the brutal death metal and slam scenes resolve the conflict between their gender and the seemingly misogynistic depictions of violence in images and lyrics within those subgenres. This research will help us gain insight into this unique cultural environment to see the extent to which misogyny exists within metal extreme metal scenes.",x8qr2,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x8qr2/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to creation of data,[],ve5k9

Reasoning about durations,"Few experiments have examined how people reason about durative relations, e.g., during. Such relations pose challenges to present theories of reasoning, but many researchers argue that people simulate a mental timeline when they think about sequences of events. A recent theory posits that to mentally simulate durative relations, reasoners do not represent all of the time points across which an event might endure. Instead, they construct discrete tokens that stand in place of the beginnings and endings of those events. The theory predicts that when reasoners need to build multiple simulations to solve a reasoning problem, they should be more prone to error. Three experiments tested the theory by providing participants sets of premises describing durative relations; participants judged whether the sets were consistent or inconsistent. The results validated the model theory's prediction. We conclude by situating the results in recent work on the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie temporal thinking.",kgvdf,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/kgvdf/contributors/?format=json,,[],evprc

Understanding the effects of text reminders on reducing churn in supplemental assistance programs,"“Churning” is when eligible transitional benefit program participants fail to renew, temporarily dropping out of their program before reentering within four months. Churn is a widespread issue across transitional benefit programs, negatively impacting participants and administering agencies. This proposed intervention will assess whether a low-cost scalable texting program can reduce churn for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Participants in one treatment group will receive text messages that simplify the interim report and recertification process with reminders, information, and direct links. A second treatment arm will receive reminders only, while a control group will experience the current procedures of the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance. The text messages aim to reduce informational and behavioral barriers program participants face and thus lessen churn. We estimate an overall sample size around 60,000 over the course of three months. We will iterate three times during the project, testing timing of the texts and identifying heterogeneous effects. The primary outcome of interest is churn probability. We will also assess completing process steps on time rates, submitting complete forms or verification rates, interview completion rates (including as-scheduled and post-missed interview), approval and closure rates, and the average number of days that forms are submitted before deadlines.",4hwdx,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/4hwdx/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to accessing the data,[],64v9t

National Survey of Police Officer-Involved Firearms Shootings,"NORC at the University of Chicago and the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) will conduct a national organizational survey of law enforcement agencies (LEAs) to estimate the agency aggregated numbers of the past 10 years of police officer-involved shootings—including both officers shooting at civilians and officers being shot or shot at—and demographic, situational, agency, and community factors associated with these shootings. This is one of the first national studies to assess the number of officers shooting civilians and officers being shot at in the same dataset, and to measure important correlates of these shootings using advanced analytical methods. This study addresses two important gaps: First, we do not have reliable nationally representative data to estimate the number of police officers shootings of civilians, the number of police officers being shot at, and the overlap between the two. Second, there is little research on how LEA characteristics, structure, resources, culture, policies and training are related to officer-involved shootings.

Using a stratified sample design developed by NORC and implemented by PERF, we will randomly draw a nationally representative sample of 1,500 LEAs. We will invite the selected LEAs to participate in an online survey. With an estimated 70% response rate, we expect at least 1,000 LEAs will complete the survey. The sample will be weighted to be representative of all state/local LEAs in the U.S., adjusting for non-response. We will also explore the potential use of existing datasets, including UCR, local gun law and regulation, and census data, for measures of agency and community correlates, and merge it with our national survey data when possible. In addition, we will select 30 agencies to conduct in-depth interviews with command staff to provide additional context for our survey data.

Does order matter? Harmonic priming effects for unscrambled chord sequences,"This study examines whether scrambling the order of chords in a tonal harmonic progression inhibits the speed and accuracy of processing in two behavioral harmonic priming experiments. Sixteen 9-chord sequences were selected from Bach’s chorales that either remain unchanged (thereby reflecting low temporal incoherence), or were scrambled to produce increasingly incoherent sequences (i.e., medium or high). To produce the scrambled conditions, a variable-order n-gram model (Pearce, 2005) was trained on a corpus of Roman numeral annotations from 100 Bach chorales (Verbeten &amp; Sears, 2019). It then identified the scrambled versions (scrambling chords 2-8) that produced either medium or high estimates of model uncertainty. Sixty participants (30 musicians) indicated as quickly as possible whether the target chord was in or out of tune. In Experiment 1, the target chord was tuned 40 cents sharp relative to the preceding context. In Experiment 2, the optimal level of 'out-of-tuneness' for each participant was selected using an adaptive staircasing procedure in the training phase to ensure task difficulty remained constant across participants.",wxy67,True,False,OSF Preregistration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wxy67/contributors/?format=json,Registration prior to accessing the data,[],6anvs

Bodily Maps of Moral Concerns,"The somatosensory reaction to different social circumstances has been proposed to trigger conscious emotional experiences. Here, we present a pre-registered experiment in which we examine the topographical maps associated with violations of different moral concerns. Specifically, participants (N = 596) were randomly assigned to scenarios of moral violations, and then drew their subjective somatosensory experience on two 48,954-pixel silhouettes. We demonstrate that bodily representations of different moral violations are slightly different. Further, we demonstrate that violations of moral concerns are felt in different parts of the body, and arguably result in different somatosensory experiences for liberals and conservatives. We also investigate how individual differences in moral concerns relate to bodily maps of moral violations. Finally, we use natural language processing to predict activation in body parts based on the semantic representation of textual stimuli. The findings shed light on the complex relationships between moral violations and somatosensory experiences.",svj8c,True,False,Open-Ended Registration,False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/svj8c/contributors/?format=json,,"['emotion', 'feeling', 'Moral Foundations Theory', 'morality', 'natural language processing']",n6shf

Optimal well-being after depression and anxiety in Canada,"We will use data from the Canadian Community Health Survey - Mental Health (CCHS-MH) to explore optimal well-being (OWB) after depression and anxiety in a nationally representative Canadian sample. We will also examine if our OWB criteria selects a different rate of individuals than Keyes (2005) complete mental health criteria. Additionally, we will examine clinical and psychosocial correlates of OWB.  

Research Questions 
(1) What is the prevalence of OWB after depression and anxiety in a Canadian sample?
(2) How does the current study’s definition of OWB (Rottenberg et al., 2018) compare to other definitions of high functioning after psychopathology (e.g., complete mental health; Keyes, 2002; Fuller-Thompson, Agbeyaka, LaFond, &amp; BerKlug, 2016)? 
(3) What are the clinical correlates and predictors of OWB after depression and anxiety?

Does approximate numeracy predict superior decision making beyond objective and subjective numeracy? Registered replication report on Schley and Peters (2014),"Everyday decision making requires dealing with numbers related to potential outcomes and their probabilities. A bulk of research from Judgement and Decision Making field (for a review see: Cokely et al., 2018; Garcia-Retamero, Sobkow, Petrova, Garrido, &amp; Traczyk, 2019) showed that superior decision making is largely driven by individual differences in objective statistical numeracy—an ability to understand statistical and probability information and to use it in everyday contexts. Nevertheless, a few recent studies suggested that an ability to estimate quantities and to map symbolic numbers into mental number line may be an equally important predictor of decision making as objective numeracy. The aim of the present research is to replicate one of the first and most important studies showing this effect (study 2 from Schley &amp; Peters, 2014; Psychological Science; more than 100 citations). In this study, 99 participants completed an adaptive decision task (a series of monetary gambles), enabling estimation of parameters from the Prospect Theory (Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979). Moreover, participants solved a number-line task to measure symbolic-number mapping (Siegler &amp; Opfer, 2003), a set of mathematical tasks measuring objective numeracy (Weller et al., 2013) and answered few questions regarding demography (age, sex, income, education). The results of this study showed that participants with more exact symbolic-number mappings exhibited more linear value functions in a decision task. Moreover, more exact symbolic-number mapping mediated the relationship between objective numeracy and value-function parameters suggesting that this ability may (at least partially) explain the relationship between numeracy and decision making. In our research, we plan to extend this experimental procedure by including the Subjective Numeracy Scale (Fagerlin et al., 2007) as a measure of numeric confidence. This approach would allow us to test the replicability of the relationship between symbolic-number mapping and value function parameters as well as to compare the relative contribution of three types of numeric competencies: objective numeracy, approximate numeracy, and subjective numeracy proposed recently by Peters and Bjalkebring (2015).",57dus,True,False,"Replication Recipe (Brandt et al., 2013): Pre-Registration",False,https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/57dus/contributors/?format=json,,[],tajhd
