Covariates to control for when looking at outcomes measuring willingness to compromise with the outgroup (Palestinians): An index of responses to four statements measuring subjects' level of identification as Jewish, political ideology, and a dichotomous variable for whether or not the subject has been exposed to violence related to the conflict (as measured by responses to three questions).

We will begin by focusing on Israeli perceptions of the motives of Palestinians, intending to expand the scope of the research to Palestinians and other groups after completion of this first experiment. A recent survey we completed in Israel suggests that those who feel that the \"true motives\" (as opposed to the stated motives) of Palestinians who engage in violence are deep-seated Anti-Jewish sentiment--as opposed to more proximate motives like increased human rights, land ownership, and jobs--are much more likely to support increased violence towards Palestinians generally as compared to those who think the Palestinians are motivated by more proximate concerns like those just listed. To test these observational findings, we propose a survey experiment that will randomly assign individuals to news articles presenting research evidence that suggests these differing motives: one article will present evidence that Palestinians are motivated by anti-Jewish concerns, and the other that they are motivated by lack of political, economic and social opportunities. We will also include a placebo article as a control condition. Respondents will then answer a series of questions about support for violence against Palestinians. A companion study in the US will test whether these factors generalize, looking at the effect of perceived motivation for individuals joining/participating in ISIS on support for different counter-terror tactics and foreign policy preferences. As part of this study, respondents will be shown news articles presenting research evidence that suggests different motives for joining/participating in ISIS: one article will present evidence that participants are motivated by a radical anti-Western/anti-Islamic ideology, and the other that they are motivated by lack of political, economic and social opportunities.

Both surveys begin by measuring initial perceptions towards the outgroup and include measures to explore heterogeneous treatment effects (like degree of militarism, etc.). Both then randomly assign participants to one of three conditions: a placebo condition (article about social media), a condition presenting participants with an article in which an expert says the motives of the outgroup are hatred (hatred article), and a condition where they are presented with an article in which the expert claims the motives are lack of political or economic opportunities (lack of opportunity article).

A recent survey we completed in Israel suggests that those who feel that the \"true motives\" (as opposed to the stated motives) of Palestinians who engage in violence are deep-seated Anti-Jewish sentiment--as opposed to more proximate motives like increased human rights, land ownership, and jobs--are much more likely to support increased violence towards Palestinians generally as compared to those who think the Palestinians are motivated by more proximate concerns like those just listed. To test these observational findings, we propose a survey experiment that will randomly assign individuals to news articles presenting research evidence that suggests these differing motives: one article will present evidence that Palestinians are motivated by anti-Jewish concerns, and the other that they are motivated by lack of political, economic and social opportunities. We will also include a placebo article as a control condition. Respondents will then answer a series of questions about support for violence against Palestinians. A companion study in the US will test whether these factors generalize, looking at the effect of perceived motivation for individuals joining/participating in ISIS on support for different counter-terror tactics and foreign policy preferences. As part of this study, respondents will be shown news articles presenting research evidence that suggests different motives for joining/participating in ISIS: one article will present evidence that participants are motivated by a radical anti-Western/anti-Islamic ideology, and the other that they are motivated by lack of political, economic and social opportunities. A third group will be given the same placebo treatment as in the Israel study. Following this, we will gauge support for potential anti-ISIS measures, and more general foreign policy preferences towards the Middle East.", "q16": "The survey experiments in Israel and America are designed to be virtually identical, differing only in question wording to reflect the different contexts, and in the outgroups on which they focus (in the Israel case, it is Palestinians involved in stabbing attacks; in the American case, it is those fighting for ISIS). Both surveys begin by measuring initial perceptions towards the outgroup and include measures to explore heterogeneous treatment effects (like degree of militarism, etc.). Both then randomly assign participants to one of three conditions: a placebo condition (article about social media), a condition presenting participants with an article in which an expert says the motives of the outgroup are hatred (hatred article), and a condition where they are presented with an article in which the expert claims the motives are lack of political or economic opportunities (lack of opportunity article). We will then measure their level of support for violent measures against the outgroup of various types.", "q17": "We will test these hypotheses via a survey experiment in both Israel and the US, examining how manipulating perceptions of terrorist motivation influence support for different policies. Our main research question is how does differential perceptions of motivation (lack of opportunity vs. hatred) influence support for counter-terror policies--and whether ideology, psychological aggression, and terrorism-related stress/exposure moderate this relationship.", "q18": "USA, Israel", "q19": "900 in Israel, 900 in US", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "Canetti (University of Haifa): #199/16 ; Gubler (BYU): FWA with American U. ; Zeitzoff (American U.): #2016-301", "q25": "Canetti (University of Haifa): 1 June 2016 ; Gubler (BYU): 29 June 2016 ; Zeitzoff (American U.): 24 May 2016", "q26": "Other (describe in text box below)", "q27": "Third Party: The Midgam Project, an online survey panel in Israel, will handle the sampling, random assignment, and data collection for our sample there.

In the wake of natural disasters, election administration is disrupted and voting is likely to become a lower priority. At the same time, people affected by natural disasters should not be disenfranchised on top of other impacts from the disaster \u2013 especially as they are usually in significant need of assistance from government agencies. Past research has demonstrated that increasing \u201csearch costs\u201d to find voting locations and \u201ctransportation costs\u201d to reach voting locations decreases turnout (Brady and McNulty 2011). Research on the administration of the 2012 election in the wake of Hurricane Sandy indicates that steps by local election officials to reduce these costs, such as using the same voting locations, may bolster turnout in affected areas (Stein 2015). This research builds on these concepts by seeking to deliver information about voting to people in the impacted areas using a method of communication (SMS) likely to reach individuals despite disruptions of natural disasters. The experiment is conducted during the 2018 election in counties in Florida and Georgia declared federal disaster areas in the wake of Hurricane Michael and in counties in North Carolina declared federal disaster areas in the wake of Hurricane Florence. The experiment is conducted among people of color in these areas based on historical patterns of low participation. The treatment takes advantage of the availability of early in-person voting in each of the three states. The first two SMS messages (scheduled for October 25 and October 30) note that public records indicate whether the individual has cast a ballot yet, and provides information on early voting locations and hours to encourage this form of voting in the wake of the hurricane. The mention of public records about voting was intended to make voters aware their voting behavior was being monitored to elicit social pressure (Green and Gerber 2015). Early voting allows voters to cast a ballot at any location within their county of registration, an especially valuable convenience in the wake of a hurricane. Early voting also allows voters to select when to vote, again a convenience likely to be heightened in the wake of a hurricane.
