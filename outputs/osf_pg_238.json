"Jaye Jungmin Ahn, Iris Vilares, Fanshu Sun, Cristina Chuong"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Betrayal trauma is when trauma is elicited by a close other (e.g. childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse) resulting in long-term social cognitive consequences that can obstruct an individuals\u2019 ability to make choices about who to trust (Gobin &amp; Freyd, 2014). Existing literature has demonstrated that early experiences of trauma influence an individuals\u2019 ability to establish healthy interpersonal relationships because of individuals\u2019 lack of trust in others. Research on revictimization of individuals in repeated traumatic events have shown that initial traumatic breaches of trust disrupts individual\u2019s ability to differentiate risks of social situations and make proper decisions to trust others (Gobin &amp; Freyd, 2009). Overall, research has suggested that traumatic events play a critical role in shaping an individual\u2019s ability to trust others (and more specifically, make correct decisions on whom to trust). Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) have both been examined in previous literature to predict reductions in trust in previous studies (Belli, Rogers, &amp; Lau, 2012), however this relationship has not yet been found for betrayal trauma specifically. Considering the importance of trust on interpersonal relationships and recovery from trauma based on prior research, the relationship between trust and trauma must be further studied to gain a thorough understanding of the interaction between the two. \nThe current study will utilize the trust game paradigm, an experimental behavioral economic game developed by Berg and McCabe (1995), to empirically analyze trust in an interpersonal setting. Results of previous studies have varied depending on the method of the project. Pitula and colleagues (2017) have found that children who have experienced significant traumas in the past display lower amounts of trust across different trials of the trust game. However, Gobin and Freyd (2014) did not find a significant relationship between betrayal trauma and trust behavior when they executed a similar study with adults. Furthermore, the observed effects on trust may depend on if the reciprocating partner is in a generous or betraying way (Pitula et al., 2017; Bell et al., 2019). These two studies differed not only in the population used (undergraduate psychology students vs. institutionalized adopted youth) but also in the number of trials used (one vs. multiple), and other methodological details. Many studies utilizing the trust game have additionally used computers as the other partner in the trust game, while deceiving participants that they were playing with actual people. This deception may be particularly relevant when studying trust, and in Gobin and Freyd\u2019s study (2014) most participants did not believe they were playing with an actual partner. Due to the discrepancy between the methods of the trust game as well as the results of studies that examine this relationship, the present study focuses on analyzing the effect of betrayal trauma on trust in an undergraduate population sample, using both generous and betraying partners as well as no deception.

Existing literature has demonstrated that early experiences of trauma influence an individuals\u2019 ability to establish healthy interpersonal relationships because of individuals\u2019 lack of trust in others. Research on revictimization of individuals in repeated traumatic events have shown that initial traumatic breaches of trust disrupts individual\u2019s ability to differentiate risks of social situations and make proper decisions to trust others (Gobin &amp; Freyd, 2009). Overall, research has suggested that traumatic events play a critical role in shaping an individual\u2019s ability to trust others (and more specifically, make correct decisions on whom to trust). Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) have both been examined in previous literature to predict reductions in trust in previous studies (Belli, Rogers, &amp; Lau, 2012), however this relationship has not yet been found for betrayal trauma specifically. Considering the importance of trust on interpersonal relationships and recovery from trauma based on prior research, the relationship between trust and trauma must be further studied to gain a thorough understanding of the interaction between the two. \nThe current study will utilize the trust game paradigm, an experimental behavioral economic game developed by Berg and McCabe (1995), to empirically analyze trust in an interpersonal setting. Results of previous studies have varied depending on the method of the project. Pitula and colleagues (2017) have found that children who have experienced significant traumas in the past display lower amounts of trust across different trials of the trust game. However, Gobin and Freyd (2014) did not find a significant relationship between betrayal trauma and trust behavior when they executed a similar study with adults. Furthermore, the observed effects on trust may depend on if the reciprocating partner is in a generous or betraying way (Pitula et al., 2017; Bell et al., 2019). These two studies differed not only in the population used (undergraduate psychology students vs. institutionalized adopted youth) but also in the number of trials used (one vs. multiple), and other methodological details. Many studies utilizing the trust game have additionally used computers as the other partner in the trust game, while deceiving participants that they were playing with actual people. This deception may be particularly relevant when studying trust, and in Gobin and Freyd\u2019s study (2014) most participants did not believe they were playing with an actual partner. Due to the discrepancy between the methods of the trust game as well as the results of studies that examine this relationship, the present study focuses on analyzing the effect of betrayal trauma on trust in an undergraduate population sample, using both generous and betraying partners as well as no deception. Reciprocation patterns are predicted to be related to differential patterns of trust behavior based on the frequency of trauma one has experienced.

Variables measured from the trust game include the average invested monetary units across the trials, the average investment in the first block, the initial investment amount at the beginning of each block, and the change in average investment between each block. \n\nSelf-report measures of trust: At the beginning and end of the experiment, and also between each block, participants will be asked about their perceived level of trust in specifically the other player (see below for details), serving as further dependent variables as a result of the trust game. \nQuestions to measure the participant\u2019s perceived trustworthiness in the other player are listed below, these questions will be asked intermittently during one block of the trust game on a 7 point Likert scale.\n1.\tHow trustworthy do you rate the other participant\u00a0as of now?\n2.\tHow trustworthy do you rate the other participant\u00a0to be in future trials?\n\nIn addition, the General Trust Scale will be used to measure participant\u2019s global beliefs about other\u2019s honesty and trustworthiness at a general level beyond the interaction with the other player. \n\nQuestionnaires: Results from the Brief Betrayal Trauma Survey, the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version, General Trust Scale, and the MacLean Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder will be completed by participants and scored. \n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Hypothesis 1: Trust and betrayal trauma are negatively correlated through a variety of behavioral and self-report measures\n\nWe will use a Spearman\u2019s correlational test to analyze the relationship between the results of the trust game and scores from the Brief Betrayal Trauma index. The different correlation tests will examine the following relationships:\n    Correlation between the average investment across trials for each condition and the betrayal trauma score\n    Correlation between the initial investment per block with the betrayal trauma score\n    Correlation between the average investment in the first block and betrayal trauma score\n    Correlation between average scores from the General Trust Scale and betrayal trauma scores\n    Correlation between average scores from the self-reported beliefs about the player\u2019s trustworthiness and betrayal trauma scores\n    These correlational tests will be compared between condition 1 and condition 2\n\n\nHypothesis 2: Betrayal trauma will differentially affect trust depending on the reciprocation of investments of either a betraying or generous partner\n\n    Individuals with higher betrayal trauma will respond with faster decreases in investments when playing with a betraying partner who returns lower values, when compared with individuals with low betrayal trauma.\n    We will use a Spearman\u2019s correlational test to analyze the relationship between trauma level and changes in trust behavior across trials. The change in the investment (calculated through the slope of investment amounts) will be correlated with the scores from the BTTS. This calculation analysis will occur \n\n\nHypothesis 3: Higher betrayal trauma will be associated with lower trust and with higher PTSD and/or BPD symptoms. Namely, we predict that:\n    A mediation analysis (Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986) will be conducted as a secondary analysis to determine how trust variables measured from the trust game mediates and predicts the relationship between trauma and PTSD (based on the PTSD Checklist) and Borderline Personality Disorder symptoms (MacLean Screening). \n\nIn addition, we will look at the correlations between the behavioral trust measures, the self-reported beliefs in the trustworthiness of the partner, and the scores in the general trust scale (the expectation is that these correlations will be positive).\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/9bqa3/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}},

We will then utilize publicly available data from Social Explorer, a website that provides access to United States census data, to look at county-specific demographic information (i.e., population, percent unemployed, median household income) to assess early life SEC (Scott et al., 2018).\n\nEarly life experiences will be assessed with the Risky Families Questionnaire (Felitti et al., 1998; Taylor, Lerner, Sage, Lehman, and Seeman, 2004). The Risky Families Questionnaire is a 13-item measure (10 items +3 filler items) that uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very often) to assess the degree of risk of physical, mental, and emotional distress experienced by participants in their homes during childhood and adolescence.\n\nThe control-related trait, urgency, will be assessed with the Positive Urgency Measure (PUR; Cyders et al., 2007) and Negative Urgency (NUR) scale of the revised version of the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale (UPPS-R; Whiteside and Lynam, 2001). The PUR is a 14-item measure that uses a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (agree strongly) to 4 (disagree strongly) to assess urgency when experiencing positive emotions. The NUR is a 12-item subscale of the UPPS-R that also uses a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (agree strongly) to 4 (disagree strongly) to assess urgency when experiencing negative emotions.\n\nApproach- and avoidance-related traits will be assessed with the Need for Affect Scale (Maio and Esses, 2001), the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (Bond et al., 2011), the Acceptance of Emotions Scale (Weihs, Enright, and Simmens, 2008), and the Emotional Approach Coping Scale (Stanton et al., 2000). \n\nThe Need for Affect Scale is a 26-item measure that uses a 7-point response scale ranging from -3 (strongly disagree) to 3 (strongly agree) with 13 items that assess motivation to approach emotions and 13 items to assess the motivation to avoid emotions. \n\nThe Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II) is a 7-item measure that uses a 7-point response scale ranging from 1 (never true) to 7 (always true) that assesses psychological inflexibility or experiential avoidance.\n\nThe Acceptance of Emotions Scale (AE) is a 13-item measure where responses are based on the percentage of time that each statement is true in increments of 10, ranging from 0 (never/not at all) to 100 (always/perfectly). It assesses the extent that individuals are accepting of their feelings, and higher scores indicate more emotional acceptance. \n\nEmotion Approach Coping (EAC) will be assessed with the dispositional version of the Emotional Approach Coping Scale (Stanton et al., 2000), which measures people\u2019s characteristic ways of managing emotions in stressful encounters. The Emotional Approach Coping Scale is an 8-item measure that uses a 4-point response option ranging from 1 (I usually don\u2019t do this at all) to 4 (I usually do this a lot) and measures two domains for coping through emotional approach: emotional processing and emotional expression.\n\nEmotion expression will be assessed with the Berkeley Expressivity Questionnaire (Gross and John, 1998), the Emotional Expressiveness Questionnaire (King and Emmons, 1990), the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (Gross and John, 2003), and the Affective Style Questionnaire (Hofmann and Kashdan, 2010). \n\nThe Berkeley Expressivity Questionnaire is a 16-item measure that uses a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) that assesses three facets of emotional expressivity: negative expressivity, positive expressivity, and impulse strength. \n\nThe Emotional Expressiveness Questionnaire is a 16-item measure that uses a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (does not agree at all) to 7 (strongly agrees) that assesses the expression of positive and negative emotions and intimacy. High scores on the EEQ indicate higher emotion expression. \n\nThe expressive suppression subscale of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire is a 4-item measure that uses a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) that assesses individual differences in expressive suppression. \n\nThe Affective Style Questionnaire is a 20-item measure that uses a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (not true of me at all) to 5 (extremely true of me) that assesses individual differences in emotion regulation techniques. The scale includes three subscales: concealing, adjusting, and tolerating.\n\nAlexithymia will be assessed with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-II (Bagby, Parker, and Taylor, 1993). The Toronto Alexithymia Scale-II (TAS-20) is a 20-item measure that uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) that assesses alexithymia. The scale includes three subscales: difficulty describing feelings, difficulty identifying feeling, and externally-oriented thinking.\n\nAffectivity will be assessed with the modified Differential Emotions Scale (Fredrickson, Tugade, Waugh, and Larkin, 2003). The modified Differential Emotions Scale (mDES) is a 20-item measure that uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) to assess the degree and frequency of positive and negative emotions.

The NUR is a 12-item subscale of the UPPS-R that also uses a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (agree strongly) to 4 (disagree strongly) to assess urgency when experiencing negative emotions.\n\nApproach- and avoidance-related traits will be assessed with the Need for Affect Scale (Maio and Esses, 2001), the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (Bond et al., 2011), the Acceptance of Emotions Scale (Weihs, Enright, and Simmens, 2008), and the Emotional Approach Coping Scale (Stanton et al., 2000). \n\nThe Need for Affect Scale is a 26-item measure that uses a 7-point response scale ranging from -3 (strongly disagree) to 3 (strongly agree) with 13 items that assess motivation to approach emotions and 13 items to assess the motivation to avoid emotions. \n\nThe Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II) is a 7-item measure that uses a 7-point response scale ranging from 1 (never true) to 7 (always true) that assesses psychological inflexibility or experiential avoidance.\n\nThe Acceptance of Emotions Scale (AE) is a 13-item measure where responses are based on the percentage of time that each statement is true in increments of 10, ranging from 0 (never/not at all) to 100 (always/perfectly). It assesses the extent that individuals are accepting of their feelings, and higher scores indicate more emotional acceptance. \n\nEmotion Approach Coping (EAC) will be assessed with the dispositional version of the Emotional Approach Coping Scale (Stanton et al., 2000), which measures people\u2019s characteristic ways of managing emotions in stressful encounters. The Emotional Approach Coping Scale is an 8-item measure that uses a 4-point response option ranging from 1 (I usually don\u2019t do this at all) to 4 (I usually do this a lot) and measures two domains for coping through emotional approach: emotional processing and emotional expression.\n\nEmotion expression will be assessed with the Berkeley Expressivity Questionnaire (Gross and John, 1998), the Emotional Expressiveness Questionnaire (King and Emmons, 1990), the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (Gross and John, 2003), and the Affective Style Questionnaire (Hofmann and Kashdan, 2010). \n\nThe Berkeley Expressivity Questionnaire is a 16-item measure that uses a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) that assesses three facets of emotional expressivity: negative expressivity, positive expressivity, and impulse strength. \n\nThe Emotional Expressiveness Questionnaire is a 16-item measure that uses a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (does not agree at all) to 7 (strongly agrees) that assesses the expression of positive and negative emotions and intimacy. High scores on the EEQ indicate higher emotion expression. \n\nThe expressive suppression subscale of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire is a 4-item measure that uses a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) that assesses individual differences in expressive suppression. \n\nThe Affective Style Questionnaire is a 20-item measure that uses a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (not true of me at all) to 5 (extremely true of me) that assesses individual differences in emotion regulation techniques. The scale includes three subscales: concealing, adjusting, and tolerating.\n\nAlexithymia will be assessed with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-II (Bagby, Parker, and Taylor, 1993). The Toronto Alexithymia Scale-II (TAS-20) is a 20-item measure that uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) that assesses alexithymia. The scale includes three subscales: difficulty describing feelings, difficulty identifying feeling, and externally-oriented thinking.\n\nAffectivity will be assessed with the modified Differential Emotions Scale (Fredrickson, Tugade, Waugh, and Larkin, 2003). The modified Differential Emotions Scale (mDES) is a 20-item measure that uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) to assess the degree and frequency of positive and negative emotions. The scale includes two subscales: positive emotions and negative emotions.\n\nIn order to assess whether our proposed dimensions represent approach/avoidance and control/dyscontrol, we will use the BIS/BAS Scale (Carver and White, 2013) and the Brief Self-Control Scale (Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone, 2004) as anchoring scales.\n\nThe BIS/BAS scale is a 24-item measure that uses a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (very true for me) to 4 (very false for me) to measure two motivational systems, the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and the behavioral activation system (BAS). The BIS corresponds to motivation to avoid aversive outcomes, and the BAS corresponds to motivation to approach goal-oriented outcomes.\n\nThe Brief Self-Control Scale is a 13-item measure that uses a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (Not at all like me) to 5 (very much like me) to assess dispositional self-regulatory behaviors.", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "The mean of each trait response to emotion scale (i.e., ispative mean imputation) for each scale will be converted to a z score. Scales with more than 50% missing items will be considered missing for that person and not subject to further analysis. A general propensity to response to emotion will be assessed by examining item-total correlations and the mean correlation among the measures, and if there is evidence for a general propensity (majority of item-total correlations greater than .30), then the z scores will be summed. \n\nDimension scores will be created by weighting z scores for each measure of response to emotion by its value on that dimension and summing. Anchoring scales will not be included in the dimension scores.", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "1.\tHypothesis 1 states that two dimensions (approach/avoidance and control/dyscontrol) will characterize the factor structure of trait responses to emotion. The multidimensional model will be constructed using ALSCAL in SPSS. Distances among emotion trait response measures and anchoring scales will be calculated as 1 minus the correlation between each pair of measures and treated as interval data. There are 19 total emotion trait response measures (including subscales), allowing up to 4-dimensional models (Kruskal and Wish, 1978). Stress statistics will be examined for 1- through 4-dimensional models, and the highest-dimensional model that yields a substantive reduction in stress (greater than or equal to .05) will be adopted. The position of anchoring scales (e.g., BIS/BAS Scales and the Brief Self-Control Scale) will be used to determine whether dimensions represent approach/avoidance and control; that is, if an anchoring scale lies along the dimension rather than in interstitial space, its construct will provide interpretation of the scale.\n\n2.\tHypothesis 2 states that individuals who are younger and are female will utilize more approach trait emotion responses; in contrast, individuals who are older and are male will utilize more avoidant trait emotion responses. Additionally, individuals who are older and are female (particularly in regard to negative emotions) will utilize more control trait emotion responses than individuals who are younger and are male (particularly in regard to negative emotions).\n\nThe relationships among these demographic variables and the dimension scores will be investigated using both zero-order correlations and multiple regression models. Multiple regression models will allow for us to model the relationships between the demographic variables and the dimension scores by fitting a linear equation to observed data. Every demographic variable will serve as an independent variable, and the dimension score will be the dependent variable. The demographic variables\u2019 relationship with the dimension score will be calculated while holding the other demographic variables constant using the following equation: (dimension score) = B_0 + B_1X_((age)) + B_2X_((gender)) where \u03b20 = the predicted value of the dimension score when all demographic variables are held constant, and \u03b2_iX = the regression coefficient (or slope) for an independent variable. To determine statistical significance, alpha will be set at p is less than .05. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, a sequential approach that is equivalent to Bonferroni correction but has been demonstrated to yield greater power (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995; Thissen, Steinberg, Kuang, 2002), will be applied to account for performing multiple tests on each proposed trait response to emotion dimension to reduce our Type I error rate.", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []},
