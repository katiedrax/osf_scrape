We here test the effects of these in a conjoint experiment on candidate favourability fielded as part of a survey to a representative sample of the Finnish population.", "q4": "H1: Recommendations have positive effects on candidate favourability.\n\nH2: The effect of recommendations on candidate favourability vary according to the strength of the social ties to the source of the recommendation. \n\nH3: Recommendations have a stronger effects among people with less political sophistication.\n\nH4: Uncertainty of winning a seat has a negative effect on candidate favourability \n\nH5: The effect of electoral uncertainty is weaker among respondents who are more prone to risk-taking", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

A recommended minimum threshold for the number of respondents is (Orme, 2010, p. 64): (nta)/c=500\nWhere n is the number of respondents, t is the number comparisons made (here 7), a is the number of alternatives or profiles to choose from (here 2) and c is the largest number of levels for any attribute (here 15 since the analyses will include a 3x5 interaction). \n\nAccordingly, the minimum number of respondents is 536 people. Orme (2010: 65) emphasizes that this is a minimum requirement that should not be used to justify too small sample sizes). Another rule-of-thumb is that if you compare groups, there should be a minimum of 200 in each group. Since the inclusion of interaction effects between the recommendation attribute and political sophistication divides respondents into five groups, there should be at least 1000 respondents. Furthermore, it is also necessary to consider generalisability to the general population of interest (Aguinis &amp; Bradley, 2014). However, there is also a wish to ensure a sample that is representative of the Finnish population when it comes to age, gender, and region. To ensure the representativeness the sample size will be 1000 individuals.

The obtained coefficients indicate the Average Marginal Component Effect (AMCE), which is interpreted as the average change in the probability that a profile will win support when it includes the listed attribute value instead of the baseline attribute value. The NO INFORMATION attribute level will serve as baseline in all analyses.\n\nThe first part of the analyses involves to examine how the attributes affect evaluations of candidates, which involves a straightforward regression analysis where respondents\u2019 choices are included as the dependent variable (coded profile chosen yes/no) and the attributes are included as categorical variables. All results are presented using coefficient plots, as recommended by Hainmueller et al. (2014).\n\nThe second step concerns differences in effects of recommendations depending on the level of respondents' political sophistication. Here the regression model includes interaction effects between sophistication variables (political interest, internal political efficacy, voting, party identification and discuss politics)  and the attributes to see whether their effects differ depending on the type of issue. This gives us the average component interaction effect (ACIE).  \n\nFor risk taking, the analyses will include interaction effects between respondents propensity for risk taking and the conjoint attributes.

This study will use 20 years of data collected by the SFPDP to explore trends in FTA rates over time, the association of these trends with shifts in policy and practice, and the relationship between individual characteristics and FTA outcomes among individuals participating in the Supervised Release program. By utilizing a large population over a significant period, this study will inform potential enhancements in pretrial programming to improve FTA outcomes for individuals with intensive needs.\n\nThe study strives to inform the understanding of FTA outcomes by utilizing Supervised Release data to examine a population that poses a significant challenge with court attendance. The external validity of any potential finding will be limited to the characteristics of the program participants. As individuals with lower levels of risk and need are increasingly diverted from the justice system, resources are concentrated on individuals with higher levels of risk and need. By studying the factors associated with FTA for a generally high-needs population, this study seeks to gain insight into whether and how it is possible to support this population in maintaining compliance with court requirements.\n\nSupervised Release is one of SFPDP\u2019s most integral services, as it caters specifically to high-needs clients. Over more than 20 years of implementation, SFPDP has experienced variation in appearance and safety rates among Supervised Release participants, with current appearance and safety rates of 85% and 88% respectively.  Supervised Release case managers work with clients to determine their case management needs level, short- and long-term goals, and a corresponding treatment plan. In addition, Supervised Release case managers connect clients with short-term housing, outside treatment, and service providers who continue to work with clients after the conclusion of their cases. The goal of Supervised Release is to connect clients with the help they need to comply with court obligations including attendance at required court appearances. As such, this study will study a long-standing program that has experienced fluctuation in FTA rates over time and has witnessed significant shifts in legislative and judicial policy at the state level. In addition, SFPDP has implemented changes in practice, most notably the implementation of the Public Safety Assessment (PSA), developed by Arnold Ventures, which may have affected FTA outcomes for program participants.\nSpecifically, the study will focus on two primary research objectives: \n\u2022\tObjective A: Identify trends in Supervised Release participants\u2019 FTA rates over time, how these trends change following significant shifts in policy and practice, and the association between participants\u2019 characteristics (e.g., demographic characteristics, offense characteristics, prior criminal history, pretrial release court requirements) and FTA outcomes. \n\u2022\tObjective B: Quantitatively and qualitatively assess the association between FTA and individual, client stability, and court factors using a population of recent Supervised Release participants, to understand what factors are most strongly associated with FTA.\nGiven SFPDP\u2019s leadership in pretrial best practices, research on Supervised Release participants has the potential to inform both programmatic and policy decisions for other jurisdictions seeking to implement effective pretrial practices. In addition, there are several unique aspects of the program that deem it worthy of further research, including its management by an independent nonprofit organization, its location in politically-dynamic California, and the high appearance and safety rate of its recent participants.

The objective is to find trends, changes over time, and associations between Supervised Release participants\u2019 characteristics and FTA outcomes. The study will focus on three research questions:\n\nResearch Question 1: To what extent do individuals participating in the Supervised Release program fail to appear at scheduled court dates and how has this changed over time?\nThis research question establishes a starting point for the study by evaluating the extent to which individuals in the Supervised Release program fail to appear at required court hearings and presenting a portrait of the overall proportion of individuals that fail to appear. This component of the analysis is intended to provide context for the research by providing an overview of the population characteristics and the extent to which FTA occurred among this population over time. \n\nResearch Question 2: To what extent do significant shifts in policy and practice align with changes in Supervised Release participants\u2019 FTA rates over time?\nOver the course of the study period, significant legislative actions and key judicial decisions have reshaped the criminal justice system and the social and economic support services available to individuals eligible for participation in the Supervised Release program, such as Assembly Bill 109, Proposition 47, and Proposition 57. In addition, there have been changes in the Supervised Release program itself that may be associated with individual outcomes. \n\nResearch Question 3: To what extent are individual, client stability, and court factors associated with FTA outcomes among individuals participating in the Supervised Release program?\nThis question seeks to determine which factors are significantly associated with FTA outcomes, as well as the magnitude and direction of those relationships. The study will explore associations described in the sub-questions below.\no\tResearch Question 3.1: How are individual characteristics associated with FTA among individuals participating in the Supervised Release program?\no\tThe study will examine two types of individual factors: demographic characteristics and offense characteristics. By examining participants\u2019 FTA outcomes by demographic characteristics such as age, race/ethnicity, and gender, the study seeks to identify whether some population groups have a higher probability of FTA than others. In addition to demographic characteristics, the study will also examine FTA outcomes by offense characteristics. Offense characteristics refers to the most serious offense at the time of charge. This analysis will examine both the offense level (misdemeanor/felony) and the offense type, including property, violent, drug, weapon, and public order offenses. Understanding differences in FTA outcomes by offense characteristics may provide insight into the extent to which certain offense characteristics are associated with a higher risk of FTA than others. \no\tResearch Question 3.2: How are client stability characteristics associated with FTA among individuals participating in the Supervised Release program?\no\tBoth acute and chronic social and economic conditions, including factors such as homelessness, unstable housing, unemployment, and unstable employment, can pose significant challenges for individuals in their daily lives, making court appearances more challenging and potentially increasing the probability of FTA. In contrast, strong social support and stable housing conditions can act as protective factors for compliance with court requirements, including attendance. Research Question 3.2 is designed to understand how factors affecting participants\u2019 social and economic stability may be associated with the probability that they will appear at required court appointments. This study will examine differences in individual stability characteristics to identify where the presence or absence of these factors is significantly associated with FTA outcomes. \no\tResearch Question 3.3: How are court and case management requirements associated with FTA among individuals participating in the Supervised Release program? \no\tAs a Supervised Release program participant, individuals are expected to remain in compliance with their assigned treatment plans, including attendance at court, calls and meetings with case managers, engagement in treatment services, and related requirements, which may include electronic monitoring.

First, a logistic regression will be conducted utilizing the dependent variable and all individual demographic characteristics as well as case and prior criminal history characteristics to identify the extent to which these characteristics are associated with FTA outcomes.  Next, measures of stability characteristics will be added to the model to examine their association with FTA outcomes and to identify the extent to which individual demographic and case factors are associated with FTA outcomes. This also allows the research team to identify the extent to which individual demographic and case factors are associated with FTA outcomes in the presence of client stability factors. Where the significant or magnitude of the relationship between demographic/case characteristics changes with the addition of client stability characteristics, this may indicate mediating or moderating effects, which the research team will explore to the extent possible. Finally, measures of case management will be added to the model to identify the extent to which these aspects of case management are associated with FTA outcomes. Again, this process may allow the research team to identify the extent to which individual demographic and case characteristics as well as client stability characteristics are associated with FTA outcomes in the presence of case management characteristics including potential interaction effects. To the extent possible, the research team will further investigate interaction effects where empirically justified. \n\nQualitative Data\n\nQualitative data will be analyzed utilizing a framework analysis method to organize data by participant and code.

We will also measure participants' attachment styles, relationship satisfaction, and demographics information.\n\nRationale:\nAvoidant and anxious attachment are described as the tendencies either to deactivate or hyperactivate the attachment system in response to threat. Avoidant attachment is therefore usually identified in both the research and popular psychology literatures as a habitual avoidance or fear of intimacy itself, and anxious attachment as a habitual approach towards or desire for intimacy itself. We propose that these descriptions inaccurately characterize the motivations driving avoidant and anxious attachment behaviors. \n\tWe propose, instead, and in keeping with the ontogenetic origins of avoidant and anxious attachment styles, two alternative goals and characterizations of avoidant and anxious attachment styles:\n\n1.\tThe goal of avoidance is actually to maintain proximity by maintaining one\u2019s ability to identify and fulfill one\u2019s own needs and desires, without disrupting one\u2019s relationships, and is adopted on the basis of a fear that one\u2019s needs and desires are incompatible with one\u2019s relationships and will lead to the discovery of relationship incompatibility and the dissolution of the relationship. This proposal is in keeping with the finding that avoidant attachment in infants is predicted by having attachment figures who move farther away rather than closer in response to their infants\u2019 displays of distress and attempts to seek proximity. It is also theoretically consistent with the Dynamic Maturational Model\u2019s characterization of avoidant attachment as based in compliance, with avoidance behavior being one component of the overarching strategy.\na.\t(The goal of maintaining existing proximity is also consistent with conceptions of attachment to systems and the role of deactivation/palliation more broadly, e.g. system justification, just world beliefs, etc. and their effect on system-support at the sociopolitical level.)\n2.\tThe goal of anxiety or preoccupation is actually to render the attachment relationship effective in its evolutionary and interpersonal function of protection from threat, and is adopted on the basis of a fear that despite having the relationship, the attachment figure will not fulfill one\u2019s needs and desires. This proposal is in keeping with the finding that anxious attachment in infants is predicted by having attachment figures who are distracted and interfering or intrusive, but who respond to (i.e., whose caregiving can be regulated by) exaggerated proximity-seeking, or protest behaviors. It is also theoretically consistent with the Dynamic Maturational Model\u2019s characterization of anxious attachment as based in coercion, with anxiety or preoccupation behavior being one component of the overarching strategy.\n\nThis alternative conceptualization of the motivations of avoidant and anxious attachment is also in keeping with Mikulincer and Shaver\u2019s (2003, p.23) observation that \u201cdismissing individuals possess available representations of self during security-enhancing interactions with an attachment figure and can use them in threat contexts,\u201d whereas preoccupied individuals do not possess these available representations. As Schafer (1968, p.9) describes, \u201cinternalization refers to all those processes by which the subject transforms real or imagined regulatory interactions with his environment, and real or imagined characteristics of his environment, into inner regulation and characteristics.\u201d Whether real or imagined, avoidant individuals seem to have positive if idealized representations of experiences with attachment figures, whereas anxious individuals seem to lack even realistic (flawed, non-idealized) representations of satisfying experiences with attachment figures, leading the former to seek to protect and maintain potential access to these experiences, and the latter to seek to render their relationships more satisfying of their needs and desires.\n\nRationale In Brief:\n\u2022\tNOT\no\tAvoidant attachment: Fear of and avoidance of intimacy\no\tAnxious attachment: Desire for and preoccupation with intimacy\n\u2022\tBUT RATHER\no\tAvoidant attachment: Concern with retaining relationship\no\tAnxious attachment: Concern with receiving sufficient caregiving", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-03-27T20:14:10.934751", "date_modified": "2020-03-27T15:28:29.052698", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["Attachment"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["N/A"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "eea9a93b054db1f841c903a82f22eab350ea6b8d0f8c60b116ee6ca9f833d92107e84aea99acb3c1f1faba0d2d88d520b0a458388c2256fd07f6cfe54717ddb879c2e4dc7e663bd2ade469bce91060544bb57c917f115e8ee38a1d5ee1d0fae73bf300e529f82b17a49ae9e0aae13b57ecfed89766a6c58e0c9438b6c2ec92a98cf806f9fc6ae8f7e1cf38d1daee185a", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-03-27T20:14:10.914416", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Preregistration Template from AsPredicted.org", "registered_meta": {"data": {"extra": [], "value": "It's complicated.
