The current study will investigate whether this also accounts for an action-effect compatibility effect, thus when participants have to respond to  stimuli by certain movements (e.g., a hand movement to the left or right) which causes object movements which are spatially neutral for the participant, but corresponding to the direction of the hand movement from an avatar's perspective (e.g., vertical object movements with a 90\u00b0 rotated avatar).

The current study will investigate whether this also accounts for an action-effect compatibility effect, thus when participants have to respond to  stimuli by certain movements (e.g., a hand movement to the left or right) which causes object movements which are spatially neutral for the participant, but corresponding to the direction of the hand movement from an avatar's perspective (e.g., vertical object movements with a 90\u00b0 rotated avatar).

For example, conformity increases if the counterpart involved in the experiment is perceived as part of the in-group (Castelli, Vanzetto, Sherman, &amp; Arcuri, 2001) or if the self-other boundaries are experimentally reduced using the enfacement task (Paladino, Mazzurega, Pavani, &amp; Schubert, 2010).\nHere we want to investigate if the different stimulus type (GAN vs REAL) will also elicit different levels of conformity within the same participants.

Critically, the spatial density of the letter array will be manipulated at each trial giving the illusion that the number of the letters also varies (Anobile et al, 2014). The task of the participants will be to provide an estimation of the number of letters. Above the letter array, a number would indicate the estimation provided by the previously presented person. Importantly, this number will be randomly sampled from a normal distribution and therefore will not be informative of the actual number of letters in the display (which is fixed anyway). To ensure participants\u2019 engagement in the task, we will inform them that the real faces did their best to provide an accurate estimation of the array display, whereas the estimates provided by the artificial faces were randomly generated by an algorithm. In this way, people will be motivated to conforming to the faces that they believe are real.

Here, we intend to investigate the behavioural consequences of this bias. More specifically, we want to investigate the level of conformity elicited by the two types of stimuli. \nPrevious studies showed that conformity (i.e. the over-proportional bias to match or copy an informational source, relative to random copying) can be experimentally manipulated. For example, conformity increases if the counterpart involved in the experiment is perceived as part of the in-group (Castelli, Vanzetto, Sherman, &amp; Arcuri, 2001) or if the self-other boundaries are experimentally reduced using the enfacement task (Paladino, Mazzurega, Pavani, &amp; Schubert, 2010).\nHere we want to investigate if the different stimulus type (GAN vs REAL) will also elicit different levels of conformity within the same participants. In other words, will participants conform more to non-existing people than to real people?\n\n\n\n", "q4": "The amount of conformity will be different for the two stimulus types.

Conformity will be measured using a similar approach as used in Castelli et al., 2001: at each trial, participants will see one of the faces (either GAN or REAL) followed by an array of 200 letters organized in a random spatial configuration. Critically, the spatial density of the letter array will be manipulated at each trial giving the illusion that the number of the letters also varies (Anobile et al, 2014). The task of the participants will be to provide an estimation of the number of letters. Above the letter array, a number would indicate the estimation provided by the previously presented person. Importantly, this number will be randomly sampled from a normal distribution and therefore will not be informative of the actual number of letters in the display (which is fixed anyway). To ensure participants\u2019 engagement in the task, we will inform them that the real faces did their best to provide an accurate estimation of the array display, whereas the estimates provided by the artificial faces were randomly generated by an algorithm. In this way, people will be motivated to conforming to the faces that they believe are real. Note that participants do not know which ones are the REAL or the GAN faces.\n \nReferences\nAnobile, G., Cicchini, G. M., &amp; Burr, D. C. (2014).
