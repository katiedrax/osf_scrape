We know little about how large scale anthropogonic activity, as a prominent contemporary global change driver, is indirectly influencing the current reshuffling of ecological communities. Direct environmental influences, such as forest loss and warming, have been found to catalyse biodiversity changes. Quantifying the indirect impact of global changes of human activity, such as roads and urbanisation, will allow to better unravel different sources of heterogenous biodiversity change. Urbanisation and roads can influence changes in ecological communities by increasing connectivity and favouring urban-adapted species, causing both temporal and spatial turnover. Species\u2019 response to such influences is dependent on ecological aspects such as their mobility. Highly mobile species are found to be affected most by urbanisation. Beyond the effect of urbanisation and roads on biodiversity change, high human population density often coincides with high species richness, illuminating spatial congruence between human development and diverse ecosystems. This can be seen both as a threat and as an opportunity to improved management. Recent global-scale data compilations of biodiversity time-series (BioTIME) and data sets which indirectly capture large-scale anthropogenic activities, will allow me to quantify their influence on ecological communities worldwide. Linking human impact with biodiversity change can provide the needed evidence and predictions for better international policy making in the light of our rapidly changing Anthropocene.\n\nPurpose of the study\nMy aim is to quantify how global change drivers influence ecological communities (and individual taxa) over time. Specifically, I will focus on the effects of urbanisation and roads, captured in the metric accessibility to cities, and human population density on temporal changes on ecological community composition overall and across taxa. These drivers are an indirect representation of large- scale human activity and capture big parts of the alteration of our planet.

Exploratory outcomes analyzed will be male to female ratio, clinical symptoms analysis, pharmacological interventions as well as non-pharmacological, diagnostic methods used for the detection of the virus, laboratory findings (blood count cells, liver enzymes, C-reactive protein, d-dimer, albumin, lipid profile, serum ions, vitamins measures, glucose levels, and any important biomarkers) and radiological assessment (using radiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance or ultrasound). \nData Collection, Quality Assessment and Data Synthesis\nData extraction and quality assessment will be performed independently by two overview authors. Conflicts will be resolved by consensus or by a third researcher. Identification data (author name and journal of publication), range of period associated with the search, number of databases, population or settings considered, main results and outcomes observed, and number of participants were extracted in an Excel file. Two researchers independently will be to assess the quality of the reviews using an adapted version of the \u2018A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR)\u2019.  We will adapt the before mentioned tool because of the lack of systematic reviews using randomized clinical trials. For data synthesis, we will prepare a table summarizing each included systematic review considering the aim of each study. Therefore, we will prepare a narrative summary of the methods and findings, as well as study strengths and limitations. \n", "q6.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e7bbd38c3f8d30025fa2d9a", "file_name": "Search strategy overview of reviews covid-19.docx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/6xtyw/files/osfstorage/5e7bbd38c3f8d30025fa2d9a", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e7bbd38c3f8d30025fa2d9a"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "c8b2d14925a330e2a7397d641b293daa9673c167cfd37826bd1b5c82ef3b1abe"}}], "q10.question": "A librarian with wide experience with systematic reviews will perform the obtention of studies.

For the purposes of this study, we define cheating as romantic or sexual behaviors that occur outside of a committed romantic relationship and that violate the expectations of the relationship. This definition can be broken down into two parts: the behavior that occurred and the judgment of whether that behavior constitutes cheating. Previous research has explored these two different parts separately, but have not included both parts of the definition, thus limiting the utility of their measures as they do not encapsulate the full construct. Given the inconsistent theoretical approaches and lack of full inclusion of the definition of cheating in research, our goal for the current project is to investigate whether a conceptualization of cheating that includes explicit cheating behaviors and the judgments of the behaviors as cheating fits the underlying structure of the construct. Specifically, we plan to investigate both explicit cheating behaviors as dimensional, as has been the standard in the research literature, and the judgments of the cheating behaviors as both a categorical and dimensional judgment.

To assess the explicit behaviors piece of our definition, participants will be asked, \"Please indicate which actions you have engaged in while in an exclusive romantic relationship.\u201d They will then be presented with our list of potential cheating behaviors and their response options. For items that involve someone else, we will clarify, \u201c\u2019Someone other than my partner\u2019 refers to a person to whom you could be attracted\u201d in order to focus exclusively on behaviors that potentially reflect cheating since, for example, riding in a car with a same-sex co-worker would not approximate cheating behavior but riding with an opposite-sex coworker could, for a heterosexual participant. We will ask participants to report on all past behavior, rather than from some specific time period (e.g., the last six months) to capture more variability in cheating behaviors, since cheating is a relatively low base-rate phenomenon in any one arbitrarily determined time referent. \nFor the response options, we plan to use a 3-point rating scale: 0 = \u201cDid not participate in this behavior\u201d, 1 = \u201cParticipated in this behavior on only one occasion\u201d, and 2 = \u201cParticipated in this behavior on more than one occasion.\u201d Often, researchers have used dichotomous response options (e.g., \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d) when assessing cheating behavior. We chose to use an ordinal scale because it provides more information by allowing for the property of magnitude. This additional variability is important statistically in creating data that are more appropriate for our chosen models which attempt to discern underlying latent factors. Additionally, assessing for frequency aligns with potential conceptualizations of cheating behaviors (i.e., dimensional and hybrid models).\nAdditionally, to give us the ability to do more nuanced investigation of motivation, intent, and serial cheating in future studies, we plan to include further response options for those who endorse an item. Specifically, if a participant chooses \u201cDid not participate in this behavior,\u201d they will then be presented with the options of 0 = \u201cDid not participate in this behavior because there was no opportunity\u201d and 1 = \u201cDid not participate in this behavior despite the opportunity to do so because I did not want to\u201d (Luo, Cartun, &amp; Snider, 2010; Wiederman &amp; Hurd, 1999). If a participant chooses \u201cParticipated in this behavior on more than one occasion,\u201d they will then be presented with the options of 1 = \u201cParticipated in this behavior on more than one occasion with the same person\u201d, and 2 = \u2018\u2018Participated in this behavior with different people\u201d (Luo, Cartun, &amp; Snider, 2010; Wiederman &amp; Hurd, 1999); in this case, we will allow participants to select both options, if applicable. Additionally, for those who indicate they have participated in any of these behaviors on more than one occasion, we will include the item \u201cPlease indicate the number of times you have participated in this behavior\u201d with an open-ended response. We do not currently plan to analyze these additional response options in the proposed project but believe they will be useful in other studies and for the future utility of this measure. \n\nJudgment of behaviors. Our operational definition of cheating includes the idea that whether a behavior is cheating is determined by the expectations and rules of the particular relationship. In order to account for this aspect of our operational definition, we plan to present the previously described items to participants a second time, this time asking them first \u201cDo you consider this behavior to be cheating\u201d with response options 0 = \u201cNo\u201d and 1 = \u201cYes.\u201d Participants will then be asked, \u201cHow serious do you consider the participation in this behavior?\u201d on a scale of 1 = \u201cNot serious at all\u201d to 10 \u201cExtremely serious.\u201d\n\nThe final questionnaire will consist of demographic questions, the measure mentioned above, measures related to previously established negative consequences of cheating and validity questions (see Appendix C for proposed validity items).

Participants will be paid .$90 for agreeing to participate. Only participants who are older than 18 years of age, speak English fluently, and currently live within the United States will be allowed to participate. CloudResearch allows us to place filters on those characteristics so our study will only appear to those who meet the criteria. We plan to include participants who have cheated as well as those who have not. While we could create having a history of cheating as an inclusionary criterion, we decided against doing so because we believe it could change our results. Specifically, since the definition of cheating appears to vary amongst individuals, it is likely that some participants will have participated in some cheating behaviors as defined by us that they would not think of if they were asked to self-select into the study based on their past behaviors.", "q10.uploader": [], "q14.question": "There are no manipulated variables because it is observational.", "q14.uploader": [], "q15.question": "Explicit behaviors. To assess the explicit behaviors piece of our definition, participants will be asked, \"Please indicate which actions you have engaged in while in an exclusive romantic relationship.\u201d They will then be presented with our list of potential cheating behaviors and their response options. For items that involve someone else, we will clarify, \u201c\u2019Someone other than my partner\u2019 refers to a person to whom you could be attracted\u201d in order to focus exclusively on behaviors that potentially reflect cheating since, for example, riding in a car with a same-sex co-worker would not approximate cheating behavior but riding with an opposite-sex coworker could, for a heterosexual participant. We will ask participants to report on all past behavior, rather than from some specific time period (e.g., the last six months) to capture more variability in cheating behaviors, since cheating is a relatively low base-rate phenomenon in any one arbitrarily determined time referent. \nFor the response options, we plan to use a 3-point rating scale: 0 = \u201cDid not participate in this behavior\u201d, 1 = \u201cParticipated in this behavior on only one occasion\u201d, and 2 = \u201cParticipated in this behavior on more than one occasion.\u201d Often, researchers have used dichotomous response options (e.g., \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d) when assessing cheating behavior. We chose to use an ordinal scale because it provides more information by allowing for the property of magnitude. This additional variability is important statistically in creating data that are more appropriate for our chosen models which attempt to discern underlying latent factors. Additionally, assessing for frequency aligns with potential conceptualizations of cheating behaviors (i.e., dimensional and hybrid models).\nAdditionally, to give us the ability to do more nuanced investigation of motivation, intent, and serial cheating in future studies, we plan to include further response options for those who endorse an item. Specifically, if a participant chooses \u201cDid not participate in this behavior,\u201d they will then be presented with the options of 0 = \u201cDid not participate in this behavior because there was no opportunity\u201d and 1 = \u201cDid not participate in this behavior despite the opportunity to do so because I did not want to\u201d (Luo, Cartun, &amp; Snider, 2010; Wiederman &amp; Hurd, 1999). If a participant chooses \u201cParticipated in this behavior on more than one occasion,\u201d they will then be presented with the options of 1 = \u201cParticipated in this behavior on more than one occasion with the same person\u201d, and 2 = \u2018\u2018Participated in this behavior with different people\u201d (Luo, Cartun, &amp; Snider, 2010; Wiederman &amp; Hurd, 1999); in this case, we will allow participants to select both options, if applicable. Additionally, for those who indicate they have participated in any of these behaviors on more than one occasion, we will include the item \u201cPlease indicate the number of times you have participated in this behavior\u201d with an open-ended response. We do not currently plan to analyze these additional response options in the proposed project but believe they will be useful in other studies and for the future utility of this measure. \n\nJudgment of behaviors. Our operational definition of cheating includes the idea that whether a behavior is cheating is determined by the expectations and rules of the particular relationship. In order to account for this aspect of our operational definition, we plan to present the previously described items to participants a second time, this time asking them first \u201cDo you consider this behavior to be cheating\u201d with response options 0 = \u201cNo\u201d and 1 = \u201cYes.\u201d Participants will then be asked, \u201cHow serious do you consider the participation in this behavior?\u201d on a scale of 1 = \u201cNot serious at all\u201d to 10 \u201cExtremely serious.\u201d\n\nThe final questionnaire will consist of demographic questions, the measure mentioned above, measures related to previously established negative consequences of cheating and validity questions (see Appendix C for proposed validity items). Included in the demographic items will an open ended question asking for the participant\u2019s age and the items, \u201cHave you done anything you consider to be cheating?\u201d and \u201cHas a partner done anything you consider to be cheating?\u201d to assess participants\u2019 history with cheating.
