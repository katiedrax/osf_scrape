The data were collected in behavioral laboratory, using paper and pencil.\n\nWe used Arkes and Blumer\u2019s (1985) classic escalation decision task. People will need to decide how much from a $1M to be allocated to a previously chosen division or another division they did not chose before. Participants completed an escalation of commitment scenario (written in Chinese).The scenario was modified to be about cell phone R&amp;D. The initial decision was using $1M from a $2M budget to develop battery durability. After a year, the development finished 75% of the progress and was thinking how to allocate the reminding $1M to four categories. At the same time, there was a new battery already in the market, which is cheaper and more durable than the one the firm was developing.\n\nThe materials are here \nMaterials 02 (Rank Allocation and Escalation).doc\n\n\n", "q12.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e25886bedceab01448308d5", "file_name": "Materials 02 (Rank Allocation and Escalation).doc", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/vj4z3/files/osfstorage/5e25886bedceab01448308d5", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e25886bedceab01448308d5"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "99f5eca889ee84d1d3fecd8787cab2896c76ff3552f42bb6286dbd95869ad975"}}], "q16.question": "There was one within-participant variable: Resource Allocation Principles (Equity, Equality, and Need).

Half of the subjects were informed that they made the initial decision. The other half were informed that another person made the decision. The manipulation was done for other purposes that were not relevant to this research purpose. \n\nInitial decision categorization (Hierarchical categorization vs. non-hierarchical categorization, between-participant). Half of the participants were informed that the initial decision was made under a first level category (either battery vs. display, or appearance vs. durability) then to the second level category. Another half of the participants were informed with four discrete categories (battery appearance, battery durability, display appearance, and display durability). \n\nEscalation option arrangement: (By Product vs. By Features) Half of the participants were given escalation options organized in a way by project, such that allocating in the following order: Battery Durability, Battery Appearance, Display Durability, and Display Appearance. Another half of the participants were given escalation options organized in a way by Features, such that allocating in the following order: Battery Durability, Display Durability, Battery Appearance, and Display Durability.\n\nThese manipulations were not relevant to our research question.

Simply, because resources are limited, people may allocate resources according to the following three principles: \n\n1.\tAllocate according to performance: Resources have to be allocated according to prospect, maximizing the allocation to projects with good performance and minimizing the allocation to projects with poor performance.\n\n2.\tAllocate according to need: Some projects need new resources to avoid its failure. Allocation priority should be given to these projects.\n\n3.\tEqually allocate: Resources should be equally allocated to all projects because we cannot be certain about the prospect and need of these projects in the future. \u201c\n\nAfter that, participants ranked which principle is the most appropriate, and which one is the most inappropriate. After ranking they rated (1-7) on the extent to which they agreed with the following statements:\n\nTwo items for equity-based principle: \n1.\tGenerally speaking, resources should be allocated according to performance\n2.\tGenerally speaking, allocating resources according to performance is the most appropriate\n\nTwo items for equality-based principle:\n1.\tGenerally speaking, resources should be equally allocated.\n2.\tGenerally speaking, allocating resources equally is the most appropriate\n\nTwo items for need-based principle:\n1.\tGenerally speaking, resources should be allocated according to needs.\n2.\tGenerally speaking, allocating resources according to needs is the most appropriate\n\nIn Phase two, participants completed an escalation of commitment scenario (written in Chinese) modified according to Arkes and Blumer (1985).

After a year, the development finish 75% of the progress and was thinking how to allocate the reminding $1M to four categories. At the same time, there was a new battery already in the market, which is cheaper and more durable than the one the firm was developing.\n\n  At the end, we asked people to rank and rate the three
