This study investigates two puzzles. The first puzzle is whether or not civilian harm by the U.S. military affects public support. Scholars in the \u201cstrategic public\u201d camp point to the public\u2019s preoccupation with winning wars (Sagan and Valentino 2017; Press et al 2013; Gelpi, Feaver and Reifler 2009; Jentleson 1992) and concern for American combatant deaths (Boettcher and Cobb 2006; Eichenberg 2005; Gartner 2008; Feaver and Gelpi 2005; Mueller 1994). From this perspective, foreign civilian harm would only affects public support for war if the public believes this harm is militarily counter-productive. In contrast, the \u201cmoral public\u201d camp points to moral (Johns and Davies forthcoming; Chilton 2015; Walsh 2015; Larson and Savych 2006) and legal (Chilton 2015; Kreps and Wallace 2015; Kreps 2014; Wallace 2013) norms against civilian killing as determinants of public support for war. The second puzzle investigates why Black Americans have opposed U.S. wars at higher levels than White Americans. On the one hand, research suggests that the race gap may be a result of strategic beliefs. Compared to White Americans, Black Americans hold \u201cdovish\u201d foreign policy views consistent with their Democratic partisan leaning (Ender, Rohall and Matthews 2015). As such, Black Americans may be sensitive to civilian harm on the belief that this harm undermines U.S. military effectiveness. On the other hand, researchers have suggested that ethnocentrism and acceptance of racism help explain support for war among White Americans (Green working paper; Kam and Kinder 2007).

more or less likely to accept newcomers. This research is generally characterized by two main lines of reasoning. The first posits that labor market competition makes natives feel economically threatened and leads them to feel antipathy toward immigrants (eg., Dancygier and Donnelly, 2012; Mayda, 2006; Scheve and Slaughter, 2001). The second argues that antipathy toward immigrants emerges not from economic threat, but rather feelings of symbolic, or cultural, threat (eg., Citrin et al., 1997; Kalkan, Layman and Uslaner, 2009; Sniderman and Hagendoorn, 2007). On balance, the latter view has received more empirical support (see: Hainmueller and Hopkins, 2014b). In general, it has focused on how immigrants\u2019 language abilities, race, religion, and compliance with norms shape natives\u2019 opinions about them. The project proposed here will examine how immigrants\u2019 political attitudes may matter. Specifically, it asks: how does an immigrant agreeing or disagreeing with a native-born citizen about politics affect the citizen\u2019s attitude toward that immigrant? Answering this question entails, for the first time, integrating the political science literature on public opinion toward immigrants with the social psychology literature on ideological conflict. In general, people prefer those who agree with them over those who do not. Attitudinal similarity has often been shown to supersede considerations of similarity based on race, gender, and social status (Erwin, 1971; Crano, 1997; Fawcett and Markson, 2010). The \u201cideological conflict hypothesis\u201d argues that similarity-liking applies to politics as well: despite conservatives\u2019 reputation for intolerance, people across the political spectrum have been shown to be equally willing to express negative attitudes towards and even discriminate against others if they disagree with them (Brandt et al., 2014).

The estimand I aim to recover is the Av- erage Marginal Component Effect (AMCE) conditional on respondents\u2019 pre-treatment responses to the four issue questions and the party identification question. The AMCE is the average difference in the probability of an immigrant being preferred for permanent residency/citizenship in the binary outcome question when two different values of an at- tribute are compared, where the average is calculated over all possible combinations of the other attribute values. Mathematically, the estimand can be written as: \u03c0(t1, t0, p(t)) = E[Yi(t1, Tijk[\u2212l], Ti[\u2212j]k) \u2212 Yi(t0, Tijk[\u2212l], Ti[\u2212j]k)], where Tijk[\u2212l] denotes the vector of L-1 treatment attributes for respondent i\u2019s jth profile in choice task k without the lth component. Inverse-probability weights (IPW) will be applied to take into consideration the fact that attributes do not have equivalent probabilities of assignment to treatment because the Muslim attribute level cannot appear with the country of origin attribute levels Mexico, Guatemala or Poland.", "q18": "Canada, United States", "q19": "Canada: 2,500; USA: 1,000", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes",

In a 2x2 factorial design, we assigned 879 postcode sectors located within 40 constituencies to four groups: one control group, one group that receives a number of voter registration videos via Instagram and Snapchat, one group that receives turnout encouragement videos via Instagram and Snapchat, and one group that received both voter registration and GOTV ads. These messages are targeted towards young people aged between 18 and 35 years, and feature social media influencers. The voter registration videos appear in postcode sectors assigned to the treatment group in the week before the voter registration deadline on 26 November. The GOTV ads appear on Tuesday and Wednesday 10 and 11 December. After the election, we will collect voter registration and turnout data at the polling station level (polling stations can perfectly be matched to postcode sectors) to test whether the campaign increased voter registration and voter turnout.

We design a survey experiment to empirically examine several hypotheses. We first assess whether respondents exposed to information about a violent event have lower perceptions of electoral integrity than those receiving neutral information about the election.

We next assess whether and how the partisan identity of the alleged perpetrator of election violence influences citizens\u2019 responses to information about electoral violence. We examine how the win/loss status of the perpetrator influences citizens\u2019 responses to information about electoral violence. Our rationale is that respondents will see losing candidates as \u201csore losers\u201d who instigate violence to protest election outcomes.

Understanding perceptions is important for interpreting the effects of violence on attitudes, particularly if such perceptions are shaped not just by objective information about violence, but also by biases or misinformation.

The assignment to the experimental condition was done at the level of the individual, while maintaining a gender split across the entire sample by blocking on gender at the PSU level. The control group received a neutral vignette without an experimental prime, simply reminding people about the past election. The two control groups, in addition to the neutral vignette, also received an experimental prime describing an incidence of electoral violence taking place during the campaign. Across the two treatment conditions the alleged political party instigating the incidence differed. The event description was fictional, but closely resembled events described in actual newspaper reporting of violent events in West Bengal before the 2019 elections, both to enhance the credibility of the prime, as well as for ethical considerations. Specifically, the vignette describes an attack against a polling agent, but randomly varies the partisan identity of the perpetrator.

In the experiment, the respondents were randomly assigned to a control group, or one of two treatment groups, all of equal size (yielding 360 respondents per group). The assignment to the experimental condition was done at the level of the individual, while maintaining a gender split across the entire sample by blocking on gender at the PSU level. The control group received a neutral vignette without an experimental prime, simply reminding people about the past election. The two control groups, in addition to the neutral vignette, also received an experimental prime describing an incidence of electoral violence taking place during the campaign. Across the two treatment conditions the alleged political party instigating the incidence differed. The event description was fictional, but closely resembled events described in actual newspaper reporting of violent events in West Bengal before the 2019 elections, both to enhance the credibility of the prime, as well as for ethical considerations. Specifically, the vignette describes an attack against a polling agent, but randomly varies the partisan identity of the perpetrator. Similar events involving both treatments can be found in news articles. After being presented with the vignette, citizens indicate how they perceive the integrity and legitimacy of the electoral process, which is our dependent variable.", "q18": "India", "q19": "1080

situations of conflict, ingroup criticism - criticism that members of a given social group direct towards their fellow ingroup members or towards the group itself - can help prevent negative intergroup outcomes. But one factor that could determine the effectiveness of ingroup criticism is the receptiveness of others. This study tests other ingroup members\u2019 receptiveness to two frames for criticism: A moral frame, which justifies the criticism by arguing that the criticized ingroup behavior is immoral, and a pragmatic frame, which argues that the criticized behavior is harmful to the group\u2019s interests. These frames are tested in an experiment involving participants in several dozen focus groups, each with 3\u201310 Jewish Israeli participants, in Haifa, Israel. The topic of discussion for these focus groups centered on the killing of a neutralized Palestinian attacker by an Israeli soldier in March, 2016, and specifically addressed whether or not the soldier\u2019s actions should have been condemned by prominent Israeli political and military leaders as it was. The experimental treatment was delivered through a confederate who participated in these groups as if he were also a research subject. In a third of the groups, the confederate took a neutral position; in the other two-thirds, he argued in favor of condemnation from either a moral or pragmatic frame. To measure the effect of these frames, after the focus group, participants provided measures of their willingness to engage in ingroup criticism themselves, their approval of criticism coming from other ingroup members, and their willingness to compromise with the outgroup (Palestinians). There was also a true control, where some participants who didn\u2019t participate in any group answer the same outcome questions. It is hypothesized that results from this experiment will show that a moral frame causes people to become more critical of the soldier\u2019s actions and more supportive of leaders\u2019 criticism, but that the confederate will incur a backlash from other ingroup members who will rate him/her lower than other participants.

This study tests other ingroup members\u2019 receptiveness to two frames for criticism: A moral frame, which justifies the criticism by arguing that the criticized ingroup behavior is immoral, and a pragmatic frame, which argues that the criticized behavior is harmful to the group\u2019s interests. These frames are tested in an experiment involving participants in several dozen focus groups, each with 3\u201310 Jewish Israeli participants, in Haifa, Israel. The topic of discussion for these focus groups centered on the killing of a neutralized Palestinian attacker by an Israeli soldier in March, 2016, and specifically addressed whether or not the soldier\u2019s actions should have been condemned by prominent Israeli political and military leaders as it was. The experimental treatment was delivered through a confederate who participated in these groups as if he were also a research subject. In a third of the groups, the confederate took a neutral position; in the other two-thirds, he argued in favor of condemnation from either a moral or pragmatic frame. To measure the effect of these frames, after the focus group, participants provided measures of their willingness to engage in ingroup criticism themselves, their approval of criticism coming from other ingroup members, and their willingness to compromise with the outgroup (Palestinians). There was also a true control, where some participants who didn\u2019t participate in any group answer the same outcome questions. It is hypothesized that results from this experiment will show that a moral frame causes people to become more critical of the soldier\u2019s actions and more supportive of leaders\u2019 criticism, but that the confederate will incur a backlash from other ingroup members who will rate him/her lower than other participants.

For most of U.S. history, ancestry has determined who is classified as either \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cwhite.\u201d The hypodescent rule, which was codified into law, stipulated that a single drop of African blood made a person \u201cblack\u201d (Davis 1991). However, some scholars argue that the rules of racial classification are now in flux (Alba; Gans 2012). The post-1965 immigration waves, originating mostly from Asia and Latin America, have complicated the old U.S. white/black racial binary. These new immigrants often do not neatly fit into either white or black categories. Further, their offspring often marry native whites giving rise to a growing multiracial population. Scholars are unsure how multiracials will come to be classified by the white majority and/or whether the hypodescent rule will apply to them (Lee and Bean 2004). Some claim that their descendants will be accepted as \u201cwhite\u201d particularly if they are light skinned and middle class. However, others envision a different future, in which some Latinos and Asians continue to be racialized as \u201cnon- white\u201d (Bonilla-Silva 2004). In addition, there is growing sociological evidence that non- biological social factors can shape perceived race such as one\u2019s romantic partners (Flores 2018), class background (Freeman et al. 2011), and even criminal record (Saperstein and Penner 2010). This evidence suggests that the rules of racial classification may be becoming more flexible, moving away from ancestry as the sole race criterion. In this survey experiment, we seek to uncover the current rules of racial classification in the U.S. by exploring the role that biological factors like ancestry and skin color play in shaping perceived race. In addition, we will assess the relative weight of non-biological social and cultural factors such as language, class background, and religion in shaping racial classification. Given that perceived racial status continues to shape people\u2019s lives (Pager 2008), it is crucial to understand the rules that govern racial classification in the U.S. today. This experiment will contribute to key theoretical debates in sociological research on racial classification, ancestry, and group boundaries."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "In this survey experiment, we will examine the effect of biological, social, and cultural factors in shaping perceived race in the U.S. Our independent variables are: religion, skin color, occupation, name, primary language spoken at home, and genetic ancestry test results. These attributes were selected based on their importance in shaping perceptions of race (Bonilla-Silva 2004; Freeman et al. 2011; Garcia and Abascal 2016). Following a proposed Census 2020 ethnic identification question, our respondents will be able to classify each profile in one of six different racial/ethnic groups: white, black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, Native American, and Middle Eastern/North African. These will be our dependent variables. Based on prior literature, we hypothesize that biological markers like skin color and ancestry test results will be especially impactful for \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cblack\u201d categories. We expect that lighter skin tones and European ancestry will result in higher probabilities of being classified as \u201cwhite.\u201d In contrast, we expect darker skin tones and African ancestry to increase the odds of \u201cblack\u201d classification. In contrast, we expect that cultural and social markers will be especially important for the other ethnoracial groups. We expect that the probabilities of \u201cLatino\u201d classification will significantly increase when profiles signal Catholic religion, Spanish language, and typical Spanish names. Similarly, we expect that Asian names and languages will significantly increase classification as \u201cAsian.\u201d We do not expect a strong effect for religion in the case of Asians given the diversity of Asians\u2019 religious affiliations (Ecklund and Park 2007). We expect religion to be a particularly important cue for MENA identification. We expect being Muslim, speaking Arabic, and having a Middle-Eastern name to significantly increase MENA classification. With regards to classification as Native-American, we also expect indigenous names along with speaking an indigenous language to be important factors. Based on prior literature, we expect occupational status, a strong marker of class background, to shape perceived race (Freeman et al. 2011). More specifically, given current ethnoracial inequalities in the U.S., we expect that a high occupational status will increase the odds of white and Asian classification. In turn, we expect a negative effect of occupational status on black, Latino, and Native American classifications. In addition, we will conduct several interaction tests. We will test whether these patterns vary by whether respondents have taken an ancestry test themselves. We will also test whether living in the U.S. South, an area known for particularly rigid racial boundaries, interacts with our subjects\u2019 responses. Lastly, we will test whether skin color interacts with our other treatments. This will test whether and how physical signals of race\u2014skin color\u2014constrain or amplify the impact of other signals of race."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "To address these questions, we will use a paired conjoint survey experiment on a representative sample of 1,500 non-Hispanic adult U.S. residents. YouGov, an independent polling firm, will apply this experiment. In the experiment, respondents will compare the profiles of two individuals side by side that list a number of individual traits and classify their race. This allows us to test the independent effect of each dimension on perceived race net of all other attributes, as well as explore interactions among the attributes. The individual traits are: religion, skin color, occupation, name, primary language spoken at home, and genetic ancestry test results. We use a survey experiment because it lets us compare the effects of multiple immigrant attributes on public perceptions (Schachter 2016). Our conjoint design (Hainmueller, Hopkins, and Yamamoto 2014) allows us to create profiles of hypothetical individuals who vary along several cultural, social, and phenotypic dimensions. In the experiment respondents read a short passage, which introduces the task by saying, \u201cWe are interested in studying how people classify the race/ethnicity of others. You will be presented with pairs of profiles describing different individuals living in the United States. For each pair of profiles, please look at the information carefully, and then indicate how you would classify each person\u2019s race/ethnicity. There are no correct or incorrect answers for this, we just want to understand how people make these classifications. Even if you aren\u2019t entirely sure, please indicate your best guess about the race/ethnicity of each person\u201d (see Design Appendix). They are then presented with two randomly assigned profiles and are asked, \u201cHow would you classify these individuals? (please chose the single best category for each individual)\u201d Response options are: White, Black, Native American, Hispanic, Middle Eastern/North African (MENA), and Asian.

For most of U.S. history, ancestry has determined who is classified as either \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cwhite.\u201d The hypodescent rule, which was codified into law, stipulated that a single drop of African blood made a person \u201cblack\u201d (Davis 1991). However, some scholars argue that the rules of racial classification are now in flux (Alba; Gans 2012). The post-1965 immigration waves, originating mostly from Asia and Latin America, have complicated the old U.S. white/black racial binary. These new immigrants often do not neatly fit into either white or black categories. Further, their offspring often marry native whites giving rise to a growing multiracial population. Scholars are unsure how multiracials will come to be classified by the white majority and/or whether the hypodescent rule will apply to them (Lee and Bean 2004). Some claim that their descendants will be accepted as \u201cwhite\u201d particularly if they are light skinned and middle class. However, others envision a different future, in which some Latinos and Asians continue to be racialized as \u201cnon- white\u201d (Bonilla-Silva 2004). In addition, there is growing sociological evidence that non- biological social factors can shape perceived race such as one\u2019s romantic partners (Flores 2018), class background (Freeman et al. 2011), and even criminal record (Saperstein and Penner 2010). This evidence suggests that the rules of racial classification may be becoming more flexible, moving away from ancestry as the sole race criterion. In this survey experiment, we seek to uncover the current rules of racial classification in the U.S. by exploring the role that biological factors like ancestry and skin color play in shaping perceived race. In addition, we will assess the relative weight of non-biological social and cultural factors such as language, class background, and religion in shaping racial classification. Given that perceived racial status continues to shape people\u2019s lives (Pager 2008), it is crucial to understand the rules that govern racial classification in the U.S. today. This experiment will contribute to key theoretical debates in sociological research on racial classification, ancestry, and group boundaries.", "q16": "In this survey experiment, we will examine the effect of biological, social, and cultural factors in shaping perceived race in the U.S. Our independent variables are: religion, skin color, occupation, name, primary language spoken at home, and genetic ancestry test results. These attributes were selected based on their importance in shaping perceptions of race (Bonilla-Silva 2004; Freeman et al. 2011; Garcia and Abascal 2016). Following a proposed Census 2020 ethnic identification question, our respondents will be able to classify each profile in one of six different racial/ethnic groups: white, black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, Native American, and Middle Eastern/North African. These will be our dependent variables. Based on prior literature, we hypothesize that biological markers like skin color and ancestry test results will be especially impactful for \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cblack\u201d categories. We expect that lighter skin tones and European ancestry will result in higher probabilities of being classified as \u201cwhite.\u201d In contrast, we expect darker skin tones and African ancestry to increase the odds of \u201cblack\u201d classification. In contrast, we expect that cultural and social markers will be especially important for the other ethnoracial groups. We expect that the probabilities of \u201cLatino\u201d classification will significantly increase when profiles signal Catholic religion, Spanish language, and typical Spanish names. Similarly, we expect that Asian names and languages will significantly increase classification as \u201cAsian.\u201d We do not expect a strong effect for religion in the case of Asians given the diversity of Asians\u2019 religious affiliations (Ecklund and Park 2007). We expect religion to be a particularly important cue for MENA identification. We expect being Muslim, speaking Arabic, and having a Middle-Eastern name to significantly increase MENA classification. With regards to classification as Native-American, we also expect indigenous names along with speaking an indigenous language to be important factors. Based on prior literature, we expect occupational status, a strong marker of class background, to shape perceived race (Freeman et al. 2011). More specifically, given current ethnoracial inequalities in the U.S., we expect that a high occupational status will increase the odds of white and Asian classification. In turn, we expect a negative effect of occupational status on black, Latino, and Native American classifications. In addition, we will conduct several interaction tests. We will test whether these patterns vary by whether respondents have taken an ancestry test themselves. We will also test whether living in the U.S. South, an area known for particularly rigid racial boundaries, interacts with our subjects\u2019 responses. Lastly, we will test whether skin color interacts with our other treatments. This will test whether and how physical signals of race\u2014skin color\u2014constrain or amplify the impact of other signals of race.", "q17": "To address these questions, we will use a paired conjoint survey experiment on a representative sample of 1,500 non-Hispanic adult U.S. residents. YouGov, an independent polling firm, will apply this experiment. In the experiment, respondents will compare the profiles of two individuals side by side that list a number of individual traits and classify their race. This allows us to test the independent effect of each dimension on perceived race net of all other attributes, as well as explore interactions among the attributes. The individual traits are: religion, skin color, occupation, name, primary language spoken at home, and genetic ancestry test results. We use a survey experiment because it lets us compare the effects of multiple immigrant attributes on public perceptions (Schachter 2016). Our conjoint design (Hainmueller, Hopkins, and Yamamoto 2014) allows us to create profiles of hypothetical individuals who vary along several cultural, social, and phenotypic dimensions. In the experiment respondents read a short passage, which introduces the task by saying, \u201cWe are interested in studying how people classify the race/ethnicity of others. You will be presented with pairs of profiles describing different individuals living in the United States. For each pair of profiles, please look at the information carefully, and then indicate how you would classify each person\u2019s race/ethnicity. There are no correct or incorrect answers for this, we just want to understand how people make these classifications. Even if you aren\u2019t entirely sure, please indicate your best guess about the race/ethnicity of each person\u201d (see Design Appendix). They are then presented with two randomly assigned profiles and are asked, \u201cHow would you classify these individuals? (please chose the single best category for each individual)\u201d Response options are: White, Black, Native American, Hispanic, Middle Eastern/North African (MENA), and Asian. Respondents separately assess each individual profile. We use responses to this question as the dependent variable in our main analysis.
