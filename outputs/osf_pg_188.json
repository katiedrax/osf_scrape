Participants\u2019 evaluations (i.e., whether the events described in the testimony depicted rape or consensual sex) were measured every second as they watched the video of the victim testifying. Specifically, participants moved a slider between two scale endpoints (1 = consensual sex, 100 = rape) when responding to this measure. Using this design, we investigated how participants evaluated specific events described in this testimony (i.e., the rape event), by recording the position of the slider during certain parts of the video. After participants watched the video, they were also asked how likely it was that the defendant was guilty of committing rape. Contrary to our predictions, across both studies, participants in both testimony conditions did not differ in their likelihood of finding the defendant guilty of rape. However, participants who watched the testimony where the rape event was presented first were more likely to evaluate this event as rape compared to those who watched the testimony presented in a chronological order.\n\nThe findings of the two studies described above suggest that presenting the rape event first to participants may have allowed them to evaluate the key evidence (i.e., the rape event) as accurately depicting rape. However, it remains unclear whether ordering the testimony in this way had any effect on participants\u2019 perceptions of the overall case (i.e., their perceptions of defendant guilt). Another method of assessing participants\u2019 perceptions of the overall case may be to ask them what they think occurred during the events described by the victim (i.e., construct a story). According to the Story Model (Pennington &amp; Hastie, 1993), jurors organise the information presented to them at trial into a story of what they think occurred during the alleged crime. To construct this story, jurors will often rely on their schemas related to the crime as well as the evidence presented during the trial. As such, the type of story a juror constructs will often indicate whether they perceive the events alleged as depicting rape or consensual sex. \n\nFurthermore, the story a juror constructs goes on to play an important role during deliberation. According to the Story Sampling Model (Devine, 2012), one-way jurors deliberate is by sharing their stories with the other members of the jury. As a group, the jury will then decide which story they think best accounts for what occurred in the alleged crime. A story that is coherent, and consistent with jurors\u2019 schemas related to the crime, as well as the evidence presented during the trial, will likely be accepted by the jury as the best story (Pennington &amp; Hastie, 1993). The jury will then attempt to match the accepted story to the verdict that fits best (Devine, 2012). As such, during the deliberation in a rape trial, jurors who listen to a coherent story that matches their expectations of what occurs in a typical rape may be more likely to believe that the defendant is guilty. In contrast, jurors who listen to a coherent story that matches their expectations of what occurs in typical consensual sex may be more likely to believe that the defendant is not guilty. It is therefore critical to investigate whether changing the order in which events are presented in the victim\u2019s testimony influences the type of stories (i.e., rape stories vs consensual sex stories, coherent vs incoherent stories) mock jurors construct, from the perspective of other mock jurors. \n\nThe aim of the current study is to investigate whether changing the order in which the victim\u2019s testimony is presented causes mock jurors to construct different types of stories of what occurred during the alleged rape, from the perspective of different mock jurors. To investigate this, we will conduct the study in two phases. In phase 1, participants will construct stories of what they think occurred during the alleged rape after they watch a testimony where the rape event is presented first, or the events are presented in a chronological order. Pennington and Hastie (1986) assessed the type of stories mock jurors created by having them \u201cthink aloud\u201d \u2013 that is, say out loud exactly what they were thinking about the case after watching a video of the evidence presented at trial. As such, in phase 1 of the current study, we plan to ask participants to think aloud as they say what they think happened on the night of the alleged rape.

A previous social-belonging intervention conducted at University of Waterloo found that women did underperform academically relative to men, at least those who were in male-dominated STEM majors, and that a social-belonging intervention erased this gap (Walton, Logel, et al., 2015). \n\nHowever, that study found underperformance, and treatment effects, only in majors in which women made up fewer than 20% of students. Data on  the gender-diversity of women\u2019s particular major within their STEM program was unavailable at this stage of the project. We were uncertain of whether we would be able to detect effects of the belonging intervention without being able to consider students\u2019 majors, and the proportion of women in them.\n\nThe goal of this project was to understand and improve student outcomes at University of Waterloo by developing a tool in the form of an online reading and writing activity, to promote adaptive belonging mindsets, designing a platform on which it could be implemented, and testing its effectiveness. The secondary purpose was to advance psychological theory by investigating for whom, and in which contexts, belonging interventions are effective and what effects, beyond academic outcomes, they may have.\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Notes\n\n\u2022\tAll the analyses will be conducted separately by STEM department: Math, Engineering and Physics.  The programs differ meaningfully in their cultures, student body, and course of study. The treatment was adapted from previous materials designed for engineering students (Walton, Logel, et al., 2015) and then was customized to refer to math- and physics-related issues. Consistent with the idea that these should be treated like three separate interventions, basic, preliminary analyses conducted on the first two cohorts of data for a report to the university staff, done before preregistering, found a different pattern of results across programs.  \n\n\u2022\tWe did do any tests for program drop out because of the way STEM programs are structured at University of Waterloo: Degree-completion rates are over 80% for mathematics and engineering (data are not easily available for physics) and the programs have course paths to keep students who fail classes in their first year in the program, hence the test would be underpowered.\n\n\u2022\tExcitement measure was added as a distractor to orient students away from the seeming negativity of the previous questions.

A previous social-belonging intervention conducted at University of Waterloo found that women did underperform academically relative to men, at least those who were in male-dominated STEM majors, and that a social-belonging intervention erased this gap (Walton, Logel, et al., 2015). \n\nHowever, that study found underperformance, and treatment effects, only in majors in which women made up fewer than 20% of students. Data on  the gender-diversity of women\u2019s particular major within their STEM program was unavailable at this stage of the project. We were uncertain of whether we would be able to detect effects of the belonging intervention without being able to consider students\u2019 majors, and the proportion of women in them.\n\nThe goal of this project was to understand and improve student outcomes at University of Waterloo by developing a tool in the form of an online reading and writing activity, to promote adaptive belonging mindsets, designing a platform on which it could be implemented, and testing its effectiveness. The secondary purpose was to advance psychological theory by investigating for whom, and in which contexts, belonging interventions are effective and what effects, beyond academic outcomes, they may have.\n", "q4": "Notes\n\n\u2022\tAll the analyses will be conducted separately by STEM department: Math, Engineering and Physics.

Consistent with the idea that these should be treated like three separate interventions, basic, preliminary analyses conducted on the first two cohorts of data for a report to the university staff, done before preregistering, found a different pattern of results across programs.  \n\n\u2022\tWe did do any tests for program drop out because of the way STEM programs are structured at University of Waterloo: Degree-completion rates are over 80% for mathematics and engineering (data are not easily available for physics) and the programs have course paths to keep students who fail classes in their first year in the program, hence the test would be underpowered.\n\n\u2022\tExcitement measure was added as a distractor to orient students away from the seeming negativity of the previous questions.

We did not have any hypotheses about it.\n\n\u2022\tClose Friends Combined (Follow up) \u2013 Average of the mean of Close Friends (Follow up) and average of Friends \u2013 How Close for each friend (Follow up) after standardization.\n\n\u2022\tAcademic Behaviours (Follow up) \u2013 Mean of academic behaviours (Follow up).\n\n\u2022\tExtracurricular Sum (Follow up) \u2013 Sum of the 3 extracurricular activities \u2013 How Involved items. \n\n\u2022\tAcademic Integration Index (Follow up) \u2013 was computed by first standardizing and then averaging the following variables: mean of Close Friends Combined (Follow up), Mentorship (Follow up), Academic Integration (Follow up).  \n\n\u2022\tSubjective Wellbeing Index \u2013 (Follow up) \u2013 the average of Life Satisfaction (Follow up) and Short flourishing (Follow up) after standardization. \n\n\u2022\tAll hypotheses will be tested only for students in majors were females represent &lt; 20% of the student body. \n\n\u2022\tExploratory Hypotheses \u2013 exploratory hypotheses were run because we thought that other dependent variables could be affected by the intervention but based on the literature we are unsure as reported results are conflicted.\n\nMain Hypotheses:\n\n1.\tBelonging Expectations (Initial) \u2013 We expect higher belonging expectation scores for females in the affirmation condition compared to the control. \n\n2.\tBelonging (Follow up) - We expect higher belonging scores in the intervention (vs. control) for females.\n\n3.\tBelonging Uncertainty (Follow up) \u2013 We expect lower belonging uncertainty in the intervention (vs. control) condition for females.\n\n4.\tSTEM GPA (Follow up)  \u2013 We expect higher STEM GPA in the intervention (vs. control) for females.

"Working memory (WM) is a cognitive system that provides access to temporarily maintained information for further processing (Miyake &amp; Shah, 1999). Visual WM (VWM) refers to maintaining and directing the visual information needed for higher cognitive processing in the present moment (Luck &amp; Vogel, 2013). WM performance is a mixture of the quantitative number of objects that can be held in WM (capacity) and the qualitative resolution of the representations of these objects (precision). \n\nNon-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have gained growing research interest as a promising intervention tool to enhance WM performance  (Andrews et al., 2011; Birba et al., 2017; Brunoni &amp; Vanderhasselt, 2014; Bystad et al., 2016; Fregni et al., 2005; Hoon Ohn et al., 2008; Molaee-Ardekani et al., 2013; Nikolin et al., 2017). TDCS delivers weak current from anode to cathode through the skull, generating electric fields to modulate cortical activities and facilitate neuroplasticity (Ruffini et al., 2013; Roche et al., 2015). \n\nMore recently, inconsistent tDCS effects on WM performance have been reported. Some research has found that WM capacity can be improved by tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and/or posterior parietal cortex (PPC; Andrews et al., 2011; Arciniega et al., 2018; Fregni et al., 2005; Li et al., 2017). Likewise, one study by Heinen et al. (2016) showed that PPC stimulation can potentially enhance WM precision. However, other authors found no effects on WM performance by tDCS over either or both brain regions (Brunoni &amp; Vanderhasselt, 2014; Friedrich et al., 2019; Horvath et al., 2015; Robison et al., 2017). These contrary findings suggest further investigation in tDCS effects on both WM capacity and precision, comparing the stimulations between DLPFC and PPC. \n\nWang et al. (2019) recently reported a particularly intriguing finding. They tested the effects of 15-minute anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC and the right PPC relative to a sham condition for 20 participants in a within-subject design. VWM capacity and precision were measured with a continuous reproduction task. In this task, participants memorised the orientations of 2, 4, or 6 bars on a screen. Participants were then asked to reproduce the orientation of one of the bars by mouse-click. The deviation of the reproduced orientation from the original orientation was then used to estimate VWM capacity and precision for each participant, set size, and stimulation condition. Wang et al. observed a selective increase in VWM capacity at set size 6 after PPC relative to sham stimulation, but not after DLPFC stimulation, any other set size, or on VWM precision. \n\nThe potential of brief tDCS to enhance VWM capacity renders it important to test the replicability of this finding. In addition, several aspects of Wang et al.\u2019s (2019) study are potentially problematic and warrant addressing. First, the small sample size translates into low statistical power even for moderate effect sizes, and low statistical power can lead to false-positive findings (Button et al., 2013). The reported effect size is very large (d = 1.028), but this may reflect an overestimate (cf. Halsey et al., 2015). Second, Wang et al. (2019) administered only 60 trials per design cell, which may have led to unreliable estimates of VWM capacity and precision. Third, Wang et al. (2019) failed to assign an equal number of participants to every possible counterbalanced sequence. Therefore, carryover effects across sessions (e.g., practice) have not been adequately controlled in the given VWM tasks. Finally, because Wang et al. (2019) used rotated bars as stimuli, the unique angles of their stimuli effectively ranged only from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0, leaving room for developing task-specific strategies. Some, but not all, participants may have realized they could simply memorize the location of just one end of the bar rather than the actual orientation of the bar, thereby making the task considerably easier. This could be problematic in particular in combination with the incomplete counterbalancing and the small number of participants.\n\nIn this preregistered experiment, we will conceptually replicate Wang et al.\u2019s (2019) study and address the potential issues of their study by using a bigger sample size, larger number of trials, complete counterbalancing, and stimuli that use the full space of possible angles (360\u00b0).", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-03-12T16:53:45.735724", "date_modified": "2020-03-12T15:14:36.033079", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["tDCS", "working memory"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": null, "analytics_key": "cba3f553d941aeb2223b05775c50c06ce85b58d46c4ac3e6c0d2b88106e8202b00c8ee0ac6f123b843a359f70d8934652bd4e381517266244e9e23adb383c50593fdb85380751924ceb54a8ce03cb41ca4b575fd07c6f03387e922189a8965fdf1f3b82a7793de3fdc529a361d8395d4940ea6b0712c1a5b826539332c85efd295008082956c0173fe60bf761b2fe1a9", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-03-12T16:53:45.716505", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "The tDCS effect on visual working memory over DLPFC and PPC"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Shuangke Jiang, Myles Jones, Claudia C. von Bastian"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Working memory (WM) is a cognitive system that provides access to temporarily maintained information for further processing (Miyake &amp; Shah, 1999).

In each one of the sessions, participants will receive stimulation (15 min at 2 mA, 35 cm2) on the DLPFC, stimulation on the PPC, or a sham stimulation on either DLPFC or PPC. In the sham stimulation, tDCS is turned off after ~30 seconds, producing the expected typical \u2018tingling\u2019 sensation on the scalp and, thus, providing an effective control condition to minimise placebo effects. The order of three sessions will be counterbalanced across participants. \n\nAfter the stimulation, VWM capacity and precision will be measured using continuous orientation reproduction tasks.

The fit of the two models will be compared by both the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). In case the AIC and BIC provide different conclusions, we will use the model favoured by the BIC. \n\nThe SMM is characterised by a mixture of a circular von Mises distribution and a uniform distribution. Specifically, the distribution of recall errors is a weighted summation of two components. The first component is the height of uniform distribution (g), representing random guess responses. This can be used to calculate the probability of the remembered target stimulus (the proportion of the von Mises distribution; Pm = 1-g).  Capacity (K) is the product of Pm and the set size (K = Pm*N).\n\nThe second component is the width of Pm, which can be presented by the circular standard deviation (SD) of the von Mises distribution. A smaller SD is interpreted as better precision of VWM. The precision is denoted by the inverse of the SD (SD^-1). \n\nCalculated parameters (i.e., capacity K and precision SD^-1) in the sham condition will be subtracted from that in active PPC and DLPFC conditions for each set size.

In addition, Bayes factors will be calculated to indicate the strength of evidence for the absence or presence of effects. \n\nHypothesis 2 (neither PPC nor DLPFC stimulation will improve VWM precision): Analyses will be analogous to those for testing Hypothesis 1, with the only difference that the dependent variable will be the precision estimates (\u2206SD^-1).\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q21": {"extra": [], "value": "P value &lt;.05 criteria will be used to interpret significant effects of main effects and interactions.

Visual WM (VWM) refers to maintaining and directing the visual information needed for higher cognitive processing in the present moment (Luck &amp; Vogel, 2013). WM performance is a mixture of the quantitative number of objects that can be held in WM (capacity) and the qualitative resolution of the representations of these objects (precision). \n\nNon-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have gained growing research interest as a promising intervention tool to enhance WM performance  (Andrews et al., 2011; Birba et al., 2017; Brunoni &amp; Vanderhasselt, 2014; Bystad et al., 2016; Fregni et al., 2005; Hoon Ohn et al., 2008; Molaee-Ardekani et al., 2013; Nikolin et al., 2017). TDCS delivers weak current from anode to cathode through the skull, generating electric fields to modulate cortical activities and facilitate neuroplasticity (Ruffini et al., 2013; Roche et al., 2015). \n\nMore recently, inconsistent tDCS effects on WM performance have been reported. Some research has found that WM capacity can be improved by tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and/or posterior parietal cortex (PPC; Andrews et al., 2011; Arciniega et al., 2018; Fregni et al., 2005; Li et al., 2017). Likewise, one study by Heinen et al. (2016) showed that PPC stimulation can potentially enhance WM precision. However, other authors found no effects on WM performance by tDCS over either or both brain regions (Brunoni &amp; Vanderhasselt, 2014; Friedrich et al., 2019; Horvath et al., 2015; Robison et al., 2017). These contrary findings suggest further investigation in tDCS effects on both WM capacity and precision, comparing the stimulations between DLPFC and PPC. \n\nWang et al. (2019) recently reported a particularly intriguing finding. They tested the effects of 15-minute anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC and the right PPC relative to a sham condition for 20 participants in a within-subject design. VWM capacity and precision were measured with a continuous reproduction task. In this task, participants memorised the orientations of 2, 4, or 6 bars on a screen. Participants were then asked to reproduce the orientation of one of the bars by mouse-click. The deviation of the reproduced orientation from the original orientation was then used to estimate VWM capacity and precision for each participant, set size, and stimulation condition. Wang et al. observed a selective increase in VWM capacity at set size 6 after PPC relative to sham stimulation, but not after DLPFC stimulation, any other set size, or on VWM precision. \n\nThe potential of brief tDCS to enhance VWM capacity renders it important to test the replicability of this finding. In addition, several aspects of Wang et al.\u2019s (2019) study are potentially problematic and warrant addressing. First, the small sample size translates into low statistical power even for moderate effect sizes, and low statistical power can lead to false-positive findings (Button et al., 2013). The reported effect size is very large (d = 1.028), but this may reflect an overestimate (cf. Halsey et al., 2015). Second, Wang et al. (2019) administered only 60 trials per design cell, which may have led to unreliable estimates of VWM capacity and precision. Third, Wang et al. (2019) failed to assign an equal number of participants to every possible counterbalanced sequence. Therefore, carryover effects across sessions (e.g., practice) have not been adequately controlled in the given VWM tasks. Finally, because Wang et al. (2019) used rotated bars as stimuli, the unique angles of their stimuli effectively ranged only from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0, leaving room for developing task-specific strategies. Some, but not all, participants may have realized they could simply memorize the location of just one end of the bar rather than the actual orientation of the bar, thereby making the task considerably easier. This could be problematic in particular in combination with the incomplete counterbalancing and the small number of participants.\n\nIn this preregistered experiment, we will conceptually replicate Wang et al.\u2019s (2019) study and address the potential issues of their study by using a bigger sample size, larger number of trials, complete counterbalancing, and stimuli that use the full space of possible angles (360\u00b0). \n", "q4": "Two main hypotheses will be tested based on the study results in the original study :\n1.

The same tDCS setup will thus be used in the current study. Equally important, the pilot data were subjected to analysis to develop a feasible analytical workflow (see analysis plan below).\n\nThe pilot data indicated no evidence of tDCS effects on neither VWM capacity nor precision.

Each session will be one of the three stimulation conditions (active DLPFC stimulation, active PPC stimulation and sham stimulation). For the sham condition, half of the participants will receive the sham stimulation over PPC and the other half will receive it over DLPFC. The sequence of all conditions will be counterbalanced (see Randomization). ", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Participants will be recruited through online university systems (online research participants system in the Department of Psychology and the University\u2019s volunteer list), social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), display of flyers throughout the department, and word-of-mouth. Participants will be compensated with an average of \u00a35 per session (\u00a34 for the first session, \u00a35 for the second session, and \u00a36 for the third session). Psychology undergraduate students will receive course credits for the first two sessions and \u00a35 for the third session. \n\nParticipants are included in the study if they meet the following criteria:\n1. Age between 18 and 35 years old.\n2. Proficient English for understanding the task instructions.\n3. Educated to A-level or higher.\n4. Right-handed.\n5. No current diagnosis of neurological, psychological or psychiatric illness. \n6. Normal or corrected-to-normal vision, including no colour blindness. \n7. No neurostimulation within the past week.\n8. No current medication with known side effects on cognition, in particular memory and attention. \n9. No current recreational drug use (e.g., cannabis, cocaine, or methamphetamines). \n\nParticipants who sign up for the study will be invited to three lab sessions. Each session is expected to last for about 60 minutes and will take place in the Department of Psychology building in Sheffield. Upon their first arrival, participants will receive an information sheet and a consent form. Demographic data including age and gender, native language and educational level will also be collected.  In addition, participants will be asked to confirm their eligibility for the study based on the above criteria.  \n\nWe aim to start the study once ethical approval has been obtained, with data collection being completed by 31/05/2020. However, if we do not meet the target sample size, data collection may be completed at a later point at least until the target sample size has been reached.\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "We will manipulate set size (2, 4, or 6 memoranda) and stimulation (DLPFC, PPC, or sham stimulation on either DLPFC or PPC). ", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "The dependent variables will be VWM capacity and precision derived from performance in continuous reproduction tasks. \n\nParticipants will be recruited to attend 3 sessions for different stimulation conditions (active DLPFC, active PPC and sham). Each session will last up to 1 hour (3 hours in total) with an interval of at least 48 hours to allow any possible after effects of tDCS to return to baseline ( \u2018wash out\u2019). In each one of the sessions, participants will receive stimulation (15 min at 2 mA, 35 cm2) on the DLPFC, stimulation on the PPC, or a sham stimulation on either DLPFC or PPC. In the sham stimulation, tDCS is turned off after ~30 seconds, producing the expected typical \u2018tingling\u2019 sensation on the scalp and, thus, providing an effective control condition to minimise placebo effects. The order of three sessions will be counterbalanced across participants. \n\nAfter the stimulation, VWM capacity and precision will be measured using continuous orientation reproduction tasks. Each trial begins with a fixation cross displayed centrally for 1000 ms. Next, two, four or six randomly orientated (0-360\u00b0) isosceles triangles are arranged in a circular manner and appear on the screen for 200 ms, followed by a 1000 ms blank screen. Note that we will not manipulate the blank interval duration as Wang et al. (2019) did, as they did not observe an effect of tDCS in their short-interval (100 ms, labelled sensory memory) condition. Next, one of the displayed triangles is randomly selected as the target stimulus and presented in a random orientation. Participants are instructed to reproduce the original orientation using the mouse. The reaction time and the recall error (i.e., the difference in degrees between the reproduced orientation and the original orientation) will be measured. The recall error will be used to estimate capacity and precision (see Statistical Models). \n\nOnce participants completed practice trials at set size 2 (50 practice trials in Session 1, and 10 practice trials in Sessions 2 and 3), 360 trials at set size 2, 4 and 6 (120 per set size, intermixed) will be administered to measure post-tDCS VWM performance. The VWM task will be executed with Tatool Web (www.tatool-web.com, von Bastian, Locher, &amp; Ruflin, 2013).\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "See Statistical Models.", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "First, recall error will be calculated as the absolute angular difference (from 0 to 180 degrees) between reproduced orientation and presented orientation for each trial. For each stimulation condition and set size separately, VWM capacity and precision will be estimated by fitting the Standard Mixture Model (SMM; Zhang and Luck, 2008) and Swap Mixture Model (SWM; Bays and Husain, 2008) at the recall error distribution using MATLAB 2019a and the MemToolbox (Suchow &amp; Brady, 2013). The fit of the two models will be compared by both the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). In case the AIC and BIC provide different conclusions, we will use the model favoured by the BIC. \n\nThe SMM is characterised by a mixture of a circular von Mises distribution and a uniform distribution. Specifically, the distribution of recall errors is a weighted summation of two components. The first component is the height of uniform distribution (g), representing random guess responses. This can be used to calculate the probability of the remembered target stimulus (the proportion of the von Mises distribution; Pm = 1-g).  Capacity (K) is the product of Pm and the set size (K = Pm*N).\n\nThe second component is the width of Pm, which can be presented by the circular standard deviation (SD) of the von Mises distribution. A smaller SD is interpreted as better precision of VWM. The precision is denoted by the inverse of the SD (SD^-1). \n\nCalculated parameters (i.e., capacity K and precision SD^-1) in the sham condition will be subtracted from that in active PPC and DLPFC conditions for each set size. These normalised values (\u2206k and \u2206SD^-1) will be used for testing the hypotheses. \n\nHypothesis 1 (PPC stimulation will increase VWM capacity, especially at set size 6): \nWe will first run an omnibus ANOVA with two within-subjects factors stimulated region (DLPFC/PPC) and set size (2, 4, 6), and the capacity estimates relative to sham (\u2206k) as the dependent variable. If the interaction is significant, we will follow it up by separate one-way ANOVAs to determine the source of the interaction. Bonferroni-corrected pairwise t-tests and simple-effect analysis will be used to follow up any main effects in the omnibus and the one-way ANOVAs. To replicate Wang et al.'s (2019) analysis, we will further run Bonferroni-corrected paired t-tests against zeros for each region of stimulation and set size, resulting in 6 tests at a corrected alpha-level of .0083. Effect sizes will be estimated with partial eta squared or ANOVA and Cohen's d for t-tests. In addition, Bayes factors will be calculated to indicate the strength of evidence for the absence or presence of effects. \n\nHypothesis 2 (neither PPC nor DLPFC stimulation will improve VWM precision): Analyses will be analogous to those for testing Hypothesis 1, with the only difference that the dependent variable will be the precision estimates (\u2206SD^-1).\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=n9fkp", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/de-1/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "de-1", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "n9fkp", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "n9fkp", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/hqnc5/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "hqnc5", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/92k4w/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "92k4w", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/n9fkp/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n9fkp/"}}], "links": {"first": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json", "last": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "prev": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=187", "next": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=189", "meta": {"total": 5469, "per_page": 10}}}
