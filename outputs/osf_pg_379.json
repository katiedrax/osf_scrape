One experiment considers whether attitudes toward health policy display a status quo bias, in which proposals described as changes from the status quo will be penalized relative to proposals described as a return to a prior status quo.

We will then estimate 2) whether this effect varies by respondents' levels of information (measured via education and media consumption). We will also examine the effects by 3) self-reported health status (having a pre-existing condition and self-reported health status), as well as 4) attitudes toward the parties and Obama (measured via the Obama feeling thermometer, partisanship, and 2016 vote choice). A second experiment instead examines the role of partisan priming. Specifically, some respondents were randomly assigned to report their attitudes toward the ACA after being asked for their 2016 candidate preference and approval/disapproval of Donald Trump, while for others, the order of those questions was reversed.

In another experiment, we seek to understand the role of attitudes and cues related to ethnic/racial groups in shaping ACA-related attitudes. Our survey explained that the ACA had extended insurance to approximately 17 million Americans, and randomly assigned respondents to read an additional clause indicating that 7 million of those people were Hispanic or African American or not. Here, we propose to 1) analyze the overall effects, and then analyze the effects for non-Hispanic white respondents broken out by their 2) political partisanship (party ID, 2016 self-reported vote choice, and Trump feeling thermometer) and 3) attitudes toward these groups, as expressed by the difference in their feeling thermometer ratings of these groups relative to Whites. Following Hetherington (2006), we also propose to examine the results 4) by levels of governmental trust. A fourth experiment, also building off Hetherington (2006), considers the role of low government trust in shaping ACA attitudes. Some respondents received an ideological anti-ACA message while others saw a low-trust anti-ACA message and still others saw no message at all. Here, we will consider the 1) overall effects as well as 2) the effects broken out by respondents' self-reported social trust and governmental trust. We will also 3) examine the results by partisanship, measured via 2016 vote choice and 7-category party ID.

We will examine its 1) overall effects as well as 2) its effects by information (education and media consumption) and 3) by partisanship.

Controlling for subsidy amount and local voting rate differences, the farther that households move in geographic distance, the smaller (more negative) will be the change in voting rates. This is due to a \u2018social dislocation\u2019 effect of moving away from prior networks, other things held equal. Heterogeneous Treatment Effects We anticipate that the treatment will generate heterogeneous treatment effects in a number of well-defined dimensions. Individual variation: 1. Subsidy amounts. 2.

Because of the large income transfer provided by the program there was substantial excess demand, and the government allocated access by conducting lotteries for each new building within the pool of eligible applicants.

H2: The change in political participation will be larger when the subsidy transfer to the household is larger. H3: Controlling for the subsidy amount, households that move across neighborhoods in which the local voting rates have increased more will see larger increases in participation. H4. Controlling for subsidy amount, the larger is the increase in property prices between the old and the new neighborhood, the larger will be the increase in participation. H5. Controlling for subsidy amount and local voting rate differences, the farther that households move in geographic distance, the smaller (more negative) will be the change in voting rates. This is due to a \u2018social dislocation\u2019 effect of moving away from prior networks, other things held equal. Heterogeneous Treatment Effects We anticipate that the treatment will generate heterogeneous treatment effects in a number of well-defined dimensions. Individual variation: 1. Subsidy amounts. 2. Distance moved. 3. Child age at moving. Neighborhood-level variation: 4. Change in local-level political participation. 5.

societal costs. Many policy reforms have sought to address the problem, e,g., by implementing admission thresholds, restructuring the general program, setting up performance measures for the different educations and supporting the creation of more internships (The Danish Government 2014; Munk et al. 2015). However, few of these reforms directly address the motivation and goals of the students themselves, which has been argued to be a large part of their absence and dropout in vocational educations in Denmark (Katznelson and Brown 2011). In this study we seek to use Mental Contrasting with Implementation Intensions (MCII) as a cost-efficient, psychological way of addressing student absence and dropout from vocational training in Denmark. MCII has been shown to affect goal-directed behavior in various fields and settings, especially in the educational setting (Duckworth et al. 2013; Oettingen et al. 2013; Kizilcec and Cohen 2017). The idea is that it is not always enough to have goals. People need to develop a sense of feasibility of the goal \u2013 an expectation of successful goal striving \u2013 and a commitment to these goals. However, the goals may still not succeed in creating goal-directed behavior, because we have a tendency not to consider the impeding reality when constructing the goals. MCII seeks to address these pitfalls in creating goal-directed behavior and succeeding in reaching the goals by instructing people to think about both their goals, why they would like to meet them, which obstacles they will probably face along the way and to plan strategies to overcome these. In a way, MCII is a structured way of thinking about goals, a self-regulation strategy, that may more effectively result in goal fulfillment (Oettingen et al. 2013), making it a type of wise psychological intervention (Walton 2014). Furthermore, we will investigate the influence of social image among adolescents when they attend an education. It is well known that adolescents are more susceptible to peer influence than other age groups and they should also still be under the influence of their parents (Steinberg and Monahan 2007; Steinberg 2014). It has been argued that social image is an important influence when adolescents make educational decisions (Bursztyn and Jensen 2015, 2017). We argue that this social image might change with different reference groups, such that adolescents react differently when they are thinking about their parents as opposed to thinking about their peers as reference groups when making decisions. Therefore, our MCII treatment group is divided into two treatment groups where the students are either presented with questions about their parents\u2019 or their peers\u2019 recognition and a question on how important this reference groups\u2019 recognition is to them before being asked the standard MCII questions. Therefore, we are priming the students to think of either their parents or peers and the students\u2019 own perceptions of how much recognition they would get from these reference groups if they completed their basic education. Lastly, we will examine whether the students\u2019 self-control (Tangney et al. 2004) will moderate the effect of MCII on student absence and dropout. Self-control is thought to moderate the effects of MCII, since people high on self-control may already have a tendency to follow through on plans, while people low on self-control may need some help, especially on forming and sticking to the if-then plans (Oettingen et al. 2013). Therefore, we expect that self-control will moderate the effect of MCII such that the effect is largest among students with low self-control."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Primary hypothesis: H1: MCII will reduce absenteeism of all participating students on average Secondary hypotheses: H2: Priming students to think about peers will reduce absence (relative to priming to think about parents) the more recognition from peers they perceive they will get. H3: The more positive recognition students perceive they will get from peers, the more will the effect of MCII be moderated by priming students to think about their peers (relative to being primed to think about parents. H4: The effect of MCII on absenteeism will be smaller the more self-control students possess. H5: In the long run, we expect similar effects on dropout"}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "Power calculation The experiment will contain 3 experimental groups: Treatment 1 (MCII + parents), Treatment 2 (MCII + peers) and a control group. A power calculation shows that conditional on a sample size of 450 that is fairly evenly distributed among the experimental groups that we will be able to detect an effect-size of around 10-15 percentage points change in dropout and absenteeism from the course with a power of 80%. This partly depends on absenteeism and dropout in the control group (estimated with the Stata command: power twoproportions (.25 .50 .75), n(150 300 450) power(.8)). Recruitment and randomization To test the hypotheses, we designed a field experiment which will be carried out among students at the basic level at the vocational schools Aarhus Tech (N = 436) and SOSU Oestjylland (N = 129) in the fall of 2017. This gives us a population size of 565 students. Students will be asked to answer a survey during school time. Not all students will participate, but we expect to have at least 450 respondents as suggested by the power calculation. Treatments will be embedded in the survey. Students will be randomly assigned individually to one of the three experimental conditions when they initiate the survey. We therefore expect little attrition (only students that do not fill out the whole survey and students without follow-up data). The treatment will be a MCII treatment. The specific sequence of the MCII is the following: First respondents are asked about their desired future; their goals. They are asked to imagine this future as vividly as possible, almost like a fantasy, and then mention and elaborate on the outcomes that they associate with this future. Secondly, they are asked to elaborate on the parts of the present reality that might stand in the way of their future goals. They are asked to mention specific obstacles that might interfere with the goals and then to elaborate vividly on these obstacles and how they might interfere. The last part of MCII is the implementation part: writing an if-then plan that is supposed to address the previously mentioned obstacles (Duckworth et al. 2013; Kizilcec and Cohen 2017). Measures The outcome variables will be both short-term self-assessments and longer term objective measures of absence and dropout from the school. The primary outcome measure will be administrative data on the individual students\u2019 absence from school. To study the mechanisms, we will use items embedded in the survey. Right after having received treatments (or control) the students will be asked about their strength of goal pursuit. This is operationalized as energization (\u201cHow keen are you on completing your basic course?\u201d), future planning (\u201cTo which extent have you made plans on how to complete your basic education?\u201d) and responsibility of reaching desired goals (\u201cTo which extent do you determine whether you will reach your goals with the education?\u201d). To study longer-term outcomes, we will obtain administrative data on the dropout at the individual level from the basic part of the vocational educations from the two schools. The moderator variables, future orientation and self-control, will be collected as part of the survey. Operationalization of future orientation will follow the measure (10 items) outlined in Steinberg et al. (2009) and self-control will be the brief measure obtained in Tangney et al. (2004) (both translated into Danish). Pre-analysis plan The plan of analysis is first to apply the difference-in-means estimator via OLS regression to obtain the average intention-to-treat effect of the two MCII treatments (combined) in comparison with the control group (H1). This will be done using the dependent variables strength of goal pursuit (additive index comprising of the 3 above mentioned items) and the absenteeism measure. A logit specification will be used to analyze the dropout measure, since this outcome will be a dummy (dropout or not). Secondly, to test H2 we interact the students\u2019 perceived recognition from their peers with the treatment of being reminded of their peers and include this interaction term in a OLS regression with both of the interacted variables. To test H3 we interact students\u2019 perceived recognition from peers with the treatment of being reminded of their peers and the MCII treatment. This is a three-way-interaction term and it will be analyzed by including it with all two-way interaction terms and variables in the same OLS regression with the 3 outcome measures as dependent variables. We will test hypothesis H4 by interacting the treatment and control groups with an index measure of self-control (Tangney et al. 2004) and include this interaction term in a OLS regression with both of the interacted variables. H5 is tested in the same way as H1-H4 only with dropout as outcome. Since dropout is binary measure and since it is measured over time, a survival analysis will be employed."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Denmark"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "450"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q32": {"extra": [], "value": "D91, I20"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design", "Survey Methodology"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "The Influence of Social Reference Groups on Behavioral Interventions to Reduce Absenteeism and Dropout from Vocational Education", "q2": "Simon Calmar Andersen | Morten Hjortskov", "q3": "20171025AA", "q4": "10/25/2017 - 07:45", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to any research activities", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "11/1/17", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "No", "q15": "Dropout and absence is a large problem in vocational training in Denmark which has large societal costs. Many policy reforms have sought to address the problem, e,g., by implementing admission thresholds, restructuring the general program, setting up performance measures for the different educations and supporting the creation of more internships (The Danish Government 2014; Munk et al. 2015). However, few of these reforms directly address the motivation and goals of the students themselves, which has been argued to be a large part of their absence and dropout in vocational educations in Denmark (Katznelson and Brown 2011). In this study we seek to use Mental Contrasting with Implementation Intensions (MCII) as a cost-efficient, psychological way of addressing student absence and dropout from vocational training in Denmark. MCII has been shown to affect goal-directed behavior in various fields and settings, especially in the educational setting (Duckworth et al. 2013; Oettingen et al. 2013; Kizilcec and Cohen 2017). The idea is that it is not always enough to have goals. People need to develop a sense of feasibility of the goal \u2013 an expectation of successful goal striving \u2013 and a commitment to these goals. However, the goals may still not succeed in creating goal-directed behavior, because we have a tendency not to consider the impeding reality when constructing the goals. MCII seeks to address these pitfalls in creating goal-directed behavior and succeeding in reaching the goals by instructing people to think about both their goals, why they would like to meet them, which obstacles they will probably face along the way and to plan strategies to overcome these. In a way, MCII is a structured way of thinking about goals, a self-regulation strategy, that may more effectively result in goal fulfillment (Oettingen et al. 2013), making it a type of wise psychological intervention (Walton 2014). Furthermore, we will investigate the influence of social image among adolescents when they attend an education. It is well known that adolescents are more susceptible to peer influence than other age groups and they should also still be under the influence of their parents (Steinberg and Monahan 2007; Steinberg 2014). It has been argued that social image is an important influence when adolescents make educational decisions (Bursztyn and Jensen 2015, 2017). We argue that this social image might change with different reference groups, such that adolescents react differently when they are thinking about their parents as opposed to thinking about their peers as reference groups when making decisions. Therefore, our MCII treatment group is divided into two treatment groups where the students are either presented with questions about their parents\u2019 or their peers\u2019 recognition and a question on how important this reference groups\u2019 recognition is to them before being asked the standard MCII questions. Therefore, we are priming the students to think of either their parents or peers and the students\u2019 own perceptions of how much recognition they would get from these reference groups if they completed their basic education. Lastly, we will examine whether the students\u2019 self-control (Tangney et al. 2004) will moderate the effect of MCII on student absence and dropout. Self-control is thought to moderate the effects of MCII, since people high on self-control may already have a tendency to follow through on plans, while people low on self-control may need some help, especially on forming and sticking to the if-then plans (Oettingen et al. 2013). Therefore, we expect that self-control will moderate the effect of MCII such that the effect is largest among students with low self-control.", "q16": "Primary hypothesis: H1: MCII will reduce absenteeism of all participating students on average Secondary hypotheses: H2: Priming students to think about peers will reduce absence (relative to priming to think about parents) the more recognition from peers they perceive they will get. H3: The more positive recognition students perceive they will get from peers, the more will the effect of MCII be moderated by priming students to think about their peers (relative to being primed to think about parents. H4: The effect of MCII on absenteeism will be smaller the more self-control students possess. H5: In the long run, we expect similar effects on dropout", "q17": "Power calculation The experiment will contain 3 experimental groups: Treatment 1 (MCII + parents), Treatment 2 (MCII + peers) and a control group.

However, it is very hard to single out the independent effect of identity in such studies: predictions based on identity motivation tend to coincide with those based on either rational learning or motivated reasoning. My aim is to construct a test of identity-based political attitude adjustment which excludes the alternative hypotheses based on rational learning or motivated reasoning. I construct an experimental design where (some of) the treatments a) do not provide information for subjects about party positions, b) do not even provide arguments or dilemmas about the issue in focus, but c) manipulate the situational salience of political identity. The major hypothesis is that the increase of situational salience of political identity will lead to attitude adjustment in accordance with perceived group norms (even without providing any information about party postitions).

This latter refers to the direct effect of feelings of affection to a political community. Effects of rational learning and motivated reasoning have been tested extensively. However, it is very hard to single out the independent effect of identity in such studies: predictions based on identity motivation tend to coincide with those based on either rational learning or motivated reasoning. My aim is to construct a test of identity-based political attitude adjustment which excludes the alternative hypotheses based on rational learning or motivated reasoning. I construct an experimental design where (some of) the treatments a) do not provide information for subjects about party positions, b) do not even provide arguments or dilemmas about the issue in focus, but c) manipulate the situational salience of political identity. The major hypothesis is that the increase of situational salience of political identity will lead to attitude adjustment in accordance with perceived group norms (even without providing any information about party postitions). However, this effect of situational salience may disappear if the voter\u2019s baseline identity is extremely strong or extremely weak.", "q16": "H1 The significant increase of salience of political identity, on average, will increase the likelyhood of attitude adjustment in accordance with the perceived position of the voter's preferred political community on a politicized question.

H1.3 The increase of salience of perceived differences of typical/expected opinions on a politicized question between political communities will, in itself, increase the likelyhood of attitude adjustment in accordance with the perceived position of the voter's preferred political community on the politicized question. H2 The increase of situational salience of political identity will not increase the likelyhood of attitude adjustment in accordance with the perceived position of the voter's preferred political community on a non-politicized policy question H3 The increase of salience of political identity will not increase the likelyhood of attitude adjustment in accordance with the perceived position of the voter's preferred political community among politically extremely lowly and highly engaged individuals.", "q17": "I increase the salience of political identity in the treatment conditions.

H2: Senate Liberals are more likely than independent senators to select the \u2018by vote choice in 2015\u2019 view. H3: Female senators are more likely than male senators to select the \u2018by gender\u2019 view. H4: Non-Ontario senators are more likely than Ontario senators to select the \u2018by province\u2019 view.

As such, an additional hypothesis is that religious non-identifiers who receive the evangelical cue may respond in the opposite direction of the cue (that is, take a more liberal position) compared to non-evangelicals in the control condition (hypothesis from existing research). It is also possible, however, that religious non-identifiers also take a sufficiently unified liberal position that the evangelical group cue does not produce a detectable effect on policy attitudes (alternative hypothesis). Drawing on the same anti-evangelical literature, religious non-identifiers who hold liberal policy positions on issues in question and receive the evangelical cue should be more likely to mobilize around the policy issue--in the opposite direction of the evangelical cue--than the religious non-identifiers who do not receive the evangelical cue.
