The PPES contains a scale from 1-5, 1 being \"Never\" and 5 being \"More than 20 times.\" \n\nThe first redundancy analysis model contains two outcome variables:\n1. Perceived pain tolerance. This was measured with a subset of questions on the ACSS. Participants were asked, \"Please read each item below and indicate to what extent you feel the statement describes you,' where participants responded on a Likert-type scale from 0 being \"Not at all like me\" to 4 being \"Very much like me.\" One item from the ACSS will represent pain tolerance: 4 (\"I can tolerate more pain than most people\").

This is consistent with Ribeiro et al's (2014) findings that these 7 items formed a replicable factor structure that is substantively related to fearlessness about death.\n\nThe second model contains two outcome variables:\n1. Sensation seeking. This refers to one's tendency to seek out thrilling experiences. The was measured with the Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, Positive Urgency, Impulsive Behavior Scale (UPPS-P). Participants were asked, \"Below are a number of statements that describe ways in which people act and think.

In this approach, there are two steps: 1) Estimating the weights of the formative indicators using a redundancy analysis model. 2) Fixing the weights obtained from step 1 for the formative indicators and estimating a structural model.\n\nStep 1:\nThe first redundancy analysis model will have 25 observed variables that will load onto a formative construct whose disturbance term is fixed to 0. The formative construct will be linked to a global and reflective measure of the construct (i.e., acquired capability). \n\nThe second redundancy analysis model will have 25 observed variables that will also load onto a formative construct whose disturbance term is fixed to 0. The formative construct will be linked to two latent variables that are reflective measures of sensation seeking and negative urgency. \n\nStep 2:\nThe weights obtained from step 1 will be used to estimate two structural models. These structural models will test whether acquired capability predicts suicidal intent, NSSI, and other variables relevant to suicidal thoughts and behaviours.

The PPES contains a scale from 1-5, 1 being \"Never\" and 5 being \"More than 20 times.\" \n\nThe first redundancy analysis model contains two outcome variables:\n1. Perceived pain tolerance. This was measured with a subset of questions on the ACSS. Participants were asked, \"Please read each item below and indicate to what extent you feel the statement describes you,' where participants responded on a Likert-type scale from 0 being \"Not at all like me\" to 4 being \"Very much like me.\" One item from the ACSS will represent pain tolerance: 4 (\"I can tolerate more pain than most people\").

The following items from the ACSS will represent FAD: 7 (\u201cThe fact that I am going to die does not affect me\u201d), 8 (\"The pain involved in dying does not frighten me\"; reverse scored), 10 (\u201cI am very much afraid to die\u201d), 11 (\u201cIt does not make me nervous when people talk about death\u201d), 13 (\u201cThe prospect of my own death arouses anxiety in me\u201d; reverse-scored), 14 (\u201cI am not disturbed by death being the end of life as I know it\u201d), and 19 (\u201cI am not at all afraid to die\u201d). This is consistent with Ribeiro et al's (2014) findings that these 7 items formed a replicable factor structure that is substantively related to fearlessness about death.\n\nThe second model contains two outcome variables:\n1. Sensation seeking. This refers to one's tendency to seek out thrilling experiences.
