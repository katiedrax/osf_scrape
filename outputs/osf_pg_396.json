That conclusion, however, appears not to condition on whether the presented arguments are perceived as persuasive or distinguish between arguments and other kinds of information (opinions or facts). These distinctions are important because influential theories in political science and philosophy anticipate opposite effects from individuals\u2019 exposure to unpersuasive to them, yet credible, arguments. In the first stage of a survey experiment, we elicit subjects\u2019 opinion and their confidence in that opinion on five issues. In the second stage of the experiment, conducted three weeks later, we first present subjects with arguments running counter to their stated opinion (from the first stage) on two randomly chosen issues. On the screen where subjects are given the arguments, they are also asked to indicate whether they find the provided argument persuasive and for their reasoning to explain that judgment. Everyone who participates in the second stage is treated with arguments on two issues (and enters the control group for the other issues). We, further, randomly assign a subset of subjects to a \"no argument\" treatment but give them the following text on the screen (for example): \"Consider the following question: Do you think affirmative action in college admissions is a desirable tool for ensuring equal opportunity?\u201c And, supposing the subject answered affirmative in the first stage, s/he is now asked: \"Please write down your best argument to support your position...\" Finally, all subjects are again asked about their issue opinion and confidence in that opinion and self-report their news consumption, political knowledge, political ideology, and familiarity with the issues."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "The theoretical framework that supports the hypotheses below is based on the formal analysis of effects of argumentation in the model of deliberation as self-discovery by Hafer and Landa (2013; 2018) and Dickson, Hafer, and Landa (2009). Main hypotheses (Dickson, Hafer, and Landa 2009): H1: Conditional on there being residual uncertainty about preferred policy, one's confidence in the (prior) opinion increases after exposure to a counter-attitudinal argument that s/he finds not persuasive. H2: Conditional on there being residual uncertainty about preferred policy, one's confidence in the (prior) opinion decreases or the opinion is reversed after exposure to a counter-attitudinal argument that s/he finds persuasive. Heterogeneous treatment effects: We expect differences in treatment effects by news consumption and political knowledge. In particular, consistent with Hafer and Landa (2013 and 2018), we expect the following: H3a: The increase in confidence after hearing a non-persuasive counter-attitudinal argument (H1) will be stronger for subjects who report high news consumption and who are politically more knowledgeable than for those who report low news consumption and who are less politically knowledgeable. Note, there is a competing effect: H3b: The increase in confidence after hearing a non-persuasive counter-attitudinal argument (H1) will be weaker for those who are politically more knowledgeable, given that they are more likely to have seen the argument in the treatment, and so their posterior may not be as responsive as a result.

That conclusion, however, appears not to condition on whether the presented arguments are perceived as persuasive or distinguish between arguments and other kinds of information (opinions or facts). These distinctions are important because influential theories in political science and philosophy anticipate opposite effects from individuals\u2019 exposure to unpersuasive to them, yet credible, arguments. In the first stage of a survey experiment, we elicit subjects\u2019 opinion and their confidence in that opinion on five issues. In the second stage of the experiment, conducted three weeks later, we first present subjects with arguments running counter to their stated opinion (from the first stage) on two randomly chosen issues. On the screen where subjects are given the arguments, they are also asked to indicate whether they find the provided argument persuasive and for their reasoning to explain that judgment. Everyone who participates in the second stage is treated with arguments on two issues (and enters the control group for the other issues). We, further, randomly assign a subset of subjects to a \"no argument\" treatment but give them the following text on the screen (for example): \"Consider the following question: Do you think affirmative action in college admissions is a desirable tool for ensuring equal opportunity?\u201c And, supposing the subject answered affirmative in the first stage, s/he is now asked: \"Please write down your best argument to support your position...\" Finally, all subjects are again asked about their issue opinion and confidence in that opinion and self-report their news consumption, political knowledge, political ideology, and familiarity with the issues.", "q16": "The theoretical framework that supports the hypotheses below is based on the formal analysis of effects of argumentation in the model of deliberation as self-discovery by Hafer and Landa (2013; 2018) and Dickson, Hafer, and Landa (2009). Main hypotheses (Dickson, Hafer, and Landa 2009): H1: Conditional on there being residual uncertainty about preferred policy, one's confidence in the (prior) opinion increases after exposure to a counter-attitudinal argument that s/he finds not persuasive. H2: Conditional on there being residual uncertainty about preferred policy, one's confidence in the (prior) opinion decreases or the opinion is reversed after exposure to a counter-attitudinal argument that s/he finds persuasive. Heterogeneous treatment effects: We expect differences in treatment effects by news consumption and political knowledge. In particular, consistent with Hafer and Landa (2013 and 2018), we expect the following: H3a: The increase in confidence after hearing a non-persuasive counter-attitudinal argument (H1) will be stronger for subjects who report high news consumption and who are politically more knowledgeable than for those who report low news consumption and who are less politically knowledgeable. Note, there is a competing effect: H3b: The increase in confidence after hearing a non-persuasive counter-attitudinal argument (H1) will be weaker for those who are politically more knowledgeable, given that they are more likely to have seen the argument in the treatment, and so their posterior may not be as responsive as a result. To separate those two competing effects, we elicit whether subjects indicate to have been familiar with the argument presented to them. We expect support for H3b only for subjects who self-report high levels of familiarity with the argument.", "q17": "The hypotheses will be tested by a between subject comparison of the within-subject difference prior-posterior confidence in the stated opinion of control and treatment group. We will compute the difference in stated issue opinion between treatment (receiving the counter-attitudinal argument) and control group in the within-subject difference between prior and posterior confidence in the stated issue opinion. The difference-in-difference regression will also include terms indicating the order in which the two treatment issues were seen by the subject, what issues form that pair of treatment arguments seen by the subject, the subjects\u2019 self-reported news consumption, political knowledge, political ideology, and familiarity with the arguments as well as an indicator of the order in which the non-treatment issue opinions and confidence in those stated opinions are elicited. For estimation of sub-group effects, we compute the difference-in-difference estimator for median-split groups of low/high news consumption, low/high political knowledge, and low, medium, high familiarity with the argument separately as well as estimate the interaction effect of a treatment dummy and the full range of values on the news consumption/political knowledge/familiarity with argument variables.

{"extra": [], "value": "A long literature defends the claim that taxation and government accountability go hand in hand either because taxation gives citizens more bargaining power, raises expectations for the provision of services and the good governance, or increases willingness to engage in costly action. But this virtuous relationship between taxpaying and democratic accountability may be conditional. First, if voters pay taxes in an unsystematic, unobserved, or informal way, expectations of benefits and subsequent pressure on the government may, in turn, be dampened. Second, if taxpayers perceive their experience paying taxes as independent from those of others in a similar economic situation, they may fail to coordinate on voting on fiscal issues. This project seeks to connect the literature on taxation and accountability to the phenomenon of clientelistic electoral strategies -- the norm in many young democracies. Much ink has been spilled over how to break the clientelitsic equilibrium -- namely, the situation in which political parties campaign on the promise of particularistic transfers rather than on programmatic issues, and in return, citizens only hold governments to account for these targeted, one-off transfers rather than more universal policies. The historical record demonstrates that the transition to programmatic politics in advanced democracies often relied upon broad-based constituencies of middle class urbanites who were no longer satisfied with plum patronage jobs and transfers but instead began to clamor for universalistic policies such as workers rights and a social safety net. In the young democracies of some developing countries, the middle class is swelling as it reaps the benefits of steady growth and development in the post-structural adjustment era. Will this group mimic the middle classes in the US and England -- calling upon the government to reform and provide better services? So far, the answer has been no. This project proposes and interrogates the intuition that one reason for this is the informal nature of taxation in developing countries. Whether and how citizens pay taxes, and their perceptions of belonging to a group of like-minded taxpayers, conditions their political demands and the likelihood of voting on programmatic issues. For class consciousness to emerge and translate into coordinated pressure on the government, a group of individuals must first see themselves as such. I seek to show that in one stable, developing democracy -- Senegal, this is not the case. While there is a growing group of urbanites in the capital who generate enough income to satisfy their most basic demands and thus share second-order preferences such as improved education and opportunities for their children, better infrastructure and services to support their businesses, this group is fractionalized and does not perceive these commonalities. One reason for this appears to be the uneven way in which members of this so-called middle class interact with the state. While there is a more traditional middle class group of salaried individuals working in the private and public sector who often have unions and shared experiences, this group is quite small. The second, much larger group is comprised of small businesses and individual entrepreneurs, the vast majority of which exist in the informal sector. While salaried individuals are taxed regularly and systematically in accordance with the fiscal code, informal sector business owners and entrepreneurs are taxed in an erratic and informal way by the state that is often outside standard and transparent fiscal processes. Not only are the experiences of these two groups substantively different, but the informal and unsystematic nature of taxation in the latter group does not lend itself to coordination. Members of this group have little information about how others like themselves experience taxation, and since their experience is unsystematic, they have no reason to assume the experience of others will look the same. The purpose of the present data collection exercise is to validate some of these assumptions and further examine the importance of the link between taxation, class consciousness, and political participation. Specifically, I will ask four related research questions. First, do citizens presently condition their vote on fiscal policy decisions, and is this conditional on being in the formal sector? Second, does priming taxation or making certain taxes more salient change the way in which voters conceive of demands on the government or make electoral decisions? Third, does priming the ability of like-minded voters to coordinate on shared interests influence the nature of demands on government or the way in which voters formulate electoral preferences? And finally, does providing information about the costs and benefits of formalization make formalization more attractive for the informal sector?"}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypothesis 1: Salaried members who formally pay taxes will have a qualitatively different set of demands of the government \u2013 more programmatic in nature \u2013 relative to informal sector members who informally and unsystematically pay taxes, in spite of both saying they are able to meet basic needs. They will also be more likely to vote along programmatic lines. Hypothesis 2 Salaried members who formally pay taxes will believe the government to whom they pay tax is less corrupt and more responsive relative to informal sector members who informally and unsystematically pay taxes. Hypothesis 3 Priming individuals to think about the taxes they pay will induce them to value transparency from government more. Hypothesis 4 Priming informal sector individuals to think about the taxes they pay will induce them to rate the government as less capable, while it will not have this effect on salaried individuals. Hypothesis 5 Priming salaried individuals to think about the taxes they pay will induce them to demand even more from government or become more dissatisfied with its performance and vote more along programmatic lines, while priming informal sector individuals to consider their tax payments will not have these effects. Hypothesis 6 Making salient a fiscal policy that has net benefits for an individual will increase support for the incumbent, but only if the individual pays taxes in the formal sector. Hypothesis 7 Bringing people into the tax base activates them politically, increasing expectations or holding the government more responsible. Hypothesis 8 Telling informal sector entrepreneurs about their tax obligation were they to obtain formal status, along with the decreased tax rate for that group, should lead them to respond more positively to fiscal policy, increasing their support for the incumbent. Hypothesis 9 Providing information about formal tax obligations along with information about the costs and benefits to formalize will increase interest in formalization. Hypothesis 10 Giving members of a formally taxed group information about the size of the \u201cmiddle class\u201d coalition that could potentially benefit from the 2013 legislation will provide a coordinating mechanism for a political response to the policy, thus increasing the political salience of fiscal policy and programmatic politics in general. Hypothesis 11 Giving members of an informally taxed group information about their tax obligation under the law (either the CGU or VAT), along with the information that a large proportion of others are in their same position, will provide a coordinating mechanism for political activity among those similarly frustrated by the status quo, thus increasing political engagement."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "To test Hypothesis 1, I will compare responses across participant types to questions about the most important public service expected of each level of government (national and local).

After eliciting their preferred candidate, I will elicit the respondent\u2019s willingness to pay to stay with their preferred incumbent (or willingness to accept money to change to the other party).

defends the claim that taxation and government accountability go hand in hand either because taxation gives citizens more bargaining power, raises expectations for the provision of services and the good governance, or increases willingness to engage in costly action. But this virtuous relationship between taxpaying and democratic accountability may be conditional. First, if voters pay taxes in an unsystematic, unobserved, or informal way, expectations of benefits and subsequent pressure on the government may, in turn, be dampened. Second, if taxpayers perceive their experience paying taxes as independent from those of others in a similar economic situation, they may fail to coordinate on voting on fiscal issues. This project seeks to connect the literature on taxation and accountability to the phenomenon of clientelistic electoral strategies -- the norm in many young democracies. Much ink has been spilled over how to break the clientelitsic equilibrium -- namely, the situation in which political parties campaign on the promise of particularistic transfers rather than on programmatic issues, and in return, citizens only hold governments to account for these targeted, one-off transfers rather than more universal policies. The historical record demonstrates that the transition to programmatic politics in advanced democracies often relied upon broad-based constituencies of middle class urbanites who were no longer satisfied with plum patronage jobs and transfers but instead began to clamor for universalistic policies such as workers rights and a social safety net. In the young democracies of some developing countries, the middle class is swelling as it reaps the benefits of steady growth and development in the post-structural adjustment era. Will this group mimic the middle classes in the US and England -- calling upon the government to reform and provide better services? So far, the answer has been no. This project proposes and interrogates the intuition that one reason for this is the informal nature of taxation in developing countries. Whether and how citizens pay taxes, and their perceptions of belonging to a group of like-minded taxpayers, conditions their political demands and the likelihood of voting on programmatic issues. For class consciousness to emerge and translate into coordinated pressure on the government, a group of individuals must first see themselves as such. I seek to show that in one stable, developing democracy -- Senegal, this is not the case. While there is a growing group of urbanites in the capital who generate enough income to satisfy their most basic demands and thus share second-order preferences such as improved education and opportunities for their children, better infrastructure and services to support their businesses, this group is fractionalized and does not perceive these commonalities. One reason for this appears to be the uneven way in which members of this so-called middle class interact with the state. While there is a more traditional middle class group of salaried individuals working in the private and public sector who often have unions and shared experiences, this group is quite small. The second, much larger group is comprised of small businesses and individual entrepreneurs, the vast majority of which exist in the informal sector. While salaried individuals are taxed regularly and systematically in accordance with the fiscal code, informal sector business owners and entrepreneurs are taxed in an erratic and informal way by the state that is often outside standard and transparent fiscal processes. Not only are the experiences of these two groups substantively different, but the informal and unsystematic nature of taxation in the latter group does not lend itself to coordination. Members of this group have little information about how others like themselves experience taxation, and since their experience is unsystematic, they have no reason to assume the experience of others will look the same. The purpose of the present data collection exercise is to validate some of these assumptions and further examine the importance of the link between taxation, class consciousness, and political participation. Specifically, I will ask four related research questions. First, do citizens presently condition their vote on fiscal policy decisions, and is this conditional on being in the formal sector? Second, does priming taxation or making certain taxes more salient change the way in which voters conceive of demands on the government or make electoral decisions? Third, does priming the ability of like-minded voters to coordinate on shared interests influence the nature of demands on government or the way in which voters formulate electoral preferences? And finally, does providing information about the costs and benefits of formalization make formalization more attractive for the informal sector?", "q16": "Hypothesis 1: Salaried members who formally pay taxes will have a qualitatively different set of demands of the government \u2013 more programmatic in nature \u2013 relative to informal sector members who informally and unsystematically pay taxes, in spite of both saying they are able to meet basic needs. They will also be more likely to vote along programmatic lines. Hypothesis 2 Salaried members who formally pay taxes will believe the government to whom they pay tax is less corrupt and more responsive relative to informal sector members who informally and unsystematically pay taxes. Hypothesis 3 Priming individuals to think about the taxes they pay will induce them to value transparency from government more. Hypothesis 4 Priming informal sector individuals to think about the taxes they pay will induce them to rate the government as less capable, while it will not have this effect on salaried individuals. Hypothesis 5 Priming salaried individuals to think about the taxes they pay will induce them to demand even more from government or become more dissatisfied with its performance and vote more along programmatic lines, while priming informal sector individuals to consider their tax payments will not have these effects. Hypothesis 6 Making salient a fiscal policy that has net benefits for an individual will increase support for the incumbent, but only if the individual pays taxes in the formal sector. Hypothesis 7 Bringing people into the tax base activates them politically, increasing expectations or holding the government more responsible. Hypothesis 8 Telling informal sector entrepreneurs about their tax obligation were they to obtain formal status, along with the decreased tax rate for that group, should lead them to respond more positively to fiscal policy, increasing their support for the incumbent. Hypothesis 9 Providing information about formal tax obligations along with information about the costs and benefits to formalize will increase interest in formalization. Hypothesis 10 Giving members of a formally taxed group information about the size of the \u201cmiddle class\u201d coalition that could potentially benefit from the 2013 legislation will provide a coordinating mechanism for a political response to the policy, thus increasing the political salience of fiscal policy and programmatic politics in general. Hypothesis 11 Giving members of an informally taxed group information about their tax obligation under the law (either the CGU or VAT), along with the information that a large proportion of others are in their same position, will provide a coordinating mechanism for political activity among those similarly frustrated by the status quo, thus increasing political engagement.", "q17": "To test Hypothesis 1, I will compare responses across participant types to questions about the most important public service expected of each level of government (national and local). I expect responses of the formal sector to be more programmatic in nature. I will also provide a candidate vignette comparing two incumbents \u2013 one who performed well on the programmatic dimension, another who performed well on personalistic dimension. After eliciting their preferred candidate, I will elicit the respondent\u2019s willingness to pay to stay with their preferred incumbent (or willingness to accept money to change to the other party). I expect members of the informal sector to have a higher willingness to pay to stay with the programmatic candidate. (prioritynat, priority com, vignette) To test Hypothesis 2, I will compare responses across participant types to questions about how much of the budget they expect each level of government to spend on public goods (relative to corrupt spending).

Three short videos for each issue were produced and screened in rural Uganda, where these issues are prominent social concerns.

This stream in turn relates to a broader literature on the effects of elite cueing and framing on public opinion (for overviews, see Druckman and Lupia 2000; Chong and Druckman 2007; Busby et al. 2018). In our earlier research, we have assessed the effects of communication by three types of elites on the popular legitimacy of IOs: national governments, civil society organizations, and IOs themselves (Dellmuth and Tallberg 2019). We found that both national governments and civil society organizations are capable of swaying people\u2019s opinions of IOs, particularly through negative messages, while communication by IOs themselves tends to be less effective. In this study, we take our research one step further by focusing specifically on the effects of party cues on the perceived legitimacy of IOs.
