adverse outcomes, including aggression, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms (Cicchetti &amp; Toth, 2005; Hildyard &amp; Wolfe, 2002). It is important for prevention and intervention efforts to identify factors that may reduce risk of adverse outcomes in children who have experienced maltreatment. Neighborhood collective efficacy (NCE) is the perception of the social connection in the neighborhood, which includes a combination of social cohesion (i.e., trust in neighbors) and informal social control (i.e., neighbors\u2019 willingness to intervene in situations) (Sampson et al. 1997). Neighborhood collective efficacy (NCE) is associated with lower externalizing and internalizing problems among diverse groups of individuals. The two components of NCE, informal social control and social cohesion, are uniquely associated with lower externalizing and internalizing problems (Dawson et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Kingsbury et al., 2019). Social cohesion buffers the effect of stressful life events on adolescent externalizing problems (e.g., aggression) and internalizing problems (e.g., depression and anxiety) (Kingsbury 2019; Kim 2019). However, limited studies have examined moderating effect of NCE or its components on internalizing problems and externalizing problems in individuals who have experienced child maltreatment. The study is unique since we are examining the individual components of NCE and maltreatment, a potent relationship stressor. The protective effect of NCE may operate differently in the context of maltreatment compared to other types of stress. In addition, few studies have examined associations of NCE with both internalizing and externalizing behaviors in the same study.\n Research has found that higher NCE or social cohesion is related to lower externalizing behaviors among maltreated youths (Kotch et al. 2014; Yonas et al. 2010). One study found that youths who experienced neglect were buffered on aggressive outcomes by NCE but not youths who experienced physical or sexual abuse (Yonas et al. 2010). These results suggest that NCE may not buffer different types of maltreatment in the same manner. Furthermore, another study found a main effect such that higher social cohesion but not informal social control was associated with lower externalizing problems among youths who experienced neglect (Kotch et al. 2014). Additionally, there is only one study to our knowledge that has examined if neighborhood social cohesion has a moderating effect on internalizing behaviors. Using data from the Project of Human Development of Chicago Neighborhoods, the authors founds that higher neighborhood social cohesion was related to lower internalizing behaviors but not externalizing behaviors among youths that experienced physical aggression towards them by a parent (Riina, Martin, &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2014). It was also demonstrated that social cohesion did not buffer children younger than 11 years old from internalizing behaviors; however, this buffering effect was seen in 11-year-old children and older. \nSince Riina and colleagues\u2019 (2014) study only had parent report about parent-child physical aggression history, it will be beneficial to examine the moderating effect of NCE in a sample that used Child Protective Services (CPS) reports such as other studies that examined externalizing behaviors (Kotch et al. 2014; Yonas et al. 2010). There are mixed findings about the potential protective effects of social cohesion and informal social control among different maltreatment types. Thus, it is important to further examine these components of NCE individually. Furthermore, there is limited work that examined how the severity of stressors might moderate the associations between NCE and adverse outcomes. One study found that although there was no direct association between NCE and externalizing symptoms, NCE did buffer externalizing behaviors among maltreated adolescents who experienced bereavement (Sasser et al., 2019). Thus, NCE might still be an effective protective factor even in the context of high stress. \nUsing the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS), a sample of nearly 5000 individuals with prospective measures of abuse and neglect behaviors from birth through adolescence, we will test the hypothesis that NCE moderates the association of maltreatment with internalizing and externalizing problems. We hypothesize that maltreatment type and severity will moderate the buffering effect of NCE. However, the FFCWS uses parent report of abuse and neglect behaviors; we will then replicate the findings from the FFCWS dataset with another dataset. The Longitudinal Studies on Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) dataset, an agency-referred sample of approximately 1300 maltreated and at-risk youth, will be used to replicate the findings of FFCWS. The proposed analyses will increase our understanding of the potential buffering nature of NCE for youths who have experienced maltreatment. \n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Aim 1: To examine the association of maltreatment severity by type (i.e., neglect, emotional maltreatment, and abuse) with internalizing and externalizing behaviors at age 15 or 16.\nHypothesis 1: It is expected that adolescents who experienced neglect will have higher internalizing and externalizing behaviors, especially as severity of neglect increases.

With these mixed findings, we have no a priori hypotheses on the potential sex differences on the effect of NCE between maltreatment and internalizing behaviors. \nExternalizing behaviors: Wilkinson and colleagues (2019) showed that there were no sex differences in the moderating effect of NCE on frequency of delinquent behaviors among maltreated adolescents. Thus, it is predicted that there will not be any sex differences on the moderating effect of NCE on the association between maltreatment and externalizing behaviors.   \n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

It is important for prevention and intervention efforts to identify factors that may reduce risk of adverse outcomes in children who have experienced maltreatment. Neighborhood collective efficacy (NCE) is the perception of the social connection in the neighborhood, which includes a combination of social cohesion (i.e., trust in neighbors) and informal social control (i.e., neighbors\u2019 willingness to intervene in situations) (Sampson et al. 1997). Neighborhood collective efficacy (NCE) is associated with lower externalizing and internalizing problems among diverse groups of individuals. The two components of NCE, informal social control and social cohesion, are uniquely associated with lower externalizing and internalizing problems (Dawson et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Kingsbury et al., 2019). Social cohesion buffers the effect of stressful life events on adolescent externalizing problems (e.g., aggression) and internalizing problems (e.g., depression and anxiety) (Kingsbury 2019; Kim 2019). However, limited studies have examined moderating effect of NCE or its components on internalizing problems and externalizing problems in individuals who have experienced child maltreatment. The study is unique since we are examining the individual components of NCE and maltreatment, a potent relationship stressor. The protective effect of NCE may operate differently in the context of maltreatment compared to other types of stress. In addition, few studies have examined associations of NCE with both internalizing and externalizing behaviors in the same study.\n Research has found that higher NCE or social cohesion is related to lower externalizing behaviors among maltreated youths (Kotch et al. 2014; Yonas et al. 2010). One study found that youths who experienced neglect were buffered on aggressive outcomes by NCE but not youths who experienced physical or sexual abuse (Yonas et al. 2010). These results suggest that NCE may not buffer different types of maltreatment in the same manner. Furthermore, another study found a main effect such that higher social cohesion but not informal social control was associated with lower externalizing problems among youths who experienced neglect (Kotch et al. 2014). Additionally, there is only one study to our knowledge that has examined if neighborhood social cohesion has a moderating effect on internalizing behaviors. Using data from the Project of Human Development of Chicago Neighborhoods, the authors founds that higher neighborhood social cohesion was related to lower internalizing behaviors but not externalizing behaviors among youths that experienced physical aggression towards them by a parent (Riina, Martin, &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2014). It was also demonstrated that social cohesion did not buffer children younger than 11 years old from internalizing behaviors; however, this buffering effect was seen in 11-year-old children and older. \nSince Riina and colleagues\u2019 (2014) study only had parent report about parent-child physical aggression history, it will be beneficial to examine the moderating effect of NCE in a sample that used Child Protective Services (CPS) reports such as other studies that examined externalizing behaviors (Kotch et al. 2014; Yonas et al. 2010). There are mixed findings about the potential protective effects of social cohesion and informal social control among different maltreatment types. Thus, it is important to further examine these components of NCE individually. Furthermore, there is limited work that examined how the severity of stressors might moderate the associations between NCE and adverse outcomes. One study found that although there was no direct association between NCE and externalizing symptoms, NCE did buffer externalizing behaviors among maltreated adolescents who experienced bereavement (Sasser et al., 2019). Thus, NCE might still be an effective protective factor even in the context of high stress. \nUsing the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS), a sample of nearly 5000 individuals with prospective measures of abuse and neglect behaviors from birth through adolescence, we will test the hypothesis that NCE moderates the association of maltreatment with internalizing and externalizing problems. We hypothesize that maltreatment type and severity will moderate the buffering effect of NCE. However, the FFCWS uses parent report of abuse and neglect behaviors; we will then replicate the findings from the FFCWS dataset with another dataset. The Longitudinal Studies on Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) dataset, an agency-referred sample of approximately 1300 maltreated and at-risk youth, will be used to replicate the findings of FFCWS. The proposed analyses will increase our understanding of the potential buffering nature of NCE for youths who have experienced maltreatment. \n", "q4": "Aim 1: To examine the association of maltreatment severity by type (i.e., neglect, emotional maltreatment, and abuse) with internalizing and externalizing behaviors at age 15 or 16.\nHypothesis 1: It is expected that adolescents who experienced neglect will have higher internalizing and externalizing behaviors, especially as severity of neglect increases.

The participants were born between 1998-2000 and were recruited at birth from 20 different cities. The FFCWS prioritized recruiting unmarried mothers since the goals of this study is to understand families and children from unmarried parents.  Both parents were asked to interview. If the father did not participate in the study, then the mother was asked questions about the father. Families were interviewed after their child was born, when their child was 1-year old, 3-years-old, 5-years-old, 9-years-old, and 15-years-old. There are many measures that were examined in these interviews by parents and/or primary caregiver and child (depending on age). In the interviews, mothers and/or primary caregivers were asked about their perception of the neighborhood and maltreatment experienced by their child. The demographic questionnaire, Neighborhood Collective Efficacy scale, and the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scales were given to mothers and/or primary caregivers. At age 15, adolescents completed self-report measures on their anxiety symptoms, depression symptom, and delinquency behaviors. The Brief Symptoms Inventory 18, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and the Delinquency Behavior questionnaire were given to adolescents.\n\nLONGSCAN:\nData collection: The LONGSCAN is a longitudinal study following children with different levels of risk for maltreatment. Participants were recruited at age 4 years from 5 different cities. Depending on the study site, participants were either recruited from another study, recruited from a tracking program, recruited from being reported to CPS, or recruited as a control (e.g., similar neighborhood background). Three cities recruited children from already existing samples and the other cities also recruited from other groups. The goal of this study was to understand families and children that are at risk of maltreatment or have experienced maltreatment. Primary caregivers were interviewed when their child was 4-year old, 6-years-old, 8-years-old, 12-years-old, 14-years-old, and 16-years-old. Parents and/or primary caregiver and child (depending on age) were interviewed. At age 16 of the child, primary caregivers were asked about their perception of the neighborhood, the Quality of Neighborhood, Residential Stability &amp; Organizational and Religious Affiliation questionnaire. At age 16, adolescents completed self-report questionnaires on their trauma symptoms, and their delinquent and violent behaviors. Adolescents completed the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children, and the Delinquent and Violent Behavior measure. Additionally, CPS records were regularly reviewed from birth through age 18 and were recoded with both the National Incidence Study coding and the Modified Maltreatment Classification System (MMCS; Barnett, Manly, &amp; Cicchetti, 1993).\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Please see attached document.", "q17.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e2bf6bf87a1d9013e1d11f5", "file_name": "Variables for Preregistration.docx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/e48dy/files/osfstorage/5e2bf6bf87a1d9013e1d11f5", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e2bf6bf87a1d9013e1d11f5"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "72386c981fbcd2108e38c579ea11b2c0ac1b4213881aadfd2d105f290ff42e2e"}}], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Stepwise linear regression models will be conducted in both FFCWS and LONGSCAN using SPSS version 25. \n\n14.1 FFCWS\nMain models.

interaction between the person, the situation, and the emotion regulation strategy itself (Dor\u00e9, Silvers, &amp; Ochsner, 2016). Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) affords researchers the opportunity to capture information across all three of these domains simultaneously: using mobile smartphone technology, participants can report their naturally occurring use of different strategies within different situations, over time. While EMA methodology provides many benefits (Aldao, 2013; Shiffman, Stone, &amp; Hufford, 2008), these rich sources of data can be challenging to analyze with more traditional statistical approaches (e.g., regression, ANOVA) due to their high dimensionality. Namely, there is a virtually infinite number of strategies that people can use and situations that people can encounter within daily life, with an extraordinary number of potential combinations. In this way, the occurrence of any one strategy within any one situation is quite rare, making it challenging to establish robust inferential statistics that are calculated using methods that assume normality and linear underlying processes of the data systems. Thus, while theory championing the importance of person-situation-strategy interactions has grown over the past decade (e.g., Aldao, Sheppes, &amp; Gross, 2015; Bonanno &amp; Burton, 2013), empirical studies that test such three-way interactions have lagged behind (see Dor\u00e9 et al., 2016 for review). Clearly, there is a need to develop new approaches to analyze these rich but sparse EMA data.\n\nPoint process models are used to model any series of discrete events over time. They describe \u201cthe probability of a new event in the next instant of time, given knowledge of the past up until the present\u201d (Harte, 2015, p. 2). Conditional only on the history of the system (i.e., how the system has behaved since initiating data collection) and time (i.e., the point in time for which each data point was collected relative to the initial data point), point process models can accommodate data that are heavily zero-inflated. Thus, point process models allow researchers to model rare events. Up until this point, their use has largely been confined to meteorological contexts (e.g., lightening striking the ground, a volcano erupting, the onset of an earthquake; Schoenberg, nd) and neuron spiking. However, it is likely that these models can be applied to other types of rare events, such as emotion regulation strategy use across different situations in daily life. Therefore, this methodological paper aims to validate the use of point process models for studying emotion regulation in EMA data. Although this study focuses on emotion regulation strategy use, it is but one example of \u201crare\u201d human behavior that can be measured through EMA. As EMA research continues to grow in popularity, both within and outside of emotion regulation content, it is vital to uncover appropriate analytic approaches that researchers can use to handle infrequently occurring phenomena.\n\nMethod\n\nTo our knowledge, point process models have not yet been applied to EMA data. Given the goal of this paper is to validate an existing analytic approach on a new type of data source, we will follow methods previously established by Ogata (1988), Vere-Jones (2009) and Wadsworth and Tawn (2012). Given this paper is methodologically motivated rather than theoretically motivated, we use this pre-registration to briefly outline the steps that we propose to take on a previously collected EMA dataset, including a validation on simulated data and an application demonstration within real human subjects data (described below). This dataset measured 144 participants\u2019 use of eight different emotion regulation strategies over the course of two weeks. Participants reported using (or not using) each of these strategies up to six times a day in response to semi-randomly timed short mobile phone surveys. \n\nFor each individual, we will fit multiple models (e.g., exponential, loglinear, linear) to their self-reported use of the eight strategies to estimate different types of \u201cgrowth\u201d (i.e., is a person more likely to use a strategy at the next survey after it was already used, less likely to use a strategy at the next survey after it was already used, or no more or no less likely to use a strategy at the next survey after it was already used?). Note that each strategy will be modeled separately, per person. Idiographic models, such as these, allow researchers to harness the full information that is collected on a given individual, across time, rather than averaging/collapsing across potentially meaningful within-person differences (as is done in traditional aggregate approaches). So, point process modelling will allow researchers to treat intra-individual differences as meaningful rather than as noise. Although idiographic models are less generalizable than aggregate models, accounting for individual trajectories in strategy use is particularly important in this context, given that time-varying situations are expected to interact with strategy use and trait-level characteristics (Dor\u00e9 et al., 2016). Further, there are multiple clinical applications of this work that would involve modifying emotion regulation strategy choices at the individual level over time. \n\nWe will compare the model fit statistics for each strategy for each person and select the best fitting model to represent the growth trajectory of each underlying system (in this case, \u201csystem\u201d refers to an individual\u2019s use of a given strategy over time). Note that if there are no fit differences between the models, we will assume the process in stable and linear to simplify the model parameters. If the best fit model to any given system is linear, it will be considered homogenous. A homogenous system tells you the expected rate of that strategy being used across all time (and can be interpreted similarly to a probability value). Systems that are better characterized by a non-linear process (i.e., exponential, loglinear) will be considered non-homogenous. Non-homogenous systems generally can then be transformed to homogenous systems so that all systems can be accurately compared together (regardless of if all systems share the same underlying growth parameters within the raw EMA data). While non-homogenous systems will be transformed to homogenous systems in order to directly compare the use of different strategies and different people, such differences in underlying growth processes between people are likely substantively meaningful rather than a result of noise. For example, if Person A\u2019s use of a cognitive reappraisal strategy is characterized by a loglinear process whereas Person B\u2019s use of cognitive reappraisal is characterized by an exponential process, this difference suggests that Person A becomes less likely to use cognitive reappraisal after they have used it while Person B becomes more likely to use cognitive reappraisal after they have used it. As such, these differences in growth processes across participants (or differences across strategy types within a given participant) could point to important individual differences that would otherwise be washed out by statistical methods that assume that all data are generated by an identical underlying process. \n\nNote that this approach allows for potentially important covariates to be included in the models. For example, how effective the individual viewed their strategy attempt to be in helping to improve their thoughts and feelings could reasonably impact the rate at which that strategy re-occurs for the individual. While the current methodologically-focused paper will explore the simplest case of point process models on complex human data, point process models can include additional variables of theoretical interest to allow applied researchers to test substantive questions of interest. \n\nValidation Approach\n\nTo validate point process modeling on EMA data, we will simulate data that imitates those that are often observed in psychological EMA data (e.g., unequal spacing between observation points, binary outcomes with zero inflation, unequal measurement points across participants). We will generate these simulated data according to different underlying processes (i.e., some simulated data streams will be generated according to a linear process, while others will be simulated according to log-linear or exponential processes). After simulating data for which we know the underlying process, we will test to see if the point process models, according to our proposed steps, recover these known processes. If the models recover the underlying processes that are known to have generated the simulated data, we will have demonstrated validation.\n\nDemonstrating Application\n\nTo demonstrate application in real data, we will test a substantive hypothesis. Point process models return values that characterize the rate of occurrence of a given phenomenon. In the literature, social anxiety disorder symptom severity has been negatively associated with the tendency to use cognitive reappraisal, at both trait and state levels (Blalock, Kashdan, &amp; Farmer, 2016). Thus, it is possible that social anxiety symptom severity influences the rate of occurrence (and recurrence) of cognitive reappraisal in daily life. Therefore, we hypothesize that social anxiety symptom severity, as measured by the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (Mattick &amp; Clarke, 1998), will be associated with cognitive reappraisal rate of occurrence over time. Note that we do not make claims about the direction of this predicted effect (successful use of cognitive reappraisal could decrease the rate of its future occurrence based on a diminished need to regulate or increase the rate of its future occurrence based on a tendency to use what has worked in the past). Also note that a null result should not be interpreted as a failed validation of this modeling approach, as well-validated models often return null results. \n\nTo further show the applicability of these models, we will take each time series and fit a point process model to the first 70% of the data points. We will then use this training data set to see how accurately these models can predict the rate of occurrence of the remaining 30% of the data using 95%-confidence intervals. If a large proportion of individuals\u2019 strategy-use rate of occurrence is contained within these 95%-confidence intervals (i.e., approximately 85% of the data or above), then we will conclude that this method shows good feasibility/applicability to data derived from EMA studies. If less than 85% of the data is included within these 95%-confidence intervals, then we can conclude that our model is likely not very applicable to this system.\n\nExtended Application\n\nUltimately, we are interested in combining simultaneous streams of information (i.e., multiple emotion regulation strategies and situational contexts \u2013 such as in-the-moment affect, perceived effectiveness of the strategy in that moment, being alone or with others, et cetera \u2013 that are often measured within the emotion regulation-focused EMA studies) to investigate the reciprocal relationship between context and strategy use within and across people. This approach will require a multivariate approach to applying point process models to EMA data (where the outcome would be a matrix of all eight strategies). Due to the complexity of multivariate point process models, we will need to iteratively refine these models through application to the data. While challenging to pre-register, we will openly share and detail all decisions that were made in this process. \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"summary": "Emotion researchers have recently begun to conceptualize emotion regulation as an interaction between the person, the situation, and the emotion regulation strategy itself (Dor\u00e9, Silvers, &amp; Ochsner, 2016).

As EMA research continues to grow in popularity, both within and outside of emotion regulation content, it is vital to uncover appropriate analytic approaches that researchers can use to handle infrequently occurring phenomena.\n\nMethod\n\nTo our knowledge, point process models have not yet been applied to EMA data. Given the goal of this paper is to validate an existing analytic approach on a new type of data source, we will follow methods previously established by Ogata (1988), Vere-Jones (2009) and Wadsworth and Tawn (2012). Given this paper is methodologically motivated rather than theoretically motivated, we use this pre-registration to briefly outline the steps that we propose to take on a previously collected EMA dataset, including a validation on simulated data and an application demonstration within real human subjects data (described below). This dataset measured 144 participants\u2019 use of eight different emotion regulation strategies over the course of two weeks. Participants reported using (or not using) each of these strategies up to six times a day in response to semi-randomly timed short mobile phone surveys. \n\nFor each individual, we will fit multiple models (e.g., exponential, loglinear, linear) to their self-reported use of the eight strategies to estimate different types of \u201cgrowth\u201d (i.e., is a person more likely to use a strategy at the next survey after it was already used, less likely to use a strategy at the next survey after it was already used, or no more or no less likely to use a strategy at the next survey after it was already used?). Note that each strategy will be modeled separately, per person. Idiographic models, such as these, allow researchers to harness the full information that is collected on a given individual, across time, rather than averaging/collapsing across potentially meaningful within-person differences (as is done in traditional aggregate approaches). So, point process modelling will allow researchers to treat intra-individual differences as meaningful rather than as noise. Although idiographic models are less generalizable than aggregate models, accounting for individual trajectories in strategy use is particularly important in this context, given that time-varying situations are expected to interact with strategy use and trait-level characteristics (Dor\u00e9 et al., 2016). Further, there are multiple clinical applications of this work that would involve modifying emotion regulation strategy choices at the individual level over time. \n\nWe will compare the model fit statistics for each strategy for each person and select the best fitting model to represent the growth trajectory of each underlying system (in this case, \u201csystem\u201d refers to an individual\u2019s use of a given strategy over time). Note that if there are no fit differences between the models, we will assume the process in stable and linear to simplify the model parameters. If the best fit model to any given system is linear, it will be considered homogenous. A homogenous system tells you the expected rate of that strategy being used across all time (and can be interpreted similarly to a probability value). Systems that are better characterized by a non-linear process (i.e., exponential, loglinear) will be considered non-homogenous. Non-homogenous systems generally can then be transformed to homogenous systems so that all systems can be accurately compared together (regardless of if all systems share the same underlying growth parameters within the raw EMA data). While non-homogenous systems will be transformed to homogenous systems in order to directly compare the use of different strategies and different people, such differences in underlying growth processes between people are likely substantively meaningful rather than a result of noise. For example, if Person A\u2019s use of a cognitive reappraisal strategy is characterized by a loglinear process whereas Person B\u2019s use of cognitive reappraisal is characterized by an exponential process, this difference suggests that Person A becomes less likely to use cognitive reappraisal after they have used it while Person B becomes more likely to use cognitive reappraisal after they have used it. As such, these differences in growth processes across participants (or differences across strategy types within a given participant) could point to important individual differences that would otherwise be washed out by statistical methods that assume that all data are generated by an identical underlying process. \n\nNote that this approach allows for potentially important covariates to be included in the models. For example, how effective the individual viewed their strategy attempt to be in helping to improve their thoughts and feelings could reasonably impact the rate at which that strategy re-occurs for the individual. While the current methodologically-focused paper will explore the simplest case of point process models on complex human data, point process models can include additional variables of theoretical interest to allow applied researchers to test substantive questions of interest. \n\nValidation Approach\n\nTo validate point process modeling on EMA data, we will simulate data that imitates those that are often observed in psychological EMA data (e.g., unequal spacing between observation points, binary outcomes with zero inflation, unequal measurement points across participants). We will generate these simulated data according to different underlying processes (i.e., some simulated data streams will be generated according to a linear process, while others will be simulated according to log-linear or exponential processes). After simulating data for which we know the underlying process, we will test to see if the point process models, according to our proposed steps, recover these known processes. If the models recover the underlying processes that are known to have generated the simulated data, we will have demonstrated validation.\n\nDemonstrating Application\n\nTo demonstrate application in real data, we will test a substantive hypothesis. Point process models return values that characterize the rate of occurrence of a given phenomenon. In the literature, social anxiety disorder symptom severity has been negatively associated with the tendency to use cognitive reappraisal, at both trait and state levels (Blalock, Kashdan, &amp; Farmer, 2016). Thus, it is possible that social anxiety symptom severity influences the rate of occurrence (and recurrence) of cognitive reappraisal in daily life. Therefore, we hypothesize that social anxiety symptom severity, as measured by the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (Mattick &amp; Clarke, 1998), will be associated with cognitive reappraisal rate of occurrence over time. Note that we do not make claims about the direction of this predicted effect (successful use of cognitive reappraisal could decrease the rate of its future occurrence based on a diminished need to regulate or increase the rate of its future occurrence based on a tendency to use what has worked in the past). Also note that a null result should not be interpreted as a failed validation of this modeling approach, as well-validated models often return null results. \n\nTo further show the applicability of these models, we will take each time series and fit a point process model to the first 70% of the data points. We will then use this training data set to see how accurately these models can predict the rate of occurrence of the remaining 30% of the data using 95%-confidence intervals. If a large proportion of individuals\u2019 strategy-use rate of occurrence is contained within these 95%-confidence intervals (i.e., approximately 85% of the data or above), then we will conclude that this method shows good feasibility/applicability to data derived from EMA studies. If less than 85% of the data is included within these 95%-confidence intervals, then we can conclude that our model is likely not very applicable to this system.\n\nExtended Application\n\nUltimately, we are interested in combining simultaneous streams of information (i.e., multiple emotion regulation strategies and situational contexts \u2013 such as in-the-moment affect, perceived effectiveness of the strategy in that moment, being alone or with others, et cetera \u2013 that are often measured within the emotion regulation-focused EMA studies) to investigate the reciprocal relationship between context and strategy use within and across people. This approach will require a multivariate approach to applying point process models to EMA data (where the outcome would be a matrix of all eight strategies). Due to the complexity of multivariate point process models, we will need to iteratively refine these models through application to the data. While challenging to pre-register, we will openly share and detail all decisions that were made in this process. \n", "uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links":
