"}, "q12": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Population of Subjects: \n\nThis longitudinal, cohort-based study follows students who graduated from Colorado high schools between 2010-2011 and 2013-2014. Cohorts are designated by the school year in which students were in 11th grade because while the 2009 legislation designated all high school students as eligible to participate in concurrent enrollment courses in grades 9 through 12, most concurrent enrollment courses in Colorado are offered to 11th and 12th grade students. Statewide, 32 percent of all 11th and 12th graders in public high schools in Colorado participated in concurrent enrollment in 2016-17. This study therefore involves cohorts of 11th grade students across five academic years, starting in the fall of 2009 through the fall of 2012. Given the data available for the period of the present study, four cohorts are constructed \u2013 starting when students were in 11th grade and defined by their expected high school graduation year. TABLE 1 presents the study\u2019s cohorts.\n\nInclusion Rules:\n\nEvaluation specific inclusion criteria include: (1) Must have 2008-09 baseline school-level data; (2) Must be a traditional student/school in which individuals earn a high school degree (or GED), typically done in four years (that is, the expected high school graduation date is in four years) because this is how most students experience concurrent enrollment education in Colorado. The definition of \u201ctraditional school\u201d includes charter and innovation schools that offered high school degrees; and (3) Must have a school sample size of 11th and 12th grade students that includes 10 or more students (per cohort), as \u201ctreatment\u201d is defined first at the school level and then at the student level, and investigators need a minimum number of students who were eligible to take concurrent enrollment.\n\nExclusion Rules:\n\nEvaluation specific exclusion criteria include:\n\n(1) Students who attended an Early College High School (ECHS) during the period of the study \u2013 Students attend a Colorado state board-approved high school that, through partnerships with institutions of higher education, enable them to earn 60 credits and an associate degree (or a specified number of college credits). The program is funded through the annual K-12 school finance act/PPR and is therefore exempt from Colorado\u2019s concurrent enrollment act. \n\n(2) ASCENT students \u2013 13th year of school. ASCENT stands for Accelerating Students through Concurrent ENrollmenT. Students who have completed at least 12 credit hours of postsecondary course prior to completion of their 12th grade year may be eligible for the ASCENT Program. They remain students in their Local Education Provider (LEP) for one year following their 12th grade year, and the LEP receives ASCENT specific per-pupil state funding that it uses to pay their college tuition at the resident community college rate. Students receive their high-school diplomas at the end of their ASCENT year. \n\n(3) Other dual \u2013 students taking a course outside Colorado\u2019s state-funded concurrent (or \u201cdual\u201d) enrollment program. Programs identified by the state of Colorado as \u201cother\u201d high school concurrent enrollment programs are administered directly by postsecondary institutions and do not fall under the state\u2019s statutory definition of concurrent enrollment. Students can receive college-level credit through these other programs, but they and their families may be required to pay for courses. Additionally, these completed courses are not required to transfer and/or apply to programs of study at other Colorado public institutions of higher education (Colorado Department of Higher Education, &amp; Colorado Department of Education, 2018).\n\nRecruitment\n\nThis project involves the same matched sample constructed for a study funded by the Institute of Education Sciences titled \u201cThe Outcomes and Return on Investment of Concurrent Enrollment in Colorado: A Researcher-Practitioner Partnership to Improve Postsecondary Access and Success\u201d (Award R305H170049; PIs K. Poast, Colorado Department of Higher Education, P. Buckley, University of Colorado Boulder). The IES-funded study is registered with the Registry of Efficacy and Effectiveness Studies (REES), and can be located here: https://sreereg.icpsr.umich.edu/framework/pdf/index.php?id=2232. The present study extends previous research to examine time-to-degree and earnings. \n\nThe treatment is defined as 11th and 12th grade students who attempted concurrent enrollment credits while attending a school with \u201cmore\u201d concurrent enrollment opportunities. Treatment students are compared to a business-as-usual comparison group of 11th and 12th grade students who did not attempt any concurrent enrollment credits while attending otherwise similar high schools offering \u201cfewer\u201d concurrent enrollment opportunities. Groups are identified at the school-level using the state median number of concurrent enrollment credits attempted in 2008-09 (the baseline year), with \u201cmore\u201d opportunities represented by schools at or above the state median and \u201cfewer\u201d reflecting schools below the state median. Baseline equivalence at the student level is established using Hedges g (with pooled standard deviations) for continuous variables and Cox\u2019s d for dichotomous measures. Research groups are formed as follows:\n\n1. As a first step, treatment and control schools are crudely matched on three school-level variables: a) free and reduced lunch status (FRL; a proxy for income in education research), b) ninth grade reading achievement, and c) college-going rates. In addition, high schools are exactly matched on urbanicity (urban/suburban vs. rural). For reference only (since baseline equivalence is formally established at the student level), treatment and comparison schools are well-matched on college-going rate (g = 0.10) and student achievement (g = 0.01), and less well-matched on FRL percent (g = 0.50).\n\n2. For each sample, if baseline equivalence is not achieved between all students attempting concurrent enrollment credits at the matched treatment schools (treatment students) and all students who did not attempt concurrent enrollment credits at the matched comparison schools (comparison students), 1:1, nearest neighbor propensity score matching without replacement will be used to match students across conditions by cohort, FRL status, gender, ninth grade reading achievement, minority status, and English language learner (ELL) status. Consistent with What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) standards as outlined in the Transition to College Review Protocol, baseline equivalence of better than 0.25 standard deviations will be established on ninth grade standardized reading scores and FRL status. All matching variables will also be included in analytic models. \n\nIn summary, treatment and comparison students are never drawn from the same school. By selecting comparison students from schools offering \u201cfewer\u201d concurrent enrollment opportunities, the potential confound from the self-selection of comparison students out of concurrent enrollment courses is minimized. Overall, this two-stage matching process will result in a comparison group that was very well matched to the treatment group at both school and student levels.\n\nFootnotes: \n\n(1) Exact matching at the school level is conducted on \u201curbanicity\u201d (i.e., whether the school was rural or urban/suburban) to arrive at results for common support because: (1) Groups were balanced before matching on all school-level variables except \u201cUrbanicity\u201d; (2) Concurrent enrollment access is determined at the school level and urbanicity strongly predicts concurrent enrollment offerings. Rural schools tend to lean heavily on concurrent enrollment because they do not have the student numbers to support alternative programs like Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB). Given this structural difference between rural and non-rural schools, we matched \u201cconcurrent enrollment rich\u201d rural schools only with \u201cconcurrent enrollment poor\u201d rural schools and \u201cconcurrent enrollment rich\u201d non-rural schools only with \u201cconcurrent enrollment poor\u201d non-rural schools.\n\n(2) Sequential matching process of schools first, then students within those schools. The logic for doing so is because in conducting a quasi-experimental design (QED), the matching process must address issues of access and opportunity (which is a structural issue), as investigators theorize that opportunity is correlated with whether schools offer concurrent enrollment courses.\n\nStudy Timeline:\n\nThis project is a retrospective study relying on secondary analysis of historical data. Cohorts of 11th grade students are followed across five academic years, starting in the fall of 2009 through the fall of 2012. In terms of outcomes, postsecondary data encompass academic year (AY) 2011-2012 through AY 2015- 2016. Unemployment insurance (UI) data is based on calendar year and quarter. For this study, earnings (UI) data encompass calendar year 2012 through 2018."}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Tables 1-6.docx"}, "nodeId": "cqm7t", "sha256": "c83fdeaa5353f3935d8caf6cab839ea5e5c18362f2627599486b6c32bf20bc47", "viewUrl": "/project/pdnyr/files/osfstorage/5e336f2df6631d00fb5a2ddc/", "selectedFileName": "Tables 1-6.docx"}], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "Postsecondary Outcomes:\n\nAs a result of the two-stage matching process followed for this study, the initial matched sample includes 25,262 students (12,631 in treatment and 12,631 in control) nested in 172 schools (86 in treatment and 86 in control) that are used to examine matriculation. We then obtain a second matched sample, using the same variables and effect size metrics described earlier, of 13,830 students (6,915 in treatment and 6,915 in control) in 168 schools (84 treatment, 84 control) who matriculated to college within one year of their expected high school graduation date to examine college completion and earnings. These 13,830 students are the sample for the present study. TABLE 2 presents the sample size (by cohort and overall) for the matched sample. Cohort is based on expected high school graduation (so the 2010-11 cohort would be in college in 2011-12, and so on). In sum, the matched sample examining postsecondary outcomes includes 13,830 students who graduated from a Colorado public high school and matriculated to a postsecondary institution (either in-state or out-of-state) within one year of their expected high school graduation date.  \n\nThe sample size for each postsecondary outcome varies depending on the number of years for which postsecondary available for each cohort (see TABLE 3). That is, cohorts one (expected high school graduation in 2010-2011) and two (expected high school graduation in 2011-2012) have up to five and four years of potential postsecondary data, respectively \u2013 thus all models assessing postsecondary outcomes will include these two cohorts. In contrast, cohort 4 (expected high school graduation in 2013-2014) has two years of potential postsecondary data and therefore this cohort can only be included in one of the models analyzing postsecondary outcomes for this study.\n\nEarnings Outcomes:\n\nThe matched sample of 13,830 students that matriculated to college within one year of expected high school graduation is also used to assess earnings. The Colorado Department of Higher Education (CDHE) will link students in the matched sample with students in the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE) dataset using social security number (SSN). Important limitations of this sample include: (1) Only students for whom CDHE can find unemployment insurance (UI) data in the CDLE dataset can be included in the analysis; (2) If a college graduate leaves Colorado for work, they do not show up in the CDLE dataset; (3) If an industry or particular employer does not conform with unemployment insurance (UI), CDLE will not have UI data for workers in these industries. This includes, but is not limited to, some who work in agricultural employment, military and federal civilian employment, railroad employment and self-employment, as these workers are not included in Colorado\u2019s UI database.\n\nIn sum, the sample evaluating earnings includes students with an SSN from the matched sample found in the CDLE unemployment insurance (UI) database who are employed in Colorado. The UI data, however, do not include all people in the labor force, omitting some in agricultural employment, military and federal civilian employment, railroad employment and those who are self-employed.\n\nOn average, the match rate of student-level postsecondary outcomes to student-level UI data is around 50 percent (though this match rate might vary a bit depending on the year, degree level, and program, as reported by CDHE). Thus, if the match rate hovers around 50 percent statewide, we should expect to find earnings outcomes for roughly half the matched sample (or 6,915 students). See estimated sample size by cohort in TABLE 4.\n\nLike the postsecondary outcomes, the sample size for each earnings outcome varies depending on the number of years for which unemployment insurance (UI) data are available for each cohort (see TABLE 5). That is, UI data pulled within 5 years of expected high school graduation date are available for cohorts 1 (expected high school graduation in 2010-2011), 2 (expected high school graduation in 2011-2012) and 3 (expected high school graduation in 2012-2013); this model will therefore only include these three cohorts. In contrast, all four cohorts will be included in the model assessing earnings within 3 years of expected high school graduation date.\n\nSample Size Summary:\n\nTABLE 6 provides a summary of each research question, data source, and students\u2019 expected educational progression during the periods covered by the present study. Included in Table 6 is a breakdown of the confirmatory vs. exploratory research questions along with an explanation of which cohorts will be included in each model given the years for which data are available from each data source.

We then obtain a second matched sample of students who matriculated to college within one year of high school, using the same variables and effect size metrics described earlier, of 13,830 students nested in 168 schools (84 treatment, 84 control). This second matched sample will be used for the present study. \n\nPower analyses conducted in PowerUp! [1] and Optimal Design [2] had these conservative assumptions: 2-level CRT; 168 schools at baseline with an average cluster size of n=82 students; .10 and .30 for the proportion of variance accounted for by level 2 and level 1 covariates; p &lt; .05; and a conservative estimate of ICCs r =.10 for college completion outcomes. Based on the literature on designing a study at the secondary level that includes binary outcomes [3, 4, 5, 6] and intervention studies that reported effect sizes for postsecondary outcomes including college completion [7, 8, 9], ICCs for the postsecondary outcomes range from .02-.10 and effect sizes typically range from small to small-medium (Cohen\u2019s d = .20 - .29). We will have power of .80 to achieve a minimum detectable effect size (MDES) of d = .043 for primary outcomes, indicating that the study is sufficiently powered to detect a small intervention effect size at a minimum at the posttest. Studies on earnings outcomes for school-based interventions implemented at the secondary level are sparse. Thus, using the same metrics described above, but expecting half the sample size (86 schools with an average cluster size of n=80) due to the linking of postsecondary datasets to earnings data sets (described elsewhere in this document), we will have a power of .80 to achieve a MDES of d = .061. This bodes well for the evaluation\u2019s ability to identify an effect for college completion and earnings outcomes, should one exist, as these minimum detectible effect sizes are smaller than the anticipated impacts of the intervention. In addition, the power of the full estimation models is expected to be enhanced by including control variables that account for a meaningful proportion of variance in the outcomes."}, "q15": {"extra": [], "value": "N/A"}, "q16": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q17": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Postsecondary Outcome Variables: \n\nStudents enroll in public two-year community colleges to pursue a variety of goals. Some want to learn specific skills but not necessarily earn a credential. Others may want to obtain an industry-recognized certificate, take remedial courses to prepare for further postsecondary education, or take courses to prepare for transfer to a four-year college or university. In short, the goal for many community college students is not an associate degree, and many who earn an associate degree will seek four-year degrees. Considering these factors, college success will be assessed using different measures (each analyzed as a separate model): \n\n(1) Earning a credential within two years of expected high school graduation date. This sample will include students who initially enroll in a 2-year institution, and will not include students who start at a 2-year college and transfer to a 4-year institution within 2 years of their expected high school graduation date.\n\n(2) Earning a four-year degree within four years of expected high school graduation date. This sample will include students who initially enroll in a 4-year institution. It also will include those who enroll in a 2-year college and transfer to a 4-year institution within 2 years of their expected high school graduation date. In addition, the sample will include those who initially enroll in a 2-year college, earn a credential, and then enroll immediately in a 4-year institution.\n\n(3) Earning a four-year degree within three years of expected high school graduation date. This sample will include students who initially enroll in a 4-year institution. It also will include those who enroll in a 2-year college and transfer to a 4-year institution within 2 years of their expected high school graduation date.

However, the Colorado Department of Education (CDE) data set does not contain SSN. Thus, the only opportunity to identify earnings outcomes for secondary students in this study is for cases in which the student matriculated to college. For this reason, the earnings analysis is limited to students who attempted at least one postsecondary course. The analysis will therefore examine:\n\n(1) Earnings five years after students\u2019 expected high school graduation date. This analysis will include all students in the matched sample for which a SSN is located in the unemployment insurance (UI) data. Quarterly data will be summed for the fifth calendar year after a student\u2019s expected high school graduation date. For example, for students whose expected high school graduation date was May 2012, their earnings will be summed from Q1 2017 to Q4 2017.\n\n(2) Earnings three years after expected high school graduation date for those who initially matriculated to a 2-year college. This analysis will be limited to only those students from the matched sample who matriculated to a 2-year college and did not transfer to a 4-year college. Quarterly data will be summed for the third calendar year after a student\u2019s expected high school graduation date. For example, for students whose expected high school date was May 2012, their earnings their earnings will be summed from Q1 2015 to Q4 2015.\n\nFootnote: Wages are pay for a set amount of time (e.g. dollars paid per hour) and are not available in unemployment insurance (UI) data.

The data used in this study are therefore administrative, collected by Colorado state agencies as part of their regular job duties. ", "q13": "Postsecondary Outcomes:\n\nAs a result of the two-stage matching process followed for this study, the initial matched sample includes 25,262 students (12,631 in treatment and 12,631 in control) nested in 172 schools (86 in treatment and 86 in control) that are used to examine matriculation. We then obtain a second matched sample, using the same variables and effect size metrics described earlier, of 13,830 students (6,915 in treatment and 6,915 in control) in 168 schools (84 treatment, 84 control) who matriculated to college within one year of their expected high school graduation date to examine college completion and earnings. These 13,830 students are the sample for the present study. TABLE 2 presents the sample size (by cohort and overall) for the matched sample. Cohort is based on expected high school graduation (so the 2010-11 cohort would be in college in 2011-12, and so on). In sum, the matched sample examining postsecondary outcomes includes 13,830 students who graduated from a Colorado public high school and matriculated to a postsecondary institution (either in-state or out-of-state) within one year of their expected high school graduation date.  \n\nThe sample size for each postsecondary outcome varies depending on the number of years for which postsecondary available for each cohort (see TABLE 3). That is, cohorts one (expected high school graduation in 2010-2011) and two (expected high school graduation in 2011-2012) have up to five and four years of potential postsecondary data, respectively \u2013 thus all models assessing postsecondary outcomes will include these two cohorts. In contrast, cohort 4 (expected high school graduation in 2013-2014) has two years of potential postsecondary data and therefore this cohort can only be included in one of the models analyzing postsecondary outcomes for this study.\n\nEarnings Outcomes:\n\nThe matched sample of 13,830 students that matriculated to college within one year of expected high school graduation is also used to assess earnings. The Colorado Department of Higher Education (CDHE) will link students in the matched sample with students in the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE) dataset using social security number (SSN). Important limitations of this sample include: (1) Only students for whom CDHE can find unemployment insurance (UI) data in the CDLE dataset can be included in the analysis; (2) If a college graduate leaves Colorado for work, they do not show up in the CDLE dataset; (3) If an industry or particular employer does not conform with unemployment insurance (UI), CDLE will not have UI data for workers in these industries. This includes, but is not limited to, some who work in agricultural employment, military and federal civilian employment, railroad employment and self-employment, as these workers are not included in Colorado\u2019s UI database.\n\nIn sum, the sample evaluating earnings includes students with an SSN from the matched sample found in the CDLE unemployment insurance (UI) database who are employed in Colorado. The UI data, however, do not include all people in the labor force, omitting some in agricultural employment, military and federal civilian employment, railroad employment and those who are self-employed.\n\nOn average, the match rate of student-level postsecondary outcomes to student-level UI data is around 50 percent (though this match rate might vary a bit depending on the year, degree level, and program, as reported by CDHE). Thus, if the match rate hovers around 50 percent statewide, we should expect to find earnings outcomes for roughly half the matched sample (or 6,915 students). See estimated sample size by cohort in TABLE 4.\n\nLike the postsecondary outcomes, the sample size for each earnings outcome varies depending on the number of years for which unemployment insurance (UI) data are available for each cohort (see TABLE 5). That is, UI data pulled within 5 years of expected high school graduation date are available for cohorts 1 (expected high school graduation in 2010-2011), 2 (expected high school graduation in 2011-2012) and 3 (expected high school graduation in 2012-2013); this model will therefore only include these three cohorts. In contrast, all four cohorts will be included in the model assessing earnings within 3 years of expected high school graduation date.\n\nSample Size Summary:\n\nTABLE 6 provides a summary of each research question, data source, and students\u2019 expected educational progression during the periods covered by the present study. Included in Table 6 is a breakdown of the confirmatory vs. exploratory research questions along with an explanation of which cohorts will be included in each model given the years for which data are available from each data source. ", "q14": "In the study pre-registered with REES (described elsewhere in this document), the initial matched sample includes 25,262 students (12,631 in treatment and 12,631 in control) nested in 172 schools (86 in treatment and 86 in control) that are used to examine matriculation to college within one year of expected high school graduation date. We then obtain a second matched sample of students who matriculated to college within one year of high school, using the same variables and effect size metrics described earlier, of 13,830 students nested in 168 schools (84 treatment, 84 control). This second matched sample will be used for the present study. \n\nPower analyses conducted in PowerUp! [1] and Optimal Design [2] had these conservative assumptions: 2-level CRT; 168 schools at baseline with an average cluster size of n=82 students; .10 and .30 for the proportion of variance accounted for by level 2 and level 1 covariates; p &lt; .05; and a conservative estimate of ICCs r =.10 for college completion outcomes. Based on the literature on designing a study at the secondary level that includes binary outcomes [3, 4, 5, 6] and intervention studies that reported effect sizes for postsecondary outcomes including college completion [7, 8, 9], ICCs for the postsecondary outcomes range from .02-.10 and effect sizes typically range from small to small-medium (Cohen\u2019s d = .20 - .29). We will have power of .80 to achieve a minimum detectable effect size (MDES) of d = .043 for primary outcomes, indicating that the study is sufficiently powered to detect a small intervention effect size at a minimum at the posttest. Studies on earnings outcomes for school-based interventions implemented at the secondary level are sparse. Thus, using the same metrics described above, but expecting half the sample size (86 schools with an average cluster size of n=80) due to the linking of postsecondary datasets to earnings data sets (described elsewhere in this document), we will have a power of .80 to achieve a MDES of d = .061. This bodes well for the evaluation\u2019s ability to identify an effect for college completion and earnings outcomes, should one exist, as these minimum detectible effect sizes are smaller than the anticipated impacts of the intervention.

Cohorts are designated by the school year in which students were in 11th grade because while the 2009 legislation designated all high school students as eligible to participate in concurrent enrollment courses in grades 9 through 12, most concurrent enrollment courses in Colorado are offered to 11th and 12th grade students. Statewide, 32 percent of all 11th and 12th graders in public high schools in Colorado participated in concurrent enrollment in 2016-17. This study therefore involves cohorts of 11th grade students across five academic years, starting in the fall of 2009 through the fall of 2012. Given the data available for the period of the present study, four cohorts are constructed \u2013 starting when students were in 11th grade and defined by their expected high school graduation year. TABLE 1 presents the study\u2019s cohorts.\n\nInclusion Rules:\n\nEvaluation specific inclusion criteria include: (1) Must have 2008-09 baseline school-level data; (2) Must be a traditional student/school in which individuals earn a high school degree (or GED), typically done in four years (that is, the expected high school graduation date is in four years) because this is how most students experience concurrent enrollment education in Colorado. The definition of \u201ctraditional school\u201d includes charter and innovation schools that offered high school degrees; and (3) Must have a school sample size of 11th and 12th grade students that includes 10 or more students (per cohort), as \u201ctreatment\u201d is defined first at the school level and then at the student level, and investigators need a minimum number of students who were eligible to take concurrent enrollment.\n\nExclusion Rules:\n\nEvaluation specific exclusion criteria include:\n\n(1) Students who attended an Early College High School (ECHS) during the period of the study \u2013 Students attend a Colorado state board-approved high school that, through partnerships with institutions of higher education, enable them to earn 60 credits and an associate degree (or a specified number of college credits). The program is funded through the annual K-12 school finance act/PPR and is therefore exempt from Colorado\u2019s concurrent enrollment act. \n\n(2) ASCENT students \u2013 13th year of school. ASCENT stands for Accelerating Students through Concurrent ENrollmenT. Students who have completed at least 12 credit hours of postsecondary course prior to completion of their 12th grade year may be eligible for the ASCENT Program. They remain students in their Local Education Provider (LEP) for one year following their 12th grade year, and the LEP receives ASCENT specific per-pupil state funding that it uses to pay their college tuition at the resident community college rate. Students receive their high-school diplomas at the end of their ASCENT year. \n\n(3) Other dual \u2013 students taking a course outside Colorado\u2019s state-funded concurrent (or \u201cdual\u201d) enrollment program. Programs identified by the state of Colorado as \u201cother\u201d high school concurrent enrollment programs are administered directly by postsecondary institutions and do not fall under the state\u2019s statutory definition of concurrent enrollment. Students can receive college-level credit through these other programs, but they and their families may be required to pay for courses. Additionally, these completed courses are not required to transfer and/or apply to programs of study at other Colorado public institutions of higher education (Colorado Department of Higher Education, &amp; Colorado Department of Education, 2018).\n\nRecruitment\n\nThis project involves the same matched sample constructed for a study funded by the Institute of Education Sciences titled \u201cThe Outcomes and Return on Investment of Concurrent Enrollment in Colorado: A Researcher-Practitioner Partnership to Improve Postsecondary Access and Success\u201d (Award R305H170049; PIs K. Poast, Colorado Department of Higher Education, P. Buckley, University of Colorado Boulder). The IES-funded study is registered with the Registry of Efficacy and Effectiveness Studies (REES), and can be located here: https://sreereg.icpsr.umich.edu/framework/pdf/index.php?id=2232. The present study extends previous research to examine time-to-degree and earnings. \n\nThe treatment is defined as 11th and 12th grade students who attempted concurrent enrollment credits while attending a school with \u201cmore\u201d concurrent enrollment opportunities. Treatment students are compared to a business-as-usual comparison group of 11th and 12th grade students who did not attempt any concurrent enrollment credits while attending otherwise similar high schools offering \u201cfewer\u201d concurrent enrollment opportunities. Groups are identified at the school-level using the state median number of concurrent enrollment credits attempted in 2008-09 (the baseline year), with \u201cmore\u201d opportunities represented by schools at or above the state median and \u201cfewer\u201d reflecting schools below the state median. Baseline equivalence at the student level is established using Hedges g (with pooled standard deviations) for continuous variables and Cox\u2019s d for dichotomous measures. Research groups are formed as follows:\n\n1. As a first step, treatment and control schools are crudely matched on three school-level variables: a) free and reduced lunch status (FRL; a proxy for income in education research), b) ninth grade reading achievement, and c) college-going rates. In addition, high schools are exactly matched on urbanicity (urban/suburban vs. rural). For reference only (since baseline equivalence is formally established at the student level), treatment and comparison schools are well-matched on college-going rate (g = 0.10) and student achievement (g = 0.01), and less well-matched on FRL percent (g = 0.50).\n\n2. For each sample, if baseline equivalence is not achieved between all students attempting concurrent enrollment credits at the matched treatment schools (treatment students) and all students who did not attempt concurrent enrollment credits at the matched comparison schools (comparison students), 1:1, nearest neighbor propensity score matching without replacement will be used to match students across conditions by cohort, FRL status, gender, ninth grade reading achievement, minority status, and English language learner (ELL) status. Consistent with What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) standards as outlined in the Transition to College Review Protocol, baseline equivalence of better than 0.25 standard deviations will be established on ninth grade standardized reading scores and FRL status. All matching variables will also be included in analytic models. \n\nIn summary, treatment and comparison students are never drawn from the same school. By selecting comparison students from schools offering \u201cfewer\u201d concurrent enrollment opportunities, the potential confound from the self-selection of comparison students out of concurrent enrollment courses is minimized. Overall, this two-stage matching process will result in a comparison group that was very well matched to the treatment group at both school and student levels.\n\nFootnotes: \n\n(1) Exact matching at the school level is conducted on \u201curbanicity\u201d (i.e., whether the school was rural or urban/suburban) to arrive at results for common support because: (1) Groups were balanced before matching on all school-level variables except \u201cUrbanicity\u201d; (2) Concurrent enrollment access is determined at the school level and urbanicity strongly predicts concurrent enrollment offerings. Rural schools tend to lean heavily on concurrent enrollment because they do not have the student numbers to support alternative programs like Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB). Given this structural difference between rural and non-rural schools, we matched \u201cconcurrent enrollment rich\u201d rural schools only with \u201cconcurrent enrollment poor\u201d rural schools and \u201cconcurrent enrollment rich\u201d non-rural schools only with \u201cconcurrent enrollment poor\u201d non-rural schools.\n\n(2) Sequential matching process of schools first, then students within those schools. The logic for doing so is because in conducting a quasi-experimental design (QED), the matching process must address issues of access and opportunity (which is a structural issue), as investigators theorize that opportunity is correlated with whether schools offer concurrent enrollment courses.\n\nStudy Timeline:\n\nThis project is a retrospective study relying on secondary analysis of historical data. Cohorts of 11th grade students are followed across five academic years, starting in the fall of 2009 through the fall of 2012. In terms of outcomes, postsecondary data encompass academic year (AY) 2011-2012 through AY 2015- 2016. Unemployment insurance (UI) data is based on calendar year and quarter.

In short, the goal for many community college students is not an associate degree, and many who earn an associate degree will seek four-year degrees. Considering these factors, college success will be assessed using different measures (each analyzed as a separate model): \n\n(1) Earning a credential within two years of expected high school graduation date. This sample will include students who initially enroll in a 2-year institution, and will not include students who start at a 2-year college and transfer to a 4-year institution within 2 years of their expected high school graduation date.\n\n(2) Earning a four-year degree within four years of expected high school graduation date. This sample will include students who initially enroll in a 4-year institution. It also will include those who enroll in a 2-year college and transfer to a 4-year institution within 2 years of their expected high school graduation date. In addition, the sample will include those who initially enroll in a 2-year college, earn a credential, and then enroll immediately in a 4-year institution.\n\n(3) Earning a four-year degree within three years of expected high school graduation date. This sample will include students who initially enroll in a 4-year institution. It also will include those who enroll in a 2-year college and transfer to a 4-year institution within 2 years of their expected high school graduation date. In addition, the sample will include those who initially enroll in a 2-year college, earn a credential, and then enroll immediately in a 4-year institution.\n\nEarnings Outcome Variables:\n\nBoth the Colorado Department of Higher Education (CDHE) and Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE) data sets provide social security numbers (SSN), which allows the departments to link data sets. However, the Colorado Department of Education (CDE) data set does not contain SSN. Thus, the only opportunity to identify earnings outcomes for secondary students in this study is for cases in which the student matriculated to college. For this reason, the earnings analysis is limited to students who attempted at least one postsecondary course. The analysis will therefore examine:\n\n(1) Earnings five years after students\u2019 expected high school graduation date. This analysis will include all students in the matched sample for which a SSN is located in the unemployment insurance (UI) data. Quarterly data will be summed for the fifth calendar year after a student\u2019s expected high school graduation date. For example, for students whose expected high school graduation date was May 2012, their earnings will be summed from Q1 2017 to Q4 2017.\n\n(2) Earnings three years after expected high school graduation date for those who initially matriculated to a 2-year college. This analysis will be limited to only those students from the matched sample who matriculated to a 2-year college and did not transfer to a 4-year college. Quarterly data will be summed for the third calendar year after a student\u2019s expected high school graduation date. For example, for students whose expected high school date was May 2012, their earnings their earnings will be summed from Q1 2015 to Q4 2015.\n\nFootnote: Wages are pay for a set amount of time (e.g. dollars paid per hour) and are not available in unemployment insurance (UI) data. Earnings are wage*hours worked, which is what is reported in UI data. An important limitation of this work is that whether earnings are higher for treatment students (supposing the research hypothesis holds) because the wage is higher or because more hours are worked cannot be determined.\n\nMeasured variables:\n\n\u2022\tQuarterly earnings (3 and 5-year)\n\u2022\tPostsecondary enrollment institution type (2 vs. 4 year)\n\u2022\tDegree completion (2 and 4 year)\n\u2022\tEnglish language learner status\n\u2022\tRace/Ethnicity\n\u2022\tUrbanicity\n\u2022\tGender\n\u2022\t9th grade reading standardized test scores\n\u2022\tCondition", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Statistical Models:\n\nThree separate confirmatory analyses will be run, each on the sample of students who matriculate to college within one year of their expected high school graduation date.

For each model, multi-level regression models will be employed. Mixed effects logistic regression models will be used to estimate the odds of on-time or early college completion, while linear regression will be used to model earnings in the fifth year after expected high school graduation for matched students in the treatment group who matriculate to college compared to matched students in the control group who matriculate to college, while adjusting for school-level clustering (by including random intercepts for high schools) and student-level characteristics. Student-level controls will include ELL status, urbanicity, income, ethnicity, gender, ninth grade reading scores, and cohort in all models. We will use the Bonferroni method of adjustment for multiple comparisons when running each model.

We predict a main effect of hierarchy-relevance of job (hierarchy-enhancing, hierarchy-attenuating) in predicting White evaluators\u2019 ratings of White applicant fit, such that evaluators rate a White applicant as a better fit for a hierarchy-enhancing (versus -attenuating) job. As an exploratory step, we will also test whether this effect is moderated by job status (high, low) by asking evaluate an applicant seeking either a high-status (i.e., CEO) or low status (i.e., entry level associate) job at a hierarchy-enhancing (hedge fund) or hierarchy-enhancing (nonprofit) organization.

On the other hand, if they are uncorrelated, we will interpret the results with respect to the independent correlations of each measure with risk preferences.\n\nAs a positive control, we will fit a separate Bayesian beta regression model using Stan, regressing proportional extraversion scores (i.e. IPIP NEO-PI-R sum scores, normalized to the range of [0,1]) on the proportion of choices for certain over risky gambles (i.e. average of choice across the 52 certain/risky gambles). The regression model involves three free parameters as above. \n\nH2: Subclinical anxiety will be positively correlated with pessimism in the interpretation of probabilities, as measured by decreased probability elevation in gains (delta-plus parameter of prospect theory models) and increased probability elevation in losses (delta-minus parameter of prospect theory models).\n\nWe will fit a Bayesian beta regression model using Stan, regression proportional anxiety scores (i.e. STAI-T sum scores, normalized to the range of [0,1]) on the estimated probability elevation parameters from our CPT model. The regression model involves three free parameters as above. \n\nTo measure individual differences in probability weighting, we will fit hierarchical Bayesian cumulative prospect theory (CPT) models to the choice data. Despite the long history of CPT, there is no single agreed-upon CPT model; the best-fitting variant of CPT models varies across studies &amp; datasets.\n\nAs such, we plan to test three variants of CPT models. The most basic (CPT-A) consists of five parameters: risk sensitivity (alpha), probability curvature (gamma), probability elevation in gain (delta-plus), probability elevation in loss (delta-minus), and choice sensitivity (theta). Note that this model allows for different evaluations of probabilities in gains vs. losses, and eliminates the common loss aversion parameter. This design choice is motivated by recent evidence which found probability elevation to be domain dependent and to better explain putative loss aversion (Pachur &amp; Kellen, 2013, https://escholarship.org/uc/item/27n5s4wn).\n\nThe second and third families of models (CPT-B, CPT-C) are both extensions of CPT-A. The CPT-B models differ in that they include loss aversion (lambda), whereas the CPT-C models differ in that they include separate probability curvature parameters for gain and loss (gamma-plus, gamma-minus). CPT-B is motivated by the canonical CPT literature on loss aversion; CPT-C is motivated by previous work which found domain dependencies on probability curvature (Pachur &amp; Kellen, 2013, https://escholarship.org/uc/item/27n5s4wn).\n\nAll models will be fit using the Stan probabilistic programming language. Both no-pooling and partial-pooling versions of each model will be fit, where the former fits each participant separately and the latter estimates participant parameters constrained by a group-level distribution. To determine the best-fitting of the six models, the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) will be computed for each model at the level of the participant. The best fitting model should have a greater WAIC with non-overlapping standard errors of the difference in WAIC between it and other models (the delta-WAIC statistic). If there is a tie, we will appeal to parsimony (i.e., select the model with fewer parameters).\n\nWe note that we will be running the best-fitting CPT model and beta regression simultaneously (i.e. joint-modeling). The Bayesian joint-modeling framework naturally takes into account uncertainty in parameter estimates, thereby downweighting the influence of noisy or uncertain parameters in the correlation (Boehm et al., 2018, DOI: 10.3758/s13428-017-0940-4).\n\nWe have already programmed the analysis models in Stan, and are available for inspection here (https://github.com/nivlab/AnxiousProspects/releases/tag/preregistration).

In turn, the choice sensitivity parameter (theta) is sampled in the range of [0,1], which we found to be appropriate for the magnitude range of our gambles. \n\nTo measure convergent validity, we will repeat the same analyses above using instead the proportional generalized anxiety scores (i.e. GAD-7 sum scores, normalized to the range of [0,1]).

Broadly, we aim to characterize research on the strength and directionality of this association, the time intervals used throughout this research, the populations from which this research has sampled from, mechanisms (i.e., mediators) of this association, the quantitative methods used, and how amenable to open science practices (i.e., preregistering hypotheses, making data publicly available) this research has been thus far."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "We expect that the majority of research will provide support for the existence of a bidirectional association between loneliness and depression (i.e., that loneliness at T predicts depression at T+1 and that depression at T predicts loneliness at T+1).

It is well established that chronic feelings of loneliness frequently co-occur with depression, however the causal nature of this relationship, as well as various mechanisms, is not well understood. The purpose of this scoping review is to examine the current state of research on the longitudinal (i.e., prospective) association between loneliness and depression. Broadly, we aim to characterize research on the strength and directionality of this association, the time intervals used throughout this research, the populations from which this research has sampled from, mechanisms (i.e., mediators) of this association, the quantitative methods used, and how amenable to open science practices (i.e., preregistering hypotheses, making data publicly available) this research has been thus far.", "q4": "We expect that the majority of research will provide support for the existence of a bidirectional association between loneliness and depression (i.e., that loneliness at T predicts depression at T+1 and that depression at T predicts loneliness at T+1).
