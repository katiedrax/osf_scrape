Topological analyses of hierarchical clustering have been successfully applied to neuroimaging studies, neuropsychological testing, and pharmacological testing.  Patterns formulated in survey response data can be conceptualized in terms of geometric structures. The properties of connections between structures can be computed utilizing properties of homotopy and homology. Using filtration, which iteratively changes the perspective of data being examined can create nested sequences of features in the data as algebraic objects. This information can be reapplied in the creation of topological features in the data by going up/down a certain number of filtrations in the data. Hierarchical clustering analysis, which is a machine learning algorithm that can group like objects into categorically similar arrangements, can be applied to the topological filtrations created in this process. The patterns in the data can be visualized using dendrograms, or topological mappings in the geometry of survey items.

We will employ the Hausdorff metric, which measures the distance between two objects objects in the same dimension.

We conduct two survey experiments - one in the Israel and one in the United States. We present respondents with a news article describing a contentious action in their country.

Hypothesis 3b: Contentious political actions perpetrated by an out-group member are more likely to be classified as violent and justify a repressive state response if the actions occur more proximate to the observer.
