depression, suicidality, anxiety and substance use problems as well as social problems such as childhood adversity and intimate partner violence. These psychosocial difficulties have in turn been shown to be associated with increased risky sexual behaviour and risk for HIV infection in the general population and among non-heterosexual men. \nThere is evidence that shared genetic and environmental factors respectively influence the association between mental health problems and sexual orientation, and risky sexual behaviour. The aetiology of the relationship between sexual orientation and disparities in psychosocial risk and risky sexual behaviour is not yet well understood. \nWe recently demonstrated that increased mental health problems partly explained increased risky sexual behaviour among non-heterosexual individuals and that this mediation relationship was not confounded by shared aetiological influences. However, measures of social disparity were not included and the assessment of risky sexual behaviour was mostly based on the number of sexual partners. It will be informative to test this genetic model in a different sample incorporating better psychosocial variables and a broader index of risky sexual behaviour.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-01-31T09:40:35.381424", "date_modified": "2020-01-31T09:38:37.775452", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": null, "analytics_key": "c6b98a3e38604fede38be61a5576434ed6548d7e32e7807d32316e271d16f2f318fab7d1a72fd4d985f6c49c88b79c1e25cd219297d46738578753df5ba0b5e89637304f9c8ab8e27f6a548c117b6a7a97ee77e4e4d806eb184a65d55a5d3029288f207f84b5db4ff8e711ae21ed1f1413b1b9a6826001a6492160200a0a482f452038c6ebd258fc946c416446f411c8", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-01-31T09:40:35.352719", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Open-Ended Registration", "registered_meta": {"summary": {"extra": [], "value": "This registration contains a description of background, the research questions and hypotheses, the data to be used, the list of variables to be used and the questionnaires used to assess them and the analysis plan."}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Preregistration of Secondary Data Analysis -

Samples\n\nSummary: This registration document contains the analysis plan for a factorial analysis of a Life Goal measure. After this analysis, we plan to use this measure in a project that will assess changes in personality traits and facets and life goals and their relationships with occupational creativity. This project will use data from two existing datasets. The overarching project has two primary goals: (1) to examine how personality traits (including facet level measures) and goals develop and change during adolescence and young adulthood and (2) to examine whether changes in personality traits and goals (over and above initial levels of personality and goals) predict occupational creativity. We will follow 2 steps in preregistering this project: At step 1 (current document) we register our analysis plan for the exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis for the life goals measure employed in the study. After evaluating the factorial structure of the goals measure, and in light of the factorial analyses results, we will register hypotheses and research questions at step 2. Both registration documents follow the preregistration template, \u201cPreregistration of secondary data analysis: A template and tutorial\u201d (den Akker et al., 2019). \n\nPart 1: Study information\nQ1: Provide the working title of your study.\n \nA1: Changes in Personality Traits and Life Goals in the Transition to Young Adulthood and their association with Occupational Creativity\n\nQ2: Name the authors of this preregistration. \n\nA2: \nAndreea Sutu \nORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3958-3154\nRodica Damian\nORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0046-0627\nKevin Hoff \nORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3265-2209\nSif Einarsd\u00f3ttir\n ORCID https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8039-5203\nJames Rounds\n\nQ3: List each research question included in this study.\nA3: At step 1 of this preregistration, our research question is: What is the factor structure of the Life Goals measure employed in this study?\n\nQ4: For each of the research questions listed in the previous section, provide one or more specific and testable hypotheses, and make it clear whether the hypotheses are directional (e.g., A &gt; B) or non-directional (e.g., A =\u0338 B). If directional, state the direction.\n \nA4: We expect that the measure will show a factorial make-up similar to the one emerging in previous studies that have employed a longer version of this measure (Roberts &amp; Robins,2000) or different samples (Stoll et al., under review). \n\nPart 2: Data description \nQ5: Name and briefly describe the dataset(s), and if applicable, the subset(s) of the data you plan to use.\n \n\nA5:\tThe study will use two existing longitudinal datasets collected over a 12-year span.\nSample 1 (N1 = 485) was younger and more homogenous in age at time one (average age = 15.3 years, SD = 0.5) compared to Sample 2 (average age = 17.9, SD = 3.5). Sample 1 was assessed over five waves (time 1, and two-, six-, eight- and eleven-years later), while Sample 2 (N2 = 1,368) was assessed over three waves (time 1 and six- and twelve-years later).  Both samples were representative of the Icelandic student population. Participation was voluntary and not compensated. \n\nQ6: Specify whether this data is open or publicly available.\n \nA6: The data are not publicly available. \n\nQ7: How can the data be accessed? Provide a persistent identifier or link if the data are available online, or give a description of how you obtained the dataset.\n \nA7: The data cannot be publicly accessed.\n\nQ8: Specify the date of download and/or access.\n \n\nA8: Andreea Sutu and Rodica Damian have not yet accessed the data at the time of the current preregistration. \n\nKevin Hoff has accessed the data for previous papers using the personality and vocational interest measures. Kevin first accessed the dataset in Fall 2016, but has not analyzed the data for the proposed study (i.e., the life goals items and personality facets).\nSif Einarsd\u00f3ttir and James Rounds collected the data beginning in 2006. They have not analyzed the life goals and personality facets data.\n\nQ9: If the data collection procedure is well documented, provide a link to that information. If the data collection procedure is not well documented, describe, to the best of your ability, how data were collected.\n \nA9: The data for both samples was first collected in 2006 across eighty randomly chosen schools (forty for each sample). A website link with access to the measures was sent through e-mail to participants who accepted to take part in the study. E-mails were sent to request participation, followed by phone calls to non-responders for the following waves for each sample.  The dataset and the collection procedure is described in detail here: Hoff, Song, Einarsdo\u0301ttir, Briley, &amp; Rounds, 2018, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, DOI: 10.1037/pspp0000228.\n\nQ10: Some studies offer codebooks to describe their data. If such a codebook is publicly available, link to it here or upload the document. If not, provide other available documentation. Also provide guidance on what parts of the codebook or other documentation are most relevant. \nA10: A codebook is available on Step 2 of the preregistration process which will include all measures used in the project. \n\nPart 3: Variables \nQ11: If you are going to use any manipulated variables, identify them here. Describe the variables and the levels or treatment arms of each variable (note that this is not applicable for observational studies and meta-analyses). If you are collapsing groups across variables this should be explicitly stated, including the relevant formula.\n \nA11: Not applicable\n\nQ12: If you are going to use any measured variables, identify them here. Describe both outcome measures as well as predictors and covariates and label them accordingly. If you are using a scale (a set of items that have an underlying latent construct) or an index (a set of items that directly indicate a value or quantity), state the construct the scale/index represents, which items the scale/index will consist of, how these items will be aggregated, and whether this aggregation is based on a recommendation from the study codebook or validation research. If you are using any categorical variables, state how you will code them in the statistical analyses. \n\nA12: The Major Life Goals measure employed is the same across both samples. The study measure was based on the major life goals proposed by Roberts and Robins (2000) which contained 35 items across seven broad domains: Economic, Aesthetic, Social, Relationship, Political, Hedonistic, and Religious life goals. However, the current study measure used only 26 of the life goals listed in the original measure, along with two additional items that aimed to assess goals related to education (27 items in total). Exploration and validation of the current study life goals measure is warranted, given that we employ a different number of items and a different wording of items compared to the original measure. \nParticipants rated the importance of 27 life goals on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (not important to me) to 5 (very important to me). The complete list of items is shown below.\n1.\tHaving an exciting lifestyle\n2.\tHelping others in need\n3.\tDevoting attention to my spiritual life\n4.\tHaving a high standard of living and wealth\n5.\tOwning my own business\n6.\tHaving harmonious relationship with my parents and siblings\n7.\tHaving fun\n8.\tHaving children\n9.\tHaving good grades in school\n10.\tBeing influential in public affairs\n11.\tBecoming accomplished in one of the performing arts\n12.\tHaving new and different experiences\n13.\tWrite good fiction and prose\n14.\tHaving a career\n15.\tSupporting artistic activities and fine arts\n16.\tObtaining a high school degree\n17.\tTaking part in volunteer community and public service\n18.\tParticipating in religious activity\n19.\tPrepare myself for graduate school\n20.\tHaving a satisfying marriage/relationship\n21.\tBecoming a community leader\n22.\tHaving a high-status career\n23.\tBe an accomplished musician\n24.\tBecoming an authority on a special subject in my field\n25.\tBecoming a business executive\n26.\tProduce good artistic work\n27.\tWorking to promote the welfare of others\n\nQ13: Which units of analysis (respondents, cases, etc.) will be included or excluded in your study? Taking these inclusion/exclusion criteria into account, indicate the (expected) sample size of the data you\u2019ll be using for your statistical analyses (to the best of your knowledge). In the next few questions, you will be asked to refine this sample size estimation based on your judgments about missing data and outliers. \nA13. The Table below summarizes the sample sizes at each wave.\n\nBased on an age cut-off of 21 years old and younger (exclusion of participants if they are 22 years old or older), we expect the following sample sizes:\nSample 1 Wave 1 Total N = 485\n\nSample 2 Wave 1 Total N = 1,290\nN of respondents to the Major Life Goal measure:  \n\nQ14: What do you know about missing data in the data set (e.g., overall missingness rate, information about differential dropout)? How will you deal with incomplete or missing data? Based on this information, provide a new expected sample size.\n \n\nA14. Missing data: FIML analyses will be employed to deal with missing data.\n\nQ15: How will you define what a statistical outlier is in your data and what will you do when you encounter them? If you plan to remove outliers, provide a new expected sample size. Note that this will be the definitive expected sample size for your study and you will use this number to do any power analyses. \nPart 4: Knowledge of data \n\nQ17: List the publications, conference presentations (papers, posters), and working papers (in prep, unpublished, preprints) you have worked on that are based on the data set. Describe which variables you have previously analyzed and which information you used in these analyses. Limit yourself to variables that are relevant to the current study. If the dataset is longitudinal, include information about what wave of data was previously analyzed. \nImportantly, some of your team members may have used this dataset and others may not have. It is therefore important to specify the relevant work from every co-author separately. If possible, mention other researchers\u2019 work with this dataset that is relevant to the current preregistration.\n \n\nA17: Below we provide a list of all existing publications, presentations, and working papers what have used the datasets. \nUp to date, there is one paper that has employed the Life Goals measure from Sample 2, wave 1: \n\nStoll, G., Einarsdottir, S., Song, Q.C., Ondish, P., Sun J., Rounds, J. (under review). The Roles of Personality Traits and Vocational Interests in Explaining What People Want out of Life.  Journal blinded for review.\n\nThe following studies have employed one or both of the samples that will be used in our study. None of these has employed the Life Goals measure. \nHanna, L. Einarsdo\u0301ttir, S., Briley, D. A., Hoff, K. A. Rounds, J. (working paper). Have You Followed Your Interests? A Longitudinal Examination of Changes in Interest Fit in Educational and Work Contexts. \nHoff, K. A., Song, Q. C., Einarsdo\u0301ttir, S., Briley, D. A., Rounds, J. (in press). Developmental structure of personality and interests: A 4-wave, 8-year longitudinal study. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. DOI: 10.1037/pspp0000228\nHoff, K.A., Einarsdo\u0301ttir, S., Chu, C., Briley, D. A., Rounds, J. (under review). Long-Term Changes in Personality and Interests as Predictors of Career Success: Discovery and Replication in 12-Year Longitudinal Studies. Journal blinded for review.\n\nQ18: What prior knowledge do you have at the time of preregistration about trends in the data set you will be working with? For example, are you aware of summary statistics or the statistical distribution of variables, or do you know about correlations between variables? Your prior knowledge could stem from working with the data first-hand, from reading previously published research, or from codebooks. Also provide any relevant knowledge of different subsets of the data (e.g., a different wave than you will be using). Finally, provide information about your prior knowledge for every author separately.\n \nA18: The authors have no previous knowledge about trend in the Life Goals measure in the present samples. Overall we expect to find similar results to Roberts &amp; Robins (2000) and Stoll et al (under review), but the longitudinal items are slightly different which is why we are redoing it. \n\t\nPart 5: Analyses \nTo test the factorial structure of the Life Goals measure, we will perform an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) on the large sample (Sample 2). We will then use the resulting factorial structure to apply a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) on the smaller sample (Sample 1).\nStep 1: Exploratory Factor Analysis\nThe 27 item pool in Sample 2 will be analyzed using a principal factor analysis (henceforth PFA) with oblique rotation. We make no a priori assumptions regarding the relationships among factors. The extraction of factors will be based on the bass-ackwards method developed by Goldberg (2006). The bass-ackwards method is a top-down approach which starts with extracting one factor, and then extracting an increasing number factors (two factors, then three, then four, and so on) until the factor structure is not interpretable anymore.\nThis technique is based on levels of abstraction The first factor to be extracted is the largest one possible, and the next one is therefore smaller than the previous. \u201cEach subsequent principal factor extracted is completely orthogonal to all of those extracted before it. In other words, the first principal factor provides a measure of whatever is most in common to the variables that have been included in the analysis, and each subsequent factor is as large as possible after the influence of all preceding factors has been partialed out\u201d (Goldberg, 2006, p. 2). In line with the bass-ackwards technique, we plan to extract and rotate the factors until the factors can no longer be meaningfully interpreted (Jackson, Wood, Bogg, Walton, Harms, &amp; Roberts, 2010). \nFactor Extraction: We will employ PFA with oblique rotation using full information maximum likelihood information. In line with the bass-ackwards technique (Goldberg, 2006), we will run a series of PFA extractions. First, we will run a one-factor PFA. Then, we will run a two-factor PFA and so on, and so forth, until the factors cannot be interpretable anymore. \n\nStep 2: Confirmatory Factor Analysis\nIn Step 2, the factor structure emerged in Step 1 will be tested in a different sample (Sample 1) with a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (henceforth CFA). We will specify the factor structure for the CFA based on the PFA results from Step 1. In the CFA model, each indicator (item) will be allowed to correlate with one factor only. Factors will be allowed to correlate among each other, and errors will be allowed to correlate.\nThe fit of the model will be assessed via the chi-square statistic, which tests the overall fit and the discrepancy between the sample and fitted covariance matrices. A non-significant test indicates good model fit.  \nFor all analyses, we will assess model fit via chi-square and degrees of freedom, CFI values (where values greater than .95 indicate a close fit, values between .90-.95 indicate an acceptable fit, and values between .85-.90 indicate a mediocre fit), and the root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) (where values smaller than .05 indicate a close fit, values between .05-.08 indicate an acceptable fit, and values between .08-.10 indicate a mediocre fit) (Little, 2013).\n\n\n?\nReferences\n\nVan den Akker, O., Weston, S.

After this analysis, we plan to use this measure in a project that will assess changes in personality traits and facets and life goals and their relationships with occupational creativity. This project will use data from two existing datasets. The overarching project has two primary goals: (1) to examine how personality traits (including facet level measures) and goals develop and change during adolescence and young adulthood and (2) to examine whether changes in personality traits and goals (over and above initial levels of personality and goals) predict occupational creativity. We will follow 2 steps in preregistering this project: At step 1 (current document) we register our analysis plan for the exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis for the life goals measure employed in the study. After evaluating the factorial structure of the goals measure, and in light of the factorial analyses results, we will register hypotheses and research questions at step 2.

We will specify the factor structure for the CFA based on the PFA results from Step 1. In the CFA model, each indicator (item) will be allowed to correlate with one factor only. Factors will be allowed to correlate among each other, and errors will be allowed to correlate.\nThe fit of the model will be assessed via the chi-square statistic, which tests the overall fit and the discrepancy between the sample and fitted covariance matrices. A non-significant test indicates good model fit.  \nFor all analyses, we will assess model fit via chi-square and degrees of freedom, CFI values (where values greater than .95 indicate a close fit, values between .90-.95 indicate an acceptable fit, and values between .85-.90 indicate a mediocre fit), and the root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) (where values smaller than .05 indicate a close fit, values between .05-.08 indicate an acceptable fit, and values between .08-.10 indicate a mediocre fit) (Little, 2013).\n\n\n?\nReferences\n\nVan den Akker, O., Weston, S.

Research on folk moral attitudes towards CE has further revealed a disjunction between moral beliefs (i.e. judgments of moral acceptability) and moral actions (i.e. reported willingness to use CE) relating to CE use (Medaglia et al., 2019; Sattler et al., 2013).\n\nOur group recently found that the presence or absence of irrelevant social information -- namely, visible facial differences (e.g., scars, warts) -- modulated perceptions of moral character (Jamrozik et al., 2019).

Miller would split the money with them fairly (warmth / trustworthiness), and how important this was to their decision.\n\nFinally, participants will provide basic demographic information and will describe any prior experiences with cognitive enhancement and physical disability.

We will test the concurrent and predictive validity of the scale by examining its association to the Drinking Motives Questionnaire-Revised (DMQ-R; Cooper, 1994) at baseline and related behavioral outcomes (e.g., alcohol use and problems) at baseline and 6-month follow-up (controlling for baseline alcohol use and problems). \n\nWhile many different factors are associated with alcohol use, one compelling theory is that drinking motives (i.e., reasons individuals give for drinking alcohol) serve as a final mediator by which all other behavioral, psychological, and biological factors converge upon (Cooper, 1994; Cox &amp; Klinger, 1988). Indeed, drinking motives have been shown to be robustly predictive of both alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems. For example, several studies show that increased social (e.g., drinking to enjoy a social event) (Cooper, 1994; Feldman et al., 1999; Kairouz et al., 2002; Kassel, Jackson, &amp; Unrod, 2000; Kuntsche et al., 2005; Weinberger &amp; Bartholomew, 1996; Windle, 1996; Windle &amp; Windle, 1996), enhancement (e.g., drinking to get drunk), and coping motives (e.g., drinking to cheer up when you are in a bad mood) are associated with heavier alcohol consumption (Cooper, Agocha, &amp; Sheldon, 2000; Labouvie &amp; Bates, 2002; Montgomery et al., 1993; Kairouz et al., 2002; Kuntsche et al., 2005).  Drinking motives are also predictive of alcohol-related problems. For instance, drinking to cope is strongly associated with negative alcohol-related consequences, such as neglecting responsibilities, passing out or fainting due to drinking, and experiencing interpersonal difficulties with family and friends (Chelsie et al., 2015; Collins, Thompson et al., 2018; Cooper, Frone, Russell, &amp; Mudar, 1995; DiBello et al., 2018; Kuntsche et al., 2005; Mackinnon et al., 2014; McNally, Palfai, Levine, &amp; Moore, 2003; Simons, Correia, &amp; Carey, 2000; Windle &amp; Windle, 1996; White &amp; Labouvie, 1989). Further, enhancement motives have been shown to predict future alcohol-related problems (Chelsie et al., 2015; Cooper, 1994; Cooper et al., 2000; Cronin, 1997; Labouvie &amp; Bates, 2002; Mackinnon et al., 2014; White, Anderson, Ray &amp; Mun, 2016); for example, Mackinnon and colleagues (2014) found that enhancement motives prospectively predicted alcohol-related problems as measured by the Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index after a six-month follow-up period (RAPI; White and Labouvie, 1989). \n\nA review published by Kuntsche et al. in 2005 on the measurement of drinking motives, found that among 54 studies that used a multidimensional approach to examine drinking motives, there was a significant amount of heterogeneity in the instruments used. Across these 54 studies, 25 unique instruments were used, with between 10 and 40 items per scale. Kuntsche et al. (2005) also found that specific scale items used to indicate different drinking motive factors (i.e., coping, enhancement, conformity, and social) varied across studies, and this variation was directly related to conclusions that were drawn; for example, if the enhancement factor in one scale contained items such as \u201cenjoying a party\u201d, then enhancement motives were closely associated with moderate drinking, whereas if the enhancement factor contained items such as \u201cdrinking to get drunk\u201d, then this motive was more closely associated with heavier drinking. This array of drinking motive questionnaires, and related issues regarding the classification of scale items within each questionnaire, makes generalizing results difficult. \n\nThe data from this study will be useful in generating a more comprehensive and coherent measure of drinking motives. We hypothesize that a new factor structure may emerge that follows a similar structure to the initial motives theory put forth by Cox and Klinger (1988), but represents a more holistic representation of the latent variables that define drinking motives in young adults. Additionally, while the Drinking Motives Questionnaire \u2013 Revised (DMQ-R; Cooper, 1994) is the most highly cited tool currently used to assess drinking motives, it exists alongside many other assessment tools, as explained. As such, we will directly compare our newly developed drinking motives scale to the DMQ-R in predicting alcohol-related consequences and other alcohol-related behaviors. These analyses will test whether our new scale and corresponding factor structure may serve as an improvement over the current \u201cgold standard\u201d drinking motives scale in the literature.\n\nAt baseline, coping motives are predicted to be directly associated with alcohol-related consequences, and both social and enhancement motives may be linked to consequences indirectly through drinking behavior (Halim, Hasking, and Allen, 2012; Lee et al., 2007; Merrill, Wardell, &amp; Read, 2014; Patrick, Lee, &amp; Larimer, 2011). We also predict that this study will replicate previous findings when participants are followed over a 6-month period, where enhancement motives are expected to be the strongest predictor of changes in alcohol use, coping motives are expected to be most predictive of changes in alcohol-related consequences, and social motives may be prospectively linked to changes in both alcohol use and related outcomes through direct and indirect pathways, respectively (Corbin, Iwamoto, and Fromme, 2010; Crutzen, Kuntsche, &amp; Shelleman-Offermans, 2013; Foster and Neighbors, 2013; Merrill, Wardell, &amp; Read, 2014). Further, it is expected that conformity motives will be minimally predictive in measuring drinking behavior over time (Merrill and Read, 2010; Patrick et al., 2011).

This method is a top-down approach to exploratory factor analysis that first extracts one principle factor from a data set, and then two are extracted and rotated, then three, and so on until there is a factor that no variable has its highest factor (Goldberg, 2006). Horn\u2019s Parallel Analysis will first be run to determine the maximum number of factors that should be considered. Factors will be extracted via principle axis factoring with a direct oblimin rotation, since all motives to consume alcohol are assumed to be correlated with each other. \n\nMultiple linear regression analyses will be used with both the newly developed drinking motives scale and the Drinking Motives Questionnaire-Revised (DMQ-R; Cooper, 1994) as the continuous predictor variables and pertinent alcohol-related outcomes (i.e., AUDIT scores, YAACQ-B scores, quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption) will serve as the continuous outcome variables. Covariates at baseline will include gender, age, ethnicity, and education level. Baseline drinking behavior and problems will be included as covariates in the 6-month follow-up analyses in order to test whether drinking motives at baseline predict changes in drinking behavior and problems over follow-up.", "outliers": "", "dependent": "The key dependent variables will be alcohol problems and alcohol-related behaviors. These will be measured through several different questionnaires.\n\nAlcohol problems will be measured through the administration of the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT; Saunders, Aasland, Babor, De la Fuente, &amp; Grant, 1993), and the Brief Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire (B-YAACQ; Kahler, Strong, &amp; Read, 2005). The AUDIT is designed to assess problematic alcohol use and related behavior. The B-YAACQ assesses negative consequences associated with alcohol use. \n\nAlcohol-related behaviors will be assessed with the Drinking Refusal Self-Efficacy Questionnaire \u2013 Revised (DRSEQ-R; Oei, Hasking, &amp; Young, 2005). The DRSEQ-R assesses a person\u2019s belief in their ability to resist alcohol in social pressure situations, emotional relief situations, and opportunistic situations. Past year and past month alcohol use quantity and frequency, as well as frequency of binge drinking were measured using the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism\u2019s (NIAAA) alcohol consumption question set (NIAAA, 2003). Age of first drink, age of first intoxication, past year maximum drink quantity during one occasion, and frequency of drinking that maximum amount were also assessed (NIAAA, 2003). Solitary drinking was also measured by asking participants to indicate the percentage of time (on a 0 \u2013 100% scale) their drinking occurred while alone (i.e., \u201cwithout anyone else around\u201d) versus with others since they began drinking (Creswell et al., 2014; Creswell et al., 2015, Skrzynski et al., 2018).", "conditions": "This is a correlational study, so participants will not be assigned to conditions. Participants\u2019 motivations to consume alcohol will be assessed via the administration of an experimenter-created psychometric scale consisting of 205 unique items. 197 Items for this scale were drawn from previously used scales cited by Kuntsche et al. in 2005. Eight additional items were adapted from the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (Leary, 1983; Rodebaugh et. al., 2004). Participants were presented with the following instructions before completing the questionnaire: \u201cListed below are reasons people might be inclined to drink alcoholic beverages.  Using the five-point scale below, decide how frequently your own drinking is motivated by each of the reasons listed.\u201d The wording of all items was modified from their original version to fit the root \u201cYou drink\u2026\u201d.  Relative frequency of drinking in response to each item was rated on a 5-Point Likert Scale (1 = Almost Never/Never, 2 = Some of the time, 3 = Half of the time, 4 = Most of the time, 5 = Almost Always/Always). To ensure that response biases and participant fatigue did not factor into responses, items were randomized in their presentation.", "hypothesis": "The purpose of this study is to develop a new psychometric scale to assess young adult drinking motives. We will test the concurrent and predictive validity of the scale by examining its association to the Drinking Motives Questionnaire-Revised (DMQ-R; Cooper, 1994) at baseline and related behavioral outcomes (e.g., alcohol use and problems) at baseline and 6-month follow-up (controlling for baseline alcohol use and problems). \n\nWhile many different factors are associated with alcohol use, one compelling theory is that drinking motives (i.e., reasons individuals give for drinking alcohol) serve as a final mediator by which all other behavioral, psychological, and biological factors converge upon (Cooper, 1994; Cox &amp; Klinger, 1988). Indeed, drinking motives have been shown to be robustly predictive of both alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems. For example, several studies show that increased social (e.g., drinking to enjoy a social event) (Cooper, 1994; Feldman et al., 1999; Kairouz et al., 2002; Kassel, Jackson, &amp; Unrod, 2000; Kuntsche et al., 2005; Weinberger &amp; Bartholomew, 1996; Windle, 1996; Windle &amp; Windle, 1996), enhancement (e.g., drinking to get drunk), and coping motives (e.g., drinking to cheer up when you are in a bad mood) are associated with heavier alcohol consumption (Cooper, Agocha, &amp; Sheldon, 2000; Labouvie &amp; Bates, 2002; Montgomery et al., 1993; Kairouz et al., 2002; Kuntsche et al., 2005).  Drinking motives are also predictive of alcohol-related problems. For instance, drinking to cope is strongly associated with negative alcohol-related consequences, such as neglecting responsibilities, passing out or fainting due to drinking, and experiencing interpersonal difficulties with family and friends (Chelsie et al., 2015; Collins, Thompson et al., 2018; Cooper, Frone, Russell, &amp; Mudar, 1995; DiBello et al., 2018; Kuntsche et al., 2005; Mackinnon et al., 2014; McNally, Palfai, Levine, &amp; Moore, 2003; Simons, Correia, &amp; Carey, 2000; Windle &amp; Windle, 1996; White &amp; Labouvie, 1989). Further, enhancement motives have been shown to predict future alcohol-related problems (Chelsie et al., 2015; Cooper, 1994; Cooper et al., 2000; Cronin, 1997; Labouvie &amp; Bates, 2002; Mackinnon et al., 2014; White, Anderson, Ray &amp; Mun, 2016); for example, Mackinnon and colleagues (2014) found that enhancement motives prospectively predicted alcohol-related problems as measured by the Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index after a six-month follow-up period (RAPI; White and Labouvie, 1989). \n\nA review published by Kuntsche et al. in 2005 on the measurement of drinking motives, found that among 54 studies that used a multidimensional approach to examine drinking motives, there was a significant amount of heterogeneity in the instruments used. Across these 54 studies, 25 unique instruments were used, with between 10 and 40 items per scale. Kuntsche et al. (2005) also found that specific scale items used to indicate different drinking motive factors (i.e., coping, enhancement, conformity, and social) varied across studies, and this variation was directly related to conclusions that were drawn; for example, if the enhancement factor in one scale contained items such as \u201cenjoying a party\u201d, then enhancement motives were closely associated with moderate drinking, whereas if the enhancement factor contained items such as \u201cdrinking to get drunk\u201d, then this motive was more closely associated with heavier drinking. This array of drinking motive questionnaires, and related issues regarding the classification of scale items within each questionnaire, makes generalizing results difficult. \n\nThe data from this study will be useful in generating a more comprehensive and coherent measure of drinking motives. We hypothesize that a new factor structure may emerge that follows a similar structure to the initial motives theory put forth by Cox and Klinger (1988), but represents a more holistic representation of the latent variables that define drinking motives in young adults. Additionally, while the Drinking Motives Questionnaire \u2013 Revised (DMQ-R; Cooper, 1994) is the most highly cited tool currently used to assess drinking motives, it exists alongside many other assessment tools, as explained. As such, we will directly compare our newly developed drinking motives scale to the DMQ-R in predicting alcohol-related consequences and other alcohol-related behaviors. These analyses will test whether our new scale and corresponding factor structure may serve as an improvement over the current \u201cgold standard\u201d drinking motives scale in the literature.\n\nAt baseline, coping motives are predicted to be directly associated with alcohol-related consequences, and both social and enhancement motives may be linked to consequences indirectly through drinking behavior (Halim, Hasking, and Allen, 2012; Lee et al., 2007; Merrill, Wardell, &amp; Read, 2014; Patrick, Lee, &amp; Larimer, 2011).
