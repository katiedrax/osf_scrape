Fuschia Sirois, Claudia C. von Bastian, Peter Totterdell"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Procrastination is a form of self-regulation failure that reflects the prioritization of short-mood regulation over long-term goal achievement. Recent theory and research argues that an inability to regulate negative emotions in a healthy and nonself-defeating way plays a key role in understanding why people procrastinate (Sirois &amp; Pychyl, 2013; Tice &amp; Bratslavsky, 2000). Appraisal theories of emotion point out that one\u2019s specific emotional reaction results from their subjective appraisal of an event (i.e. its meaning and significance of an event) rather than the event itself (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984; Scherer, 1988). An emotion regulation strategy known as cognitive reappraisal, a primary form of cognitive change, entails using cognitive and linguistic processes to reinterpret the meaning of a situation (Jazaieri et al., 2014), which is effective for downregulating negative emotions (Gross &amp; John, 2003). Yet to date, there is little (if any) research directly testing whether cognitive reappraisal, interprets and assigns meaning to an event or potential stressor in particular, influences procrastination. In the present research we aim to address this gap by investigating how reappraising aversive tasks in light of personal meaning influences task-related emotions and subsequent behavioural procrastination.\n\nGiven that meaningfulness is strongly associated with positive emotions (Miao &amp; Gan, 2018), in order to investigate the role of personal meaning on procrastinating behaviour but rule out the possibility that any effects from the meaning making manipulation are not simply due to increases in positive affect, comparing effect sizes of these two factors (i.e. personal meaning and positive emotions) on behavioural procrastination are needed.  \n\nIn addition, one common belief about the nature of procrastination is that it is linked to setting excessively high standards. Researchers have asserted that procrastination is closely correlated to perfectionism (e.g. Flett, Blankstein, Hewitt, &amp; Koledin, 1992; St\u00f6ber &amp; Joormann, 2001). More specifically, from a multi-dimensional perspective, a recent meta-analysis revealed that trait procrastination is positively associated with perfectionistic concerns, and negatively associated with perfectionistic strivings (Sirois, Molnar, &amp; Hirsch, 2017). The question of whether perfectionism influences personal meaning or positive affect associated with goals and subsequent procrastination has, however, not been investigated. \n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "1) Participants in the personal meaning group will engage in less procrastination than those in the control group; \n2) Participants in the positive feelings group will procrastinate less than those in the control group but will procrastinate more than those in the personal meaning group.\n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

After providing consent, participants will be asked to click the \u201cI agree\u201d button if they consent to participate.  \n\nAfter linking to the online study via Qualtrics, all participants will be asked to complete a demographics questionnaire (age, gender, educational level and ethnicity) and the same set of baseline questionnaires (pretest). The baseline measures include \nThe 9-item General Procrastination Scale (GPS-9; Sirois, Yang, &amp; Van Eerde, 2019); the 5-item Personal Meaning Questionnaire (MILQ; Steger, Frazier, Oishi, &amp; Kaler, 2006); the 10-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Mackinnon , Jorm, Christensen, Korten, Jacomb, &amp; Rodgers, 1999); the 15-item Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS, Hewitt, Habke, Lee-Baggley, Sherry, &amp; Flett, 2008).\n\nAfterward, they will be instructed to list their most important current goal that they are struggling with. Specifically, in order to maximise the chance that they will procrastinate on a goal, we emphasised in the instructions that \u201cit is better to list a goal that you are averse to and struggling with but need to complete.\u201d \n\nIn order to manipulate personal meaning, we will follow the procedures used in a study of expressive writing (King &amp; Miner, 2000; Rubin, Boals, &amp; Klein, 2010).\nAll participants will be randomized to either a personal meaning group, positive feeling group, or control group, and will complete condition-specific sets of statements.\n\nParticipants in the personal meaning group will be asked to think about the meaningful aspects of their intended goal, for example \u201cCompleting this goal will be valuable to how I see myself, because ______________________________.\u201d\nParticipants in the positive affect group will be asked to write about something that made them happy, for example \u201cCompleting this goal will make me feel happy, because________________________.\u201d\nParticipants in the control group will be asked to think about what they did yesterday, for example \u201cI woke up to an alarm clock at________________________.\u201d\nLastly, all participants will be presented with the meaning in life questionnaire (MILQ), the 10-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) again. \nThe follow-up survey\n\nParticipants will be contacted approximately 36-48 hours following their completion of the original survey via e-mail and invited to complete the follow-up survey. \nTheir tasks will be to write down their chosen goal that they listed in the first part of the study, to complete a measure that assesses whether they procrastinated on their goal during the day following their participation, as well as to rate their emotional state (PANAS) and levels of personal meaning (MILQ). To measure procrastinating behaviour, participants will be asked to complete a grid that divides their past day (from 9am to 11pm) in 20-minute time intervals. A total of 42 intervals will be presented to participants at the same time. They will be asked to report what they were doing during each interval and indicate whether they were delaying or avoiding doing something they had intended to do once they recorded their activity at each interval. Any interval was indicated as \u201cdelay\u201d will be counted as procrastination intervals and summed into reflecting the number of minutes spent procrastinating. This method of measuring behavioural procrastination was used in a previous study (Sirois &amp; Gigu\u00e8re, 2018).

Recent theory and research argues that an inability to regulate negative emotions in a healthy and nonself-defeating way plays a key role in understanding why people procrastinate (Sirois &amp; Pychyl, 2013; Tice &amp; Bratslavsky, 2000). Appraisal theories of emotion point out that one\u2019s specific emotional reaction results from their subjective appraisal of an event (i.e. its meaning and significance of an event) rather than the event itself (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984; Scherer, 1988). An emotion regulation strategy known as cognitive reappraisal, a primary form of cognitive change, entails using cognitive and linguistic processes to reinterpret the meaning of a situation (Jazaieri et al., 2014), which is effective for downregulating negative emotions (Gross &amp; John, 2003). Yet to date, there is little (if any) research directly testing whether cognitive reappraisal, interprets and assigns meaning to an event or potential stressor in particular, influences procrastination. In the present research we aim to address this gap by investigating how reappraising aversive tasks in light of personal meaning influences task-related emotions and subsequent behavioural procrastination.\n\nGiven that meaningfulness is strongly associated with positive emotions (Miao &amp; Gan, 2018), in order to investigate the role of personal meaning on procrastinating behaviour but rule out the possibility that any effects from the meaning making manipulation are not simply due to increases in positive affect, comparing effect sizes of these two factors (i.e. personal meaning and positive emotions) on behavioural procrastination are needed.  \n\nIn addition, one common belief about the nature of procrastination is that it is linked to setting excessively high standards. Researchers have asserted that procrastination is closely correlated to perfectionism (e.g. Flett, Blankstein, Hewitt, &amp; Koledin, 1992; St\u00f6ber &amp; Joormann, 2001). More specifically, from a multi-dimensional perspective, a recent meta-analysis revealed that trait procrastination is positively associated with perfectionistic concerns, and negatively associated with perfectionistic strivings (Sirois, Molnar, &amp; Hirsch, 2017). The question of whether perfectionism influences personal meaning or positive affect associated with goals and subsequent procrastination has, however, not been investigated. \n", "q4": "1) Participants in the personal meaning group will engage in less procrastination than those in the control group; \n2) Participants in the positive feelings group will procrastinate less than those in the control group but will procrastinate more than those in the personal meaning group.\n", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

In the first mixed ANOVA, the mean personal meaning score will serve as the dependent variable and condition (i.e. personal meaning / positive affects / control) will serve as the between-subjects independent variable, and time (pretest / posttest) will serve as within-subject factor. Likewise, the mean positive affect score will serve as the dependent variable in the second mixed ANOVA, condition will be the between-subjects, and time (pretest / posttest) will serve as within-subject independent variable.\n\n\n5) Hypothesis tests\nA one-way ANOVA will be conducted for the main hypothesis test. The summed procrastination score will serve as the dependent variable, and condition (i.e. personal meaning/positive affects/control) will serve as the between-subjects independent variable. We anticipate both experimental conditions to lead to decreased procrastinating behaviour scores relative to the control condition, with the decrease being more pronounced in the personal meaning relative to the positive feelings group. \n\nIf there is a significant effect of group, two tailed t-tests will be conducted to see how the groups differ. \n\n\n6) Exploratory tests\nTo examine how the effectiveness of the intervention is affected by other factors, we will run an ANCOVA for each of the two experimental intervention groups (i.e. personal meaning and positive affect). For each ANCOVA, the dependent variable will be procrastinating behaviour score, and the within-subjects factor will be time (pretest/posttest).\n\nTo assess whether intervention benefits are affected by the extent to which participants changed on the targeted dimensions (i.e. personal meaning and positive affect), we will include personal meaning (MILQ) and positive affect (PA) score, respectively, as covariates. \n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ewfuz/children/?format=json",

beings to maintain a stable interpersonal relationship(Baumeister and Leary, 1995), and the breakdown of such relationships is often considered the inducement of depression, especially for female patients (Hammen, 2018).\n Evidence indicates that the relationship between interpersonal stress and depression can be bidirectional; not only interpersonal stress can lead to depression, patients with depression and high-risk individuals are also more likely to trigger or engage in stressful interpersonal situations (i.e., stress generation) (Hames et al., 2013; Hammen, 2018). Depressed patients usually show an overly active feeling of self-deprecation in social interactions (Beck and Alford, 2009; Hames et al., 2013), which could contribute to the breakdown of social relationships. Neutral remarks are often perceived as criticism from others by depressed individuals; for example, if a colleague says \u201cBe careful, don\u2019t drop your cup\u201d, a depressed patient might interpret it as \u201cYou are too stupid to hold a cup\u201d (Beck and Alford, 2009). Moreover, depressed individuals tend to excessively seek assurances from others that they are lovable and worthy (Hames et al., 2013). They may keep seeking assurances from their significant others relentlessly even when such assurance has already been provided because they tend to question the sincerity of the assurance, which could make their partners feel annoyed and could ultimately lead to rejection (Hames et al., 2013). Hence, depressed patients and/or individuals at high risk of depression may be more likely to experience the dissolution of interpersonal relationships. \n   One possible cause of self-deprecation and excessive reassurance-seeking in interpersonal relationships may be the biased processing of ambiguous social cues in depressed patients and/or individuals at high risk of depression (Beevers et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2016). A tendency to perceive negative emotions in others may impact a depressed persons\u2019 ability to effectively interact with social partners (Beevers et al.,2009). For example, depressed individuals display negatively biased identifications of ambiguous facial expressions (especially those mixed with sadness and happiness) (Beevers et al.,2009). A social partner, therefore, would have to be significantly more animated when expressing positive feelings to a depressed person, which could be tiring for the social partner and could lead to the erosion of the relationship (Beevers et al.,2009). In another study, Smith found that depression severity was associated with an increased tendency to perceive hostility in ambiguous interpersonal situations, consistent with the self-deprecation tendency as noted by Beck and Alford (2009). In a word, biased processing of ambiguous social cues may help explain why depression causes interpersonal stress. \nSurprisingly, although several studies have found that a positive association between depression and negative biases in the processing of social cues, there is little empirical data on the relationship between these biases and interpersonal relationships. If these negative biases do contribute to (interpersonal) stress generation, then individuals with stronger negative biases are likely to have poorer social relationships.\n  The present study, therefore, aims to explore whether there is a relationship between the biased processing of ambiguous social cues and social relationships.  Specifically, we are interested in whether a hostile interpretation bias and a perception bias towards ambiguous smiles are associated with social outcomes (including social support, loneliness, social network size, and social network diversity).

The AIHQ is comprised of 15 negative situations that differ in terms of intentionality, 5 ambiguous, 5 intentional, and 5 accidental. Hostile interpretation bias will be indexed using the hostile attribution score on ambiguous situations (Combs et al., 2007).\nPerception bias towards ambiguous smiles will be measured using a behavioral task developed for the current study. A similar but different task has been used in a previously registered pilot study (https://osf.io/c6e54/). Participants will be instructed to judge ninety images of smiling faces as friendly/happiness or contemptuous/hostile. Thirty of these faces are unambiguously positive, and thirty are unambiguously contemptuous. These faces are selected from the Taiwanese Facial Expression Image Database (Li-Fen Chen and Yu-Shiuan Yen, 2007). Positive smiling faces and contemptuous faces are paired with each other to generate ambiguous smiling faces (i.e., 50% friendly/happiness - 50% contemptuous/hostile). We will use the proportion of negative identification of smiles as the index of the negative perception bias:\nnegative identification % = number of negative identification trials/(number of total ambiguous trials \u2013 number of missed ambiguous trials) * 100%\n\nOur primary outcomes (variables for confirmatory analysis) are social outcomes including:\nSocial Support Rating Scale (SSRS; Xiao, 1994).

In this study, we will use the Chinese version of ULS-8 to assess perceived loneliness.\nChinese Version of Social Network Index (SNI; Cohens et al., 1997).

There are 9 items for respondents to rate based on their feelings during the past 2 weeks and the rating scale range from 0 to 3. Examiners measure depressive severity on a scale of 0-27 and scores more than 10 indicate clinically significant depression. \n\nPositive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) (Watson et al., 1988) is a mood rating scale consists of two subscales named Positive Affect (PA) and Negative Affect (NA) including 10 items each. These two factors represent affective state dimensions: Low PA is uniquely associated with depression, while high NA is correlated with a variety of aversive mood states (Crawford and Henry, 2004).

The AIHQ is comprised of 15 negative situations that differ in terms of intentionality, 5 ambiguous, 5 intentional, and 5 accidental. Hostile interpretation bias will be indexed using the hostile attribution score on ambiguous situations (Combs et al., 2007).\nPerception bias towards ambiguous smiles will be measured using a behavioral task developed for the current study. A similar but different task has been used in a previously registered pilot study (https://osf.io/c6e54/). Participants will be instructed to judge ninety images of smiling faces as friendly/happiness or contemptuous/hostile. Thirty of these faces are unambiguously positive, and thirty are unambiguously contemptuous. These faces are selected from the Taiwanese Facial Expression Image Database (Li-Fen Chen and Yu-Shiuan Yen, 2007). Positive smiling faces and contemptuous faces are paired with each other to generate ambiguous smiling faces (i.e., 50% friendly/happiness - 50% contemptuous/hostile). We will use the proportion of negative identification of smiles as the index of the negative perception bias:\nnegative identification % = number of negative identification trials/(number of total ambiguous trials \u2013 number of missed ambiguous trials) * 100%\n\nOur primary outcomes (variables for confirmatory analysis) are social outcomes including:\nSocial Support Rating Scale (SSRS; Xiao, 1994). SSRS is the most commonly used measurement of social support in the Chinese population. It is a ten-item scale, and factor analysis reveal a tri-factor structure: subjective support, objective support, and utilization of support.\nChinese Version of the 8-item UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS-8; Wu &amp; Yao, 2008). In this study, we will use the Chinese version of ULS-8 to assess perceived loneliness.\nChinese Version of Social Network Index (SNI; Cohens et al., 1997). For the current study, we translated the SNI into Chinese to measure social network size and diversity.\n\nOur secondary outcomes (variables for exploratory analysis) are measures of mood states:\n\nPatient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) (Kroenke et al., 2010) is a self-administered tool to screen depressive disorders. There are 9 items for respondents to rate based on their feelings during the past 2 weeks and the rating scale range from 0 to 3. Examiners measure depressive severity on a scale of 0-27 and scores more than 10 indicate clinically significant depression. \n\nPositive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) (Watson et al., 1988) is a mood rating scale consists of two subscales named Positive Affect (PA) and Negative Affect (NA) including 10 items each. These two factors represent affective state dimensions: Low PA is uniquely associated with depression, while high NA is correlated with a variety of aversive mood states (Crawford and Henry, 2004). In the present study, participants will be asked to indicate to what extent they felt according to mood states right now and rating from 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely).
