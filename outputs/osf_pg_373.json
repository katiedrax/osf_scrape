theories have argued that the news media is an important conduit for conveying messages to the public (Chomsky, 1997; Markham and Maslog, 1971). It shapes attitudes, influences the national discourse, and generates stereotypes (Brummett, 2014). Prior studies have found that the news media tends to portray minorities as troublesome constituents (Abrajano and Singh, 2009; Baum, 2003; Branton and Dunaway, 2008; Entman, 1990; Gilliam Jr and Iyengar, 2000; Gilliam Jr et al., 1996; Iyengar, Peters and Kinder, 1982; Kellstedt, 2003, 2005; Prior, 2005; Wortley, Hagan and Macmillan, 1997). Past research also suggests that the ways in which outgroups are represented in media impacts the public\u2019s perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors towards members of those outgroups (Harwood et al., 2012; Haynes, Merolla and Ramakrishnan, 2016; Mastro, 2009; Merolla, Ramakrishnan and Haynes, 2013; Saleem, Yang and Ramasubramanian, 2016), and shapes support for policies that harm members of the depicted outgroup (Mastro and Kopacz, 2006; Ramasubramanian, 2011). Given that Arabs, Middle Easterners, and foreign Muslims are frequently linked with tropes of violence, terrorism, and aggression across American media outlets (Alsultany, 2012; Nacos, 2016; Nacos and Torres-Reyna, 2002, 2007), one should expect these findings to extend to American Muslims. Media portrayals of Middle Easterners, for instance, have long been related to narratives of terrorism, violence, threat, and fear (see Behm-Morawitz and Ortiz (2013); Esposito (1999); Gadarian (2010); GhaneaBassiri (2013); Said (1979); Selod (2015a); Shaheen (2003); Steet (2000); Wilkins (1995)). My own scholarship has yielded three important takeaways demonstrating that news media coverage of Muslim Americans is largely negative. First, the news media communicated Muslim Americans more negatively than other racialized American groups across CNN, FOX, and MSNBC news broadcast platforms, in both the pre- and post-9/11 periods. Second, the ideology of the publication platform matters for how negatively a given network discusses marginalized groups. While FOX consistently discussed all groups negatively, MSNBC appears to have discussed Blacks, Latinos, and Asian Americans more positively in the pre-and post-9/11 periods. Finally, no network treated Muslim Americans similarly to other racialized groups. Rather, each network in each time period (pre- and post-9/11) discussed Muslim Americans more negatively than the other examined groups. As a result, Muslim Americans appear to not be able to reach American viewers in a positive light, even when compared to other racialized groups, who we know through prior scholarship are communicated negatively to begin with. What remains unknown is whether media coverage about Muslims (foreign group) and Muslim Americans (domestic group) shape attitudes towards the domestic group and affect attitudes towards policies affecting them. In this study, I refine and build on several previous experiments that I employed for my dissertation (2017), and explore whether exposure to negative versus positive media coverage about Muslims and Muslim Americans matters for public attitudes. Previously my studies have employed a within-subject design when assessing how exposure to media coverage affects attitudes towards the group and a between-subject design when assessing how exposure to media coverage affects attitudes towards policies affecting the foreign and domestic groups. Currently, I am refining the study and re-conducting these experiments. Specifically, I am removing the within-subject design when assessing attitudes towards the group to ensure that questions priming attitudes towards Muslims are removed. Moreover, I include several additional treatments beyond positive and negative transcripts about Muslims (foreign) and Muslim Americans (domestic). Specifically, I have positive and negative frames about immigrants and Latinos in order to ensure that it is not just exposure to any positive or negative information about marginalized groups that causes shifts in attitudes towards Muslims foreign and domestic. Rather, these conditions aim to demonstrate shifts in attitudes about Muslims are specific to broadcasts about Muslims themselves. In this study, I also employ a control group. The current study begins first with a consent form. Respondents are then randomized into 1 of 10 conditions (Muslim American positive, Muslim American (alternative \u2013 treatment not about terrorism), Muslim positive, Muslim negative, Immigrant positive, Immigrant negative, Latino positive, Latino negative, and Control). They are then asked the policy DVs and the attitudinal questions through the Muslim American Resentment scale (Lajevardi 2017, Lajevardi and Abrajano 2019). After answering these questions, they are asked a series of demographic and partisanship questions."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: Attitudes towards Muslim Americans will be more negative among those respondents who were exposed to negative information about Muslims and Muslim Americans compared to those respondents who were exposed to positive information about Muslims and Muslim Americans.

If citizens\u2019 ideological self-placement determines the political choices they make, whether they decide to vote or abstain in an election or even the issues that are relevant for them in taking these decisions, would not be expected left-right orientations to be associated to the attitudes towards the political regime? In addition, ideology is the basic template to understand events and make political assessments, so it should have an impact on the information we weight more to assess the political regime. We should expect citizens on different sides of the ideological scale to evaluate their satisfaction with the political system under different terms. In this paper we explore this moderating effect of ideology by looking to satisfaction with democracy, as this is one of the main attitudinal variables that we should pay attention to in democratic systems. Just recently, Besir Ceka and Pedro C. Magalh\u00e3es (2016) briefly explored the way left-right orientations are related to different conceptualizations of democracy. They found that those on the left side of the ideological continuum are more prone than rightists to emphasize social justice and redistribution as key elements for democracy. Even more, right wingers are significantly less demanding in their concept of democracy. Taking this empirical evidence into account, leftists and rightists would have different expectations about what a democracy is and what outcomes it should deliver. Thus, their satisfaction with democracy would be shaped by different factors. If these expectations are confirmed, it can be said that those on the left are more worried about the quality of their democracy in terms of how it represents different views and provides equality for all citizens. The right, as it is less demanding with the inputs of the system and tends to be always more satisfied with democracy than the exigent left, would be more satisfied when the perceived outcomes produced by the democratic system are positive.

If citizens\u2019 ideological self-placement determines the political choices they make, whether they decide to vote or abstain in an election or even the issues that are relevant for them in taking these decisions, would not be expected left-right orientations to be associated to the attitudes towards the political regime? In addition, ideology is the basic template to understand events and make political assessments, so it should have an impact on the information we weight more to assess the political regime. We should expect citizens on different sides of the ideological scale to evaluate their satisfaction with the political system under different terms. In this paper we explore this moderating effect of ideology by looking to satisfaction with democracy, as this is one of the main attitudinal variables that we should pay attention to in democratic systems. Just recently, Besir Ceka and Pedro C. Magalh\u00e3es (2016) briefly explored the way left-right orientations are related to different conceptualizations of democracy. They found that those on the left side of the ideological continuum are more prone than rightists to emphasize social justice and redistribution as key elements for democracy. Even more, right wingers are significantly less demanding in their concept of democracy. Taking this empirical evidence into account, leftists and rightists would have different expectations about what a democracy is and what outcomes it should deliver. Thus, their satisfaction with democracy would be shaped by different factors. If these expectations are confirmed, it can be said that those on the left are more worried about the quality of their democracy in terms of how it represents different views and provides equality for all citizens. The right, as it is less demanding with the inputs of the system and tends to be always more satisfied with democracy than the exigent left, would be more satisfied when the perceived outcomes produced by the democratic system are positive. Thus, while leftists would worry about how the democracy should be and work, rightists would focus on whether the products resulting of it. As the more evident outputs would be economic ones, rightists that perceive the economy to be good would more satisfied with democracy than rightists living in a country going through economic hardship.", "q16": "Negative information on the political inputs of democracy in a country would have a more negative impact on the satisfaction with democracy for those on the left more than those on the right.

"In recent decades the automation of work has disproportionately benefitted highly educated workers and capital owners while moderately educated workers have seen their wages and job security decline (Autor and Salomons, 2018; Van Reenen, 2011).

In response to predictions that between 9% and 35% of UK workers will be displaced by automation in the coming ten to twenty years (Arntz et al., 2016; Frey et al., 2016), commentators have proposed a range of innovative policies to mitigate further growth in inequality. Proposals include novel forms of taxation (Geoffard, 2016), provision of a universal basic income (Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2014; Reed and Lansley, 2016; Srnicek and Williams, 2015), or public provision of services, from transport to housing (Portes, 2017). However, it is not clear whether such policies could win popular support as the effects automation are increasingly felt by voters, paticularly given rightward-shift in policy preferences witnessed in recent years (e.g. Anelli et al., 2019; Dal Bo et al., 2019; Frey et al., 2018). Using an online survey experiment (n = 2,500) I therefore investigate how informing UK adults about their potential vulnerability to a labour market shock resulting from automation influences their preferences for a range of policies.
