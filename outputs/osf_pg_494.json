In other words, the factors produced at every level of the \u201cbass-ackwards\u201d hierarchy should be composed of both agreeableness and dark personality items in order for us to infer that the items are assessing the same latent factors.\n\nInference Criteria for Hypothesis 2: Our primary index of interest in our statistical model of Hypothesis 2 is the latent correlation between the dark personality latent factor and the agreeableness latent factor.

In cases where these criteria may conflict (e.g., a factor can be extracted where items have their strongest loading but is difficult to interpret), we will give more weight to the conceptual criterion, as interpretability of the factors is essential. These inferential criteria are in line with general recommendations for the \u201cbass-ackwards\u201d approach (Goldberg, 2006), and were used in the original Crowe et al. (2018) article.\n\nAfter applying the factor extraction methods, our inference criteria for determining a shared hierarchical structure of agreeableness and dark personality items will be that the \u201cbass-ackwards\u201d factor solution will not produce interpretable factors (i.e., factors that are not overly narrow or a methodological factor) that are composed solely of agreeableness or dark personality items. In other words, the factors produced at every level of the \u201cbass-ackwards\u201d hierarchy should be composed of both agreeableness and dark personality items in order for us to infer that the items are assessing the same latent factors.\n\nInference Criteria for Hypothesis 2: Our primary index of interest in our statistical model of Hypothesis 2 is the latent correlation between the dark personality latent factor and the agreeableness latent factor. In order to conclude that the shared variance among agreeableness scales and dark personality scales is approximately isomorphic, we will take a latent correlation \u2265 |\".90\" | as support for such a conclusion. \n", "q22": "We plan to exclude data that show evidence of invalid/careless responding. In order to exclude such data, we plan to use 4 steps to ensure data quality:\n\n1)\tParticipants who provide invalid answers to our prescreen item described above (\u201cWhat are the steps for drinking water from a water fountain\u201d) will be excluded from completing the survey portion of the study. Though there are no strict criteria for what constitutes an invalid answer, we expect participants to demonstrate an understanding of the question (they respond with information that is relevant to drinking water from a water fountain) and be generally accurate. At minimum, this would involve writing about pushing a button/lever/bar and bending over to drink the water. The first author will review the responses and rate the responses for validity (yes/no). Second and third authors will be consulted if there are responses that are not clearly right or wrong and majority vote will determine whether to invite the participant to complete the full study. Participants with responses rated as invalid will be excluded from participating in the survey portion of the study.\n\n2)\tThree Attention check items will be administered. E.g., Click the circle that says \u201cStrongly Agree.\u201d  \n\nThree Re-captcha items will be administered.

Thus, completion times faster than 10 minutes will result in that data not being included in analyses. \n\n4)\tTwo validity scales (Too Good to be True and Infrequency; 8 items each) from the original EPA (Lynam et al., 2011) will be administered to participants. Example items include \u201cI have never in my life been angry at another person\u201d and \u201cI try to eat something almost every day.\u201d Participants\u2019 data will be considered invalid if their responses for either scale are 2.75 standard deviations above the sample average.\n\nSteps 2 and 3 will be applied to responses before payment, so work will be rejected and no payment given if participant data do not meet these requirements. Step 4 will be applied after the work has been accepted and payment has been sent.  \n", "q23": "A necessary condition for participant data to be included is that MTurk participants complete the entirety of the survey in order to receive a Qualtrics completion code that they will then enter to have their work approved.

These analyses will make use of the Reactive-Proactive Aggression scales (proactive and reactive), and the CAB antisocial behavior variety scale. \n\nThese exploratory analyses will make use of hierarchical multiple regression models. Three models will be examined with RPQ-Reactive aggression, RPQ-Proactive Aggression, and CAB-Antisocial Variety serving as the DVs for the three respective models. Standardized latent factor scores estimated from the agreeableness and dark personality scales will serve as the predictor variables. At step 1, the standardized latent factor scores for agreeableness will be entered. At step 2, the standardized latent factor scores for dark personality will be entered. We will examine the change in R2 at step 2 of the models to see how much incremental validity is accounted for in our antisocial behavior variables when the dark personality traits are added to the model. Latent factor scores will be estimated using the regression method in \u2018lavaan\u2019. \n\nWe will also conduct analyses to better understand the content of the agreeableness factors at each level of the hierarchy identified by the \u201cbass-ackwards\u201d solution. These analyses will be conducted by correlating the agreeableness factors from the \u201cbass-ackwards\u201d solution with the subscales of the D70, the agreeableness subscales from which the agreeableness items were drawn from, the remaining IPIP-NEO-120 facet scales (i.e., facet scales from the N,E,O, and C domains), and the five optimal factors originally identified in Crowe et al.

Specifically, we will examine the zero-order correlations among all agreeableness and dark personality items using a cutoff of a correlation  \u2265 |.65| to identify redundant items. When selecting which item to remove from redundant pairs, the item with more redundancies will be removed. For example, if Item 1 and Item 2 are redundant (r \u2265 |.65|), but Item 1 only has one redundancy while Item 2 is also redundant with Item 3, Item 2 will be removed. Thus, two redundancies will be removed by dropping one item. If items have the same number of redundancies, the item to be dropped will be chosen randomly. The |.65| both maximizes item content and minimizes the risk of bloated specific factors. This process of item removal/retention was used in Crowe et al.

Perimenopause is a normal and important aging phenomenon that occurs in women\u2019s life. Although some women have no obvious symptoms during this period, Most women still suffer from perimenopausal symptoms that affect health, work, life, and economic status. The most common and frequent episode of perimenopausal symptoms is hot flashes, which affect around 75% of menopausal women, In addition, the incidence of menopause insomnia is as high as 39% \u201347%, Other symptoms include anxiety, fatigue, irritability, weight gain, night sweats, vaginal dryness, and urinary incontinence. These perimenopausal symptoms begin 1\u20132 years before menopause and may persist from 6 months to more than ten years. These menopause symptoms may be caused by the perimenopause itself, or it may be a chain reaction caused by one of them. These chain reactions may cause or promote the occurrence of diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, psychological diseases and so on while accelerating aging. Hot flashes can affect women's work and quality of life, Of course, sleep will also be affected.

altered Akt/GSK-3 signaling in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and subsequent functional deficits that are induced by co-use of alcohol and THC during adolescence. In order to accomplish this, we will use a rat model to investigate the effects of co-use of alcohol and THC during adolescence on working memory and on the expression and post-translational modification (PTM) of protein kinase B (Akt) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3\u03b2). \n\n\nTo assess behavioral effects of adolescent use of alcohol and THC alone, as well as the co-use of alcohol and THC, we will assess the impact of drug exposure on performance of a delayed matching to position (DMTP) task that provides a measure of working memory.

Performance on these tasks at several stages of the task will be evaluated. \n\n\nAt the conclusion of behavioral testing, western blot analysis will be performed in order to examine protein expression and PTM differences in adolescent-exposed animals.  "}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Previous work in both preclinical models and humans has demonstrated that exposure to either alcohol or THC alone can lead to many adverse consequences, including deficits in learning, behavioral flexibility, and attention (Gulley and Juraska, 2013, Neuroscience 249: 3-20; Rubino and Parolaro, 2016, Biol Psychiatry 79: 578-585; Staples and Mandyam, 2016, Front Psychiatry 7: 162). In addition, co-use of these drugs is relatively common in adolescents (Johnson et al, 2015, Ann Arbor, MI: Institute for Social Research) and is associated with more detrimental outcomes than use of either drug separately (Subbaraman and Kerr, 2015, Alcohol Clin Exp Res 39: 872-879; Hartman et al, 2016, Drug Test Anal 8: 690-701). We hypothesize that rats previously exposed to both alcohol and THC in adolescence will exhibit reduced accuracy on the longer delays of the DMTP task (when cognitive load is at its greatest) and increase the number of sessions needed to reach criterion, relative to both controls and rats exposed to either alcohol or THC alone. Additionally, much like in our work with amphetamines (Sherill et al, 2013, Behav Brain Res 242: 84-94) we expect that animals exposed to either alcohol or THC will be more susceptible to proactive interference and that animals exposed to a combination of alcohol and THC will exhibit the greatest deficits.  In light of previous reports of more significant effects of adolescent drug exposure in females (Lovelace et al. 2015, Neuropharmacology 99: 242-255); Rubino et al. 2008, Neuropsychopharmacology 33: 2760-2771), we hypothesize that the expected differences described above will be more emphasized in females than in males.  \n\n\nConsistent with what has been shown in the literature (Ozaita et al. 2007, J Neurochem 102:1105-1114), we expect that phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) and phosphorylated GSK-3\u03b2 (pGSK-3\u03b2) protein levels will differ in animals exposed to a combination of alcohol and THC. Specifically, as a consequence of chronic CB1 activation by THC and indirect CB1 activation by alcohol, we hypothesize that Akt and GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylation will be reduced, indicating decreased Akt activity and increased GSK-3\u03b2 activity, respectively. Sex-specific differences in Akt/GSK-3 signaling following adolescent exposure to alcohol and THC remain largely unexplored. However, findings by Rubino and Parolaro (2016, Biol Psychiatry 79: 578-585) show variation in cannabinoid metabolism between sexes and suggest that Akt/GSK-3 dysregulation will be more prominent in female rats.

In order to accomplish this, we will use a rat model to investigate the effects of co-use of alcohol and THC during adolescence on working memory and on the expression and post-translational modification (PTM) of protein kinase B (Akt) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3\u03b2). \n\n\nTo assess behavioral effects of adolescent use of alcohol and THC alone, as well as the co-use of alcohol and THC, we will assess the impact of drug exposure on performance of a delayed matching to position (DMTP) task that provides a measure of working memory. Following testing at short (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8s) and long (0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24s) delays, behavioral flexibility will be tested by requiring rats to reverse their strategy to delayed non-matching to-position (DNMTP) task. Performance on these tasks at several stages of the task will be evaluated. \n\n\nAt the conclusion of behavioral testing, western blot analysis will be performed in order to examine protein expression and PTM differences in adolescent-exposed animals.  ", "q4": "Previous work in both preclinical models and humans has demonstrated that exposure to either alcohol or THC alone can lead to many adverse consequences, including deficits in learning, behavioral flexibility, and attention (Gulley and Juraska, 2013, Neuroscience 249: 3-20; Rubino and Parolaro, 2016, Biol Psychiatry 79: 578-585; Staples and Mandyam, 2016, Front Psychiatry 7: 162). In addition, co-use of these drugs is relatively common in adolescents (Johnson et al, 2015, Ann Arbor, MI: Institute for Social Research) and is associated with more detrimental outcomes than use of either drug separately (Subbaraman and Kerr, 2015, Alcohol Clin Exp Res 39: 872-879; Hartman et al, 2016, Drug Test Anal 8: 690-701). We hypothesize that rats previously exposed to both alcohol and THC in adolescence will exhibit reduced accuracy on the longer delays of the DMTP task (when cognitive load is at its greatest) and increase the number of sessions needed to reach criterion, relative to both controls and rats exposed to either alcohol or THC alone. Additionally, much like in our work with amphetamines (Sherill et al, 2013, Behav Brain Res 242: 84-94) we expect that animals exposed to either alcohol or THC will be more susceptible to proactive interference and that animals exposed to a combination of alcohol and THC will exhibit the greatest deficits.  In light of previous reports of more significant effects of adolescent drug exposure in females (Lovelace et al. 2015, Neuropharmacology 99: 242-255); Rubino et al. 2008, Neuropsychopharmacology 33: 2760-2771), we hypothesize that the expected differences described above will be more emphasized in females than in males.  \n\n\nConsistent with what has been shown in the literature (Ozaita et al. 2007, J Neurochem 102:1105-1114), we expect that phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) and phosphorylated GSK-3\u03b2 (pGSK-3\u03b2) protein levels will differ in animals exposed to a combination of alcohol and THC. Specifically, as a consequence of chronic CB1 activation by THC and indirect CB1 activation by alcohol, we hypothesize that Akt and GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylation will be reduced, indicating decreased Akt activity and increased GSK-3\u03b2 activity, respectively. Sex-specific differences in Akt/GSK-3 signaling following adolescent exposure to alcohol and THC remain largely unexplored. However, findings by Rubino and Parolaro (2016, Biol Psychiatry 79: 578-585) show variation in cannabinoid metabolism between sexes and suggest that Akt/GSK-3 dysregulation will be more prominent in female rats.
