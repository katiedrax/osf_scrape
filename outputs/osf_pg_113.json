The ways that humans generalize provide evidence for the inductive biases which guide language learning, where an inductive bias is any means for choosing one generalization over another (Mitchell 1980). We focus on one particular type of generalization: generalization to longer sequences than have been seen during acquisition. Because language acquisition proceeds over a finite set of utterances, the set of utterances from which learners learn must have some maximum length, yet the languages that humans acquire are generally taken to be unbounded; indeed, this unboundedness is traditionally viewed as one of the key properties of language (Hockett 1963). We investigate such generalization in an experimental setting by training participants on sequences with a certain maximum length and then testing them on sequences of a greater length. We hypothesize that participants will generalize the syntactic patterns that they have learned to sequences of greater length than they have seen before. \n\nWe use an artificial language learning paradigm, in which participants are taught a simple language in a controlled way and are then tested on what they have learned. The language we have chosen for this purpose is the language of center-embedded pairs of words, such as \u201cA1 A2 A3 B3 B2 B1,\u201d where there are two categories of words (category A and category B) and where each word has a symmetrically opposite word that it depends on (e.g., A2 and B2 depend on each other). This type of language has been the focus of extensive past work in artificial language learning. In past work, learners are shown examples of such sequences and are then tested on whether they have learned certain properties of these sequences, particularly the property that no element of category B can precede an element of category A (Fitch and Hauser 2004); the property that there must be the same number of A\u2019s as B\u2019s (Hochmann, Azadpour, and Mehler 2008); and the property that symmetric pairs of words depend on each other (Perruchet and Rey 2005). However, few works have tested whether people generalize this pattern to greater lengths than were seen during training: Gentner et al. (2006) investigated this question in songbirds, but not in humans; one experiment in Poletiek (2002) investigated this question but did not get clear evidence of learning even in the lengths participants had seen; another experiment of Poletiek (2002), and the experiments of Cho et al. (2011), also investigated this question with humans but only found generalization to novel lengths when there was not a clean separation between training and testing, such that it is unclear if participants actually were generalizing to longer sequences or learning from the testing trials. \n\nIn order to test whether participants generalize this pattern to greater lengths than they have seen, we must ensure that they learn the pattern for at least the lengths that they have seen, and past work has found that it is challenging to get participants to learn this pattern (de Vries et al. 2008). One manipulation that has been found to reliably help in the learning of this pattern is starting small, in which the training set is arranged in order from small sequences to large ones (Lai and Poletiek 2011, Poletiek et al. 2018). This finding from past work motivates a secondary hypothesis that we will also test: We hypothesize that the reason that starting small is beneficial is that it helps learners learn the relevant features of words present in the language, and that this is the sole reason why starting small is beneficial. By \u201cthe relevant features\u201d, we mean which words belong to category A vs. category B, and which members of category A can depend on which members of category B. These features are more salient in shorter examples than in longer examples, so initial exposure to only short examples can help highlight these features. Under this hypothesis, it is the learning of these features, rather than the staged nature of the input per se, that facilitates learning of the language. One motivation for this hypothesis is that past work has shown that humans readily learn a mirror language (i.e., a language of even-length palindromes) (Jiang et al. 2018); the main difference between this mirror language and the language we investigate is that the language we investigate requires the learning of relevant word features whereas the mirror language does not. We believe that this difference is what makes the language we investigate so much harder to learn than the mirror language, and this is why we predict that the learning of these features is the crucial aspect of learning that has thwarted participants in non-starting-small settings, and that once learners are armed with knowledge of these features they will readily learn the rest of the language (as they do with the mirror language).\n\nTo test this secondary hypothesis, we introduce a new condition that is meant to provide strong cues to word features in a different way than starting small. This is achieved through the arrangement of the buttons that participants use to reproduce the sequences shown to them during training; we will use both an \u201cinformative buttons\u201d setting in which the arrangement of these buttons provides cues to the features present in the language, and an \u201cuninformative buttons\u201d setting in which the buttons do not provide cues to this information. We will also vary whether training starts small or involves randomly-ordered sequences, to give 4 conditions: starting small with informative buttons, starting small with uninformative buttons, random ordering with informative buttons, and random ordering with uninformative buttons.\n\nOur two hypotheses can thus be summarized together as follows: the main difficulty that learners have in learning a center-embedded pattern is learning the features of the words used to instantiate that pattern, such that any method that makes these features salient will facilitate learning of center embedding, with the degree of facilitation determined by how salient the method makes these features (secondary hypothesis); but when learners do learn the center-embedded pattern for sequences with a certain maximum length they will naturally extend it to longer sequences than they have seen before (main hypothesis). We will operationalize successful knowledge of the center-embedded pattern as the ability to discriminate between strings that fit the pattern from those that do not, for strings up to the maximum length that has been presented during training (call this length N). Our test set includes three categories of example; for us to conclude that successful learning of the center-embedded pattern has occurred, performance must be above chance on all three categories. We will further operationalize the prediction that participants will generalize this knowledge to greater lengths as follows: if participants correctly discriminate strings up to length N, then they will also correctly discriminate strings up to length N+2. The particular types of strings that will be used to test identification of strings that do not fit the pattern will be discussed in more detail below.\n\nThe specific predictions that these hypotheses make are that the learners in the \u201crandom ordering with uninformative buttons\u201d condition will not learn the center embedded pattern, but that the learners in the other conditions will (because of the ways that these conditions facilitate the learning of the relevant features) and that learners in these conditions will also extend this pattern to novel lengths. Of our two methods for making the features salient, we predict that the informative buttons will make the relevant features more salient than starting small, and that having both forms of assistance together will not be more helpful than having the informative buttons alone (i.e., that the benefits of starting small will be redundant when paired with the benefits of the informative buttons). Thus, we also predict that learners in the \u201crandom order with informative buttons\u201d condition will learn the center embedded pattern significantly better than learners in the \u201cstarting small with uninformative buttons\u201d condition, and that learners will perform significantly better in the \u201cstarting small with informative buttons\u201d condition than in the \u201cstarting small with uninformative buttons\u201d condition, but not significantly better than in the \u201crandom ordering with informative buttons\u201d condition. Overall, then, we predict the following ranking among our 4 conditions with respect to how well learners in each condition will learn the center embedded pattern: random ordering with uninformative buttons &lt; starting small with uninformative buttons &lt; {random ordering with informative buttons, starting small with informative buttons}. \n\nFor the purposes of these predictions, our test set is divided into 5 categories (3 categories of sequences whose lengths are less than or equal to the maximum length seen during training, and 2 categories of sequences longer than those seen during training). With respect to these 5 categories, the predictions described in the previous paragraph will be operationalized as follows: For learners in the \u201crandom ordering with uninformative buttons\u201d condition, there will be at least 1 of the 3 categories with lengths less than or equal to the maximum length used during training for which these learners do not exceed chance performance, and there will be at least 1 of the 2 categories with lengths greater than seen during training for which these learners do not exceed chance performance. For learners in the other 3 conditions, performance will exceed chance for all 5 categories. Finally, regarding the predictions about which conditions lead to more effective learning than others, we will operationalize this as follows: learners in one condition will be said to have learned the center embedded pattern significantly better than learners in a second condition if there is at least 1 of the 3 categories with lengths less than or equal to the maximum length used during training for which learners in the first condition significantly outperform learners in the second condition, but there are no categories among those 3 categories for which learners in the second condition significantly outperform the learners in the first condition. Along similar lines, learners in two conditions will be said to have no significant difference if, for all 3 of these categories, there is no significant difference in performance between the two conditions.\n"}, "study_type": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment"}, "study_type_other": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"data": "No, no data have been collected for this study yet.", "name": "Generalization of Center Embedding to Novel Lengths", "other": "We will also repeat the between-condition comparisons for the subsets of the test set that are of greater length than seen during training.

Finally, regarding the predictions about which conditions lead to more effective learning than others, we will operationalize this as follows: learners in one condition will be said to have learned the center embedded pattern significantly better than learners in a second condition if there is at least 1 of the 3 categories with lengths less than or equal to the maximum length used during training for which learners in the first condition significantly outperform learners in the second condition, but there are no categories among those 3 categories for which learners in the second condition significantly outperform the learners in the first condition. Along similar lines, learners in two conditions will be said to have no significant difference if, for all 3 of these categories, there is no significant difference in performance between the two conditions.\n", "study_type": "Experiment"}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecac48", "text": "Social and Behavioral Sciences"}]]}, "relationships": {"license": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965", "type": "licenses"}}, "children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=j935t", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "j935t", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "j935t", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/tw5hx/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "tw5hx", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n2kxy/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "n2kxy", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5d2d2268d28338002c2432d2/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5d2d2268d28338002c2432d2", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/j935t/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/j935t/"}}, {"id": "snrp4", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Adverse effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in COVID-19 and other viral respiratory infections: Rapid Review", "description": "Background\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most commonly used drugs, and have a wide range of uses, including treatment of acute and chronic pain, fever, and inflammations of infectious and non-infectious etiology. NSAIDs include unselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors (such as ibuprofen, aspirin (acetylsalicylate), diclofenac and naproxen) as well as selective COX 2 inhibitors (such as Celecoxib, Rofecoxib, Etoricoxib, Lumiracoxib, and Valecoxib). \n\nConcerns have been raised that NSAIDs may be associated with an increased risk for adverse effects when used in patients with acute viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19 (caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS, caused by SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, caused by MERS-CoV), and other coronavirus infections. These concerns apply both to the use of NSAIDs prior to the infection, and to the use of NSAID during the infection.\n\nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of prior and current use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with acute viral respiratory infections on acute severe adverse events (including mortality, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute organ failure and opportunistic infections), on acute healthcare utilization (including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, supplemental oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation) as well as on quality of life and long-term survival. \n\nSetting of the review question and protocol development\nThe overall review question was set by the World Health Organization (WHO), which commissioned this review. At WHO, clinical experts and methodologists were involved in defining the review question. The protocol was developed by PvP and ER drawing on Cochrane Rapid Review guidance [1] and with input from Susan Norris (WHO), Gerald Gartlehner (Cochrane Austria) as well as AM, JB, JMS, KS, LMP and SD. Outcomes were set by WHO and refined by PvP and ER drawing on guidance from the WHO Working Group on the clinical characterization of COVID-19 infection (Annex 1) [2] and Susan Norris.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-01T18:52:24.853100", "date_modified": "2020-04-01T18:50:38.106060", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Authors"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "596ce93cb8e4e631c3cc8038d0cf9db3f59974efa4618e0ed8409d80f675495cc69b418fcbb83d70d1d03b0406df1d695b01fb91216d97848497bc91ec60f9ae496de70cf755afa3348a40e0a3b1ffb2b8a238addf96934259a3020392a002d2759eff9282d68a7aa3af687fef6000180ad3d47ea8125c404c1863ea3296d91677db049d213c294f0d51d090ea13a7ea", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-01T18:52:24.825813", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Peter von Philipsborn, Renke Biallas, Jacob Burns, Simon Drees, Karin Geffert, Ani Movsisyan, Lisa Maria Pfadenhauer, Kerstin Sell, Brigitte Strahwald, Jan Stratil, Eva Rehfuess"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "NA"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": ["No blinding is involved in this study."]}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "NA"}, "q6": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "NA"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": "NA"}, "q8": {"extra": [], "value": "Registration prior to analysis of the data"}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": "NA"}, "q10": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Eligibility\nTables 1 and 2 provide an overview of inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nStudies that include both patients with conditions considered in this review (i.e. acute viral respiratory infections or conditions commonly caused by respiratory viruses) and patients with other conditions (e.g. bacterial infections, conditions treated with antibiotics) will be included at title and abstract screening stage. We will decide at full text screening stage on how to proceed with these.\nAs the methodological approach to monitoring adverse events as well as their occurrence is often poorly reported in peer-reviewed publications, we will adopt an inclusive approach. During full text screening we will take note of all studies that do not explicitly report on severe adverse events or the method to identify these but where it may be possible to assume that no such events occurred (e.g. because the study reports adverse events classified as mild or moderate or because the study reports that no severe side effects were recorded). After full text screening we will decide on a consistent approach with regard to these studies. \nSecondary outcomes are of interest to WHO but we will not screen for these during title/abstract or full-text screening. Where a study reporting on a primary outcome also provides data on these secondary outcomes, we will attempt to extract them if this is feasible within the time frame of the review.\nStudies that report both outcomes considered in this review (e.g. acute complications) and outcomes not considered in this review (e.g. long-term gastrointestinal adverse effects) will be included, but data extraction will be limited to relevant outcomes.\nWe will include any systematic empirical study design reporting primary data on at least 10 patients (Table 1). For COVID-19, SARS and MERS, studies of any size will be eligible for inclusion.\n\nSearch methods for identification of studies\nWe will perform searches in MEDLINE and EMBASE, using the Ovid search interface. We will use existing systematic and narrative reviews and included studies to perform backward- and forward-citation searches in Scopus. In addition, the review team will search the WHO Database of publications on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [3].\nOur search strategy is based on two sets of search terms (NSAIDs, and viral respiratory infections), and was reviewed by an experienced information specialist (Irma Klerings). All searches will be conducted in English and abstracts screened in English only. Database searches will be limited to studies published in English or German. For studies on the current COVID-19 outbreak, we will consider studies in English, French, German and Italian. No restriction based on the year of publication will be applied.

As detailed in this extraction form, with respect to the study population, among other issues, we will pay attention to the characterization of the viral respiratory infection (i.e. disease, severity, pathogen, share of participants with viral respiratory infection) and any pre-existing conditions or co-morbidities. \nWith respect to the intervention and comparison, we will extract detailed information regarding NSAID use, notably regarding the specific drug used (Annex 2), type of application (i.e. intravenous or oral), reason for NSAID use, prescription vs. over-the-counter use, and initiation of NSAID use prior to or during the viral respiratory infection. One review author will assess all data extraction forms and classify NSAIDs based on their mechanism of action (unselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors, and selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors).\nWith respect to outcomes, we will extract information on all primary outcomes, i.e. acute severe adverse events, acute healthcare utilization, long term survival and quality of life as detailed under the inclusion criteria above.

We will use the Tool to Assess Risk of Bias in Case Control Studies developed by the Clarity Group at McMaster University for case-control studies [4], and the Cochrane risk of bias tool adapted by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) group for all remaining study designs [5].\nThe Tool to Assess Risk of Bias in Case Control Studies developed by the Clarity Group at McMaster University is based on the following five questions:\n1. Can we be confident in the assessment of exposure?\n2. Can we be confident that cases had developed the outcome of interest and controls had not?\n3. Were the cases (those who were exposed and developed the outcome of interest) properly selected?\n4. Were the controls (those who were exposed and did not develop the outcome of interest) properly selected?\n5. Were cases and controls matched according to important prognostic variables or was statistical adjustment carried out for those variables?\nFor each of these questions, one of the following answers is given:\n\u2022 Definitely yes (low risk of bias)\n\u2022 Probably yes (probably low risk of bias)\n\u2022 Probably no (probably high risk of bias)\n\u2022 Definitely no (high risk of bias)\nThe Cochrane EPOC Risk of Bias tool includes the following nine criteria:\n1. Random sequence generation (selection bias)\n2. Allocation concealment (selection bias)\n3. Similarity of baseline outcome measurements (selection bias)\n4. Similarity of other baseline characteristics (selection and performance bias)\n5. Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)\n6. Blinding (performance and detection bias)\n7. Contamination (performance bias)\n8. Selective reporting (reporting bias)\n9. Other potential sources of bias\nFor each of these criteria, one of the following assessments is given:\n\u2022 Low risk of bias: plausible bias unlikely to alter the results\n\u2022 Unclear risk of bias: plausible bias that raises some doubt about the results\n\u2022 High risk of bias: plausible bias that seriously weakens confidence in the results\nIn applying the tool we will follow relevant instructions as provided by EPOC (EPOC 2015) and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2017a). We will present risk of bias findings either in tables or by adapting the traffic light scheme used by Cochrane.\n\nAssessment of the certainty of evidence\nWe will use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence of primary outcomes. The assessment of the certainty of evidence will be done by two review authors, and the findings discussed among the review team.\nIn GRADE, the certainty of evidence can be understood as the extent to which one can be confident that the true effect of an intervention lies on one side of a specified threshold, or within a chosen range (Hultcrantz 2017). Within the GRADE approach, the certainty of evidence is assessed based on a number of factors which can decrease or increase the level of evidence. Traditionally, evidence from RCTs starts as high certainty evidence in GRADE, and evidence from all other study designs starts as low certainty.\nThere are four possible levels of evidence:\n\u2022 High certainty: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.\n\u2022 Moderate certainty: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.\n\u2022 Low certainty: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.\n\u2022 Very low certainty: Any estimate of effect is uncertain.\nThere are five factors that can lead to a downgrading of the level of evidence. If one of these factors is found to exist, it is classified either as serious (downgrading by one level) or as very serious (downgrading by two levels):\n\u2022 Risk of bias of individual studies (limitations in the design and implementation of available studies, suggesting high likelihood of bias).\n\u2022 Indirectness of evidence (indirect population, intervention, control, outcomes).\n\u2022 Unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency of results (including problems with subgroup analyses).\n\u2022 Imprecision of results (wide confidence intervals).\n\u2022 High probability of publication bias.\nThere are three factors increasing the certainty of evidence, each of which can lead to an upgrading of the level of evidence:\n\u2022 Large magnitude of effect (upgrading by one or two levels).\n\u2022 All plausible confounding would reduce a demonstrated effect or suggest a spurious effect when results show no effect (upgrading by one level).\n\u2022 Dose\u2010response gradient (upgrading by one level).\n\nEvidence synthesis\nWe will summarize the findings of the included studies narratively and with tables. If we find two or more sufficiently homogenous studies, we will conduct meta-analyses and present forest plots.\nAs much as possible within the timeframe and sensible in terms of the number of studies identified, we will conduct stratified analyses based on the following criteria:\n\u2022 Pathogen/disease group (COVID-19, SARS, MERS, other coronaviruses, other viral respiratory infections)\n\u2022 Age (elderly &gt; 65 years, adults 18-65 years; adolescents 12-17 years, children 6-12 years, &lt;6 years)\n\u2022 Sex\n\u2022 Severity of the acute viral respiratory infection (mild, moderate, severe)\n\u2022 With or without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\n\u2022 Co-morbidities (pre-existing cardiovascular disease (including hypertension and ischemic heart disease), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes mellitus, renal disease, rheumatic diseases, prior allergic or hypersensitive reactions to NSAIDs including Reye\u2019s syndrome)\n\u2022 Type of NSAID used (unselective COX inhibitors, selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors)\n\u2022 Specific substance used (e.g. ibuprofen, aspirin, etc.) and dose (high vs. low)\n\u2022 Prior use (incl. short-term/intermittent vs. chronic/long-term) vs. use during acute viral respiratory infection\nAll data presented in the final review manuscript in the narrative synthesis, in tables or in meta-analyses and forest plots will be independently checked by a second review author."}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Annex 6.docx"}, "nodeId": "43rsn", "sha256": "9ca131da70574ec3524748e83bf29bbccfd85b6eb89f9c8bb5b34fa1ab810bcc", "viewUrl": "/project/snrp4/files/osfstorage/5e84e2eed0e35401b3b466ea/", "selectedFileName": "Annex 6.docx"}, {"data": {"name": "References.docx"}, "nodeId": "43rsn", "sha256": "16beeecc1d7361f3fb344f46ded0497d76f5d8c55938abe8af1073cd59206c2a", "viewUrl": "/project/snrp4/files/osfstorage/5e84e2eed0e35401b3b466e8/", "selectedFileName": "References.docx"}], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q21": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q23": {"extra": [], "value": "Declarations\n\nConflicts of interest\nNone of the authors have conflicts of interest to report, as indicated in declaration of interest forms submitted to WHO.\n\nFunding\nFunded through staff positions and other funds of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen (LMU Munich).\n\nProvenance and peer review\nCommissioned by WHO, not externally peer reviewed."}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Peter von Philipsborn, Renke Biallas, Jacob Burns, Simon Drees, Karin Geffert, Ani Movsisyan, Lisa Maria Pfadenhauer, Kerstin Sell, Brigitte Strahwald, Jan Stratil, Eva Rehfuess", "q2": "NA", "q3": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies.", "q4": ["No blinding is involved in this study."], "q5": "NA", "q7": "NA", "q8": "Registration prior to analysis of the data", "q9": "NA", "q11": "Study selection\nAfter removal of duplicate studies, we will perform a multistage screening process to select those studies which meet the inclusion criteria:\n\u2022 Stage 1, screening of titles and abstracts: One review author will assess the titles and abstracts of all identified records. 20% of all titles and abstracts will be independently assessed by a second review author.

We will decide at full text screening stage on how to proceed with these.\nAs the methodological approach to monitoring adverse events as well as their occurrence is often poorly reported in peer-reviewed publications, we will adopt an inclusive approach. During full text screening we will take note of all studies that do not explicitly report on severe adverse events or the method to identify these but where it may be possible to assume that no such events occurred (e.g. because the study reports adverse events classified as mild or moderate or because the study reports that no severe side effects were recorded). After full text screening we will decide on a consistent approach with regard to these studies. \nSecondary outcomes are of interest to WHO but we will not screen for these during title/abstract or full-text screening.

All searches will be conducted in English and abstracts screened in English only. Database searches will be limited to studies published in English or German. For studies on the current COVID-19 outbreak, we will consider studies in English, French, German and Italian. No restriction based on the year of publication will be applied.

As detailed in this extraction form, with respect to the study population, among other issues, we will pay attention to the characterization of the viral respiratory infection (i.e. disease, severity, pathogen, share of participants with viral respiratory infection) and any pre-existing conditions or co-morbidities. \nWith respect to the intervention and comparison, we will extract detailed information regarding NSAID use, notably regarding the specific drug used (Annex 2), type of application (i.e. intravenous or oral), reason for NSAID use, prescription vs. over-the-counter use, and initiation of NSAID use prior to or during the viral respiratory infection. One review author will assess all data extraction forms and classify NSAIDs based on their mechanism of action (unselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors, and selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors).\nWith respect to outcomes, we will extract information on all primary outcomes, i.e. acute severe adverse events, acute healthcare utilization, long term survival and quality of life as detailed under the inclusion criteria above. In addition, where available and time permitting, we will also extract information on the following secondary outcomes:\t\n\u2022 Laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, leukocyte counts and others\n\u2022 Imaging / radiologic findings: CT chest scan, chest x-ray and others\n\nRisk of bias assessment\nOne review author will assess risk of bias of included studies. We will use the Tool to Assess Risk of Bias in Case Control Studies developed by the Clarity Group at McMaster University for case-control studies [4], and the Cochrane risk of bias tool adapted by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) group for all remaining study designs [5].\nThe Tool to Assess Risk of Bias in Case Control Studies developed by the Clarity Group at McMaster University is based on the following five questions:\n1. Can we be confident in the assessment of exposure?\n2. Can we be confident that cases had developed the outcome of interest and controls had not?\n3. Were the cases (those who were exposed and developed the outcome of interest) properly selected?\n4. Were the controls (those who were exposed and did not develop the outcome of interest) properly selected?\n5. Were cases and controls matched according to important prognostic variables or was statistical adjustment carried out for those variables?\nFor each of these questions, one of the following answers is given:\n\u2022 Definitely yes (low risk of bias)\n\u2022 Probably yes (probably low risk of bias)\n\u2022 Probably no (probably high risk of bias)\n\u2022 Definitely no (high risk of bias)\nThe Cochrane EPOC Risk of Bias tool includes the following nine criteria:\n1. Random sequence generation (selection bias)\n2. Allocation concealment (selection bias)\n3. Similarity of baseline outcome measurements (selection bias)\n4. Similarity of other baseline characteristics (selection and performance bias)\n5. Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)\n6. Blinding (performance and detection bias)\n7. Contamination (performance bias)\n8. Selective reporting (reporting bias)\n9. Other potential sources of bias\nFor each of these criteria, one of the following assessments is given:\n\u2022 Low risk of bias: plausible bias unlikely to alter the results\n\u2022 Unclear risk of bias: plausible bias that raises some doubt about the results\n\u2022 High risk of bias: plausible bias that seriously weakens confidence in the results\nIn applying the tool we will follow relevant instructions as provided by EPOC (EPOC 2015) and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2017a). We will present risk of bias findings either in tables or by adapting the traffic light scheme used by Cochrane.\n\nAssessment of the certainty of evidence\nWe will use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence of primary outcomes. The assessment of the certainty of evidence will be done by two review authors, and the findings discussed among the review team.\nIn GRADE, the certainty of evidence can be understood as the extent to which one can be confident that the true effect of an intervention lies on one side of a specified threshold, or within a chosen range (Hultcrantz 2017). Within the GRADE approach, the certainty of evidence is assessed based on a number of factors which can decrease or increase the level of evidence. Traditionally, evidence from RCTs starts as high certainty evidence in GRADE, and evidence from all other study designs starts as low certainty.\nThere are four possible levels of evidence:\n\u2022 High certainty: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.\n\u2022 Moderate certainty: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.\n\u2022 Low certainty: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.\n\u2022 Very low certainty: Any estimate of effect is uncertain.\nThere are five factors that can lead to a downgrading of the level of evidence. If one of these factors is found to exist, it is classified either as serious (downgrading by one level) or as very serious (downgrading by two levels):\n\u2022 Risk of bias of individual studies (limitations in the design and implementation of available studies, suggesting high likelihood of bias).\n\u2022 Indirectness of evidence (indirect population, intervention, control, outcomes).\n\u2022 Unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency of results (including problems with subgroup analyses).\n\u2022 Imprecision of results (wide confidence intervals).\n\u2022 High probability of publication bias.\nThere are three factors increasing the certainty of evidence, each of which can lead to an upgrading of the level of evidence:\n\u2022 Large magnitude of effect (upgrading by one or two levels).\n\u2022 All plausible confounding would reduce a demonstrated effect or suggest a spurious effect when results show no effect (upgrading by one level).\n\u2022 Dose\u2010response gradient (upgrading by one level).\n\nEvidence synthesis\nWe will summarize the findings of the included studies narratively and with tables. If we find two or more sufficiently homogenous studies, we will conduct meta-analyses and present forest plots.\nAs much as possible within the timeframe and sensible in terms of the number of studies identified, we will conduct stratified analyses based on the following criteria:\n\u2022 Pathogen/disease group (COVID-19, SARS, MERS, other coronaviruses, other viral respiratory infections)\n\u2022 Age (elderly &gt; 65 years, adults 18-65 years; adolescents 12-17 years, children 6-12 years, &lt;6 years)\n\u2022 Sex\n\u2022 Severity of the acute viral respiratory infection (mild, moderate, severe)\n\u2022 With or without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\n\u2022 Co-morbidities (pre-existing cardiovascular disease (including hypertension and ischemic heart disease), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes mellitus, renal disease, rheumatic diseases, prior allergic or hypersensitive reactions to NSAIDs including Reye\u2019s syndrome)\n\u2022 Type of NSAID used (unselective COX inhibitors, selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors)\n\u2022 Specific substance used (e.g. ibuprofen, aspirin, etc.) and dose (high vs. low)\n\u2022 Prior use (incl. short-term/intermittent vs. chronic/long-term) vs. use during acute viral respiratory infection\nAll data presented in the final review manuscript in the narrative synthesis, in tables or in meta-analyses and forest plots will be independently checked by a second review author.", "q17.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e84e2eed0e35401b3b466ea", "file_name": "Annex 6.docx", "file_urls": {"html":

present research is to examine the effects of practice and extremity of evaluation on the automatic activation of the evaluation as measures by the EPT.\n\n Background\nA classic finding in the field of automatic attitudes is the finding that an accessible attitude toward an object prompts an automatic activation of the evaluation upon encountering the attitude object (Fazio, Sanbonmatsu, Powell, &amp; Kardes, 1986). One research tested the relation between accessible evaluations of nouns (e.g., divorce and baby) and the automatic activation of these evaluations (Fazio et al., 1986). In two studies, accessible evaluations were operationalized as relatively fast self-reported evaluations. In a third study, accessible evaluations were manipulated by rehearsal (evaluating a noun five different times versus making a non-evaluative judgment of a noun). Automatic evaluation was measured in an evaluative priming task. In that task, participant categorized adjectives as good or bad. Before each adjective, a noun appeared. The index of automatic evaluation of each noun was the size of the expected priming effect: faster categorization of adjectives of valence that was congruent with the valence of the prime noun than of adjectives of the other valence. The study found that nouns with more accessible evaluations had a stronger priming effect in the evaluative priming task. Accessible attitudes in this context were defined as attitudes that required relatively short time to activate or were manipulated by rehearsing the evaluation (Fazio et al., 1986). Thus, the faster the evaluation was produced or the more training the evolution received, the more likely it was to be activated unintentionally. \n\nOne interesting finding that was frequently observed in these experiments is the correlation between accessibility and extremity. Specifically, it was found that accessible evaluations (evaluations that are activated relatively quickly) tend to be quite extreme (Judd &amp; kulak, 1980; Fazio &amp; Williams, 1986; Bargh, Chaiken, Govender, &amp; Pratto, 1992; Giner-sorola, 2001). The size of the relationship between accessibility and extremity was found to be somewhere between (-.3) - (-.53), thus the two constructs are substantially related but not redundant with each other (Powell &amp; Fazio, 1984). \n\nIn a previous research we set out to test how manipulations of amount of practice (accessibility) and of valence extremity would manifest in an unintentional evaluation. Unintentional evaluation can vary in its extremity and in the likelihood that it would be activated. A straightforward hypothesis is that extremity would be determined by the extremity of the evaluative information about the object, whereas the likelihood of unintentional activation would be determined by practice in making the evaluation. Because the EP effect is the average difference between incompatible and compatible trials, the effect frequency and its extant are intertwined. Thus, the purpose of that research was to examine whether it is possible to untangle the specific effects of evaluation practice and evaluation extremity on unintentional evaluation.\n\n The present research\n The results of AutoExt1 showed that practice and extremity affected implicit evaluations in the EP. Namely, the more practice in evaluation an object received, or, the more extreme the evaluation was, the more positive the EP score for that object was. As for explicit evaluations, we found that extremity but not practice affected the final explicit ratings of the targets. However, when looking at rating change (the difference in rating from the initial rating at the beginning of the experiment to the last rating at the end of the experiment), we found that practice increased the direct ratings. This finding made it difficult to determine how practice and extremity influenced the automaticity of the evaluations because increases in practice (and extremity) changed self-reported evaluations. For that reason, in the present research, we will balance the amount of exposure each target received so that each target will be presented equally, but the number of evaluations will vary according to condition. In addition, participants will have to evaluate targets based on description of behaviors instead of attractiveness to faces because we suspect that attraction might be somewhat automatic to begin with, which leaves less room for automatization manipulations.\n\n Procedure\n Participants will learn about 8 different target men. For each man, they will be presented with 6 behaviors that are attributed to that person, an image of the man and his name. The 8 men will vary on to three variables; (1) valence (positive vs. negative), (2) extremity (Extreme: 5 behaviors corresponding with valence and 1 neutral behavior, Moderate: 2 behaviors corresponding with valence and 4 neutral behaviors) and (3) practice (16 vs. 4 evaluations). After the learning phase participants will start to practice evaluating the men. To keep the amount of exposure to the men constant, we will use two questions, one evaluative (i.e., how likable is this person in your opinion) and one non-evaluative (where do you think this man lives, a city or the countryside), and we will manipulate the amount of times each character is presented with the evaluative question. The practice phase will comprise of 4 blocks of 5 trials for each man, for a total of 40 trials in each block, and 160 trials in the whole task. In the high practice condition, on each block participants will be asked to evaluate the target 4 times (for a total of 16 throughout the practice) and answer the non-evaluative question only once (a total of 4 times throughout the practice). In the low practice condition the ratio of the question presentation will be reversed so that participants will answer the non-evaluative question 16 times throughout the experiment and the evaluative question only 4 times. To sum up the different conditions, we will have 8 men representing 8 conditions; extremely positive with long practice, extremely positive with short practice, moderately positive with long practice, moderately positive with short practice, extremely negative with long practice, extremely negative with short practice, moderately negative with long practice, moderately negative with short practice.\nAfter learning about the men and practicing evaluating them, participants will complete an evaluative priming task.

One research tested the relation between accessible evaluations of nouns (e.g., divorce and baby) and the automatic activation of these evaluations (Fazio et al., 1986). In two studies, accessible evaluations were operationalized as relatively fast self-reported evaluations. In a third study, accessible evaluations were manipulated by rehearsal (evaluating a noun five different times versus making a non-evaluative judgment of a noun). Automatic evaluation was measured in an evaluative priming task. In that task, participant categorized adjectives as good or bad. Before each adjective, a noun appeared. The index of automatic evaluation of each noun was the size of the expected priming effect: faster categorization of adjectives of valence that was congruent with the valence of the prime noun than of adjectives of the other valence. The study found that nouns with more accessible evaluations had a stronger priming effect in the evaluative priming task. Accessible attitudes in this context were defined as attitudes that required relatively short time to activate or were manipulated by rehearsing the evaluation (Fazio et al., 1986). Thus, the faster the evaluation was produced or the more training the evolution received, the more likely it was to be activated unintentionally. \n\nOne interesting finding that was frequently observed in these experiments is the correlation between accessibility and extremity. Specifically, it was found that accessible evaluations (evaluations that are activated relatively quickly) tend to be quite extreme (Judd &amp; kulak, 1980; Fazio &amp; Williams, 1986; Bargh, Chaiken, Govender, &amp; Pratto, 1992; Giner-sorola, 2001). The size of the relationship between accessibility and extremity was found to be somewhere between (-.3) - (-.53), thus the two constructs are substantially related but not redundant with each other (Powell &amp; Fazio, 1984). \n\nIn a previous research we set out to test how manipulations of amount of practice (accessibility) and of valence extremity would manifest in an unintentional evaluation. Unintentional evaluation can vary in its extremity and in the likelihood that it would be activated. A straightforward hypothesis is that extremity would be determined by the extremity of the evaluative information about the object, whereas the likelihood of unintentional activation would be determined by practice in making the evaluation. Because the EP effect is the average difference between incompatible and compatible trials, the effect frequency and its extant are intertwined. Thus, the purpose of that research was to examine whether it is possible to untangle the specific effects of evaluation practice and evaluation extremity on unintentional evaluation.\n\n The present research\n The results of AutoExt1 showed that practice and extremity affected implicit evaluations in the EP. Namely, the more practice in evaluation an object received, or, the more extreme the evaluation was, the more positive the EP score for that object was. As for explicit evaluations, we found that extremity but not practice affected the final explicit ratings of the targets. However, when looking at rating change (the difference in rating from the initial rating at the beginning of the experiment to the last rating at the end of the experiment), we found that practice increased the direct ratings. This finding made it difficult to determine how practice and extremity influenced the automaticity of the evaluations because increases in practice (and extremity) changed self-reported evaluations. For that reason, in the present research, we will balance the amount of exposure each target received so that each target will be presented equally, but the number of evaluations will vary according to condition. In addition, participants will have to evaluate targets based on description of behaviors instead of attractiveness to faces because we suspect that attraction might be somewhat automatic to begin with, which leaves less room for automatization manipulations.\n\n Procedure\n Participants will learn about 8 different target men. For each man, they will be presented with 6 behaviors that are attributed to that person, an image of the man and his name. The 8 men will vary on to three variables; (1) valence (positive vs. negative), (2) extremity (Extreme: 5 behaviors corresponding with valence and 1 neutral behavior, Moderate: 2 behaviors corresponding with valence and 4 neutral behaviors) and (3) practice (16 vs. 4 evaluations). After the learning phase participants will start to practice evaluating the men. To keep the amount of exposure to the men constant, we will use two questions, one evaluative (i.e., how likable is this person in your opinion) and one non-evaluative (where do you think this man lives, a city or the countryside), and we will manipulate the amount of times each character is presented with the evaluative question. The practice phase will comprise of 4 blocks of 5 trials for each man, for a total of 40 trials in each block, and 160 trials in the whole task. In the high practice condition, on each block participants will be asked to evaluate the target 4 times (for a total of 16 throughout the practice) and answer the non-evaluative question only once (a total of 4 times throughout the practice). In the low practice condition the ratio of the question presentation will be reversed so that participants will answer the non-evaluative question 16 times throughout the experiment and the evaluative question only 4 times. To sum up the different conditions, we will have 8 men representing 8 conditions; extremely positive with long practice, extremely positive with short practice, moderately positive with long practice, moderately positive with short practice, extremely negative with long practice, extremely negative with short practice, moderately negative with long practice, moderately negative with short practice.\nAfter learning about the men and practicing evaluating them, participants will complete an evaluative priming task. Within each of the EPT\u2019s three blocks, each man will appear four times before positive targets and four times before negative targets, for a total of 64 trials. In total, each man will appear in 24 trials, 12 before positive targets and 12 before negative targets. After the EPT, participants will be asked to rate their liking toward to 8 men. Lastly, to examine the quality of learning, we will tell participants that some men were characterized by 5 positive behaviors and 1 neutral, some by 2 positive and 4 neutral behaviors, some by 2 negative and 4 neutral behaviors, and some by 5 negative and 1 neutral information and ask them by to try to recall what type of information combination was provided for each of the eight men.\n\nStimuli\n 8 Names[1]:  David, Michael, Chris, Kevin, Brian, James, Robert, Paul\n\n 14 Positive behaviors[2]:\nSheltered a family from his neighborhood that had lost their home in a fire (city)\t8.60\nBrought a blanket and a hot meal to a homeless person (city)\t8.43\nVolunteers to visit terminally ill children in the hospital twice a month\t8.27\nPays college tuition for his sister\u2019s children\t8.22\nHelped an elderly man mow his lawn (country)\t8.17\nCollected toys for underprivileged children\t8.13\nOffered his place in a line to an elderly person\t8.10\nMailed back an expensive item that was delivered to him by mistake\t7.99\nCooked a nice barbecue for his friends (country)\t7.87\nAlways promptly returns what he's borrowed\t7.86\nFixed the fence for his neighbor\t7.86\nAlways makes people laugh when he notices that they are sad\t7.76\nPicked up a friend from work late at night\t7.61\nThrew a surprise party for a friend\t7.68\n \n20 Neutral behaviors[3]:\n Usually wakes up at 08:00 AM from the sound of birds chirping (country)\nTakes the metro to work (city)\nLives in a penthouse apartment (city)\nGrows cherry-tomatoes (country)\nHas two dogs (country)\nShared a bedroom with his brother as a child (city)\nNever eats lunch at the same restaurant two days in a row (city)\nPlays the harmonica (country)\nEats dinner at a nice restaurant at least once a week (city)\nUsed to hate shoveling snow as a kid (country)\nIs a heavy sleeper - can sleep through loud noises (city)\nRecently bought a new track (county)\nLikes to drink a cup of coffee in a coffee shop every morning (city)\nLikes to make bonfires (country)\nLikes to go fishing (country)\nLikes to order in food (city)\nUsed to deliver newspapers as a boy (country)\nLives in a long street (city)\nIs a fan of his local football team (country)\nMet his girlfriend at a carnival (country)\n \n        \t14 Negative behaviors[4]:\nYelled at his parents over the phone\t2.77\nCut in front of some people in line to the metro (city)\t2.56\nBecame upset and broke some dishes\t2.52\nShoplifted an inexpensive item from a department store (city)\t2.50\nCriticized others because they weren't wearing fashionable clothes (city)\t2.41\nDented the fender of a parked car and didn't leave his name\t2.33\nInsulted his assistant at work\t2.07\nWas arrested for selling heroin to a teenager\t2.05\nDrove through a red light at a potentially dangerous intersection (city)\t2.04\nThrew a rock at a dog that was barking (country)\t1.93\nSmoked on a crowded bus (city)\t1.90\nMade fun of a colleague who has a speech impediment\t1.62\nStole money and jewelry from his relatives\t1.54\nLikes to pick fights with people that are physically weaker than him\t1.48\n\n       Learning phase\n\tIn the attitude formation part, participants will learn about the men.
