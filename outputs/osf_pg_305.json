The other-production effect is the finding that words heard when produced by someone else are remembered better than words read silently (MacLeod, 2011). In previous studies the magnitude of the other-production effect was smaller than that of the self-production effect. We are investigating a simulation-based account for the other-production effect \u2013 that is, that words read aloud by somebody else are better remembered than words read silently because we simulate the other\u2019s act of production using some of the same mechanisms that are used when we read the word aloud ourselves (Gambi &amp; Pickering, 2011). \nTo test whether we replicate previous findings (i.e., the production effect and the other-production effect), we will ask pairs of participants to take turns reading words out loud or reading them silently. Further, in order to try and manipulate the extent to which participants engage in simulation of their partner\u2019s acts of production, we will ask them to either take turns reading sentence contexts aloud (one word each at a time; which we expect to encourage simulation) or to read them silently. On each trial, participants will be shown a sentence context, presented one word at a time in RSVP, which each word coloured in green, orange or violet, followed by the target word in white. The colour of the sentence context specifies who should read the final target word (i.e., condition): either participant A reads it aloud, participant B reads it aloud, or both participants read it silently. The sentence contexts were taken from Rommers, Dell, &amp; Benjamin (2020) and were all unpredictable (i.e., low Cloze probability).\nThe second manipulation (high or low simulation) is blocked (order counterbalanced across participants). In the high simulation condition, participants alternate reading words from the context out loud (one each), and the position of the fixation cross on the screen before the sentence context (right or left) indicates which participant begins on each trial, by reading the first word of the sentence. The low simulation condition involves reading the whole sentence silently. \nThere are three hypotheses for the interaction between condition and simulation (both manipulated within participants). As specified below (see point 5), we will conduct an omnibus analysis first, with condition as a three-level factor (self, other, silent). This will be followed-up with analyses comparing self to silent (i.e., the self-production effect), other to silent (i.e., the other-production effect) and self to other (i.e., to assess to what degree reading a word out loud is comparable to hearing a word read aloud by one\u2019s partner). We do not expect the magnitude of the self-production effect to differ across high and low simulation blocks. Instead, we expect the magnitude of the other-production effect to be affected by simulation. If our hypotheses are correct, changes in the magnitude of the other-production effect will thus also lead to changes in the magnitude of the difference between self and other. Below, we describe our hypotheses with reference to the magnitude of the other-production effect (Other vs. Silent X High vs. Low Simulation).\n1.\tIf there is no interaction between condition (other vs. silent) and simulation, this would suggest simulation has no effect on the magnitude of other-production effect, and so simulation is unlikely to be contributing to enhanced memory for words read aloud by a partner. \n2.\tIf there is significant interaction between condition (other vs. silent) and simulation, then post-hoc analyses will be used to determine whether the size of the other-production effect is larger in low or in high simulation.\na.\tOne possibility is that the memory benefit associated with other-production will increase in high simulation compared to low simulation, because engaging in simulation of one\u2019s partner\u2019s acts of production more will make the other condition more akin to the self condition. \nb.\tHowever, it is also possible that simulation is already maximally engaged when hearing one\u2019s partner\u2019s speaking (i.e., even in low simulation blocks) as it is the default process when engaging in a joint task. If so, our manipulation should not affect memory performance in the other condition much, but it may instead affect how likely participants are to simulate their partner\u2019s even when they are not speaking (i.e., in the silent condition); if so, we would expect the magnitude of the other-production effect to be smaller in high than low simulation blocks, because high simulation blocks should boost memory performance even in the silent condition (see Rommers, et al., 2020 for a related argument about effects of sentence predictability on simulation).

Implicit learning is operationalized as the difference between random vs. patterned blocks to distinguish implicit learning from mere familiarity (Robertson, 2007).\n\nAfter performing a number of SRTT blocks, participants will be informed that, at various points during the task, the dots will appear in a reoccurring pattern. They will then be instructed to indicate (1) when they have an intuition about whether the block is random or patterned and (2) when they are explicitly aware of whether or not there is a pattern. Participants will signal such knowledge be pressing a specific key on the keyboard, at which point they will be direct to a new screen and asked to indicate their level of knowledge. Participants who report explicit knowledge of a pattern will be asked to reproduce it. \n\nNotably, the experimental design allows for the possibility that participants may report explicit knowledge prior to reporting an intuition. We have intentionally allowed for this possibility in order to gain empirical support for our first hypothesis \u2013 and frequently-cited line of thinking \u2013 that intuitions emerge before explicit knowledge. However, in instances when a participant reports explicit knowledge before/without giving an intuition, we will take some steps to assess whether the knowledge is actually explicit. Because participants must reproduce the pattern if they report explicit knowledge, we will be able to ascertain whether or not their knowledge is likely to be explicit.

This will be measured using mixed effects models, with target information (i.e., target number in the sequence, block type: pattern or random, button combination, target number x block type interaction) as Level 1 variables and Participant as the Level 2 variable. RT will be used as the DV. The first 10 targets of each block will be excluded to allow for a brief familiarization. We will also exclude all targets with an RT &gt; 1000ms. Block condition will be treated as a random slope. All other level 1 variables will set to random if doing so improves model fit. In order to obtain a measure of implicit learning for each participant, we will estimate each participant\u2019s variance from the average slope of block condition (using the most parsimonious model). \n\nDV 1: Intuitions\u2026 Participants will indicate the precise moment at which they develop intuitions. When they do this, participants will be directed to a separate screen to report whether they have an intuition that the targets are appearing as a pattern or an intuition that they are appearing randomly. We will record whether their intuitions are accurate as well as how many targets passed before they stopped the sequence to indicate the intuition. Both of these metrics (accuracy vs timing) may prove useful. If we observe a negative correlation between timing and accuracy (i.e., faster participants are more accurate), we may create a composite measure that incorporates both accuracy and timing. This measurement of intuition will serve as both a DV (as it relates to implicit learning) and as a MV (implicit learning  intuitions  explicit knowledge). Further, because participants are permitted to report explicit knowledge prior to intuitions, it will be important to determine whether explicit knowledge reported prior to an intuition is, in fact, explicit. Participants will be required to reproduce the pattern if they report explicit knowledge of a pattern. If participants who report explicit knowledge before an intuition are unable to demonstrate explicit knowledge (because they cannot produce the pattern), we may reclassify this judgement as an intuition. \n\nDV 2: Explicit Knowledge\u2026 Participants will also indicate when they have explicit knowledge of the pattern (again, by stopping the sequence). We will measure explicit knowledge by considering both accuracy and speed. Additionally, because participants will be asked to reproduce the pattern if they report explicit knowledge, we will also record the number of correct sequence elements that each participant can recall. We will examine how all 3 estimates of explicit knowledge relate to each other.\n\nSecondary, exploratory variables:\n\nWe will collect additional information on each participant. The below variables may be used in additional exploratory regression based models to examine how the emergence of intuitions relates to other cognitive abilities and personality traits. If we find that these variables are meaningfully related to implicit learning and the emergence of intuitions/explicit knowledge, they may be used as covariate regressors in the primary analyses to obtain a more precise estimate of the effect of implicit learning on intuitions and explicit knowledge. \n\n--Intuitive Thinking Style: Types of Intuition Scale (Pretz et al., 2014).\n--Reflection/Intuitive Thinking: Cognitive Reflection Test (Frederick, 2005). \n--Creative Insight: Insight problems (see Chrysikou, 2006; Patrick &amp; Ahmed, 2014)\n--Intuitions of Universal Order and Belief in Divine Intervention (Weinberger et al., submitted)\n--Basic demographic information"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "See above for calculation of implicit learning as well as potential composite measures of speed and accuracy."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q19": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "1.

Because participants will not be told that they should report intuitions first, the trajectory of conscious/accessible knowledge can be empirically tested with a t-test. We expect that the number of targets before participants report intuitions will be less than the number of targets before participants report explicit knowledge. We will also compare mean accuracy of intuitions and explicit knowledge.\n\n2. Mixed effect model to obtain estimate of implicit learning:\n--Level 1: Target number, Block condition (pattern or random), Button combination, Target number X Block condition interaction\n--Level 2: Participant\n--DV: Response Time\n\nMixed effects models are appropriate when several repeated measurements/observations (Level 1: target number) are nested within a higher level of data (Level 2: Participant; Goldstein, 2011; Longford, 1995), and have recently be used to examine sequence learning (Kahn et al., 2018; Karuza et al., 2019). The first 10 targets for each block will be excluded to allow for a brief familiarization. When building mixed effects models, it is important to carefully consider which slopes should be allowed to vary randomly. For theoretical reasons, we will set block condition to be random, as prior work has clearly demonstrated individual differences in the extent to which block condition influences RT (i.e., individual differences in implicit learning). The treatment of the remaining independent variables (i.e., fixed or random) will be resolved empirically; likelihood ratio (LR) tests will be performed to compare model fit when each independent variable is treated as a fixed or random slope in a stepwise manner. Slopes will only set to random if doing so improves model fit. In order to obtain a measure of implicit learning for each participant, we will estimate each participant\u2019s variance from the average slope of block condition (using the most parsimonious model). All mixed effects models will be fit with maximum likelihood, unstructured variances and covariances, and robust standard errors. Significance tests will be two-sided.\n\nNote that, once a participant indicates the presence of an intuition or explicit knowledge during a given block, we will no longer use information from that block in the mixed effect models to calculate implicit learning because the information is, presumably, no longer implicit (i.e., because the participant has reported some awareness). Crucially, participants are permitted to stop the block to report an intuition at any point. Thus, when this occurs is likely to vary widely from one participant to the next. Indeed, the timing of these reports are of central importance to our study. However, this does leave open the possibility that participants will have a substantially different number of Level 1 data points (i.e., how many targets before they signal an intuition/explicit knowledge). To mitigate this potential issue, all participants will complete 2 patterned blocks and 2 random blocks (order counterbalanced) prior to beginning the stage of the experiment when they are asked to report intuitions/explicit knowledge. If the number of pre-intuition data points vary widely from person-to-person, we may elect to constrain the mixed effects model (and subsequent implicit learning calculation) to just the 4 blocks that precede the stage of the experiment in which they can stop the sequence. \n\n3. Linear regression/zero-order correlations\nDV: Intuitions; Explicit Knowledge\nIV: Implicit learning (as derived from mixed effect model)\nCV: TBD\n\nBecause intuitions have been theorized to emerge from implicit learning of regularity/coherence, we hypothesize that implicit learning will predict accuracy of intuitions. Because implicit learning \u2013 by its very calculation \u2013 will occur before intuition, there is a clear directionality of effect (i.e., implicit learning -&gt; intuition). Additional data described in \u201cMeasured Variables\u201d may be used as covariates if we find that they are meaningfully associated with intuitions. We will also run a regression model in which implicit learning predicts explicit knowledge.\n\n4. Mediation analyses\nIV: Implicit learning\nMV: Intuitions\nDV: Explicit Knowledge\nCV: TBD\n\nWe will examine direct and indirect effects of implicit learning on explicit knowledge. Based on theoretical work on the role of intuition, we anticipate that it will mediate the effect of implicit learning.

Thus, there are almost certain to be additional exploratory analyses not yet conceived that will be required to provide a more thorough addressing of our primary questions \u2013 namely, how people become aware (presumably, intuitively and then more explicitly) of reoccurring patterns/regularities. \n", "q25": "References\n\nBechara, A., &amp; Damasio, A.

Implicit learning is operationalized as the difference between random vs. patterned blocks to distinguish implicit learning from mere familiarity (Robertson, 2007).\n\nAfter performing a number of SRTT blocks, participants will be informed that, at various points during the task, the dots will appear in a reoccurring pattern. They will then be instructed to indicate (1) when they have an intuition about whether the block is random or patterned and (2) when they are explicitly aware of whether or not there is a pattern. Participants will signal such knowledge be pressing a specific key on the keyboard, at which point they will be direct to a new screen and asked to indicate their level of knowledge. Participants who report explicit knowledge of a pattern will be asked to reproduce it. \n\nNotably, the experimental design allows for the possibility that participants may report explicit knowledge prior to reporting an intuition. We have intentionally allowed for this possibility in order to gain empirical support for our first hypothesis \u2013 and frequently-cited line of thinking \u2013 that intuitions emerge before explicit knowledge. However, in instances when a participant reports explicit knowledge before/without giving an intuition, we will take some steps to assess whether the knowledge is actually explicit. Because participants must reproduce the pattern if they report explicit knowledge, we will be able to ascertain whether or not their knowledge is likely to be explicit. For example, if a participant indicates explicit knowledge but cannot accurately indicate most of the repeating pattern, we may reclassify this report as an intuition. \n\nAll participants will complete the same blocks, but order will be counterbalanced randomly. \n\nIV 1: Implicit learning: Operationalized as difference in responding during patterned vs. random blocks\n\nDV 1: Intuitions: Operationalized both in terms of accuracy (e.g., does participant have an intuition of a pattern during a pattern block?) and speed (how long into the block before the participant reports an intuition). See above for alternative ways we may score intuition. \n\nDV 2: Explicit Knowledge: Operationalized both in terms of accuracy (e.g., does participant have explicit knowledge of a pattern during a pattern block? How many sequence elements can the participant reproduce?) and speed (how long into the block before the participant reports explicit knowledge).\n\nMV 1: Intuitions -&gt; does accuracy/speed of intuitions mediate relationship between implicit learning and explicit knowledge?", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Data will be collected online through Prolific (https://www.prolific.co/).

Failure to respond appropriately to these questions will indicate inappropriate attention; participants who fail these questions will be excluded from analysis. Finally, the duration of each participants\u2019 time to complete the study will be obtained; irregular completion times may also serve as grounds for exclusion.  ", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Primary, hypothesis-driven variables: \n\nIV 1: Implicit Learning\u2026 Implicit learning will be operationalized as the difference in responding on patterned vs random blocks. This will be measured using mixed effects models, with target information (i.e., target number in the sequence, block type: pattern or random, button combination, target number x block type interaction) as Level 1 variables and Participant as the Level 2 variable. RT will be used as the DV. The first 10 targets of each block will be excluded to allow for a brief familiarization. We will also exclude all targets with an RT &gt; 1000ms. Block condition will be treated as a random slope. All other level 1 variables will set to random if doing so improves model fit. In order to obtain a measure of implicit learning for each participant, we will estimate each participant\u2019s variance from the average slope of block condition (using the most parsimonious model). \n\nDV 1: Intuitions\u2026 Participants will indicate the precise moment at which they develop intuitions. When they do this, participants will be directed to a separate screen to report whether they have an intuition that the targets are appearing as a pattern or an intuition that they are appearing randomly. We will record whether their intuitions are accurate as well as how many targets passed before they stopped the sequence to indicate the intuition. Both of these metrics (accuracy vs timing) may prove useful. If we observe a negative correlation between timing and accuracy (i.e., faster participants are more accurate), we may create a composite measure that incorporates both accuracy and timing. This measurement of intuition will serve as both a DV (as it relates to implicit learning) and as a MV (implicit learning  intuitions  explicit knowledge). Further, because participants are permitted to report explicit knowledge prior to intuitions, it will be important to determine whether explicit knowledge reported prior to an intuition is, in fact, explicit. Participants will be required to reproduce the pattern if they report explicit knowledge of a pattern. If participants who report explicit knowledge before an intuition are unable to demonstrate explicit knowledge (because they cannot produce the pattern), we may reclassify this judgement as an intuition. \n\nDV 2: Explicit Knowledge\u2026 Participants will also indicate when they have explicit knowledge of the pattern (again, by stopping the sequence). We will measure explicit knowledge by considering both accuracy and speed. Additionally, because participants will be asked to reproduce the pattern if they report explicit knowledge, we will also record the number of correct sequence elements that each participant can recall. We will examine how all 3 estimates of explicit knowledge relate to each other.\n\nSecondary, exploratory variables:\n\nWe will collect additional information on each participant. The below variables may be used in additional exploratory regression based models to examine how the emergence of intuitions relates to other cognitive abilities and personality traits. If we find that these variables are meaningfully related to implicit learning and the emergence of intuitions/explicit knowledge, they may be used as covariate regressors in the primary analyses to obtain a more precise estimate of the effect of implicit learning on intuitions and explicit knowledge. \n\n--Intuitive Thinking Style: Types of Intuition Scale (Pretz et al., 2014).\n--Reflection/Intuitive Thinking: Cognitive Reflection Test (Frederick, 2005). \n--Creative Insight: Insight problems (see Chrysikou, 2006; Patrick &amp; Ahmed, 2014)\n--Intuitions of Universal Order and Belief in Divine Intervention (Weinberger et al., submitted)\n--Basic demographic information", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "See above for calculation of implicit learning as well as potential composite measures of speed and accuracy.", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "1. Paired t-test\n--Variable 1: Timing/Accuracy of intuition\n--Variable 2: Timing/Accuracy of explicit knowledge\nIntuitions are likely to emerge prior to explicit knowledge. Because participants will not be told that they should report intuitions first, the trajectory of conscious/accessible knowledge can be empirically tested with a t-test. We expect that the number of targets before participants report intuitions will be less than the number of targets before participants report explicit knowledge. We will also compare mean accuracy of intuitions and explicit knowledge.\n\n2. Mixed effect model to obtain estimate of implicit learning:\n--Level 1: Target number, Block condition (pattern or random), Button combination, Target number X Block condition interaction\n--Level 2: Participant\n--DV: Response Time\n\nMixed effects models are appropriate when several repeated measurements/observations (Level 1: target number) are nested within a higher level of data (Level 2: Participant; Goldstein, 2011; Longford, 1995), and have recently be used to examine sequence learning (Kahn et al., 2018; Karuza et al., 2019). The first 10 targets for each block will be excluded to allow for a brief familiarization. When building mixed effects models, it is important to carefully consider which slopes should be allowed to vary randomly. For theoretical reasons, we will set block condition to be random, as prior work has clearly demonstrated individual differences in the extent to which block condition influences RT (i.e., individual differences in implicit learning). The treatment of the remaining independent variables (i.e., fixed or random) will be resolved empirically; likelihood ratio (LR) tests will be performed to compare model fit when each independent variable is treated as a fixed or random slope in a stepwise manner. Slopes will only set to random if doing so improves model fit. In order to obtain a measure of implicit learning for each participant, we will estimate each participant\u2019s variance from the average slope of block condition (using the most parsimonious model). All mixed effects models will be fit with maximum likelihood, unstructured variances and covariances, and robust standard errors. Significance tests will be two-sided.\n\nNote that, once a participant indicates the presence of an intuition or explicit knowledge during a given block, we will no longer use information from that block in the mixed effect models to calculate implicit learning because the information is, presumably, no longer implicit (i.e., because the participant has reported some awareness). Crucially, participants are permitted to stop the block to report an intuition at any point. Thus, when this occurs is likely to vary widely from one participant to the next. Indeed, the timing of these reports are of central importance to our study. However, this does leave open the possibility that participants will have a substantially different number of Level 1 data points (i.e., how many targets before they signal an intuition/explicit knowledge). To mitigate this potential issue, all participants will complete 2 patterned blocks and 2 random blocks (order counterbalanced) prior to beginning the stage of the experiment when they are asked to report intuitions/explicit knowledge. If the number of pre-intuition data points vary widely from person-to-person, we may elect to constrain the mixed effects model (and subsequent implicit learning calculation) to just the 4 blocks that precede the stage of the experiment in which they can stop the sequence. \n\n3. Linear regression/zero-order correlations\nDV: Intuitions; Explicit Knowledge\nIV: Implicit learning (as derived from mixed effect model)\nCV: TBD\n\nBecause intuitions have been theorized to emerge from implicit learning of regularity/coherence, we hypothesize that implicit learning will predict accuracy of intuitions. Because implicit learning \u2013 by its very calculation \u2013 will occur before intuition, there is a clear directionality of effect (i.e., implicit learning -&gt; intuition). Additional data described in \u201cMeasured Variables\u201d may be used as covariates if we find that they are meaningfully associated with intuitions. We will also run a regression model in which implicit learning predicts explicit knowledge.\n\n4. Mediation analyses\nIV: Implicit learning\nMV: Intuitions\nDV: Explicit Knowledge\nCV: TBD\n\nWe will examine direct and indirect effects of implicit learning on explicit knowledge. Based on theoretical work on the role of intuition, we anticipate that it will mediate the effect of implicit learning.

Both scenarios are tested against a control scenario in which light conditions are kept constant. The dynamic lighting conditions that are investigated are similar in amount of relatively bright light that participants are exposed to during their working day, however, they differ in their timing of exposure to this brighter light. We will test the effects of substantially brighter light for about 3.5 hours around midday, against substantially brighter light in the morning and at the end of the afternoon (again, amounting to about 3.5 hours). In terms of acute effects, this design will also allow us to examine at what time of day improvements in alertness and performance are to be expected.\n\nThe following research questions are addressed:\n1) How can daytime light exposure affect sleep at night? \n1a) What are the effects of dynamic light scenarios (with a higher daily light dose) on sleep?\n1b) How does the timing of bright light influence sleep?\n\n2) How and when does bright light exposure influence human comfort, alertness and performance ?", "q4": "It is expected that participants' sleep is better in the dynamic conditions (with a higher light dose) compared to the control condition. Although midday boosts are often suggested (and implemented) when scenarios imitate the daylight outside and when one tries to fight the after-lunch dip, our mathematical models based on the Kronauer model predict that the boosts at the beginning and end of day could be much more effective in advancing the circadian rhythm, and preventing negative effects of evening light exposure, and therefore improve sleep and in turn potentially also daytime functioning. Therefore, we expect that sleep will be best in the dynamic condition with light at the beginning and at the end of the day.\n\nWe expect higher levels of alertness and performance when participants are exposed to the higher illuminances as compared to regular levels.

In the initial study, we tested 40 adults. Subjects were asked to perform a mental manipulation on Approximate Number System (ANS) representation, and then to compare the output of that representation to a visible array. Within subjects, adults performed three types of manipulation. In the Basic manipulation, an array of dots moved behind an occluder, and subjects had to maintain the ANS representation in working memory. In the Summation condition, two arrays of dots moved sequentially behind an occluder. Subjects had to mentally sum these arrays, a computation that can be accomplished by maintaining a running total in working memory (i.e. updating an ANS representation; see Barth et al., 2005). In the Difference (or Solve-for-x) condition, an array was occluded, an unknown set was added, and then the occluder was removed to reveal the final set. Subjects had to determine the quantity that was added, a computation that requires maintaining two separate ANS representations in working memory and taking their difference (see Kibbe &amp; Feigenson, 2015, 2017). We aimed to examine whether these different types of mental manipulation differentially impacted the precision of their outputs.\nIn the initial exploratory study, our primary analysis of interest was a repeated measures ANOVA with Manipulation Condition (Basic, Summation, Difference) and Ratio (3:4, 4:5, 5:6, 6:7, 7:8) as within-subjects factors. We found the precision of the outputs of computations with the ANS were influenced by the manipulation that subjects were asked to perform and the level of difficulty of the comparison (ratios between computed and test dot arrays). Subjects\u2019 performance decreased overall as the ratio between the comparison arrays decreased. Subjects also performed roughly equally in Basic and Summation conditions, and worse in the Difference condition. An interaction was found between Manipulation Condition and Ratio; performance across manipulation conditions converged at the hardest level (smallest ratio, 7:8). Figure 1 shows the data from this experiment. Observed power for main effects and the interaction were high (1-beta &gt; .9). In an exploratory analysis, we looked at whether performance in each condition was correlated with ANS acuity which was measured via the standardized Panamath task (the psychophysical assessment of number sense acuity, Halberda &amp; Ly, 2015). We found a moderate positive correlation between the performance in Summation condition and ANS acuity, but not in the other two conditions, though a suggestive trend was found in the performance in the Basic condition.\u00a0\nIn the replication, we intend to test a new group of 40 adults using the same tasks, but with double the test trials in each condition for the primary computation manipulation task."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypothesis 1: Adults will perform better in Basic and Summation conditions than in the Difference condition.\n\nHypothesis 2: Performance in all manipulation conditions will decrease as the ratio between the computed and test arrays become smaller.\n\nHypothesis 3: We will again observe an interaction between the manipulation condition and ratio, with performance converging as the comparisons become more difficult.\n\nA secondary goal of the current study is to examine the extent to which performance on our task correlates with performance on Panamath, a measurement of ANS acuity. We do not have a strong prediction with respect to correlation between performance on our task and Panamath performance. We may continue to find that only the Summation condition correlates with Panamath performance.

Macroangiopathy: A Protocol for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis", "description": "Diabetic macroangiopathy is a further complication of diabetes\u00a0mellitus and is the leading cause of death for diabetic patients. Shenqi compound is a traditional Chinese medicine formula widely used in the treatment of diabetes and diabetic macroangiopathy. At present, there is only one systematic review on shenqi compound in the treatment of diabetes. However, no meta-analysis has evaluated the efficacy and safety of shenqi compound on diabetic macroangiopathy.\nFrom its establishment to March 1, 2020, three English databases and four Chinese medical databases will be searched. Then, according to the established inclusion and exclusion criteria, the two methodologically trained researchers will select qualified articles by reading titles, abstracts and full texts. The deviation risk will be assessed using the tools of Cochrane Collaboration. We will conduct a meta-analysis of fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin and other results. We will also complete heterogeneity assessment, subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis for the data.\nThe results will be published at a peer-reviewed journal.\n In this study, we will systematically evaluate the evidence of shenqi compound in the treatment of diabetic macroangiopathy.
