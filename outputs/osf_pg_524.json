The experiment  starts with the word learning task in which participants are exposed to the novel words and their learning efficacy is immediately tested after each block of words (please refer to the experimental setting and structure section below for more details). Subsequently, participants will move on to the Theory of Mind task and the Executive Function task (randomized task order for each participant). At the end of the experiment, participants will complete a Meaning Retention task in which their retention of the novel word meanings is assessed.\n\nExperiment 2 will investigate the causal relationship between social cognition and word learning from pragmatic inference. Similar to the design in Experiment 1, participants will perform three tasks: Theory of mind task, Executive function task, and word learning task. One key difference is that one group of participants will perform the Theory of Mind task before word learning, while the other group will perform the Executive function task before word learning.\n\nExperimental setting and structure: \n\nFor the word learning task, participants are told that they are playing an online language game with a virtual partner named Mary. Mary is visiting a toy store and she is going to describe to them some toys she wants or likes. Participants\u2019 goal is to find which toy Mary is referring to. They are informed that Mary sometimes uses words that are not English, because she speaks a different language. After the learning phase is completed, participants will be asked to recall the objects in a multiple-choice test session.\n\nThe visual array that participants are exposed to during the word learning trials includes a table, facing the participants and two toys each time. Depending on whether the trial involves a novel word meaning that is being explicitly taught or a meaning that participants needs to infer, they see one dinosaur and one alien or two aliens or two dinosaurs, respectively. More details about the exact design and the content of the learning trials can be found below. \n\nThis word learning task is comprised of three phases: a familiarization phase, a learning phase, an immediate testing phase, and a delayed recall phase approximately 5-6 minutes later.\n\nFamiliarization phase: Our word learning task starts with the familiarization phase in which participants are introduced to the two toys, the alien and the dinosaur that they will be seeing throughout the task. They are informed that these are two of Mary\u2019s favorite toys about which she is going to talk, leading them to the two practice trials. Each of these two practice trials is meant to familiarize participants with the setting for the inferred and the taught trials and they involve familiar objects (e.g. guitar).\n\nLearning Phase: Following the familiarization trials, participants move on to the learning phase. The learning phase consists of four blocks: a block of trials in which participants need to infer the novel word meaning (inferred trials), always followed by a block of trials testing those inferred meanings (immediate inferred test trials), a block of trials where participants are explicitly taught the novel word meaning (taught trials), that are also followed by a block testing those taught meanings (immediate taught test trials). Across participants, we counterbalanced the order in such a way that half of the participants start with the inferred trials and immediate inferred test trials while the other half start with the taught trials and immediate taught test trials.\n\nInferred Trials Block: In this block, participants see two identical toys on the table (either two aliens or two dinosaurs). Toy 1 is holding one object while Toy 2 is holding the same object that Toy 1 is holding and another new object. The side on which the toy is holding two objects is counterbalanced across trials. Participants hear Mary saying: \u201cLook! I like/want this dinosaur! It is holding a mel!\u201d followed by our narrator \u2013 a different voice from Mary\u2019s \u2013 asking \u201cWhich toy does Mary like/want?\u201d The underlined word is the novel word meaning participants need to infer and it is aimed to refer to the second, extra object that one of the toys is holding. After the question is asked, participants need to click on the toy that they believe Mary likes or wants.\n\nTaught Trials Block: For the taught trials, participants see two different toys (an alien and a dinosaur) holding the same object. Participants hear Mary saying: \u201cLook! I like/want this bink! It is on the dinosaur!\u201d followed by our narrator \u2013 a different voice from Mary\u2019s \u2013 asking \u201cWhich toy does Mary like/want?\u201d Here, the underlined word is the novel word meaning that is being taught as there is only one novel object across both toys and therefore, there is no pragmatic inference for ambiguity resolution. After the question is asked, participants need to click on the toy, the alien or the dinosaur that they believe Mary likes or wants.\n\nEach block has 8 unique trials corresponding to a novel word in each one, but repeated twice in the same block, resulting in 16 trials for each block. All trials are presented in a randomized order for each participant.\n\nTest trials:\nParticipants see 4 objects they have seen before (in a 2x2 arrangement) and they hear a sentence asking \u201cWhich one is a X?\u201d where X is one of the new words they were exposed to in the learning trials. After the audio is completed, they need to click on one of the 4 toys to proceed to the next trial.\n\nFor the immediate test phase, there are 8 trials in total, each testing one of the novel words of the immediately preceded learning block and they are presented in a randomized order across participants.\n\nFor the delayed retention phase, there are 16 testing trials corresponding to the 8 novel taught words and the 8 novel inferred words, presented in a randomized order.\n\nAll recorded sentences are normalized in terms of approximate duration and intensity. \nAll novel words are monosyllabic. Within each word type category, novel words do not share the same vowels or onsets. \n\n\nTheory of Mind task\nFor our Theory of Mind task, we are using the latest, updated version of Mind in the Eyes by Baron-Cohen et al. 2001. There are 36 trials in total presented in a randomized order across participants. \n\nIn each trial, participants are presented with pictures of eyes and four different words. They are asked to choose one word out of the four given choices that they think best describes what the person pictured in the photo was thinking or feeling.\n\nThe total duration of the task is approximately 2-3 minutes.\n\nExecutive function task\nTo measure participants\u2019 executive function, we intend to use Flanker task (as available from the Gorilla Task Inventory - www.gorilla.sc; Anwyl-Irvine, Massonni\u00e9, Flitton, Kirkham &amp; Evershed, 2019) which is used to assess the participants\u2019 ability to suppress responses that are inappropriate in a particular context. The task is comprised of 36 trials, in each of which participants are presented with 5 fish, either looking all in the same direction or in different directions. Participants need to press the button that matches the direction towards which the fish in the middle is looking. Just before each trial, there is a fixation point in the middle of the screen at which participants need to look. There are three different durations for which the point remains on screen before the actual trial begins: 400ms, 800ms and 1200ms. Out of the 36 trials, there 12 trials for each fixation duration. All trials are randomly presented across participants.\nThe total duration of the task is about 2 minutes.\n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q10": {"extra": [], "value": "Registration prior to analysis of the data"}, "q11": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q12": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "i.\tPre-selection rules:\n\nWe are recruiting adult participants, within the age range of 18 to 35, that are monolingual native speakers of English.
