Social science still has few answers to these questions (Flynn, Nyhan, and Reifler 2017). However, the spread of \"fake news\" online during the 2016 election highlighted the necessity of developing more effective responses to misinformation. Facebook has formed a new partnership with fact-checkers to counter the spread of false information on its platform, but little is known about the effectiveness of the approach the company has undertaken or what might be more effective. We will therefore conduct an experiment testing two approaches to countering belief in misinformation on social media \u2013 an advance warning, which Bolsen and Druckman (2015) find is most effective in scientific controversies, and a Facebook-style banner identifying claims that fact-checkers rate as inaccurate, which Pennycook et al. find is effective (2017). Our study makes several contributions. First, we extend the advance warning approach to the context of false headlines online. Second, Pennycook et al. did not explore whether Facebook's \"disputed\" banners were as effective at dissuading belief in false headlines as a direct refutation identifying a false article as such. This hypothesis conforms to our theoretical understanding of fact-checks. For instance, Fridkin et al. (2015) finds that fact-checks which directly and negatively question the truth of a negative political ad \"influence people's assessments of the accuracy, usefulness, and tone of negative political ads\" (145). Third, we consider whether the presence of an advance warning strengthens the effect of \"disputed\" or \"false\" flags. Finally, we consider the effects of these treatments on intended liking and sharing behavior on Facebook as well as possible spillovers to the perceived accuracy of both true articles and unflagged false articles."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "We plan to test the following four experimental hypotheses.

H2b: The presence of a \"false\" flag under false headlines will reduce their perceived accuracy (relative to a no-flag condition).

We will plan to explore the following research questions, which raise important issues for which we do not have strong theoretical expectations: RQ1: Will a warning about misleading articles or the presence of a \"disputed\" or \"false\" flag on a headline affect the likelihood that people will say they would like or share it?

All Turkers are eligible to participate in this study who meet the specified qualifications and did not take part in an earlier pilot study. The sample size will be approximately 2500-3500 \u2013 data collection will continue until all funds allocated to the project are exhausted. Researchers have no role in selecting the participants after listing the project on Mechanical Turk. Randomization approach We will use a between-subjects design in which respondents are randomly assigned to one of seven conditions by the Qualtrics online survey platform (p=1/7 for each): -Pure control (no warnings or headlines shown) -Warning about false and misleading stories, no flags on false headlines -Warning about false and misleading stories, disputed flags on false headlines -Warning about false and misleading stories, false flags on false headlines -No warning about false and misleading stories, no flags on false headlines -No warning about false and misleading stories, disputed flags on false headlines -No warning about false and misleading stories, false flags on false headlines Data collection and blinding Data will be collected on the Qualtrics online survey platform. There may be some online discussion among Mechanical Turk workers about the details of our survey. This cannot be prevented and we hope that these participants preserve the integrity of the research. Primary and secondary outcome measures Our principal outcome measures are the perceived accuracy of the relevant set of false claims that were shown in headlines to respondents not assigned to the pure control condition (the set that is relevant varies by hypothesis; see below). The wording of these questions appears below. (Note: We will also conduct exploratory analysis of individual outcome questions.) To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim that Trump is bringing back the draft? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim that Trump plagiarized the Bee Movie for his inaugural speech? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim that Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz was blackmailed by the Kremlin? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim that a Donald Trump protester was paid $3,500 to protest Trump's rally? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim that Donald Trump sent his own plane to transport 200 stranded Marines? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim that an FBI agent suspected in Hillary Clinton's email leaks was found dead in an apparent murder-suicide? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) Secondary outcome measures: o The average likelihood of \"liking\" or sharing a false article on Facebook (among respondents who do not answer \"never\" when asked how often they use Facebook) o The average perceived accuracy of true articles The wording of these questions appears below. Liking/sharing questions: After the relevant perceived accuracy question, the following questions appear below each headline for respondents not assigned to the pure control condition who did not answer \"never\" when asked how often they use Facebook: How likely would you be to \"like\" this story on Facebook? -Very likely (4) -Somewhat likely (3) -Not very likely (2) -Not at all likely (1) How likely would you be to share this story on Facebook? -Very likely (4) -Somewhat likely (3) -Not very likely (2) -Not at all likely (1) True article outcome measures: To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim that Trump questioned why the U.S. Civil War had to happen? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) \u2003 To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim that Trump ordered airstrikes in Syria after a chemical attack? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) \u2003 To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim that Neil Gorsuch was confirmed to the Supreme Court? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) Statistical analyses All results will be estimated as stacked question-level data using OLS with robust standard errors clustered by respondent and respondent and question fixed effects. These results will be verified for robustness using appropriate GLM estimators (see below). We exclude control variables in our experimental analyses (see below). Unless otherwise noted, all experimental treatment effects will be estimated as intent to treat effects. Main effects (including interactions between experimental conditions) Y = b0 + b1*nocorrection + b2*disputed + b3*false + b4*warning + b5*disputedXwarning + b6*falseXwarning where nocorrection=1 if respondents were assigned to the false headlines with no flags condition and 0 otherwise; disputed=1 if respondents were assigned to the false headlines with \"disputed\" flags condition and 0 otherwise; false=1 if respondents were assigned to the false headlines with \"false\" flags condition and 0 otherwise; and warning=1 if respondents were assigned to the condition with a warning about misleading articles before viewing headlines and 0 otherwise. The excluded category are pure controls. (For expositional clarity, we may estimate an equivalent model with pure controls excluded and the no correction / no warning condition as the baseline category and report this model in an appendix.) For H1-H3, the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of false headlines. Responses from respondents in the disputed and false conditions for false headlines that were randomly assigned not to receive a flag are excluded (see RQ3a below). We will test H1 by computing b4-b1 (the effect of warning exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition). We will test H2a by computing b2-b1 (the effect of \"disputed\" flag exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition). We will test H2b by computing b3-b1 (the effect of \"false\" flag exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition). We will test H2c by computing b3-b2 (the effect of \"false\" flag exposure versus \"disputed\" flag exposure). We will test H3 by estimating b5 (how effect of disputed flag changes given warning) and b6 (how effect of false flag changes given warning). We will also compute the relevant marginal effects using b2-b1+b5 (effect of disputed given warning) and b3-b1+b6 (effect of false given warning) and contrast these with the marginal effects absent warning (b2-b1 and b3-b1, respectively). For RQ1, the outcome measure will instead be respondents' reported average likelihood of \"liking\" an article or sharing it on Facebook among those who do not respond \"never\" when asked how often they use Facebook. Responses from respondents in the disputed and false conditions for false headlines that were randomly assigned not to receive a flag are again excluded. To explore RQ1, we will compute b4-b1 (the effect of warning exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition), b2-b1 (the effect of \"disputed\" flag exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition), and b3-b1 (the effect of \"false\" flag exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition). For RQ3a, the outcome measure will be the perceived accuracy of false articles that were not flagged as such. In this case, we will exclude flagged false articles for respondents in the disputed and false conditions as well as responses in which respondents who were randomly assigned to those conditions had not previously seen a disputed or false flag on a headline. We will then estimate the model above and compute b2-b1 (the effect of previous \"disputed\" flag exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition), and b3-b1 (the effect of previous \"false\" flag exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition). For RQ3b and R4, the outcome measure will instead be the perceived accuracy of true articles. To test for spillover effects, we will only include responses from the disputed and false conditions in which respondents assigned to those conditions had previously seen a disputed or false flag on a headline. We will then estimate the model above and compute b2-b1 (RQ3b: the effect of \"disputed\" flag exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition), b3-b1 (RQ3b: the effect of \"false\" flag exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition), and b4-b1 (RQ4: the effect of warning exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition). Interactions with directional preference measure(s) Y = b0 + b1*disputed + b2*false + b3*warning + b4*warningXdisputed + b5*warningXfalse + b6*trump_congenial + b7*disputedXtrump_congenial + b8*falseXtrump_congenial + b9*warningXtrump_congenial + b10*warningXdisputedXtrump_congenial + b11*warningXfalseXtrump_congenial where trump_congenial = 1 if headline is anti-Trump and respondent disapproves of Trump or headline is pro-Trump and respondent approves of Trump and trump_congenial = 0 if headline is anti-Trump and respondent approves of Trump or headline is pro-Trump and respondent disapproves of Trump. (For expositional clarity, these models will exclude pure independents and respondents assigned to the pure control condition \u2013 models including all respondents that include interactions between trump_congenial and trump_uncongenial and each experimental condition will be reported in an appendix.) We will test H4a by estimating b7 and H4b by estimating b8. We will also compute the relevant marginal effects of disputed (b1+b7) and false (b2+b8) and contrasting them with the relevant marginal effects for uncongenial headlines (b1 and b2, respectively). Similarly, we will test RQ2 by estimating b9 and contrasting the relevant marginal effect (b3+b9) with the relevant marginal effect for an uncongenial headline (b3). Notes:\u2028 -We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models to test the hypotheses of interest, including marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from the models including interaction terms, treatment effects by subgroup, and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. -In some cases, we may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity. If so, we will verify that we can reject the null of no difference in treatment effects in a more complex interactive model reported in an appendix when possible. -For interaction terms, scales, and moderators, if results are consistent using a median/tercile split or indicators rather than a continuous scale, we may present the latter in the main text for ease of exposition and include the continuous scale results in an appendix. We will also use tercile indicators to test whether a linearity assumption holds for any interactions with continuous moderators per Hainmueller et al (N.d.) and replace any continuous interactions in our models with them if it does not.\u2028 -Don't know responses will be considered missing data for the factual belief outcome measures. -We will compute and report summary statistics for our samples. We will also collect and may report response timing data as a proxy for respondent attention.\u2028 -The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity.\u2028 -Where applicable, regression results for binary dependent variables will be verified for robustness using probit. Regression results for individual ordered dependent variables will be verified for robustness using ordered probit.\u2028 -We may estimate the experimental models described above with a standard set of covariates (indicators for gender, age groups, non-white respondents, respondents with a four-year college degree, and scores on a standard political knowledge scale) if including those has a substantively important effect on the precision of our treatment effect estimates. In that case, however, both models will be reported."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "United States of America"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "2500-3500"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "STUDY00030281"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "4/21/17"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q27": {"extra": [], "value": "Qualtrics survey software platform"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e384e5afa39b7016f1dae5e", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/76fws/providers/osfstorage/5e384e5afa39b7016f1dae5e", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/76fws/providers/osfstorage/5e384e5afa39b7016f1dae5e", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/76fws/providers/osfstorage/5e384e5afa39b7016f1dae5e?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/76fws/providers/osfstorage/5e384e5afa39b7016f1dae5e"}, "attributes": {"etag": "c360a46075eada769de52196fe98e44487fa0108824ba70b888710ab6633c730", "kind": "file", "name": "20170508AA_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e384e5afa39b7016f1dae5e", "size": 111047, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "b872891ae2a5cfc9a49b7abdbbafa593", "sha256": "7646885bacd3d25ba0e2be141809041214c1bdd4715cacd6a266315a8a4ab41a"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 111047, "modified": "2020-02-03T16:46:18.650850+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "76fws", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20170508AA_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T16:46:18+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "76fws", "sha256": "7646885bacd3d25ba0e2be141809041214c1bdd4715cacd6a266315a8a4ab41a", "viewUrl": "/project/hnq23/files/osfstorage/5e384e6157427b01770c28cf/", "selectedFileName": "20170508AA_PAP.pdf"}, {"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e384e5dfa39b701711dafdc", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/76fws/providers/osfstorage/5e384e5dfa39b701711dafdc", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/76fws/providers/osfstorage/5e384e5dfa39b701711dafdc", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/76fws/providers/osfstorage/5e384e5dfa39b701711dafdc?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/76fws/providers/osfstorage/5e384e5dfa39b701711dafdc"}, "attributes": {"etag": "fe3154998a3abb753870c0fe25174747a13153c98c0cf4d24c38a9efea516cb4", "kind": "file", "name": "20170508AA_survey.pdf", "path": "/5e384e5dfa39b701711dafdc", "size": 1439847, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "55ab8dbc869e38f4740c98920e63d788", "sha256": "d0f5a34f1dc7afd3719cf64ec18fc3fe56b8e25020a0f24ec3137332b6374d1d"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 1439847, "modified": "2020-02-03T16:46:21.579042+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "76fws", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20170508AA_survey.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T16:46:21+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "76fws", "sha256": "d0f5a34f1dc7afd3719cf64ec18fc3fe56b8e25020a0f24ec3137332b6374d1d", "viewUrl": "/project/hnq23/files/osfstorage/5e384e6157427b01770c28cd/", "selectedFileName": "20170508AA_survey.pdf"}], "value": "20170508AA_PAP.pdf, 20170508AA_survey.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Belief in false news on social media", "q2": "Brendan Nyhan", "q3": "20170508AA", "q4": "05/08/2017 - 04:44", "q5": "Joint with Spencer Blair, Nathan Busam, Katherine Clayton, Samuel Forstner, John Glance, Guy Green, Anna Kawata, Akhila Kovvuri, Jonathan Martin, Evan Morgan, Morgan Sandhu, Rachel Sang, Rachel Scholz-Bright, Austin Welch, Andrew Wolff, and Amanda Zhou.", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to assignment of treatment", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "5/8/17", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "How can we most effectively counter false information in politics, especially online?

We will therefore conduct an experiment testing two approaches to countering belief in misinformation on social media \u2013 an advance warning, which Bolsen and Druckman (2015) find is most effective in scientific controversies, and a Facebook-style banner identifying claims that fact-checkers rate as inaccurate, which Pennycook et al. find is effective (2017). Our study makes several contributions. First, we extend the advance warning approach to the context of false headlines online. Second, Pennycook et al. did not explore whether Facebook's \"disputed\" banners were as effective at dissuading belief in false headlines as a direct refutation identifying a false article as such. This hypothesis conforms to our theoretical understanding of fact-checks. For instance, Fridkin et al. (2015) finds that fact-checks which directly and negatively question the truth of a negative political ad \"influence people's assessments of the accuracy, usefulness, and tone of negative political ads\" (145). Third, we consider whether the presence of an advance warning strengthens the effect of \"disputed\" or \"false\" flags. Finally, we consider the effects of these treatments on intended liking and sharing behavior on Facebook as well as possible spillovers to the perceived accuracy of both true articles and unflagged false articles.", "q16": "We plan to test the following four experimental hypotheses. Hypotheses: H1: Exposure to a general warning about misleading articles will reduce the perceived accuracy of false headlines (relative to a no-warning condition). H2a: The presence of a \"disputed\" flag under false headlines will reduce their perceived accuracy (relative to a no-flag condition). H2b: The presence of a \"false\" flag under false headlines will reduce their perceived accuracy (relative to a no-flag condition). H2c: The presence of a \"false\" flag under false headlines will reduce their perceived accuracy relative to when a \"disputed\" flag appears under them. H3: Exposure to a general warning about misleading articles will increase the negative effects of \"disputed\" or \"false\" flags on the perceived accuracy of false news headlines. H4a: The effect of a \"disputed\" flag on perceived accuracy (versus a headline with no flag) will be reduced for politically congenial information versus uncongenial information. H4b: The effect of a \"false\" flag on perceived accuracy (versus a headline with no flag) will be reduced for politically congenial information versus uncongenial information. We will plan to explore the following research questions, which raise important issues for which we do not have strong theoretical expectations: RQ1: Will a warning about misleading articles or the presence of a \"disputed\" or \"false\" flag on a headline affect the likelihood that people will say they would like or share it? RQ2: Will the effect of a warning about misleading articles on the perceived accuracy of subsequent headlines (versus no warning) vary between congenial information and uncongenial information? RQ3: Will the presence of \"disputed\" or \"false\" flags affect the perceived accuracy of unflagged false (RQ3a) or true (RQ3b) news (relative to a no-flag condition)? RQ4: Will a warning about misleading articles reduce the perceived accuracy of true information (relative to a no-warning condition)? [Note: H1-H4 and RQ1-RQ3a concern the effects of the experimental manipulations on the perceived accuracy and likelihood of \"liking\" or sharing false headlines/claims only. RQ3b-RQ4 consider the effects of the experimental manipulations on the perceived accuracy of true headlines/claims.]", "q17": "[All of the survey items and the experimental protocol are attached below.] Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants Participants will be United States residents age 18 and over recruited on the Amazon Mechanical Turk online marketplace. All Turkers are eligible to participate in this study who meet the specified qualifications and did not take part in an earlier pilot study. The sample size will be approximately 2500-3500 \u2013 data collection will continue until all funds allocated to the project are exhausted. Researchers have no role in selecting the participants after listing the project on Mechanical Turk. Randomization approach We will use a between-subjects design in which respondents are randomly assigned to one of seven conditions by the Qualtrics online survey platform (p=1/7 for each): -Pure control (no warnings or headlines shown) -Warning about false and misleading stories, no flags on false headlines -Warning about false and misleading stories, disputed flags on false headlines -Warning about false and misleading stories, false flags on false headlines -No warning about false and misleading stories, no flags on false headlines -No warning about false and misleading stories, disputed flags on false headlines -No warning about false and misleading stories, false flags on false headlines Data collection and blinding Data will be collected on the Qualtrics online survey platform. There may be some online discussion among Mechanical Turk workers about the details of our survey. This cannot be prevented and we hope that these participants preserve the integrity of the research. Primary and secondary outcome measures Our principal outcome measures are the perceived accuracy of the relevant set of false claims that were shown in headlines to respondents not assigned to the pure control condition (the set that is relevant varies by hypothesis; see below). The wording of these questions appears below. (Note: We will also conduct exploratory analysis of individual outcome questions.) To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim that Trump is bringing back the draft? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim that Trump plagiarized the Bee Movie for his inaugural speech? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim that Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz was blackmailed by the Kremlin? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim that a Donald Trump protester was paid $3,500 to protest Trump's rally? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim that Donald Trump sent his own plane to transport 200 stranded Marines? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim that an FBI agent suspected in Hillary Clinton's email leaks was found dead in an apparent murder-suicide? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) Secondary outcome measures: o The average likelihood of \"liking\" or sharing a false article on Facebook (among respondents who do not answer \"never\" when asked how often they use Facebook) o The average perceived accuracy of true articles The wording of these questions appears below. Liking/sharing questions: After the relevant perceived accuracy question, the following questions appear below each headline for respondents not assigned to the pure control condition who did not answer \"never\" when asked how often they use Facebook: How likely would you be to \"like\" this story on Facebook? -Very likely (4) -Somewhat likely (3) -Not very likely (2) -Not at all likely (1) How likely would you be to share this story on Facebook? -Very likely (4) -Somewhat likely (3) -Not very likely (2) -Not at all likely (1) True article outcome measures: To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim that Trump questioned why the U.S. Civil War had to happen? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) \u2003 To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim that Trump ordered airstrikes in Syria after a chemical attack? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) \u2003 To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim that Neil Gorsuch was confirmed to the Supreme Court? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) Statistical analyses All results will be estimated as stacked question-level data using OLS with robust standard errors clustered by respondent and respondent and question fixed effects. These results will be verified for robustness using appropriate GLM estimators (see below). We exclude control variables in our experimental analyses (see below). Unless otherwise noted, all experimental treatment effects will be estimated as intent to treat effects. Main effects (including interactions between experimental conditions) Y = b0 + b1*nocorrection + b2*disputed + b3*false + b4*warning + b5*disputedXwarning + b6*falseXwarning where nocorrection=1 if respondents were assigned to the false headlines with no flags condition and 0 otherwise; disputed=1 if respondents were assigned to the false headlines with \"disputed\" flags condition and 0 otherwise; false=1 if respondents were assigned to the false headlines with \"false\" flags condition and 0 otherwise; and warning=1 if respondents were assigned to the condition with a warning about misleading articles before viewing headlines and 0 otherwise. The excluded category are pure controls. (For expositional clarity, we may estimate an equivalent model with pure controls excluded and the no correction / no warning condition as the baseline category and report this model in an appendix.) For H1-H3, the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of false headlines. Responses from respondents in the disputed and false conditions for false headlines that were randomly assigned not to receive a flag are excluded (see RQ3a below). We will test H1 by computing b4-b1 (the effect of warning exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition). We will test H2a by computing b2-b1 (the effect of \"disputed\" flag exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition). We will test H2b by computing b3-b1 (the effect of \"false\" flag exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition). We will test H2c by computing b3-b2 (the effect of \"false\" flag exposure versus \"disputed\" flag exposure). We will test H3 by estimating b5 (how effect of disputed flag changes given warning) and b6 (how effect of false flag changes given warning). We will also compute the relevant marginal effects using b2-b1+b5 (effect of disputed given warning) and b3-b1+b6 (effect of false given warning) and contrast these with the marginal effects absent warning (b2-b1 and b3-b1, respectively). For RQ1, the outcome measure will instead be respondents' reported average likelihood of \"liking\" an article or sharing it on Facebook among those who do not respond \"never\" when asked how often they use Facebook. Responses from respondents in the disputed and false conditions for false headlines that were randomly assigned not to receive a flag are again excluded. To explore RQ1, we will compute b4-b1 (the effect of warning exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition), b2-b1 (the effect of \"disputed\" flag exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition), and b3-b1 (the effect of \"false\" flag exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition). For RQ3a, the outcome measure will be the perceived accuracy of false articles that were not flagged as such. In this case, we will exclude flagged false articles for respondents in the disputed and false conditions as well as responses in which respondents who were randomly assigned to those conditions had not previously seen a disputed or false flag on a headline. We will then estimate the model above and compute b2-b1 (the effect of previous \"disputed\" flag exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition), and b3-b1 (the effect of previous \"false\" flag exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition). For RQ3b and R4, the outcome measure will instead be the perceived accuracy of true articles. To test for spillover effects, we will only include responses from the disputed and false conditions in which respondents assigned to those conditions had previously seen a disputed or false flag on a headline. We will then estimate the model above and compute b2-b1 (RQ3b: the effect of \"disputed\" flag exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition), b3-b1 (RQ3b: the effect of \"false\" flag exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition), and b4-b1 (RQ4: the effect of warning exposure versus the headlines/no warnings condition). Interactions with directional preference measure(s) Y = b0 + b1*disputed + b2*false + b3*warning + b4*warningXdisputed + b5*warningXfalse + b6*trump_congenial + b7*disputedXtrump_congenial + b8*falseXtrump_congenial + b9*warningXtrump_congenial + b10*warningXdisputedXtrump_congenial + b11*warningXfalseXtrump_congenial where trump_congenial = 1 if headline is anti-Trump and respondent disapproves of Trump or headline is pro-Trump and respondent approves of Trump and trump_congenial = 0 if headline is anti-Trump and respondent approves of Trump or headline is pro-Trump and respondent disapproves of Trump. (For expositional clarity, these models will exclude pure independents and respondents assigned to the pure control condition \u2013 models including all respondents that include interactions between trump_congenial and trump_uncongenial and each experimental condition will be reported in an appendix.) We will test H4a by estimating b7 and H4b by estimating b8. We will also compute the relevant marginal effects of disputed (b1+b7) and false (b2+b8) and contrasting them with the relevant marginal effects for uncongenial headlines (b1 and b2, respectively). Similarly, we will test RQ2 by estimating b9 and contrasting the relevant marginal effect (b3+b9) with the relevant marginal effect for an uncongenial headline (b3). Notes:\u2028 -We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models to test the hypotheses of interest, including marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from the models including interaction terms, treatment effects by subgroup, and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. -In some cases, we may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity. If so, we will verify that we can reject the null of no difference in treatment effects in a more complex interactive model reported in an appendix when possible. -For interaction terms, scales, and moderators, if results are consistent using a median/tercile split or indicators rather than a continuous scale, we may present the latter in the main text for ease of exposition and include the continuous scale results in an appendix. We will also use tercile indicators to test whether a linearity assumption holds for any interactions with continuous moderators per Hainmueller et al (N.d.) and replace any continuous interactions in our models with them if it does not.\u2028 -Don't know responses will be considered missing data for the factual belief outcome measures. -We will compute and report summary statistics for our samples. We will also collect and may report response timing data as a proxy for respondent attention.\u2028 -The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity.\u2028 -Where applicable, regression results for binary dependent variables will be verified for robustness using probit. Regression results for individual ordered dependent variables will be verified for robustness using ordered probit.\u2028 -We may estimate the experimental models described above with a standard set of covariates (indicators for gender, age groups, non-white respondents, respondents with a four-year college degree, and scores on a standard political knowledge scale) if including those has a substantively important effect on the precision of our treatment effect estimates. In that case, however, both models will be reported.", "q18": "United States of America", "q19": "2500-3500", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "STUDY00030281", "q25": "4/21/17",

We partner with one of the main parties to scientifically evaluate their online advertisement campaign using a cluster randomized controlled trial. In particular, residents of Schleswig-Holstein will be exposed to an extended advertisement campaign (a ``customer journey'') that includes a banner advertisements displayed via Facebook and Google adwords on several days leading up to the election. The campaign uses a factorial design and differs along four salient dimensions, which are crossed. In the authoritative route (Treat A), ads adopt an authoritative tone that specifically states what political choices are correct. Here, ads focusing on education, for instance, read ``More time for education!'' In the collaborative route (Treat C), ads adopt an inclusive tone that appeal to collective action. Here, ads focusing on education, for instance, read ``Let us make more time for education.'' In the targeted route (Treat T), ads are targeted on the basis of four socially salient milieus, to which all postal districts are assigned.

A large literature characterizes and estimates the welfare gains from trade, and identifies the mechanisms through which trade affects workers, firms and the aggregate economy. Some policymakers believe that international trade has effects beyond changing economic outcomes such as prices, expenditures, wages, employment and productivity. Trade may change individuals\u2019 views and attitudes towards other countries and cultures. For example, individuals who have directly benefited from international trade by selling their production abroad may hold more cosmopolitan views and be more favorable towards the values of their buyers. Of course, participation in international trade and an individual\u2019s views and attitudes may simply be correlated. It is hard to estimate the causal impact of trade on views and attitudes because of the difficulty of finding a convincing counterfactual since substantial evidence suggests that exporters differ from non-exporters. It is also difficult to estimate this relationship because one needs to complement trade data with surveys on individual attitudes. We hope to make progress on these issues and provide the first rigorous evidence on how exposure to trade with Western Democracies affects participants\u2019 views and attitudes. We do this by utilizing the randomized allocation of export orders to rug-making firms in Fowa, Egypt, as described in Atkin, Khandelwal and Osman (forthcoming). In our sample of 219 rug-making firms, 87% had never knowingly produced a product for export markets at baseline. We randomized which firms received an initial export order from buyers located in OECD countries (treatment firms), primarily Germany and the US; and which firms did not (control firms). All orders passed through a local intermediary, and future orders were left to the discretion of the intermediary and foreign buyers. Takeup firms successfully filled their trial orders, and continue to obtain and fill subsequent export orders to these same markets. By comparing the outcomes of the treatment group to the control group we can estimate the causal impact of exporting. More than five years after the initial randomization, and three years after our last follow up survey, we re-surveyed producers to collect information on their attitudes and world views. We developed a survey that focused on issues of economic equality, gender equality, information sources and international trade.

We then extracted only those individuals who included phone numbers in their voter data. We identified which numbers were likely cell phone numbers by using a number validation service. This left us with about 1,888 individuals who had both cell phone numbers and requested Spanish language materials. We selected another 180 to assign to our treatment group, while the other 1,708 were left to the control group. Intervention The outreach efforts include 18 research assistants who are Spanish-speaking. Each assistant received a random set of 10 individuals selected into the treatment group. Each assistant was instructed to reach out to each individual via text messaging in Spanish. These messages were designed to mobilize these individuals to vote in the November 6th 2018 elections.

Data and Outcome Measures Voter turnout will be assessed by obtaining updated voter files and calculating turnout rates for the randomly assigned treatment and control groups. Method for Estimating Average Treatment Effects We will report 95% confidence intervals for the average treatment effect, using a margin of error equal to the estimated standard error multiplied by the appropriate critical value from the t-distribution. This estimate will be generated by regressing turnout on treatment assignment, using the covariates listed below to generate more precise estimates. To assess robustness, we will also report a simple regression result with only block and treatment indicator, omitting prior turnout statistics.

Those who have behaved in socially undesirable ways are more likely to censor their responses by refusing to answer questions outright or providing false but socially desirable responses (Kuran 1997, Tourangeau, Rips, and Rasinski 2000), which can result in biased estimates derived from public opinion surveys. In the Americas, non-response is especially acute with respect to retrospective vote reports. Norms of ballot secrecy have taken root across the region, leading voters to refuse to answer standard vote questions at high rates, often insisting, \u201cmi voto es secreto\u201d \u2013 my vote is secret. Indeed, the vote choice question is regularly the most sensitive item in cross-national surveys in the region. In 2014, for example, more than 20% of Mexicans who reported participating in a recent presidential election refused to reveal their vote choice in the AmericasBarometer survey, higher than non-response to other known sensitive items in that study, such as income. This study uses audio tools developed to encourage response to sensitive questions (e.g., about drug use) and applies them to the vote choice question. We piloted a similar study in Nicaragua in 2017; the current study includes substantial changes to the protocol in order to test the mechanisms we argue are operating and, as well, tests the audio tools in a significantly more liberal political context."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "The main outcome of interest is non-response to the vote choice question (don\u2019t know+refusal to answer). Hypotheses to be tested include: H1: Non-response to the vote choice question will be lower in conditions that employ audio technology (conditions 3-6) compared to the control condition (1). H1a: Non-response will be lower in condition 4 (the confidentiality reminder administered via audio) rather than condition 2 (where the confidentiality reminder is administered via enumerator) because of the use of novel audio technology. H2: Non-response to the vote choice question will be lower in conditions that employ either confidentiality reminders (2, 5, 6) and conditions that employ an anonymity guarantee (4, 6) compared to the control condition (1). H3: Among the treatments administered via audio (3-6), non-response to the vote choice question will be lowest in condition 6 (audio, with a confidentiality reminder and anonymity guarantee) and the highest in condition 3 (audio, with no reminders). H3a: We do not have strong expectations about the differences between conditions 3 (confidentiality reminder) and 4 (anonymity guarantee); we weakly expect that condition 4 will reduce non-response to a greater extent than condition 3 since the treatment calls for the enumerator to show the respondent a blank screen to demonstrate that the enumerator will not know what the respondent\u2019s answer is (rather than simply verbally reminding them).* A secondary outcome of interest is how closely results resemble official electoral returns across conditions (DV: candidate selection). We expect the following: H4: Responses will most closely match official election outcomes in the audio conditions, and especially in condition 6 (audio, with a confidentiality reminder and anonymity guarantee). Additionally, we will test a series of non-rival hypotheses about the mechanisms that potentially account for observed treatment effects: First DV: reported beliefs about the anonymity of the vote choice question (asked at end of survey) H1M (Anonymity Mechanism): Reported beliefs about response anonymity for the vote question will be significantly higher in the audio conditions (3-6) than in the reminder (2) and control (1) conditions. Second DV: Reported enjoyment of item administered by audio. NOTE: non-voters and a randomly selected subset of those assigned to non-audio conditions will receive an item about soccer later in the survey using the same audio technology. H2M (Novelty Mechanism): On average, respondents will report that the audio treatment was more engaging compared to the survey as a whole. H2MA (Novelty Mechanism): There will be no significant differences in reported enjoyment of the audio item by the question administered via audio. Third DV: Engagement in the survey - non-response and variation in response for 7-10 items following the vote choice item. H3M (Novelty Mechanism): Engagement in the survey will increase at similar rates following audio treatments, regardless of the content of the audio. DV: vote choice. Key moderating variable is final election results, gathered from electoral authorities. H4M (Contextual Mechanism): In electoral districts where the margin of victory between first and second place candidates was very high, respondents in the audio conditions (3-6) will be more likely to report voting for someone other than the first-place candidate than those in the verbal reminder (2) and control (1) conditions. H5M (Contextual Mechanism): In electoral districts where the margin of victory between first and second place candidates was very high, those in the verbal reminder (2) condition will be more likely to report voting for the first-place candidate than those in the control (1) condition.

Those who have behaved in socially undesirable ways are more likely to censor their responses by refusing to answer questions outright or providing false but socially desirable responses (Kuran 1997, Tourangeau, Rips, and Rasinski 2000), which can result in biased estimates derived from public opinion surveys. In the Americas, non-response is especially acute with respect to retrospective vote reports. Norms of ballot secrecy have taken root across the region, leading voters to refuse to answer standard vote questions at high rates, often insisting, \u201cmi voto es secreto\u201d \u2013 my vote is secret. Indeed, the vote choice question is regularly the most sensitive item in cross-national surveys in the region. In 2014, for example, more than 20% of Mexicans who reported participating in a recent presidential election refused to reveal their vote choice in the AmericasBarometer survey, higher than non-response to other known sensitive items in that study, such as income. This study uses audio tools developed to encourage response to sensitive questions (e.g., about drug use) and applies them to the vote choice question. We piloted a similar study in Nicaragua in 2017; the current study includes substantial changes to the protocol in order to test the mechanisms we argue are operating and, as well, tests the audio tools in a significantly more liberal political context.", "q16": "The main outcome of interest is non-response to the vote choice question (don\u2019t know+refusal to answer). Hypotheses to be tested include: H1: Non-response to the vote choice question will be lower in conditions that employ audio technology (conditions 3-6) compared to the control condition (1). H1a: Non-response will be lower in condition 4 (the confidentiality reminder administered via audio) rather than condition 2 (where the confidentiality reminder is administered via enumerator) because of the use of novel audio technology. H2: Non-response to the vote choice question will be lower in conditions that employ either confidentiality reminders (2, 5, 6) and conditions that employ an anonymity guarantee (4, 6) compared to the control condition (1). H3: Among the treatments administered via audio (3-6), non-response to the vote choice question will be lowest in condition 6 (audio, with a confidentiality reminder and anonymity guarantee) and the highest in condition 3 (audio, with no reminders). H3a: We do not have strong expectations about the differences between conditions 3 (confidentiality reminder) and 4 (anonymity guarantee); we weakly expect that condition 4 will reduce non-response to a greater extent than condition 3 since the treatment calls for the enumerator to show the respondent a blank screen to demonstrate that the enumerator will not know what the respondent\u2019s answer is (rather than simply verbally reminding them).* A secondary outcome of interest is how closely results resemble official electoral returns across conditions (DV: candidate selection). We expect the following: H4: Responses will most closely match official election outcomes in the audio conditions, and especially in condition 6 (audio, with a confidentiality reminder and anonymity guarantee). Additionally, we will test a series of non-rival hypotheses about the mechanisms that potentially account for observed treatment effects: First DV: reported beliefs about the anonymity of the vote choice question (asked at end of survey) H1M (Anonymity Mechanism): Reported beliefs about response anonymity for the vote question will be significantly higher in the audio conditions (3-6) than in the reminder (2) and control (1) conditions. Second DV: Reported enjoyment of item administered by audio. NOTE: non-voters and a randomly selected subset of those assigned to non-audio conditions will receive an item about soccer later in the survey using the same audio technology. H2M (Novelty Mechanism): On average, respondents will report that the audio treatment was more engaging compared to the survey as a whole. H2MA (Novelty Mechanism): There will be no significant differences in reported enjoyment of the audio item by the question administered via audio. Third DV: Engagement in the survey - non-response and variation in response for 7-10 items following the vote choice item. H3M (Novelty Mechanism): Engagement in the survey will increase at similar rates following audio treatments, regardless of the content of the audio. DV: vote choice. Key moderating variable is final election results, gathered from electoral authorities. H4M (Contextual Mechanism): In electoral districts where the margin of victory between first and second place candidates was very high, respondents in the audio conditions (3-6) will be more likely to report voting for someone other than the first-place candidate than those in the verbal reminder (2) and control (1) conditions. H5M (Contextual Mechanism): In electoral districts where the margin of victory between first and second place candidates was very high, those in the verbal reminder (2) condition will be more likely to report voting for the first-place candidate than those in the control (1) condition. DV: reported beliefs about response anonymity H6M (Anonymity + Contextual Mechanisms): In electoral districts where the margin of victory between first and second place candidates was very high, those in the verbal reminder (2) condition will be less likely to believe their responses to the vote question are confidential than those in the control (1) and audio (3-6) conditions. * Our ability to test the differences between the audio conditions is limited by the amount of power required; we expect fairly small differences between these conditions, and due to the cell size of each treatment (which is anticipated to be", "q17": "We will use a series of econometric tests for each hypothesis.
