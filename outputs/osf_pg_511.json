Detailed information about the subprojects and the respective analysis plans can be found in separate preregistrations. \n\nAt the time of submission, data acquisition has started. 130 full datasets have been collected so far. The data have not been analyzed before preregistration and were only accessed for sanity checks that did not address any of the research questions.\n\n1. SUMMARY\nPrevious research into the neurocognitive profiles of obesity and binge eating disorder (BED) has revealed difficulties with working memory and adaptive decision-making in both conditions [e.g. 1\u20136]. However, the overlapping and differential aspects of these neurocognitive profiles have not been systematically studied so far. For example, it is unclear whether obese individuals with and without BED have distinctive alterations regarding the maintenance and updating aspects of working memory. Similarly, although there is some indication that both BED patients\u2019 and obese individuals\u2019 decision making is differentially affected depending on a task\u2019s motivational context (obtain rewards vs to avoid punishments) [1,7], this has not consistently been taken into account. Further, it is unclear at what point during development putative differences emerge, whether neurocognitive profiles change as symptom expression changes, and whether initial differences could be predictive of future clinical outcomes. To address these gaps in the literature, we study a cohort of obese adolescents and adults with and without BED in comparison with age- and gender-matched normal-weight controls. We investigate several facets of decision-making in different motivational contexts as well as working memory with and without functional MRI, at two time points spaced by approximately 6 months. Moreover, we assess neuropsychological measures, self reported eating behaviour, mood, and personality. Finally, because alterations in dopaminergic signalling have previously been implicated in all cognitive constructs studied [8\u201310] as well as BED [11] and obesity e.g. [12], we further probe whether interindividual and intergroup differences in our neurocognitive measures are associated with genetic and physiological proxies of prefrontal and striatal dopamine turnover.\n\n2. GENERAL HYPOTHESES\nI. Healthy weight and obese individuals with and without binge eating disorder will differ in their neurocognitive characteristics\nII. Decision-making differences will be more pronounced in situations where participants have to avoid losses\nIII. Differences begin to emerge in adolescence but become more pronounced with increasing chronicity of obesity and BED in adulthood\nIV. Neurocognitive profiles change as symptom expression changes over time\nV. Interindividual and intergroup differences will be associated with differences in proxies of dopamine transmission \n\n3.

Detailed information about the subprojects and the respective analysis plans can be found in separate preregistrations. \n\nAt the time of submission, data acquisition has started. 130 full datasets have been collected so far. The data have not been analyzed before preregistration and were only accessed for sanity checks that did not address any of the research questions.\n\n1. SUMMARY\nPrevious research into the neurocognitive profiles of obesity and binge eating disorder (BED) has revealed difficulties with working memory and adaptive decision-making in both conditions [e.g. 1\u20136]. However, the overlapping and differential aspects of these neurocognitive profiles have not been systematically studied so far. For example, it is unclear whether obese individuals with and without BED have distinctive alterations regarding the maintenance and updating aspects of working memory. Similarly, although there is some indication that both BED patients\u2019 and obese individuals\u2019 decision making is differentially affected depending on a task\u2019s motivational context (obtain rewards vs to avoid punishments) [1,7], this has not consistently been taken into account. Further, it is unclear at what point during development putative differences emerge, whether neurocognitive profiles change as symptom expression changes, and whether initial differences could be predictive of future clinical outcomes. To address these gaps in the literature, we study a cohort of obese adolescents and adults with and without BED in comparison with age- and gender-matched normal-weight controls. We investigate several facets of decision-making in different motivational contexts as well as working memory with and without functional MRI, at two time points spaced by approximately 6 months. Moreover, we assess neuropsychological measures, self reported eating behaviour, mood, and personality. Finally, because alterations in dopaminergic signalling have previously been implicated in all cognitive constructs studied [8\u201310] as well as BED [11] and obesity e.g. [12], we further probe whether interindividual and intergroup differences in our neurocognitive measures are associated with genetic and physiological proxies of prefrontal and striatal dopamine turnover.\n\n2. GENERAL HYPOTHESES\nI. Healthy weight and obese individuals with and without binge eating disorder will differ in their neurocognitive characteristics\nII. Decision-making differences will be more pronounced in situations where participants have to avoid losses\nIII. Differences begin to emerge in adolescence but become more pronounced with increasing chronicity of obesity and BED in adulthood\nIV. Neurocognitive profiles change as symptom expression changes over time\nV. Interindividual and intergroup differences will be associated with differences in proxies of dopamine transmission \n\n3.

Data collection started at 12th of December and finished at the 18th of December 2019. Data were hold back by my supervisor until disclosure of the analysis in the preregistration.\n\nThe project aims to examine whether the effect, the expressive intensity used by a speaker to state his opinion has on subjects\u2019 attitude change, evaluations of trustworthiness of the speaker and credibility of the message, varies depending on perceived source competency. \n\nWhile 11 000 scientists warn of the consequences of the climate change, politicians all over the world still doubt its mere existence. How is it possible that some people are persuasive even when their message contradicts profound scientific findings? What makes up persuasion? \t\t\t\t\t\t\nOne of the factors that has been regarded as important concerning persuasive effects is language intensity. Language intensity can be defined as \u201cthe quality of language which indicate[s] the degree to which the speaker\u2019s attitude toward a concept deviates from neutrality\u201d (Bowers, 1963, p. 345). It\u2019s not quite clear which effect language intensity has on persuasion. While Buller et al. (2000) could find that high intense language produced more compliance with sun protection recommendations than low intense language, Bowers (1963) could find quite the opposite effect. In his study, low intensity messages were even more convincing than high intensity messages. He drew the conclusion that the effect of language intensity on persuasion should be researched in combination with other factors (Bowers, 1963). This is also postulated by the Language Expectancy Theory, which claims that persuasion is a result of interaction between message strategies (e.g. language intensity) and expectations of the person being persuaded. Expectations are defined as \u201ca function of cultural values and societal standards or ideals for competent communication\u201d (Buller et al., 2000, p. 104). The theory predicts that a message strategy that violates expectations in a positive way will be persuasive. If, for example, a person low in competency, who would normally be expected to use intensive language, uses a very formal and moderate language style he violates expectations in a positive way (Clementson, Pascual-Ferr\u00e1 &amp; Betty, 2014). Hamilton, Hunter and Burgoon (1990) could support these theoretical assumptions with empirical evidence. They confronted university students from Hawaii with messages concerning the legalization of heroin. In this experiment, highly credible sources were more persuasive when using intense language, while low credible sources were less persuasive when using intense language. \nUnfortunately, not all evidence is pointing towards the predictions of Language Expectancy theory. Clementson et al. (2014) could report that presidential candidates, using a low-intensity language were perceived as more credible than candidates using high-intensity language. This result, however, must not necessarily be interpreted as the refutation of Language Expectancy theory. In our eyes, it throws light on the problematic operationalization of language intensity. Clementson et al. (2014) for example used a very hostile and aggressive stimulus material that also differed from the content of the stimulus material in the low-intensity language condition. It is likely that this unwanted aggressiveness in the language had a negative effect on perceived credibility, which made candidates that used low-intensity language look more credible (K\u00f6nig and Jucks, 2019). \nInstead of varying language intensity, we want to extent language intensity theory to nonverbal and paraverbal communication, since this operationalization allows us to use content consistent stimulus material which is not confounded by other variables such as aggression. Although the markers of language intensity are directness towards the audience and emotionalism of word choice (Hamilton and Hunter, 1998) the predictions of the theory should also extend to other communication markers, which show how far a communicator\u2019s attitude differs from neutrality.  In our experiment we will therefore vary the expressive intensity by varying vocal dynamics (volume, accentuation, intonation), gestures and facial expression over the course of our experimental conditions. Our theoretical hypothesis are formulated on the predictions of language expectancy theory. \n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypothesis 1: Being introduced as competent, in comparison to being introduced as incompetent, increases the perceived trustworthiness of a person stating its opinion, the perceived credibility of his message and the probability that attitude change occurs. \n\nHypothesis 2: The effect of expressive intensity on attitude change, trustworthiness and credibility ratings depends on the source\u2019s competence. \n\nHypothesis 2a: Being introduced as competent in combination with high expressive intensity results in higher trustworthiness and credibility ratings and a higher probability that attitude change occurs compared to a low expressive intensity. \n\nHypothesis 2b: Being introduced as incompetent in combination with high expressive intensity results in lower trustworthiness and credibility ratings and a lower probability that attitude change occurs compared to a low expressive intensity. \n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

This is also postulated by the Language Expectancy Theory, which claims that persuasion is a result of interaction between message strategies (e.g. language intensity) and expectations of the person being persuaded. Expectations are defined as \u201ca function of cultural values and societal standards or ideals for competent communication\u201d (Buller et al., 2000, p. 104). The theory predicts that a message strategy that violates expectations in a positive way will be persuasive. If, for example, a person low in competency, who would normally be expected to use intensive language, uses a very formal and moderate language style he violates expectations in a positive way (Clementson, Pascual-Ferr\u00e1 &amp; Betty, 2014). Hamilton, Hunter and Burgoon (1990) could support these theoretical assumptions with empirical evidence. They confronted university students from Hawaii with messages concerning the legalization of heroin. In this experiment, highly credible sources were more persuasive when using intense language, while low credible sources were less persuasive when using intense language. \nUnfortunately, not all evidence is pointing towards the predictions of Language Expectancy theory. Clementson et al. (2014) could report that presidential candidates, using a low-intensity language were perceived as more credible than candidates using high-intensity language. This result, however, must not necessarily be interpreted as the refutation of Language Expectancy theory. In our eyes, it throws light on the problematic operationalization of language intensity. Clementson et al. (2014) for example used a very hostile and aggressive stimulus material that also differed from the content of the stimulus material in the low-intensity language condition. It is likely that this unwanted aggressiveness in the language had a negative effect on perceived credibility, which made candidates that used low-intensity language look more credible (K\u00f6nig and Jucks, 2019). \nInstead of varying language intensity, we want to extent language intensity theory to nonverbal and paraverbal communication, since this operationalization allows us to use content consistent stimulus material which is not confounded by other variables such as aggression. Although the markers of language intensity are directness towards the audience and emotionalism of word choice (Hamilton and Hunter, 1998) the predictions of the theory should also extend to other communication markers, which show how far a communicator\u2019s attitude differs from neutrality.  In our experiment we will therefore vary the expressive intensity by varying vocal dynamics (volume, accentuation, intonation), gestures and facial expression over the course of our experimental conditions. Our theoretical hypothesis are formulated on the predictions of language expectancy theory. \n", "q4": "Hypothesis 1: Being introduced as competent, in comparison to being introduced as incompetent, increases the perceived trustworthiness of a person stating its opinion, the perceived credibility of his message and the probability that attitude change occurs. \n\nHypothesis 2: The effect of expressive intensity on attitude change, trustworthiness and credibility ratings depends on the source\u2019s competence. \n\nHypothesis 2a: Being introduced as competent in combination with high expressive intensity results in higher trustworthiness and credibility ratings and a higher probability that attitude change occurs compared to a low expressive intensity. \n\nHypothesis 2b: Being introduced as incompetent in combination with high expressive intensity results in lower trustworthiness and credibility ratings and a lower probability that attitude change occurs compared to a low expressive intensity. \n", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

First, we will measure the observer\u2019s behavioral and physiological response when being exposed to pain her- or himself. Second, we will perform the actual pain observation paradigm. ECG and EDA will be recorded from target and observer in all conditions. \n\nPain stimulation protocol: \nThe protocol for the delivery of the pain stimuli follows closely the well-established empathy for pain paradigm as described in R\u00fctgen et al., (2015). Before the actual procedure, the intensity of the stimulation will be calibrated to the subjective pain experience of the participant. To this end, stimulations with different intensities will be presented and the participant will rate each on a Likert scale from 1 (\u201cclearly perceivable but not painful\u201d) to 7 (\u201cunbearably painful\u201d). In the following experiment, a range of stimulation intensities rated between 1 and 2 (\"unpleasant\") will be used for the non-painful trials and a range of stimulation intensities rated between 5 (\"very painful\") and 6 (\"extremely painful\") will be used for the painful trials. Each trial will consist of an auditory cue indicating the intensity of the following stimulation (tone 1 -&gt; no pain, tone 2 -&gt; pain). After a waiting phase of 1000 ms, the electrical stimulation will be delivered for 500 ms (consisting of 20 electrical  pulses of 2 ms duration with a 24.2 ms break after each pulse). Afterwards, there will be a variable interstimulus interval of 7500-9000 ms, followed in a third of the trials by the rating of the stimulus (12 s, onset indicated by a short beep). In conditions where the participants him- or herself receives the electric stimulation, the rating consists of one question addressing the perceived pain intensity (on a visual analogue scale from \"not painful at all\" to \"extremely painful\"). In conditions where the participant observes the other receiving the electric stimulation, the question on pain intensity refers to the inferred pain intensity felt by the other, and another question is added that refers to one\u2019s own unpleasantness while watching the stimulation (on a Likert scale from \"not unpleasant at all\" to \"extremely unpleasant\"). Each condition will consist of 80 trials (40 painful and 40 non-painful trials). The order of the stimuli will be randomized, but with no more than 4 stimulations of the same intensity in a row, and with the same order for all participants. One pain stimulation condition will take approximately 20  minutes. Stimulation will be delivered with a Digitimer DS5 Isolated Bipolar Constant Current Stimulator (Digitimer Clinical and Biomedical Research Instruments) via a   bar electrode attached to the back of the right hand. This hand will always be placed flat on the table in front of the participant. A tablet will be placed at the front left of the participant on the table to display the evaluation questions and record participants button presses with the left hand.\n\n\nPain observation paradigm (\u201cObservers\u201d and \u201cTargets\u201d): \nIn this part of the experiment, the \u201cobservers\u201d will observe one of the above-mentioned targets in the two different conditions (\u201cPresence\u201d and \u201cOnline\u201d). The observer will see the same target for each condition. The matching of targets and observers will be carried out in a way that each target is observed by five observers (and hence has to come to the laboratory 5 times in total). The order of the two conditions will be permutated between observers to control for possible order effects. During the complete experiment, both target and observer will be videotaped. These videos will be presented to an independent group of participants to assess similarities and differences of the target\u2019s behavior between the conditions and to record possible facial expressions of the observer in response to the painful stimulation of the target. \nPrior to watching the target in the different conditions, the same procedure as for the targets to adjust the intensity of the electric shocks will be conducted for the observers. Then observers will undergo the pain stimulation procedure themselves. This is done to assess the behavioral and physiological responses during own pain experience to be able to compare this to the activity during the observation of pain in others and to make it easier for the observer to imagine what the stimulation feels like for the target. To save time, the pain stimulation of the observer will be shorter than the other conditions and consist of only 12 trials. \n\nPresence condition: \nIn the presence condition, observers will sit in front of the target at a table. The target will then undergo the pain stimulation protocol. In a third of the trials, observer and target will answer the rating questions. Observers are instructed to look at the target\u2019s right hand during the whole task apart from when they answer the rating questions. The background of the target will be set up in the same way as in the Online condition (a blue cloth).\n\nOnline condition: \nIn the Online condition, the observer will sit in front of a screen and a camera. The target will sit in a separate room, also in front of a camera and a screen. The camera recording the target will be connected to the screen in front of the observer and vice versa, such that target and observer can see each other in real time. The observer will watch the target undergoing the pain stimulation again, also instructed to look at the right hand of the target during the whole video apart from when answering the rating questions.
