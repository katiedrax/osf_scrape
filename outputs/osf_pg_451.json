available carbohydrate ratio on postprandial glucose and insulin responses. \n\nSearches: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be searched using appropriate search terms supplemented by manual searches of references of included studies. \n\nParticipants/population: Participants of all health backgrounds will be included. \n\nIntervention(s), exposure(s): Any dose of oat beta-glucan or oat bran consumed with a carbohydrate containing-meal.\n\nComparator(s)/control: Carbohydrate-containing meal without the addition of oat beta-glucan or oat bran. \n\nTypes of studies included: Randomized, controlled, acute feeding, crossover trials \n\nMain outcome(s): Incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for blood glucose, iAUC insulin, peak rise of glucose, peak rise of insulin \n\nData extraction (selection and coding): Two investigators will independently extract relevant data. All disagreements will be resolved by consensus. Mean and standard errors (SEs) will be extracted for all outcomes.

Linear and non-linear dose response analyses will be conducted by meta-regression. Ratio of means will be pooled using the generic inverse variance method with random-effects models. Random-effects models will be used even in the absence of statistically significant between-study heterogeneity, as they yield more conservative summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity. Fixed-effects models will only be used where there are less than 5 included trial comparisons. Heterogeneity will be tested (Cochran Q statistic) and quantified (I\u00b2 statistic). To explore sources of heterogeneity, the investigators will conduct sensitivity analyses, in which each study is systematically removed.
