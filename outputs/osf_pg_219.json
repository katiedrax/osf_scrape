In these experiments, the benefit of prior knowledge was apparent immediately\u2014perhaps facilitated by use of explicit word learning strategies\u2014but weakened over consolidation. In the present study, we ask whether this same pattern holds when novel words are encountered incidentally when listening to stories. \n\nTwo experiments have already been completed to address this question (see https://osf.io/stx6q/). An experiment with children showed that children were not influenced by word neighbours when recalling novel words learned from stories, as measured by a stem completion task. In a form recognition task, they showed poorer performance for novel words that had phonological neighbours, suggesting that prior knowledge even interfered with new learning. In an experiment with adults however, we saw no such interference, and adults continued to benefit from phonological neighbours in recalling the pseudowords as they had done in explicit learning tasks.\n\nHowever, differences in the experimental set-up make it challenging to interpret the differences between children and adults. First, adults were presented with the written stories to read along with the spoken stories, whereas children were not exposed to any orthography. This additional support enabled participants to revisit the novel words during the story, against the intended implicit nature of learning. Second, children sat separate 2-AFC recognition tasks to assess knowledge of the word-form and picture-form mapping independently, and the word-form recognition task was sensitive to neighbor effects. However, performance cannot be directly compared with adults because adults sat a combined 4-AFC version assessing form and picture knowledge simultaneously. Third, children provided spoken word responses, whereas adults provided typed responses. The present aim is to ameliorate these differences in a second adult study, using identical encoding and test formats to the original child experiment. \n\nOur primary research questions are as follows: \n1) Do adults show benefits from offline consolidation after learning novel words from spoken stories? \n2) Do adults show benefits of local prior knowledge (i.e., from word neighbours) when learning novel words from spoken stories?\n3) Is the time course of local prior knowledge benefits different when adults learn novel words from spoken stories, compared to previous studies using explicit teaching paradigms (James et al., 2019)? \n4) Are benefits of local prior knowledge related to adults\u2019 existing expressive vocabulary knowledge? \n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "1) Memory for the novel words will be different after opportunities for consolidation at the day and week follow-up tests compared to when tested immediately after learning. In line with previous studies (James et al., 2019; Henderson et al., 2015), we predict that recall in the stem completion task will improve at later test points. \n\n2) Memory for the novel words will be affected by their number of phonological neighbours. For the stem completion task, we predict that words with one/more neighbours will be better recalled than words without neighbours. We also test this hypothesis in the recognition tasks, although do not predict a specific direction given our previous experiments have demonstrated that both interference and facilitation are plausible. \n\n3) The influence of word neighbours on memory for the novel words will change after opportunities for consolidation. If the same pattern holds as with explicit teaching paradigms, we would expect an early benefit of word neighbours to weaken after consolidation. However, if initial prior knowledge connections are weaker under storybook learning conditions, we may see that the influence of neighbours instead becomes strengthened with consolidation. This alternative would manifest as a delayed benefit for word neighbours at the day or week follow-up tests, and may be most prominent for words with only one neighbour due to their more limited prior knowledge connections. \n\n4) Expressive vocabulary scores will be positively associated with overall memory performance for the novel words.

In these experiments, the benefit of prior knowledge was apparent immediately\u2014perhaps facilitated by use of explicit word learning strategies\u2014but weakened over consolidation. In the present study, we ask whether this same pattern holds when novel words are encountered incidentally when listening to stories. \n\nTwo experiments have already been completed to address this question (see https://osf.io/stx6q/). An experiment with children showed that children were not influenced by word neighbours when recalling novel words learned from stories, as measured by a stem completion task. In a form recognition task, they showed poorer performance for novel words that had phonological neighbours, suggesting that prior knowledge even interfered with new learning. In an experiment with adults however, we saw no such interference, and adults continued to benefit from phonological neighbours in recalling the pseudowords as they had done in explicit learning tasks.\n\nHowever, differences in the experimental set-up make it challenging to interpret the differences between children and adults. First, adults were presented with the written stories to read along with the spoken stories, whereas children were not exposed to any orthography. This additional support enabled participants to revisit the novel words during the story, against the intended implicit nature of learning. Second, children sat separate 2-AFC recognition tasks to assess knowledge of the word-form and picture-form mapping independently, and the word-form recognition task was sensitive to neighbor effects. However, performance cannot be directly compared with adults because adults sat a combined 4-AFC version assessing form and picture knowledge simultaneously. Third, children provided spoken word responses, whereas adults provided typed responses. The present aim is to ameliorate these differences in a second adult study, using identical encoding and test formats to the original child experiment. \n\nOur primary research questions are as follows: \n1) Do adults show benefits from offline consolidation after learning novel words from spoken stories? \n2) Do adults show benefits of local prior knowledge (i.e., from word neighbours) when learning novel words from spoken stories?\n3) Is the time course of local prior knowledge benefits different when adults learn novel words from spoken stories, compared to previous studies using explicit teaching paradigms (James et al., 2019)? \n4) Are benefits of local prior knowledge related to adults\u2019 existing expressive vocabulary knowledge? \n", "q4": "1) Memory for the novel words will be different after opportunities for consolidation at the day and week follow-up tests compared to when tested immediately after learning.

We also test this hypothesis in the recognition tasks, although do not predict a specific direction given our previous experiments have demonstrated that both interference and facilitation are plausible. \n\n3) The influence of word neighbours on memory for the novel words will change after opportunities for consolidation. If the same pattern holds as with explicit teaching paradigms, we would expect an early benefit of word neighbours to weaken after consolidation. However, if initial prior knowledge connections are weaker under storybook learning conditions, we may see that the influence of neighbours instead becomes strengthened with consolidation. This alternative would manifest as a delayed benefit for word neighbours at the day or week follow-up tests, and may be most prominent for words with only one neighbour due to their more limited prior knowledge connections. \n\n4) Expressive vocabulary scores will be positively associated with overall memory performance for the novel words.

In these experiments, the benefit of prior knowledge was apparent immediately\u2014perhaps facilitated by use of explicit word learning strategies\u2014but weakened over consolidation. In the present study, we ask whether this same pattern holds when novel words are encountered incidentally when listening to stories. \n\nTwo experiments have already been completed to address this question (see https://osf.io/stx6q/). An experiment with children showed that children were not influenced by word neighbours when recalling novel words learned from stories, as measured by a stem completion task. In a form recognition task, they showed poorer performance for novel words that had phonological neighbours, suggesting that prior knowledge even interfered with new learning. In an experiment with adults however, we saw no such interference, and adults continued to benefit from phonological neighbours in recalling the pseudowords as they had done in explicit learning tasks.\n\nHowever, differences in the experimental set-up make it challenging to interpret the differences between children and adults. First, adults were presented with the written stories to read along with the spoken stories, whereas children were not exposed to any orthography. This additional support enabled participants to revisit the novel words during the story, against the intended implicit nature of learning. Second, children sat separate 2-AFC recognition tasks to assess knowledge of the word-form and picture-form mapping independently, and the word-form recognition task was sensitive to neighbor effects. However, performance cannot be directly compared with adults because adults sat a combined 4-AFC version assessing form and picture knowledge simultaneously. Third, children provided spoken word responses, whereas adults provided typed responses. The present aim is to ameliorate these differences in a second adult study, using identical encoding and test formats to the original child experiment. \n\nOur primary research questions are as follows: \n1) Do adults show benefits from offline consolidation after learning novel words from spoken stories? \n2) Do adults show benefits of local prior knowledge (i.e., from word neighbours) when learning novel words from spoken stories?\n3) Is the time course of local prior knowledge benefits different when adults learn novel words from spoken stories, compared to previous studies using explicit teaching paradigms (James et al., 2019)? \n4) Are benefits of local prior knowledge related to adults\u2019 existing expressive vocabulary knowledge? \n", "q4": "1) Memory for the novel words will be different after opportunities for consolidation at the day and week follow-up tests compared to when tested immediately after learning.

For the stem completion task, we predict that words with one/more neighbours will be better recalled than words without neighbours. We also test this hypothesis in the recognition tasks, although do not predict a specific direction given our previous experiments have demonstrated that both interference and facilitation are plausible. \n\n3) The influence of word neighbours on memory for the novel words will change after opportunities for consolidation. If the same pattern holds as with explicit teaching paradigms, we would expect an early benefit of word neighbours to weaken after consolidation. However, if initial prior knowledge connections are weaker under storybook learning conditions, we may see that the influence of neighbours instead becomes strengthened with consolidation. This alternative would manifest as a delayed benefit for word neighbours at the day or week follow-up tests, and may be most prominent for words with only one neighbour due to their more limited prior knowledge connections. \n\n4) Expressive vocabulary scores will be positively associated with overall memory performance for the novel words.

In these experiments, the benefit of prior knowledge was apparent immediately\u2014perhaps facilitated by use of explicit word learning strategies\u2014but weakened over consolidation. In the present study, we ask whether this same pattern holds when novel words are encountered incidentally when listening to stories. \n\nTwo experiments have already been completed to address this question (see https://osf.io/stx6q/). An experiment with children showed that children were not influenced by word neighbours when recalling novel words learned from stories, as measured by a stem completion task. In a form recognition task, they showed poorer performance for novel words that had phonological neighbours, suggesting that prior knowledge even interfered with new learning. In an experiment with adults however, we saw no such interference, and adults continued to benefit from phonological neighbours in recalling the pseudowords as they had done in explicit learning tasks.\n\nHowever, differences in the experimental set-up make it challenging to interpret the differences between children and adults. First, adults were presented with the written stories to read along with the spoken stories, whereas children were not exposed to any orthography. This additional support enabled participants to revisit the novel words during the story, against the intended implicit nature of learning. Second, children sat separate 2-AFC recognition tasks to assess knowledge of the word-form and picture-form mapping independently, and the word-form recognition task was sensitive to neighbor effects. However, performance cannot be directly compared with adults because adults sat a combined 4-AFC version assessing form and picture knowledge simultaneously. Third, children provided spoken word responses, whereas adults provided typed responses. The present aim is to ameliorate these differences in a second adult study, using identical encoding and test formats to the original child experiment. \n\nOur primary research questions are as follows: \n1) Do adults show benefits from offline consolidation after learning novel words from spoken stories? \n2) Do adults show benefits of local prior knowledge (i.e., from word neighbours) when learning novel words from spoken stories?\n3) Is the time course of local prior knowledge benefits different when adults learn novel words from spoken stories, compared to previous studies using explicit teaching paradigms (James et al., 2019)? \n4) Are benefits of local prior knowledge related to adults\u2019 existing expressive vocabulary knowledge? \n", "q4": "1) Memory for the novel words will be different after opportunities for consolidation at the day and week follow-up tests compared to when tested immediately after learning. In line with previous studies (James et al., 2019; Henderson et al., 2015), we predict that recall in the stem completion task will improve at later test points. \n\n2) Memory for the novel words will be affected by their number of phonological neighbours. For the stem completion task, we predict that words with one/more neighbours will be better recalled than words without neighbours. We also test this hypothesis in the recognition tasks, although do not predict a specific direction given our previous experiments have demonstrated that both interference and facilitation are plausible. \n\n3) The influence of word neighbours on memory for the novel words will change after opportunities for consolidation. If the same pattern holds as with explicit teaching paradigms, we would expect an early benefit of word neighbours to weaken after consolidation. However, if initial prior knowledge connections are weaker under storybook learning conditions, we may see that the influence of neighbours instead becomes strengthened with consolidation. This alternative would manifest as a delayed benefit for word neighbours at the day or week follow-up tests, and may be most prominent for words with only one neighbour due to their more limited prior knowledge connections. \n\n4) Expressive vocabulary scores will be positively associated with overall memory performance for the novel words.

In a form recognition task, they showed poorer performance for novel words that had phonological neighbours, suggesting that prior knowledge even interfered with new learning. In an experiment with adults however, we saw no such interference, and adults continued to benefit from phonological neighbours in recalling the pseudowords as they had done in explicit learning tasks.\n\nHowever, differences in the experimental set-up make it challenging to interpret the differences between children and adults. First, adults were presented with the written stories to read along with the spoken stories, whereas children were not exposed to any orthography. This additional support enabled participants to revisit the novel words during the story, against the intended implicit nature of learning. Second, children sat separate 2-AFC recognition tasks to assess knowledge of the word-form and picture-form mapping independently, and the word-form recognition task was sensitive to neighbor effects. However, performance cannot be directly compared with adults because adults sat a combined 4-AFC version assessing form and picture knowledge simultaneously. Third, children provided spoken word responses, whereas adults provided typed responses. The present aim is to ameliorate these differences in a second adult study, using identical encoding and test formats to the original child experiment. \n\nOur primary research questions are as follows: \n1) Do adults show benefits from offline consolidation after learning novel words from spoken stories? \n2) Do adults show benefits of local prior knowledge (i.e., from word neighbours) when learning novel words from spoken stories?\n3) Is the time course of local prior knowledge benefits different when adults learn novel words from spoken stories, compared to previous studies using explicit teaching paradigms (James et al., 2019)? \n4) Are benefits of local prior knowledge related to adults\u2019 existing expressive vocabulary knowledge? \n", "q4": "1) Memory for the novel words will be different after opportunities for consolidation at the day and week follow-up tests compared to when tested immediately after learning. In line with previous studies (James et al., 2019; Henderson et al., 2015), we predict that recall in the stem completion task will improve at later test points. \n\n2) Memory for the novel words will be affected by their number of phonological neighbours. For the stem completion task, we predict that words with one/more neighbours will be better recalled than words without neighbours. We also test this hypothesis in the recognition tasks, although do not predict a specific direction given our previous experiments have demonstrated that both interference and facilitation are plausible. \n\n3) The influence of word neighbours on memory for the novel words will change after opportunities for consolidation. If the same pattern holds as with explicit teaching paradigms, we would expect an early benefit of word neighbours to weaken after consolidation. However, if initial prior knowledge connections are weaker under storybook learning conditions, we may see that the influence of neighbours instead becomes strengthened with consolidation. This alternative would manifest as a delayed benefit for word neighbours at the day or week follow-up tests, and may be most prominent for words with only one neighbour due to their more limited prior knowledge connections. \n\n4) Expressive vocabulary scores will be positively associated with overall memory performance for the novel words. In line with previous findings, we anticipate that the association between vocabulary and memory performance will be strongest for novel words with only one phonological neighbour.\n", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.
