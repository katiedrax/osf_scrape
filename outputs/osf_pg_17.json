Such findings suggest that the analgesic placebo effect is a real physiological phenomenon since those physiological changes are most commonly connected to subjective pain estimates as a fundamental indicator of a placebo effect. The aim of this study was to test the effect of a placebo treatment to a) subjective estimates of the severity of a pain stimulation; b) objective measures of pain stimulate. However, studies showed that both the speed and the force of a simple motor reaction are correlated to the severity of the pain sensation. Thus the study aimed to test if the placebo treatment if it appeared at the level of subjective assessments, will be accompanied on both of those objective measures of the sensation. The existence of that kind of correlation can contribute to setting important guidelines in the understanding of the mechanism of the analgesic placebo effect.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-19T22:31:35.468431", "date_modified": "2020-04-19T22:27:33.850273", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["objective measure of placebo effect", "placebo", "placebo effect", "speed and force of reaction"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "ab2f329c26ae84aa952ada21c5d196f2bbb44d37536870af3cec687a61924e5208551a7217a1575818017612e75e7dbcbc09eb9f51564a871cebfc2444a2bf9ee4112a2ef4cfc65eb2566c5c50933fd987603908f594418d953e3395f58dc381a564e627d3b1c75e6f11f9e2bb032e627bc755c0da7158ffe93653f1bd8da383e62bc99174b0268c09f24ee22d414d70", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-19T22:31:35.437103", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Nikolina \u0160aravanja, Dragutin Ivanec, Damir Lu\u010danin"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "It is reasonable to expect that characteristics of a simple motor response could be an objective indicator of a change in the intensity of sensations which can be caused by a pain simulation in the presence of a placebo treatment compared to a controlled situation without such treatment.

Social engagement, Zeitgeist, and social norms", "description": "The study will explore social engagement with two socially relevant causes, gender-equality and climate protection. The rationale for this comparative analysis is that, in spite of high importance of both issues for the society as a whole, there are observable differences in the extent to which they have mobilizing potential among the citizens. Thus, while gender-related social agenda have become powerful determinate of social and political practices and discourse, climate protection problem, although it is becoming more and more recognized as urgent and of extreme importance, is still addressed less by social and political actors. Therefore, the main goal of the study is to compare the levels of social engagement with each issue among the citizens, and also to examine the relative power of several predictors. Namely, we will analyse the role of social norms, the sense of moral obligation, self-identity, and past behaviour for social engagement. Additionally, we will explore whether the perceived salience of the issue in the society (which we call \u201czeitgeist\u201d) will differ for the issues studied, and whether this perceived relevance will influence engagement.  \nThe research will be conducted among university students. It will focus on two sources of social norms among them. We will research whether perceived norms for gender equality social engagement are higher than norms perceived for the engagement with climate protection. This would reflect the normative pressure existing for each issue. In order to account for diverse sources of social influence, we will focus on two types of these sources. On the one hand, we will study descriptive and injunctive norms coming from the reference group. On the other hand, in order to analyse the role of the more immediate context, we will explore the role of perceived descriptive and injunctive norms existing at the university campus. In this context, we will also test whether the degree to which the campus represents the source of the reference group will moderate the impact of campus social norms on engagement. \nWe will also study moral obligation and self-identity as determinants of engagement. Moral obligation and self-identity are established predictors of behaviour, and we expect them to predict social engagement in our study. Besides, and adopting the social interactionist perspective, we will test the idea that social interactions and social context, reflected in the measures of social norms, shape individual sense of moral obligation. Therefore, we will test our hypothesis that norms impact engagement directly, and also indirectly, via increased moral obligation to mobilize for the issue, and also via strengthened self-identity as an advocate for the cause.  \nFinally, we will include past behaviour as the predictor of engagement. \nIn addition, we will try to apply Jackson's (1975) return potential model (RPM) to quantify the social context in which normative forces are at work. This measurement of the normative environment includes capturing both the extremity and consensus associated with expressed opinions. We will calculate these two measures as applied to both, the reference group\u00b4s norms and the norms perceived at the campus. The \u201cintensity\u201d of a norm quantifies the degree of approval or disapproval for an opinion or a behavior. As described in Glynn, Huge, &amp; Lunney (2009), intensity is calculated by taking the deviation of each participant's score from the point of indifference (in our case, 3). Crystallization is calculated by taking the square root of the inverse of each respondent's absolute deviation from the mean approval rating among all respondents. Thus, crystallization of variable x for participant i is the square root of [1/(\u2502x i\u2212x mean\u2502)]. Finally, the normative power is calculated by multiplying the normative intensity by crystallization.\nThe study has theoretical and applied interest. Regarding to its contribution to the theory, it will provide evidence on the relative and comparative impact of the variables that shape and predict social engagement. As regards its applied value, it will provide insights about the more effective way of promoting social engagement depending on the characteristics of the cause.\n\n\nJackson, J. M. 1975.

Each odorant was mixed twice, once with a sweet+sour taste solution and once with a salty+savory taste solution, producing a total of 22 stimuli. These odor-taste mixtures, or flavors, spanned the full spectrum from highly congruent (lemonade: '0%chicken+100% lemon' odor and sweet+sour taste, chicken broth: '100%chicken+0%lemon' odor and salty+savory taste) to highly incongruent mixtures ('100%chicken+0% lemon' odor and sweet+sour taste, '0%chicken+100%lemon' odor and salty+savory taste).  \n\nProcedure \nParticipant attended two testing sessions separated by approximately one week. These sessions were identical except that before the STATE:full-session, participants were served a standardized meal, while the STATE:hungry-session was completed on an empty stomach after a 6-hour fast. Every second participant started with the STATE:full-session and every second participant started with STATE:hungry-session. During both sessions, participants first completed one Training block with 6 trials, and then two Experiment blocks with 36 trials each.

The presentation order of the stimuli was pseudo-randomized (&lt;3 identical tastes in a row) and counterbalanced between participants to minimize order-effect.\n\nTraining block. The aim of this block was to establish a common perceptual representation of the target flavors. Participants were presented with six cups, two containing water, two containing the congruent lemonade flavor, and two containing the congruent chicken broth flavor. They were instructed to taste the cups one at a time and identify the flavor, choosing between \u201cWater\u201d, \u201cLemonade\u201d and \u201cChicken broth\u201d.  \n\nExperiment block 1: Flavor typicality.

The odorants were themselves mixtures of two target odors: chicken and lemon. Together, they formed a dilution series ranging from '100%chicken+0%lemon' to '0%chicken+100% lemon' in eleven 10%-steps with '50%chicken+50%lemon' in the middle. Each odorant was mixed twice, once with a sweet+sour taste solution and once with a salty+savory taste solution, producing a total of 22 stimuli. These odor-taste mixtures, or flavors, spanned the full spectrum from highly congruent (lemonade: '0%chicken+100% lemon' odor and sweet+sour taste, chicken broth: '100%chicken+0%lemon' odor and salty+savory taste) to highly incongruent mixtures ('100%chicken+0% lemon' odor and sweet+sour taste, '0%chicken+100%lemon' odor and salty+savory taste).  \n\nProcedure \nParticipant attended two testing sessions separated by approximately one week. These sessions were identical except that before the STATE:full-session, participants were served a standardized meal, while the STATE:hungry-session was completed on an empty stomach after a 6-hour fast. Every second participant started with the STATE:full-session and every second participant started with STATE:hungry-session. During both sessions, participants first completed one Training block with 6 trials, and then two Experiment blocks with 36 trials each. Psychopy was used throughout the experiment to present instructions on a computer screen, control the timing of the different steps in the trials, and log responses. For all trial in the Training block and Experiment block 1, participants were instructed to: \n1.\tTaste the liquid in one of the cups\n2.\tRate some aspect of the experience while having the liquid inside the mouth\n3.\tExpectorate the liquid \n4.\tRinse with water to clean the mouth\n5.\tExpectorate the rinsing water  \nThis structure was repeated in Experiment block 2, except that step 2 and 3 switched places so that ratings were collected after and not before expectoration. The presentation order of the stimuli was pseudo-randomized (&lt;3 identical tastes in a row) and counterbalanced between participants to minimize order-effect.\n\nTraining block. The aim of this block was to establish a common perceptual representation of the target flavors. Participants were presented with six cups, two containing water, two containing the congruent lemonade flavor, and two containing the congruent chicken broth flavor. They were instructed to taste the cups one at a time and identify the flavor, choosing between \u201cWater\u201d, \u201cLemonade\u201d and \u201cChicken broth\u201d.  \n\nExperiment block 1: Flavor typicality. Participants were then instructed to taste 36 cups one at a time and rate how similar each flavor was to lemonade/chicken broth by using the scale in Figure 1 (without the green tick marks and numbers). The 36 cups contained the 22 odor-taste mixtures, the 11 odorants at a concentration of 50%, the 2 tastants at a concentration of 50%, and plain water.

review \n\nAUTHORS\nArendse Tange Larsen, S\u00f8ren Rud Kristensen, Liza Sopina, Jakob Kjellberg, Eske Kvanner Aasvang, Helge Bjarup Dissing S\u00f8rensen, Christian Sylvest Meyhoff. \n\nMAIN RESEARCH QUESTION\nWhat is the scope of the economic evidence of artificial-intelligence (AI) supported continuous vital signs monitoring (CVSM) systems and which (if any) special considerations does the use of AI technology imply for conducting economic analyses of such systems?\n\nSUB-QUESTIONS\n1.\tWhat are the conclusions of the economic literature on AI-supported CVSM systems? \n2.\tWhat are the methods being used for studying the economic evidence of AI-supported CVSM systems and (how) are they different from other economic analyses of CVSM systems?\n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\nMonitoring of vital signs is a way to facilitate early detection of patient deterioration, thereby ensuring timely management of disease and prevention of adverse events (1\u20133). Manual approaches for monitoring vital signs are being widely used but are challenged by poor adherence to the scoring protocol, low detection rates and long time intervals between patient observations during which deterioration can occur undetected (1,4\u20136). Continuous monitoring designing a 24/7 clinical support system offers a potential solution to the inadequate monitoring frequency but the narrow window for medical intervention upon detection of deterioration, as well as false alarms, still constitute obstacles for improving outcomes (3,7). Therefore, an increasing interest for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to support continuous monitoring systems has recently evolved (3,7\u201311). \n\nAI is a rapidly growing field providing digital transformation of a broad range of businesses and industries, the health care sector being no exception. AI is increasingly being used or tested for different purposes in the health care sector. AI-supported health care technologies have in some cases proved comparable to human approaches by clinicians and some studies even point to increased accuracy of diagnosis and risk prediction (12,13). Additionally, the use of AI-supported health care technologies may improve chronic disease management, facilitate precision therapies for complex diseases, reduce medical errors etc. (14\u201316). Hence, the application of AI in healthcare is anticipated to change patient care and is associated with high expectations in terms of improved health outcomes, increased efficiency and reduced health care costs (12,13,17,18). However, the literature on how AI-supported health care technologies can and will meet these expectations is scarce.\n\nThe application of AI in patient monitoring enables the transformation of automatically and continuously measured vital signs into real-time predictive indicators of patients\u2019 health status, which may facilitate proactive treatment of imminent deterioration (3,11). Hence, AI-supported continuous monitoring of vital signs building on automatic interpretation and classification of abnormal events is anticipated to reduce adverse events in the individual patient and improve general patient safety. Additionally, it allows for new workflows that may translate into more efficient processes and reduced health care costs. \n\nWhile the implementation and performance of some AI-supported CVSM systems have been examined (3,12,19\u201321), the question of the size and nature of the potential economic benefits of such systems remains unaddressed. \n\nSome economic aspects of CVSM systems and AI-supported health care technologies have been addressed each on their own in recent systematic reviews (1,18). Downey et al. (2018) examined the feasibility of using traditional CVSM systems outside the critical care setting and included both clinical and non-clinical outcomes, including a brief description of the cost-effectiveness of CVSM systems (1). The authors only identified three economic studies on CVSM systems. One study found an annual return of investment of 292.8 % and 92.5 % in the base case model and conservative model, respectively, mainly arising from decreased length of stay (22). Another study found that transfers to the intensive care unit (ICU) were not reduced but that the duration and costs of ICU stay were significantly less in patients monitored by the continuous monitoring system. However, the system did not reduce the overall costs of hospitalization (23). According to the authors, the reason for this might be that the monitoring was a short-lived component of a longer and complex hospitalization, which did not change the entire pathway and therefore did not reduce overall costs (23). A third study found that a continuous monitoring system was cost-effective in the initial year and that the cost-benefit increased significantly in the subsequent years (24). Based on these results, Downey et al. concluded that CVSM systems may be cost-effective (1). \n\nWolff et al. (2020) published a systematic review to summarize published cost-effectiveness studies on the application of AI in health care in general and to assess whether current studies met five quality criteria formulated by the authors themselves, and derived from classical health care effectiveness studies and digital health assessments (18). The criteria comprised: Description of cost-effectiveness of AI solution; Hypothesis formulation; Cost-effectiveness perspective; Consideration of cost alternative; Benefit today; Verification of base case. \n\nThe authors concluded that only few studies of AI in health care have been conducted and published; and that even fewer meet the authors\u2019 quality criteria (18). The authors\u2019 search strategy was not limited to any specific AI health care technologies but was, however, limited to only one database and few search terms for economic impact. None of the six AI health care technologies covered in the review comprised an AI-supported CVSM system.\n\nHence, while the health economics of traditional CVSM systems and general AI technologies in health care have been addressed in the literature, the health economic literature on AI-supported CVSM systems still remains to be studied. In this scoping review, we aim to do exactly so by exploring what the literature show and how the economic consequences of AI-supported CVSM systems have been investigated.\n\nOVERALL OBJECTIVE\nThe overall objective of the scoping review is to acquire an overview of the health economic literature on AI-supported CVSM systems and to explore what characterizes economic analyses of such systems.\n\nHereby, we wish to i) understand the economic evidence of AI-supported CVSM systems, which can feed into the decision-making processes regarding implementation and operation of such systems, and ii) inform future research on how to conduct economic analyses of AI-supported CVSM systems.\n\nWe define AI-supported CVSM systems as systems with integration of AI technology to support automatic monitoring of one or more vital signs in patients at fixed time intervals. \n\nINCLUSION CRITERIA\n- Types of participants: Hospitalized patients\n\n- Concept: The conclusions and methods of health economic analyses of AI-supported CVSM systems. Outcomes of interest are not limited to monetary outcomes. Hence, outcomes such as resource use, length of stay, transfers to intensive care unit are also considered economic outcomes. Moreover, economic outcomes include socio-economic outcomes such as return to work and indirect costs.\n\n- Context: The hospital sector, no country limits\n\n- Types of studies: Any studies assessing the economic consequences of implementing an AI-supported CVSM system (cost-effectiveness studies, cost-utility studies, cost-benefit studies, budget impact analyses, return of investment analyses, costing analyses etc.). \n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nThe search strategy will be divided into three parts as recommended by the Joanna Briggs Institute.\n\nStep 1\nStep 1 comprises an initial search in two databases (e.g. Medline and Academic Search Premier) and serves to provide inspiration for the subsequent search. In this step, relevant keywords and index terms will be identified in titles and abstracts of studies obtained from the search.\n\nStep 2\nIn step 2 a comprehensive systematic literature search will be conducted using the following 11 electronic databases: Academic Search Premier; CINAHL; EconLit; Embase; MEDLINE; Pubmed; The Cochrane Library; SveMed+; The NHS Economic Evaluation Database; Web of Science; SciVerse Scopus.\n\nAdditionally, we will conduct a search for grey literature using sources such as Google Scholar, Open Grey and websites of relevant agencies or institutes (e.g. ISPOR, NICE, NHS UK, IHE).\n\nThe search strategy will not be limited to study design or publication date but will be limited to studies written in English, Danish, Swedish or Norwegian.\n\nStep 3\nFinally, reference lists in the included studies will be searched for additional studies.\n\nRelevant search terms will be identified on the basis of the following facets and will comprise both keywords and index terms (e.g. MeSH terms):\n\nFacet 1: Artificial intelligence\nFacet 2: Continuous vital signs monitoring systems\nFacet 3: Health economics\n\nSee attached appendix for search strategy for one database.\n\nSTUDY SELECTION\nSearch results will be imported to a reference management system.

Manual approaches for monitoring vital signs are being widely used but are challenged by poor adherence to the scoring protocol, low detection rates and long time intervals between patient observations during which deterioration can occur undetected (1,4\u20136). Continuous monitoring designing a 24/7 clinical support system offers a potential solution to the inadequate monitoring frequency but the narrow window for medical intervention upon detection of deterioration, as well as false alarms, still constitute obstacles for improving outcomes (3,7). Therefore, an increasing interest for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to support continuous monitoring systems has recently evolved (3,7\u201311). \n\nAI is a rapidly growing field providing digital transformation of a broad range of businesses and industries, the health care sector being no exception. AI is increasingly being used or tested for different purposes in the health care sector. AI-supported health care technologies have in some cases proved comparable to human approaches by clinicians and some studies even point to increased accuracy of diagnosis and risk prediction (12,13). Additionally, the use of AI-supported health care technologies may improve chronic disease management, facilitate precision therapies for complex diseases, reduce medical errors etc. (14\u201316). Hence, the application of AI in healthcare is anticipated to change patient care and is associated with high expectations in terms of improved health outcomes, increased efficiency and reduced health care costs (12,13,17,18). However, the literature on how AI-supported health care technologies can and will meet these expectations is scarce.\n\nThe application of AI in patient monitoring enables the transformation of automatically and continuously measured vital signs into real-time predictive indicators of patients\u2019 health status, which may facilitate proactive treatment of imminent deterioration (3,11). Hence, AI-supported continuous monitoring of vital signs building on automatic interpretation and classification of abnormal events is anticipated to reduce adverse events in the individual patient and improve general patient safety. Additionally, it allows for new workflows that may translate into more efficient processes and reduced health care costs. \n\nWhile the implementation and performance of some AI-supported CVSM systems have been examined (3,12,19\u201321), the question of the size and nature of the potential economic benefits of such systems remains unaddressed. \n\nSome economic aspects of CVSM systems and AI-supported health care technologies have been addressed each on their own in recent systematic reviews (1,18). Downey et al. (2018) examined the feasibility of using traditional CVSM systems outside the critical care setting and included both clinical and non-clinical outcomes, including a brief description of the cost-effectiveness of CVSM systems (1). The authors only identified three economic studies on CVSM systems. One study found an annual return of investment of 292.8 % and 92.5 % in the base case model and conservative model, respectively, mainly arising from decreased length of stay (22). Another study found that transfers to the intensive care unit (ICU) were not reduced but that the duration and costs of ICU stay were significantly less in patients monitored by the continuous monitoring system. However, the system did not reduce the overall costs of hospitalization (23). According to the authors, the reason for this might be that the monitoring was a short-lived component of a longer and complex hospitalization, which did not change the entire pathway and therefore did not reduce overall costs (23). A third study found that a continuous monitoring system was cost-effective in the initial year and that the cost-benefit increased significantly in the subsequent years (24). Based on these results, Downey et al. concluded that CVSM systems may be cost-effective (1). \n\nWolff et al. (2020) published a systematic review to summarize published cost-effectiveness studies on the application of AI in health care in general and to assess whether current studies met five quality criteria formulated by the authors themselves, and derived from classical health care effectiveness studies and digital health assessments (18). The criteria comprised: Description of cost-effectiveness of AI solution; Hypothesis formulation; Cost-effectiveness perspective; Consideration of cost alternative; Benefit today; Verification of base case. \n\nThe authors concluded that only few studies of AI in health care have been conducted and published; and that even fewer meet the authors\u2019 quality criteria (18). The authors\u2019 search strategy was not limited to any specific AI health care technologies but was, however, limited to only one database and few search terms for economic impact. None of the six AI health care technologies covered in the review comprised an AI-supported CVSM system.\n\nHence, while the health economics of traditional CVSM systems and general AI technologies in health care have been addressed in the literature, the health economic literature on AI-supported CVSM systems still remains to be studied. In this scoping review, we aim to do exactly so by exploring what the literature show and how the economic consequences of AI-supported CVSM systems have been investigated.\n\nOVERALL OBJECTIVE\nThe overall objective of the scoping review is to acquire an overview of the health economic literature on AI-supported CVSM systems and to explore what characterizes economic analyses of such systems.\n\nHereby, we wish to i) understand the economic evidence of AI-supported CVSM systems, which can feed into the decision-making processes regarding implementation and operation of such systems, and ii) inform future research on how to conduct economic analyses of AI-supported CVSM systems.\n\nWe define AI-supported CVSM systems as systems with integration of AI technology to support automatic monitoring of one or more vital signs in patients at fixed time intervals. \n\nINCLUSION CRITERIA\n- Types of participants: Hospitalized patients\n\n- Concept: The conclusions and methods of health economic analyses of AI-supported CVSM systems. Outcomes of interest are not limited to monetary outcomes. Hence, outcomes such as resource use, length of stay, transfers to intensive care unit are also considered economic outcomes. Moreover, economic outcomes include socio-economic outcomes such as return to work and indirect costs.\n\n- Context: The hospital sector, no country limits\n\n- Types of studies: Any studies assessing the economic consequences of implementing an AI-supported CVSM system (cost-effectiveness studies, cost-utility studies, cost-benefit studies, budget impact analyses, return of investment analyses, costing analyses etc.). \n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nThe search strategy will be divided into three parts as recommended by the Joanna Briggs Institute.\n\nStep 1\nStep 1 comprises an initial search in two databases (e.g. Medline and Academic Search Premier) and serves to provide inspiration for the subsequent search. In this step, relevant keywords and index terms will be identified in titles and abstracts of studies obtained from the search.\n\nStep 2\nIn step 2 a comprehensive systematic literature search will be conducted using the following 11 electronic databases: Academic Search Premier; CINAHL; EconLit; Embase; MEDLINE; Pubmed; The Cochrane Library; SveMed+; The NHS Economic Evaluation Database; Web of Science; SciVerse Scopus.\n\nAdditionally, we will conduct a search for grey literature using sources such as Google Scholar, Open Grey and websites of relevant agencies or institutes (e.g. ISPOR, NICE, NHS UK, IHE).\n\nThe search strategy will not be limited to study design or publication date but will be limited to studies written in English, Danish, Swedish or Norwegian.\n\nStep 3\nFinally, reference lists in the included studies will be searched for additional studies.\n\nRelevant search terms will be identified on the basis of the following facets and will comprise both keywords and index terms (e.g. MeSH terms):\n\nFacet 1: Artificial intelligence\nFacet 2: Continuous vital signs monitoring systems\nFacet 3: Health economics\n\nSee attached appendix for search strategy for one database.\n\nSTUDY SELECTION\nSearch results will be imported to a reference management system. The screening process will be divided into two parts. In the first part (level 1 screening) studies will be selected based on title and abstract. In the second part (level 2 screening) studies will be selected based on full text examination. The study selection will be performed by two reviewers. Any disagreements will be solved by consensus.\n\nDATA EXTRACTION\nFor included articles key information relevant to the research question will be conducted according to the following charting form:\n\n-\tAuthor\n-\tYear of publication\n-\tOrigin\n-\tAim/purpose\n-\tPopulation details (and sample size)\n-\tStudy design/methods\n-\tIntervention details, including whether the AI technology is an add-on to an existing monitoring system\n-\tType of AI technology \n-\tVital sign(s) measured\n-\tSetting (e.g. intensive care unit or operating room)\n-\tTarget population\n-\tOutcomes and measurement\n-\tData sources\n-\tChallenges encountered/limitations\n-\tReference standard/comparison (if any)\n-\tKey findings and conclusion according to authors\n\nPRESENTATION OF RESULTS\nResults will be summarized as descriptive tables as well as presented as a narrative synthesis.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. \tDowney CL, Chapman S, Randell R, Brown JM, Jayne DG.
