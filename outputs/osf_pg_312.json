Firstly, we demonstrated that children who correctly individuate and represent collections as a unit still prevalently make the above-mentioned counting mistakes. Secondly, we showed that the above-mentioned counting mistakes are related to children\u2019s general number knowledge. These two findings supported our hypothesis that the counting mistakes are not solely a symptom of children\u2019s innate biases to represent spatio-temporally independent units but are inherently tied to children\u2019s understanding of number and counting. We hypothesized that beyond object-biases in individuation children\u2019s mistakes when counting parts and collections are an expression of their overgeneralization of the one-to-one counting principle and lack of understanding that abstract units are equally countable. In summary, we suggest that our findings in previous studies are best explained by counting principle overgeneralization and that the link between non-single object counting and early numeracy is not completely accounted for by the object-bias theory of individuation.\nIn the proposed study we aim to test these two competing accounts based on their explanatory value for the connection between children\u2019s general number knowledge and their mistakes when counting parts and collections of objects. \nThe object-bias theory of individuation predicts that children have a strong initial tendency to individuate the units for counting based on their spatio-temporal independence. Neither parts of objects nor collections should be counted correctly when only an individuation based on single physical objects is available. Counting object-based instead of counting nameable object parts or collections should under this account be completely explained by children\u2019s object bias and their inability to inhibit this object bias when counting.

Under this account we assume that some children form correct representations of the units to be counted and that their counting mistakes are a result of their overgeneralization of the one-to-one correspondence principle in counting and their limited application of the abstraction principle. Our previous studies found that many children can correctly represents units for object collections. If there was an overgeneralization of counting principles at play, then children\u2019s tendency to \u201ctouch each and count\u201d would not lead them to make mistakes when counting correctly represented object parts (because if they have a representation of ears as objects, then touch each and counting leads to a correct count). The counting rule overgeneralization should, however, lead them to incorrectly count objects instead of collections even when they can correctly represent the collections as a unit (even when correctly representing kinds of animals as [horses; cows], touching each and count leads to an object based counting mistake).
