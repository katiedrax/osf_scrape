We will calculate whether each participant engages frequently in each measured activity. The criterion for engaging in an activity frequently is answering that one engages in that activity at least once a month on the following 7-point scale: (1) Not at all; (2) Less than 10 times in total; (3) Once a month; (4) 2-3 times a month; (5) Once a week; (6) 2-3 times a week; (7) 4 or more times a week.\n\n2.

Derrick et al's procedure would be used to see if there was a significant difference between the proportions outlined above within the partially-overlapping samples under test.\n\nH13-26\n\nTo assess whether self-criticism explains the relationship between disordered hobby engagement and anxiety, we will undertake two separate linear regressions for each of the assessed hobbies (gambling, gaming, social media, reading, exercise, socialising, sports). First we employ a simple linear regression with disordered engagement score for each hobby as the independent variable, and GAD scores as the outcome variable. Next we will run a stepwise linear regression inputting self-criticism as a predictor at Step 1, disordered engagement score for that hobby at Step 2, and GAD scores as the outcome variable. The significance (p &lt; .05) of the disordered usage term will be used to assess whether the effect of disordered engagement retains explanatory power after controlling for self-criticism. If the effect of disordered engagement on GAD scores is significant under the simple linear regression but non-significant under the stepwise linear regression, we will interpret this as evidence of full mediation. If the effect of disordered engagement remains significant in the stepwise linear regression, the R2 change score is significant and the effect size is smaller in the stepwise regression (c.f., the simple linear regression), this will be interpreted as evidence for partial mediation. If the effect of disordered engagement remains significant in the stepwise linear regression, the R2 change score is significant and the effect size is larger in the stepwise regression (c.f., the simple linear regression), this will be interpreted as evidence for a suppressing effect of self-criticism on the relationship between disordered engagement and anxiety. If the simple linear regression shows no significant relationship between disordered engagement and GAD scores, this will be interpreted as evidence that no relationship exists for disordered engagement with that hobby and anxiety.\n\nTo assess whether self-criticism explains the relationship between disordered hobby engagement and depression, we will undertake two separate linear regressions for each of the assessed hobbies (gambling, gaming, social media, reading, exercise, socialising, sports).

If the effect of disordered engagement on GAD scores is significant under the simple linear regression but non-significant under the stepwise linear regression, we will interpret this as evidence of full mediation. If the effect of disordered engagement remains significant in the stepwise linear regression, the R2 change score is significant and the effect size is smaller in the stepwise regression (c.f., the simple linear regression), this will be interpreted as evidence for partial mediation. If the effect of disordered engagement remains significant in the stepwise linear regression, the R2 change score is significant and the effect size is larger in the stepwise regression (c.f., the simple linear regression), this will be interpreted as evidence for a suppressing effect of self-criticism on the relationship between disordered engagement and anxiety. If the simple linear regression shows no significant relationship between disordered engagement and GAD scores, this will be interpreted as evidence that no relationship exists for disordered engagement with that hobby and anxiety.\n\nTo assess whether self-criticism explains the relationship between disordered hobby engagement and depression, we will undertake two separate linear regressions for each of the assessed hobbies (gambling, gaming, social media, reading, exercise, socialising, sports). First we employ a simple linear regression with disordered engagement score for each hobby as the independent variable, and PHQ scores as the outcome variable. Next we will run a stepwise linear regression inputting self-criticism as a predictor at Step 1, disordered engagement score for that hobby at Step 2, and PHQ scores as the outcome variable. The significance (p &lt; .05) of the disordered usage term will be used to assess whether the effect of disordered engagement retains explanatory power after controlling for self-criticism. If the effect of disordered engagement on PHQ scores is significant under the simple linear regression but non-significant under the stepwise linear regression, we will interpret this as evidence of full mediation. If the effect of disordered engagement remains significant in the stepwise linear regression, the R2 change score is significant and the effect size is smaller in the stepwise regression (c.f., the simple linear regression), this will be interpreted as evidence for partial mediation. If the effect of disordered engagement remains significant in the stepwise linear regression, the R2 change score is significant and the effect size is larger in the stepwise regression (c.f., the simple linear regression), this will be interpreted as evidence for a suppressing effect of self-criticism on the relationship between disordered engagement and depression. f the simple linear regression shows no significant relationship between disordered engagement and GAD scores, this will be interpreted as evidence that no relationship exists for disordered engagement with that hobby and depression.", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x4u62/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}},
