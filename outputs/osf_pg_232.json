their function instead is to express that the speaker is in a certain conative or affective state of mind. \n\nThe contrast between moral and non-moral statements is sometimes presented as the idea that, whereas non-moral statements express cognitive mental states such as belief, moral statements express non-cognitive mental states, such as approval. Moreover, the latter express non-cognitive states in the same way that non-moral statements express beliefs. This is Schroeder's 'Parity Thesis':\n\n'[M]oral sentences are related to noncognitive, desire\u2010like states of mind in the same way that ordinary descriptive sentences are related to ordinary beliefs\u2014they express them. (Schroeder, 2008, p. 3). \n\nThe Parity Thesis makes a testable prediction: if moral assertions express non-cognitive attitudes in the same way that non-moral assertions express beliefs, then whatever relations hold between non-moral assertions and belief ascriptions should hold as well between moral assertions and ascriptions of the relevant non-cognitive attitudes. In particular, just as certain combinations of non-moral assertions and belief ascriptions generate so-called Moore paradoxes (1), similar combinations of moral assertions and ascriptions of non-cognitive attitudes ought to generate analogously unacceptable constructions (2).\n\n(1) Murder is wrong but I don\u2019t think it is wrong.\n(2) Murder is wrong but I don\u2019t disapprove of it.\n\nWoods (2014) claims that this is not the case: sentences like (2) are not unacceptable in the same way that Moorean paradoxes are. He argues that this constitutes a major blow to the Parity Thesis. Woods, however, bases his claim that sentences like (2) are acceptable on his intuitions. But intuitions vary, and not everyone agrees with Woods on this score. \n\nThe purpose of our study is to empirically test the acceptability of sentences like (2), and thereby provide empirical evidence that speaks to Wood's claim, the Parity Thesis, and the connection between moral language and non-cognitive attitudes that is the focus of much contemporary literature on metaethics and philosophy of language.\n\nIn a previous study, we tested the acceptability of constructions exactly like (2) (https://osf.io/vwekq/?view_only=d5281af405f54493a67cb3c2759d76ac).

Moreover, the latter express non-cognitive states in the same way that non-moral statements express beliefs. This is Schroeder's 'Parity Thesis':\n\n'[M]oral sentences are related to noncognitive, desire\u2010like states of mind in the same way that ordinary descriptive sentences are related to ordinary beliefs\u2014they express them. (Schroeder, 2008, p. 3). \n\nThe Parity Thesis makes a testable prediction: if moral assertions express non-cognitive attitudes in the same way that non-moral assertions express beliefs, then whatever relations hold between non-moral assertions and belief ascriptions should hold as well between moral assertions and ascriptions of the relevant non-cognitive attitudes. In particular, just as certain combinations of non-moral assertions and belief ascriptions generate so-called Moore paradoxes (1), similar combinations of moral assertions and ascriptions of non-cognitive attitudes ought to generate analogously unacceptable constructions (2).\n\n(1) Murder is wrong but I don\u2019t think it is wrong.\n(2) Murder is wrong but I don\u2019t disapprove of it.\n\nWoods (2014) claims that this is not the case: sentences like (2) are not unacceptable in the same way that Moorean paradoxes are. He argues that this constitutes a major blow to the Parity Thesis. Woods, however, bases his claim that sentences like (2) are acceptable on his intuitions. But intuitions vary, and not everyone agrees with Woods on this score. \n\nThe purpose of our study is to empirically test the acceptability of sentences like (2), and thereby provide empirical evidence that speaks to Wood's claim, the Parity Thesis, and the connection between moral language and non-cognitive attitudes that is the focus of much contemporary literature on metaethics and philosophy of language.\n\nIn a previous study, we tested the acceptability of constructions exactly like (2) (https://osf.io/vwekq/?view_only=d5281af405f54493a67cb3c2759d76ac).

The hypothesis of the central governor model is that there is a reserve physical capacity held during the pacing of an event to ensure safe body homeostasis (Swart 2009). It is the balancing act of pushing this reserve but limiting injury that guides sporting training regimes. Often an athlete is able to train for most situations they will encounter and can push into this reserve to attain greater performance benefits. However, frequently, an athlete will be confronted with a novel situation for which they have not trained. The hypothesised reaction of the central governor would be to hold a greater amount in reserve given the unknown outcome of the situation (Noakes, Peltonen, &amp; Rusko 2001). The most common event causing the biggest effect on performance in endurance athletes in this situation is temperature fluctuations (El Helou et al. 2012). The implications of exploring aspects of pacing when confronted with future heat environments or novel environments is that aspects of acclimatisation, past experience, education and mental strategies can be improved. The primary outcome would aim to improve performance in athletes when confronted by these conditions. A secondary outcome would be to deepen the argument around the brain\u2019s involvement in fatigue. The implications for this research will hopefully lead to further insights into the management of fatigue not just in the field of sports but in other health fields.\nAlthough many studies have investigated the anticipatory nature of pacing strategies (Albertus et al. 2005, Tucker &amp; Noakes 2009, Adams et al. 2016, Jones et al. 2013, Waldron, Villerius, &amp; Murphy 2014), a preliminary search of the literature has shown only one previous study using deception of environmental and core body heat that reported the associated changes in pacing strategies (Castle et al. 2012). To my knowledge, there has been no previous research into anticipatory changes to pacing strategies according to future hot environments. The aim therefore of this systematic review will be to explore the literature with respect to pacing strategies, their interaction with hot ambient environments and to explore the literature around anticipatory responses to future events."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "The objectives of this systematic review are to explore:\n1.\tThe literature around pacing and environmental challenges\n2.\tAnticipatory alterations in athlete pacing strategies that occur in response to future events\n3.\tBrain interaction with physiological mechanisms and it\u2019s impacts on fatigue"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies."}, "q6": {"extra": [], "value": ["No blinding is involved in this study."]}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q8": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Systematic review / Meta-Analysis"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q10": {"extra": [], "value": "Registration prior to creation of data"}, "q11": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q12": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "The following electronic databases will be searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE (OvidSP); Embase (OvidSP); PsycINFO (OvidSP); Emcare (OvidSP); SCOPUS (Elsevier); the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

Lorimer Moseley, Kevin Norton, Samuel Chalmers", "q3": "Winners of elite sport competitions, whether individual or team sports, are often determined by who can succeed in pushing closest to the boundaries of their body\u2019s abilities in a given situation. The hypothesis of the central governor model is that there is a reserve physical capacity held during the pacing of an event to ensure safe body homeostasis (Swart 2009). It is the balancing act of pushing this reserve but limiting injury that guides sporting training regimes. Often an athlete is able to train for most situations they will encounter and can push into this reserve to attain greater performance benefits. However, frequently, an athlete will be confronted with a novel situation for which they have not trained. The hypothesised reaction of the central governor would be to hold a greater amount in reserve given the unknown outcome of the situation (Noakes, Peltonen, &amp; Rusko 2001). The most common event causing the biggest effect on performance in endurance athletes in this situation is temperature fluctuations (El Helou et al. 2012). The implications of exploring aspects of pacing when confronted with future heat environments or novel environments is that aspects of acclimatisation, past experience, education and mental strategies can be improved. The primary outcome would aim to improve performance in athletes when confronted by these conditions. A secondary outcome would be to deepen the argument around the brain\u2019s involvement in fatigue. The implications for this research will hopefully lead to further insights into the management of fatigue not just in the field of sports but in other health fields.\nAlthough many studies have investigated the anticipatory nature of pacing strategies (Albertus et al. 2005, Tucker &amp; Noakes 2009, Adams et al. 2016, Jones et al. 2013, Waldron, Villerius, &amp; Murphy 2014), a preliminary search of the literature has shown only one previous study using deception of environmental and core body heat that reported the associated changes in pacing strategies (Castle et al. 2012). To my knowledge, there has been no previous research into anticipatory changes to pacing strategies according to future hot environments. The aim therefore of this systematic review will be to explore the literature with respect to pacing strategies, their interaction with hot ambient environments and to explore the literature around anticipatory responses to future events.", "q4": "The objectives of this systematic review are to explore:\n1.\tThe literature around pacing and environmental challenges\n2.\tAnticipatory alterations in athlete pacing strategies that occur in response to future events\n3.\tBrain interaction with physiological mechanisms and it\u2019s impacts on fatigue", "q5": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies.", "q6": ["No blinding is involved in this study."], "q7": "", "q9": "", "q10": "Registration prior to creation of data", "q11": "", "q13": "All randomised trials, systematic reviews and metanalyses will be included.\nOther study types will be considered on a case to case basis for deepening the academic \nargument.

In particular, we identified five patient groups that are known to have deficits in social relationships, albeit in unique ways: Psychosis, Borderline Personality Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Social Anxiety, and Antisocial Personality Disorder. We will conduct a systematic review of papers in which the Trust Game (Berg et al., 1995) was administered to patients with the aforementioned psychopathology to better understand similarities and differences in trusting behavior. In the trust game, two players make sequential decisions about money. The first player (trustor) can choose to give some portion of a show up payment to the partner (trustee). The money shared is then multiplied by a value (like 3) and the trustee has the option to return any amount of the larger sum of money to the trustor. This game measures trust based on the amount of money a trustee is willing to send to a partner, in the hopes that the partner will return a greater amount of money. However, we can also look at reciprocity based on the response of the trustee. Further manipulations of the task have also looked at the changes in the game when it is played over several rounds with the same player (learning to trust), and the influence of background information (prior beliefs).
