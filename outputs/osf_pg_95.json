pain, agitation and to tolerate invasive procedures such as mechanical ventilation. (1-4) Indeed, current practices indicate that nearly all mechanically ventilated patients in pediatric intensive care units (PICU) receive sedatives during the critical phase of their PICU stay. (5) However, extended exposure to sedatives often results in delays in weaning from mechanical ventilation, extends the length of PICU stay, and increases the risk of delirium. (6, 7) For this reason, guidelines concerning the use of sedatives strongly favor light levels of use, designed to improve patient outcomes in the PICU (e.g. length-of-stay) and post-PICU (e.g. neurocognition and physical functioning). (3, 8, 9) \nIn the adult population, extended sedative exposure is reduced by using daily sedation interruption methods to minimize sedative use and improve outcomes. (1, 10) Daily sedative interruptions are defined as a period of time, each day, during which the patient\u2019s medication is discontinued to allow patients to wake up and achieve arousal. (8) Unfortunately, the effectiveness and safety of daily sedative interruptions in the pediatric population have not been established. Results from the few existing studies in the pediatric population indicate that the use of adult guidelines may not be appropriate. (6, 11-13) Consequently, the current best practice in children is to gradually discontinue sedative medications as they move towards the recovery phase of their illness. Unfortunately, if sedatives are abruptly stopped or weaned too quickly, iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome (IWS) occurs. (14) \nIWS can result in prolonged and adverse health outcomes for patients. The symptoms include central nervous system hyperirritability, autonomic system dysregulation, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and motor abnormalities. (15-17) IWS typically appears in individuals who receive regular sedatives for more than 72 hours. IWS can appear in patients who: 1) are weaned from \u2265 5 days of continuous infusion or round-the-clock sedatives and 2) are receiving rescue therapy to manage an increase in symptoms after the start of weaning, and not for treatment of new pain or sedation needs. (18) The incidence of IWS is most common in critically ill pediatric populations, in part due to the differences in sedative methods between adult and pediatric populations. Specifically, the incidence of IWS in critically ill pediatric patients is estimated to range from 7.5%- 87%. (19) \nCurrently, a gold standard for diagnosing pediatric IWS doesn\u2019t exist, despite the high incidence rate of IWS in the PICU. Instead, health care professionals are required to apply subjective clinical assessments to qualify a patient\u2019s withdrawal intensity and symptoms. (20) This subjective assessment leads to missed diagnoses and variable management, which may contribute to more adverse outcomes. To address these issues, there is a need for a validated measurement tool to allow for earlier diagnoses, standardize IWS assessment, evaluate treatment effectiveness, and guide clinical practice.\nThe Withdrawal Assessment Tool (WAT-1) is a clinician-reported outcome measure developed to measure IWS in critically ill children. The WAT-1 can be used to diagnose IWS in pediatric populations and assess the clinical effectiveness of treatments. (2, 3, 21) While existing studies have validated specific measurement properties of the WAT-1 (20), to our knowledge, no studies aggregate its measurement properties. Aggregating the psychometric research on the WAT-1 will enhance our understanding of the appropriate use of the WAT-1, and outline areas of weaknesses that require future empirical research. Thus, the aim of this systematic review is to critically appraise, compare and summarize the psychometric properties, the interpretability, the feasibility and the evidence quality of the WAT-1 for identifying IWS symptoms in critically ill children. \n\nMethods\nWe will conduct a systematic review of the WAT-1 in pediatric populations according to the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) guidelines. The COSMIN guidelines provide rigorous methodology and standards that assess measurement properties, feasibility and interpretability of an instrument, and the methodological quality of the studies which report measurement properties. (22-25) This study will be reported according to both PRISMA and COSMIN guidelines. (23, 24, 26)\n \nEligibility\nPeer-reviewed, full-text articles on WAT-1 development, evaluation of one or more measurement properties (e.g. reliability, validity, and responsiveness), or its interpretation and feasibility are eligible for inclusion. Studies that use the WAT-1 as a measure of outcomes only, or to validate another measure will be excluded. Any studies that use the WAT-1 in adult populations (&gt;18 years of age) will be excluded. In alignment with specific COSMIN recommendations, posters and abstracts will be excluded because they do not have enough information about the study design. Only articles available in English or French will be included.\n\nSearch strategy\nLiterature sources\nThe following electronic databases will be searched from inception to the date of submitting this protocol: Medline, Embase, and CINHAL. Once the included articles from electronic databases are identified, their reference lists will be screened for additional pertinent records. Finally, the original creator of the WAT-1 will be consulted for pertinent literature that may have been missed. \n\nSearch strategy\nThe search strategy was developed by the lead author (MZ) and reviewed by the research team (RA, MN) and a medical librarian. The search strategy used COSMIN\u2019s comprehensive methodological search filter for PubMed, with 97.4% sensitivity and 9.4% specificity in identifying studies on measurement properties. (27) This validated filter has been translated for Embase (28) and CINAHL. (29) No limits were applied to the publication type, date, age, or methodology. Each database search strategy appears in Appendix 1.\n\nData management\nFollowing the search, all identified records will be saved and uploaded into EndNote X9.1 (Clarivate Analytics, PA, USA) and duplicates removed. The papers will then be uploaded to the freely accessible web tool Rayyan QCRI. (30) Rayyan is a free web-tool designed to facilitate the screening of articles for systematic reviews.  \n\nSelection of studies\nTwo reviewers will independently screen the full sample of records. First, titles and abstracts of each record will be appraised against the eligibility criteria. Any article deemed relevant by either reviewer will be considered for full-text extraction. Following the abstract screening, full texts of the included articles will be retrieved and evaluated for eligibility. Any disagreement about eligibility at the full-text review stage will be resolved through discussion, or with a third investigator until a full consensus is obtained.\n\nData Extraction\nTwo independent reviewers will extract data using a predefined online data collection sheet provided by COSMIN and mounted on Microsoft Excel. (31) The reviewers will extract general characteristics of the instrument (e.g. mode of administration), the characteristics of the study sample (e.g. demographics, age, gender, disease), the results regarding the measurement properties and the feasibility and interpretability of the WAT-1. \nAssessment of included studies methodological quality\nThe COSMIN four-point risk-of-bias checklist will be used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. (22) The COSMIN four-point checklists contain several questions/standards concerning the design requirements and the necessary statistical methods for each measurement property to be evaluated. Each question or standard is scored as very good, adequate, doubtful, inadequate or not applicable (N/A). The overall score per measurement property per study is determined by taking the lowest rating of any question or standard for each measurement property (i.e. worst-score-counts).\n\nAssessment of measurement properties\nMeasurement properties are defined according to the COSMIN taxonomy. (24) Appendix 2 defines each measurement property. Evidence of good measurement properties will be based on COSMIN\u2019s (32) modified criteria for good measurement properties as adapted from Terwee et al (Appendix 3). (33) Measurement properties will be labeled as sufficient (+), insufficient (\u2013) or indeterminate (?). Interpretability and feasibility will be assessed qualitatively as they are not strictly a measurement property; however, they are important in assessing the utility of measures. \n\nSummarizing measurement properties results\nThe measurement property labels across studies will be qualitatively summarized into one overall category. If the results are inconsistent, the authors will subdivide included studies (e.g. based on population subgroup) to allow for qualitative summary. If this is not possible, then a summarized label of inconsistent will be given. Thus, the overall rating for the summarized results can be sufficient (+), insufficient (\u2013), inconsistent (\u00b1), or indeterminate (?). (Appendix 3) \n\nGrading the quality of evidence \nAfter summarizing and rating all evidence for each measurement property, the final step is to grade the quality of the evidence. The quality of the evidence refers to the confidence that the pooled or summarized result is trustworthy. The grading of the quality will be based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for systematic reviews of clinical trials. (34) This approach grades the quality of the evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low. (35)\n\nDiscussion\nThis systematic review aims to assess the psychometric properties, feasibility, interpretability and quality evidence of the WAT-1 tool. This tool measures IWS symptoms caused by opioid and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms in critically ill pediatric patients, to establish an early diagnosis and evaluate subsequent treatment effectiveness. Conducting a systematic review of measurement properties may further support the WAT-1\u2019s inclusion as a psychometrically robust tool for daily clinical use. Additionally, it may encourage increased use of the WAT-1, leading to an increased understanding and identification of IWS in pediatric populations, leading to more effective clinical treatments and, ultimately, improved patient outcomes.\n\nEthics\nNo ethical approval is required. This research uses already published literature. \n\nConflicts of Interest\nAll authors report no conflicts of interest.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Lydia Thorpe, the medical librarian from Ontario Tech University for peer-reviewing our search strategy. \n\nReferences\n1.\tBarr J, Fraser GL, Puntillo K, Ely EW, Gelinas C, Dasta JF, et al.

The papers will then be uploaded to the freely accessible web tool Rayyan QCRI. (30) Rayyan is a free web-tool designed to facilitate the screening of articles for systematic reviews.  \n\nSelection of studies\nTwo reviewers will independently screen the full sample of records. First, titles and abstracts of each record will be appraised against the eligibility criteria. Any article deemed relevant by either reviewer will be considered for full-text extraction. Following the abstract screening, full texts of the included articles will be retrieved and evaluated for eligibility. Any disagreement about eligibility at the full-text review stage will be resolved through discussion, or with a third investigator until a full consensus is obtained.\n\nData Extraction\nTwo independent reviewers will extract data using a predefined online data collection sheet provided by COSMIN and mounted on Microsoft Excel. (31) The reviewers will extract general characteristics of the instrument (e.g. mode of administration), the characteristics of the study sample (e.g. demographics, age, gender, disease), the results regarding the measurement properties and the feasibility and interpretability of the WAT-1. \nAssessment of included studies methodological quality\nThe COSMIN four-point risk-of-bias checklist will be used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. (22) The COSMIN four-point checklists contain several questions/standards concerning the design requirements and the necessary statistical methods for each measurement property to be evaluated. Each question or standard is scored as very good, adequate, doubtful, inadequate or not applicable (N/A). The overall score per measurement property per study is determined by taking the lowest rating of any question or standard for each measurement property (i.e. worst-score-counts).\n\nAssessment of measurement properties\nMeasurement properties are defined according to the COSMIN taxonomy. (24) Appendix 2 defines each measurement property. Evidence of good measurement properties will be based on COSMIN\u2019s (32) modified criteria for good measurement properties as adapted from Terwee et al (Appendix 3). (33) Measurement properties will be labeled as sufficient (+), insufficient (\u2013) or indeterminate (?). Interpretability and feasibility will be assessed qualitatively as they are not strictly a measurement property; however, they are important in assessing the utility of measures. \n\nSummarizing measurement properties results\nThe measurement property labels across studies will be qualitatively summarized into one overall category. If the results are inconsistent, the authors will subdivide included studies (e.g. based on population subgroup) to allow for qualitative summary. If this is not possible, then a summarized label of inconsistent will be given. Thus, the overall rating for the summarized results can be sufficient (+), insufficient (\u2013), inconsistent (\u00b1), or indeterminate (?). (Appendix 3) \n\nGrading the quality of evidence \nAfter summarizing and rating all evidence for each measurement property, the final step is to grade the quality of the evidence. The quality of the evidence refers to the confidence that the pooled or summarized result is trustworthy. The grading of the quality will be based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for systematic reviews of clinical trials. (34) This approach grades the quality of the evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low. (35)\n\nDiscussion\nThis systematic review aims to assess the psychometric properties, feasibility, interpretability and quality evidence of the WAT-1 tool. This tool measures IWS symptoms caused by opioid and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms in critically ill pediatric patients, to establish an early diagnosis and evaluate subsequent treatment effectiveness. Conducting a systematic review of measurement properties may further support the WAT-1\u2019s inclusion as a psychometrically robust tool for daily clinical use. Additionally, it may encourage increased use of the WAT-1, leading to an increased understanding and identification of IWS in pediatric populations, leading to more effective clinical treatments and, ultimately, improved patient outcomes.\n\nEthics\nNo ethical approval is required. This research uses already published literature. \n\nConflicts of Interest\nAll authors report no conflicts of interest.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Lydia Thorpe, the medical librarian from Ontario Tech University for peer-reviewing our search strategy. \n\nReferences\n1.\tBarr J, Fraser GL, Puntillo K, Ely EW, Gelinas C, Dasta JF, et al.

We aim to identify and assess the quality of existing measures regarding one of these domains: satisfaction with treatment received.\nWe have attached our protocol for preregistration", "uploader": [{"file_id": "5e3a93d9f1369e00448b1a2e", "file_name": "Protocol for OSF.docx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/s2z6r/files/osfstorage/5e3a93d9f1369e00448b1a2e", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e3a93d9f1369e00448b1a2e"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "c9a1d7344a986e0c8f4b474c0b8e5fc8e997927cef1a925dc0411a5807bb7c81"}}]}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=s2z6r", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "s2z6r", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "s2z6r", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/4xd67/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "4xd67", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4nfqj/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "4nfqj", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/s2z6r/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/s2z6r/"}}, {"id": "jbwp6", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Out-group bias and Performance Attribution for COVID-19 Response", "description": "This study examines factors that influence the way members of the public attribution blame or credit for the government's response to the spread of the COVID-19 virus in the United States.

Epidemiology of allergic rhinitis varies according to different factors like genetic constitution, racial differences, socio-economic conditions, chances of exposure to different allergens, sex, growth stages. AR shows high prevalence among developed countries. AR is managed with first and second anti histamines (56%), intra nasal corticosteroids (25%) and mast cell stabilizers (19%). Prolonged usage of these medications is necessary in beating the disease as far as the recurrence is concerned. This may lead to numerous serious health hazards. Studies have shown that negative effects of sedative anti-histamines last to the succeeding day disturbing the day time performance.

Funnel plots will be generated to detect publication bias if more than 10 trials are identified to report the same outcomes. If appropriate, we will use cumulative meta-analyses. Results of meta-analyses will be visualized by forest plots. In addition, we will conduct trial sequential analysis to evaluate the meta-analyses for primary outcomes, which can reveal the required information size and potentially false results in a meta-analysis.

Prolonged usage of these medications is necessary in beating the disease as far as the recurrence is concerned. This may lead to numerous serious health hazards. Studies have shown that negative effects of sedative anti-histamines last to the succeeding day disturbing the day time performance.
