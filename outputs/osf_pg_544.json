Harmonic priming effects for unscrambled chord sequences", "description": "This study examines whether scrambling the order of chords in a tonal harmonic progression inhibits the speed and accuracy of processing in two behavioral harmonic priming experiments. Sixteen 9-chord sequences were selected from Bach\u2019s chorales that either remain unchanged (thereby reflecting low temporal incoherence), or were scrambled to produce increasingly incoherent sequences (i.e., medium or high). To produce the scrambled conditions, a variable-order n-gram model (Pearce, 2005) was trained on a corpus of Roman numeral annotations from 100 Bach chorales (Verbeten &amp; Sears, 2019). It then identified the scrambled versions (scrambling chords 2-8) that produced either medium or high estimates of model uncertainty.

This study's design, while not expressly mixed-methods, incorporates a combination of quantiative and qualitative methods, though it is primarily going to use a phenomenological, grounded theory design to explore the lived experiences of our sample population. \nFor the phenomenological, grounded theory, qualitative component, a semi-structured interviewing protocol was developed via a comprehensive process. The researchers wanted to develop a suitable means of collecting our data that both evoked rich description of their lived experiences of meaning-making during the Student Veteran's transitions into college, as well as, minimized the influence of the interviewers. Thus, the research team used the extant literature to develop an initial set of questions that was checked for factors that might unduly influence the interviewees (e.g., non-directionality of questions, clear protocols regarding probing questions communicated to the research team, how to answer questions about the study without giving any hints as to the research team\u2019s hypotheses, and standardized training of research assistants used as interviewers). Then, the research team sent the interview to an objective expert outside of the university who is familiar with both the praxes of qualitative inquiry and the literature on Veterans\u2019 mental health \u2013 Duane France, LPCC, - a nationally award winning licensed cliniican that works with Veterans (Duane is also a five time combat Veteran while also attending school part-time as a student-Veteran \u2013  for additional feedback that was then implemented by the research team. The researcher team then piloted the interview with a real student-Veteran (SV) that is familiar with the Primary Investigator (and that will not be used in the final research study). The interview was checked for time and then processed with the volunteer SV for feedback on content, directionality of the questions, safety versus invasiveness, quality of interview location/environment (e.g., convenience for participants), and for feedback on whether any questions should be added. \nStudent-Veterans will first be asked to complete a brief survey either at home prior to the interview or using the Warrior-Wellness Lab's equipment (i.e., a research iPad). This survey contains the informed consent, some screening questions to re-ensure participants meet the inclusion-exclusion criterion, a demographics questionnaire, Steger and colleague's (2006) Meaning-in-Life questionnaire and Zimet's (XXXX) Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support to assess variance in the sample population on two subscales of meaning-making within the sample population (i.e., the search for and presence of meaning) and perceptions of social support. This is critical so that the research team can attempt to speak to whether the sample population already appears to perceive a sense of meaning in life on average or whether they appear to be actively seeking it out, and whether they feel connected to others (i.e., linked in the extant scholarship as being predictive of transitional stress) \u2013 factors that assuredly might affect the kinds of responses they provide to questions around their lived experiences of meaning-making while transitioning from the military and into college. Further, descriptive statistics will be calculated regarding the demographics of the sample population used in the study (i.e., via the demographics survey) for sampling and reporting purposes.\nMost data for this study that will be used for analyis will be transcribed semi-sturctured interviews meticulously conducted by student research assistants of the Warrior Wellness Lab (as opposed to by the pimary investigator, which might introduce bias during the interviewing process). As such, the research team plans to implement nine credibility checks during the data gathering and analyses (i.e., open-coding) of recorded interviews recommended by Butterfield et al. (2009) to enhance the trustworthiness of our qualitative research outcomes - especially as it will be using a grounded-theory research design. A first safeguard noted by Butterfield and colleagues (2009) is usage of audio (and video) recorded interviews which will be used with all participants. This data will be securely locked away in a locked cabinet inside a locked office belonging to the PI and will use two audio-recorders and a Go-Pro attached to a tripod for each interview, all provided to the Warrior Wellness Lab by the psych department with the PI\u2019s start-up funds. For interview fidelity, the PI has developed a standardized plan to train the research team on using the extensively-developed semi-structured interviewing protocol discussed earlier. In addition to all of the interviewers using the same interview, their training will include: asking non-directional questions, clear protocols regarding probing questions communicated to the research team, how to answer questions about the study without giving any hints as to the research team\u2019s hypotheses, and standardized training of research assistants used as interviewers. We also plan to have a student that did not do any interviewing but that underwent the standardized training to audit every 4th interview to provide feedback to the interviewers about whether they were faithful to the protocol presented in the training provided by the PI. For another safeguard, during the coding process, one research assistant will extract one quarter of the transcribed interviews. Then, the PI will compare the independently extracted items with those extracted by the PI earlier in the process and will strive to come to a consensus where they appear to diverge. Any codes where consensus cannot be achieved will be discounted from the study. \nFurther, initial coding by the PI will continue until it appears that no other codes emerge (i.e., exhaustiveness). Categories will need a 25% participation rate to be considered viable (Borden &amp; Amundson, 1984; Butterfield et al., 2009). In other words, for a category to be considered viable, it will need to have been \u201cendorsed\u201d by at least one quarter of the study\u2019s participants, per Butterfield et al. (2009). Code category placement will be assessed by an independent judge, wherein, one quarter of the total codes created by the PI will be randomly selected. A research assistant will then try to place them in the appropriate categories chosen initially by the PI. The independent research assistant must match the PI\u2019s categories 80 percent of the time for the category to be deemed sufficient. Categories with less than an 80 percent congruence will be handled by seeking consensus with the research assistant and using follow-up interviews with participants during cross-checks to determine whether to keep a category. Cross-checking by participants in post will also occur. Participants that agreed to be contacted for a follow-up interview will be asked to participate provide some written responses to a series of interview questions, post data-gathering. The electronic follow-up interview will be used to appraise the degree of participant-consensus on the identified codes and categories, whether they appear clear and accurately represent what they intended to communicate, and whether any codes should fall under a different category (Butterfield et al., 2009). The research team can also use this as an opportunity to receive and answer questions participants may have about their participation in the research study. \nAffirmation of cateogories will be sought by expert opinion. Similar to Butterfield and colleagues\u2019 (2009) use of expert confirmation, our research team will use an objective expert again - Duane France, LPCC, NCC \u2013 a national award-winning expert in clinical work with Veterans and student-Veterans \u2013 as a means of determining whether the categories that emerge during the coding process appear to have utility in exploring the phenomenon in question (i.e., lived experiences of meaning-making in student-Veterans), whether any categories appear to be missing, and whether any categories seemed surprising. Last but not least, the research team will explore theoretical agreement using the extant scholarship. The research team plans to compare categories that emerge through the coding process with extant theory and literature and if any category does not appear to align with pre-existing theory or research, it will be considered a potential variable of interest for future studies (Butterfield et al. (2009).\n  Given that this is exploratory qualitative research with little to no extant research or literature to found any hypotheses and not seeking to make broad generalizations to a wider population of student-Veterans, the qualitative grounded theory design described above is strongly appropriate for exploring the lived experiences (i.e., phenomenology) of meaning-making during the student-Veterans' transition to college.

This rigorous mixed-methods study will seek to better understand the lived experiences of meaning-making in a sample of student Veterans via both qualitative and quantitative means.

This study's design, while not expressly mixed-methods, incorporates a combination of quantiative and qualitative methods, though it is primarily going to use a phenomenological, grounded theory design to explore the lived experiences of our sample population. \nFor the phenomenological, grounded theory, qualitative component, a semi-structured interviewing protocol was developed via a comprehensive process. The researchers wanted to develop a suitable means of collecting our data that both evoked rich description of their lived experiences of meaning-making during the Student Veteran's transitions into college, as well as, minimized the influence of the interviewers. Thus, the research team used the extant literature to develop an initial set of questions that was checked for factors that might unduly influence the interviewees (e.g., non-directionality of questions, clear protocols regarding probing questions communicated to the research team, how to answer questions about the study without giving any hints as to the research team\u2019s hypotheses, and standardized training of research assistants used as interviewers). Then, the research team sent the interview to an objective expert outside of the university who is familiar with both the praxes of qualitative inquiry and the literature on Veterans\u2019 mental health \u2013 Duane France, LPCC, - a nationally award winning licensed cliniican that works with Veterans (Duane is also a five time combat Veteran while also attending school part-time as a student-Veteran \u2013  for additional feedback that was then implemented by the research team. The researcher team then piloted the interview with a real student-Veteran (SV) that is familiar with the Primary Investigator (and that will not be used in the final research study). The interview was checked for time and then processed with the volunteer SV for feedback on content, directionality of the questions, safety versus invasiveness, quality of interview location/environment (e.g., convenience for participants), and for feedback on whether any questions should be added. \nStudent-Veterans will first be asked to complete a brief survey either at home prior to the interview or using the Warrior-Wellness Lab's equipment (i.e., a research iPad). This survey contains the informed consent, some screening questions to re-ensure participants meet the inclusion-exclusion criterion, a demographics questionnaire, Steger and colleague's (2006) Meaning-in-Life questionnaire and Zimet's (XXXX) Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support to assess variance in the sample population on two subscales of meaning-making within the sample population (i.e., the search for and presence of meaning) and perceptions of social support. This is critical so that the research team can attempt to speak to whether the sample population already appears to perceive a sense of meaning in life on average or whether they appear to be actively seeking it out, and whether they feel connected to others (i.e., linked in the extant scholarship as being predictive of transitional stress) \u2013 factors that assuredly might affect the kinds of responses they provide to questions around their lived experiences of meaning-making while transitioning from the military and into college. Further, descriptive statistics will be calculated regarding the demographics of the sample population used in the study (i.e., via the demographics survey) for sampling and reporting purposes.\nMost data for this study that will be used for analyis will be transcribed semi-sturctured interviews meticulously conducted by student research assistants of the Warrior Wellness Lab (as opposed to by the pimary investigator, which might introduce bias during the interviewing process). As such, the research team plans to implement nine credibility checks during the data gathering and analyses (i.e., open-coding) of recorded interviews recommended by Butterfield et al. (2009) to enhance the trustworthiness of our qualitative research outcomes - especially as it will be using a grounded-theory research design.

There is no limited SNP list (as was the case for the pilot and replication studies) that needs to be defined in order to choose a single multiple comparison correction factor in advance.  Instead, the criteria for significance will be p&lt;2x10-8 (derived for whole genome with allele frequencies as small as 0.005 per https://www.nature.com/articles/ejhg2015269), or per the bonferonni correction for as many SNPs as are found to have minor frequencies &lt; 0.005, whichever criteria is larger (as both are conservative).  For this process, i-numbered SNPs in 23andMe will be ignored unless a corresponding rs-ID was assigned as determined by chromosome and positions reported in data sets created later in time.  When an i-number or rs-ID are within 1 in position, they may be taken as the same SNP.\n\nThe \u201cgeneral population\u201d data base will be constructed with all Databases available at dbSNP for each of the following 6 ethnicities: African, East Asian, Europe, South Asian, American, and Ashkenazi Jewish.  East Asian, South Asian and Europe are as defined at www.thefreedictionary.com.\n\nSample ethnicities will be determined at www.gedmatch.com with the \"admixture heritage analysis\" tool using the MDLP Project option, with \"Admixture Proportions (With link to Oracle)\" selected, and the MDLP World-22 calculator model.  For the purpose of calculating the representative \u201cgeneral population\u201d, each sample ethnicity that registers greater than 10% will be mapped to the 6 dpSNP ethnicities as shown by example in Appendix A of the report titled PANDAS&amp;PANS_Genetic_Association_Replication_Report at https://osf.io/wcbr9.\n\nThe dbSNP databases can be found at  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rsXXXXXX#frequency_tab , where XXXXXX is the SNP rs#.", "sample": "139 data sets have already been collected from willing participants or their guardians as a result of the pilot and replication studies reported upon here (https://osf.io/wcbr9).

The probability of obtaining the sample from the general population (under the null hypothesis) will be calculated as a binomial probability, reported for each SNP individually. A p-value will be reported as the result in this study. \n\nBecause the survey group may include widely varying ethnicities, the \u201cgeneral population\u201d reference allele frequency will be crafted to reflect the sample\u2019s ethnicity, via allele proportions that are reported for each of several broad ethnicities.

If relatives show among anonymous data, the oldest may not be determinable, in which case the file with the older date stamp will be kept, and the newer file excluded.  (Note that the above exclusion criteria have already been applied to the existing 139 data sets, they will be applied to additional data sets received until a Feb. 1, 2020 cutoff date).\n\nSNPs with minor allele frequencies of less than 0.005 for the European ethnicity (as listed by 1000Genomes, or gnomAD Exome Data if the latter exists for the SNP) will be excluded from the analysis.

We likewise expected to see stronger physical sensations associated with urge among the short term goals compared to the other terms, consistent with definitions provided in Study 1.\n\tHypothesis 4: We predicted that temptation would differ from the other terms as being less pleasant, associated with lower likelihood of pursuing action, and being less internally driven. Finding that temptation is associated with lower pleasantness than the other three terms would replicate the within-subjects finding from Study 1. \nHypothesis 5: Finally, we expected that the terms urge and temptation will be rated as less natural to use for long term-goals compared to desire and craving.  Urge and temptation imply momentary impulsive processes to a stronger degree than desire and craving, suggesting they may be less salient for long-term goals, but equally salient as desire and craving for short-term goals. \n\tAdditional prediction: Unrelated to differences in terms, we anticipated that in general people would find long term goals more internal and associated with a greater likelihood of action compared to short term goals, and that internality and likelihood of action would be correlated.  \n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.
