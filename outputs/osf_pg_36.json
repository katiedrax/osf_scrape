All data was collected through the online program Second Life (SL).This program allows users to create their own avatar (independent of how they actually look) and interact with other avatars controlled by people from around the world. In the current study, we used this platform as a means to assess social distancing from black avatars as a result of anti-black racism and how this experience affects the outgroup discomfort measures of the non-black users piloting black avatars.

In this way, they termed outgroup comfort to be an advantageous trait that is predictive of resilience, confidence and improved mental health especially in black students (Cole &amp; Yip 2008). They also found that one\u2019s outgroup comfort measure was predictive of interracial contact. Because I am more interested in racial discomfort within the context of this study, however, I will be reverse coding all the items in this scale. In this current study, I will be using  measure (inversely coded) in combination with proxemics data to determine differences in racial social distancing. \n\nSocial distance\n\tIn order to measure social distance, we developed a script in Second Life that took a snapshot of how many avatars were within 5 meters of the embodied avatar.This script triggered about every ten seconds of gameplay. We then totaled and averaged how many avatars were within a 5 meter range for each 10 minute trial period. Because each participant had two ten minute trials, they each have two scores pertaining to the average number of avatars they came in contact with over a trial period. \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q16": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q17": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "H1:  My first hypothesis will be tested with a Repeated Measures ANOVA.\nH2: My second hypothesis will be tested with a Within Group Mediation analysis.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q21": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q23": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Emmy Biddle, John Tawa", "q2": "H1: Participants will maintain greater social distance while operating a Black vs. non \nBlack avatar.\nH2: Outgroup Discomfort will mediate differences in social distancing when participants use a Black or non-Black avatar. \n", "q3": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

In their study, they created a 16-point scale used to measure relative racial outgroup comfort among black and white college students. In this way, they termed outgroup comfort to be an advantageous trait that is predictive of resilience, confidence and improved mental health especially in black students (Cole &amp; Yip 2008). They also found that one\u2019s outgroup comfort measure was predictive of interracial contact. Because I am more interested in racial discomfort within the context of this study, however, I will be reverse coding all the items in this scale. In this current study, I will be using  measure (inversely coded) in combination with proxemics data to determine differences in racial social distancing. \n\nSocial distance\n\tIn order to measure social distance, we developed a script in Second Life that took a snapshot of how many avatars were within 5 meters of the embodied avatar.This script triggered about every ten seconds of gameplay. We then totaled and averaged how many avatars were within a 5 meter range for each 10 minute trial period. Because each participant had two ten minute trials, they each have two scores pertaining to the average number of avatars they came in contact with over a trial period. \n", "q15.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "H1:  My first hypothesis will be tested with a Repeated Measures ANOVA.\nH2: My second hypothesis will be tested with a Within Group Mediation analysis.\n", "q17.uploader": []}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecac48", "text": "Social and Behavioral Sciences"}]]}, "relationships": {"license": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965", "type": "licenses"}}, "children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=ca76n", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "ca76n", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "ca76n", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/ycdvg/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "ycdvg", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n4hs5/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "n4hs5", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5e795fc0d2833800195735d0/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5e795fc0d2833800195735d0", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/ca76n/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ca76n/"}}, {"id": "4dbe7", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Intragastric botulinum toxin A injection is an effective obesity therapy for patients with BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2: a systematic review and meta-analysis", "description": "The effect of intragastric injection of BTA remains debatable.

R Package, Version 1.3.2.) to unpack any significant interactions and to test whether changes in performance over wake and over sleep are statistically significant. Furthermore, in both sessions we will run paired comparisons (trained vs untrained) to determine whether significant lexical competition is found for each group.\n\nExploratory analyses: We plan to perform cross-experiment analyses, comparing data from the current study in children with a previously collected data set from adults (see https://osf.io/63p2e). Firstly, sleep architecture during the nap (e.g., total sleep time, time spent in each sleep stage and spindle density) will be compared across children and adults. Next, change over sleep in lexical competition and explicit memory (proportion change) will be compared between children (nap group) and adults (sleep condition).

Mixed effects logistic regression models will be used to model binary outcomes (cued recall accuracy; and if not at ceiling pause detection and speeded recognition accuracy) and linear mixed-effects models for continuous outcome data (pause detection and speeded recognition reaction times to accurate responses). For each dependent variable, fixed effects of Group (sleep vs wake; -.5, +.5) and Session ( pre-test vs post-test; -.5, +.5) will be included. For the pause detection task, Trained (trained vs not-trained; -.5 + .5) will be an additional independent variable. Based on tests of normality, a transformation (log or inverse) will be used to normalise the distribution of RTs if the data are found to be skewed (Brysbaert &amp; Stevens, 2018). Specifically for the pause detection task, response latencies will be measured in all cases from a marker in the digitized speech files that represented the onset of the pause in the pause-present condition (i.e. RTs measured from the same point in the speech in all cases). The fixed-effects structure will be simplified using a backwards selection procedure from the maximal fixed-effects structure, using Likelihood ratio tests (LRT) and a liberal criterion of p less than 0.2 to justify inclusion. Random intercepts and slopes will also be justified using a liberal criterion for model improvement of p &lt; 0.2 via LRT and added until no further model improvement could be established (Barr, 2013). The p-values will be provided by lmerTest (Kuznetsova, Brockhoff, &amp; Christensen, 2017). Correlations will be run between each of the PSG sleep parameters (spindle density, fast and slow sigma power, delta power and time in SWS) and over-nap changes in lexical competition and explicit memory. To determine signal power, spectral analyses will be conducted on artefact-free NREM epochs using Fast Fourier Transformation on central channels at 12.5-16 Hz for fast spindle power and on frontal channels at 9-12.5 Hz for slow spindle power (Muehlroth et al, 2019). For delta activity (0.3 \u2013 4 Hz), power will be averaged across frontal and central electrodes. To determine NREM total spindles, a continuous wavelet transform with a morlet basis function in central and frontal channels will be used at (9-16 Hz) (Tsanas &amp; Clifford, 2015). This analysis will also be repeated in frequency bands 9-12.5 Hz and 12.5-16 Hz to explore both fast and slow spindles, respectively. Although we anticipate using these specified frequency bands, we will first visually inspect the power spectra to see whether peaks are observed within these bands. In all cases, spindle density values will reflect the number of spindles per minute of NREM sleep. Oscillatory power values will be log transformed before correlations are performed.

Participants with accuracy z-scores less than -3.29 will be excluded.

(2010), we plan to run paired comparisons using the package emmeans (Lenth, Singmann, Love, Buerkner, Herve, 2018, emmeans: Estimated Marginal Means, aka Least-Squares Means. R Package, Version 1.3.2.) to unpack any significant interactions and to test whether changes in performance over wake and over sleep are statistically significant. Furthermore, in both sessions we will run paired comparisons (trained vs untrained) to determine whether significant lexical competition is found for each group.\n\nExploratory analyses: We plan to perform cross-experiment analyses, comparing data from the current study in children with a previously collected data set from adults (see https://osf.io/63p2e). Firstly, sleep architecture during the nap (e.g., total sleep time, time spent in each sleep stage and spindle density) will be compared across children and adults. Next, change over sleep in lexical competition and explicit memory (proportion change) will be compared between children (nap group) and adults (sleep condition). ", "sample": "55 participants in total will take part. The study uses a between-subjects design,  therefore there will be 55 observations in total; 40 in the sleep group and 15 in the wake group. Sample size was determined based on previous research (e.g. Smith et al., 2018) to be large enough to detect the expected correlations between behavioural change and sleep, whilst accounting for data loss from children that may not be able to nap in the afternoon.", "analyses": "Data will be analysed using R, with models fitted using the package lme4 (Bates, Maechler, Bolker, &amp; Walker, 2014) and figures made using ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016). Mixed effects logistic regression models will be used to model binary outcomes (cued recall accuracy; and if not at ceiling pause detection and speeded recognition accuracy) and linear mixed-effects models for continuous outcome data (pause detection and speeded recognition reaction times to accurate responses). For each dependent variable, fixed effects of Group (sleep vs wake; -.5, +.5) and Session ( pre-test vs post-test; -.5, +.5) will be included. For the pause detection task, Trained (trained vs not-trained; -.5 + .5) will be an additional independent variable. Based on tests of normality, a transformation (log or inverse) will be used to normalise the distribution of RTs if the data are found to be skewed (Brysbaert &amp; Stevens, 2018). Specifically for the pause detection task, response latencies will be measured in all cases from a marker in the digitized speech files that represented the onset of the pause in the pause-present condition (i.e. RTs measured from the same point in the speech in all cases). The fixed-effects structure will be simplified using a backwards selection procedure from the maximal fixed-effects structure, using Likelihood ratio tests (LRT) and a liberal criterion of p less than 0.2 to justify inclusion. Random intercepts and slopes will also be justified using a liberal criterion for model improvement of p &lt; 0.2 via LRT and added until no further model improvement could be established (Barr, 2013). The p-values will be provided by lmerTest (Kuznetsova, Brockhoff, &amp; Christensen, 2017). Correlations will be run between each of the PSG sleep parameters (spindle density, fast and slow sigma power, delta power and time in SWS) and over-nap changes in lexical competition and explicit memory. To determine signal power, spectral analyses will be conducted on artefact-free NREM epochs using Fast Fourier Transformation on central channels at 12.5-16 Hz for fast spindle power and on frontal channels at 9-12.5 Hz for slow spindle power (Muehlroth et al, 2019). For delta activity (0.3 \u2013 4 Hz), power will be averaged across frontal and central electrodes. To determine NREM total spindles, a continuous wavelet transform with a morlet basis function in central and frontal channels will be used at (9-16 Hz) (Tsanas &amp; Clifford, 2015). This analysis will also be repeated in frequency bands 9-12.5 Hz and 12.5-16 Hz to explore both fast and slow spindles, respectively. Although we anticipate using these specified frequency bands, we will first visually inspect the power spectra to see whether peaks are observed within these bands. In all cases, spindle density values will reflect the number of spindles per minute of NREM sleep. Oscillatory power values will be log transformed before correlations are performed.

responses in the syllogistic reasoning task", "description": "The psychology of reasoning investigates the cognitive processes driving human inferential mechanisms. In the syllogistic reasoning task, as a core domain of human reasoning research, participants are typically instructed to derive a conclusion from two quantified statements called the premises. The two premises each have one of four quantifiers, called moods, in their syllogistic combination: All (abbreviated by A), Some (I), None (E), and Some...not (O). The terms in the premises (the sets of entities) can be arranged in four different ways called figures. In combination, there are a total 64 different kinds of reasoning problems, one illustrated in the following example: \n\nAll A are B.\nSome B are C.\nWhat, if anything, follows?\n\nThe task is to generate a response about the two unrelated terms, A and C, using one of the quantifiers (8 conclusions: e.g., \u201cSome A are C\u201d, \u201cNo C are A\u201d, etc.) or to conclude that \u201cno logically valid conclusion\u201d \u2013 NVC for short \u2013 follows. Thus, in total, there are 9 different response options/ conclusions. Syllogisms where a conclusion with a quantifier logically follows are called valid and those were NVC is the logically correct response are called invalid syllogisms (which is the case in the given example).\n\nIn recent studies, we were able demonstrate that people greatly differ in their tendency to respond \u201cNVC\u201d (e.g., Ragni, Dames, Brand, &amp; Riesterer, 2019). It generally appears that participants interpret the \u201cNVC\u201d response option differently: For instance, while some participants seem to avoid this response option (possibly feeling uncomfortable concluding that one can infer nothing given two premises), others appear to assign it a meaning of \u201cI give up\u201d and use it frequently instead. From a diagnostical view, this is highly problematic: The way the syllogistic reasoning task is currently designed and used, individuals\u2019 interpretations of a response option differ, thus, contaminating the actual measure of interest (individuals\u2019 reasoning processes or abilities). This is particularly problematic in view of the fact that about two thirds of the 64 syllogism schemes do not allow for a logical conclusion, i.e. NVC is the logically correct answer. Thus, in many cases the logically correct answer coincides with the answer that is often chosen when respondents give up or avoid the NVC response options. This observation immediately raises the question whether an additional opt-out response option (e.g., \u201cI tried my best, but I could not find a conclusion\u201d) would solve this issue and provide a better estimation of participants\u2019 actual reasoning processes.\n\nThe current experiment investigates this question by presenting half of the participants with only the 9 possible conclusions (control group) and the other half with an opt-out response option in addition to the classic 9 conclusions (experimental group).", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-14T07:32:12.570426", "date_modified": "2020-04-14T07:24:43.747712", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["reasoning", "response options", "syllogisms"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "a10005dad8fdd5f8ba51737ac658b5760c47903aa6e0bf372047ae7dbf7466bd0cb5085685790bf2d90b54f2cf9026352b6a39d3d47a45ab57a0d974d35100dfc250bedaaabb71fd87bc00ba8c778fa4143585a6e5c0ddf27df0cdd20da869b828cf8e3f35b65f50a8c88aeba37747099d1e7b3bda83afd2a5f32a620d13df4d6e4d1ba219cf3c718b53d019a0d991da", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-14T07:32:12.547847", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Hannah Dames, Marco Ragni, Niklas Schulte"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Control Group = 9 response options/ conclusions (8 conclusions required for valid syllogisms + NVC required for invalid syllogisms)\n\nExperimental Group = 9 response options + 1 \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d response option\n\nH1: In the experimental group, the relative frequency of \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d responses is significantly higher than 0%. \n\nH2a: The likelihood to respond NVC (\u201cno valid conclusion\u201d) significantly differs between the control and the experimental group.\n\nH2b: The effect of group (control vs. experimental) is stronger for invalid than for valid syllogisms.  \n\nFurthermore, we will exploratively investigate whether the likelihood to give a correct response changes between the control and the experimental group. \n"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.
