Next, they will be randomly assigned to either the high cognitive load (High) or low cognitive load (Low) condition. Participants in High will be asked to memorize a 9-digit number throughout the study and participants in Low will be asked to memorize a 3-digit number. They will be asked NOT to use external aids to help memorize the number because it is really important for our study and doing so would invalidate the data and severely compromise our research. They will also be told that if they can correctly recall the number later in the study, they will receive a bonus payment. Following these instructions, they will be presented with a string of number. \nAfter that, participants will complete measures of (a) expressions of hurt feelings that they intend to perform next time they are hurt, (b) attribution and forgiveness, (c) state attitudes toward their current relationships, (d) emotion to be expected next time they are hurt, (e) expressions of hurt feelings that they may way to perform.\nNext, they will be asked to recall the number.

Three agreeableness scores will be computed from each of the three agreeableness measures. We will focus generally on the Big Five Inventory-Agreeableness subscale as our main predictor. We will also examine the BFAS and TIPI-Agreeableness subscale.\nii.\tGeneral trust, general communal motivation, general self-regulation, love for partner, and relationship satisfaction.

Based on the principal component analysis and scree plot of this scale in our past study, we expect 5 factors to emerge\u2014a) positive, direct expressions, b) negative, direct expressions, c) covert optimistic behaviors, d) negative, indirect expressions, and e) affectionate behaviors.

The item \u201cthe hurtful incident is an accident\u201d will be reverse-scored. An average of attribution will be computed with this reverse-scored item, and the other 5 items (i.e., my partner is insensitive or inconsiderate; my partner is trying to hurt me; my partner\u2019s behavior is intentional; my partner is deserving of blame; my partner\u2019s behavior is motivated by concerns that are selfish).\nvi.\tForgiveness. An average will be created from two items (i.e., forgive my partner for hurting me; completely forgive my partner).", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question2c": "i.\tMultiple regression will be conducted to test our hypotheses. We will regress each outcome variable (e.g., negative, direct expressions of hurt feelings) on agreeableness (mean-centered), condition (high load vs. low load; effects coded), and their interaction term. If there is a significant interaction, we will probe the effect of agreeableness in both high- and low-load conditions using dummy codes, and the effect of condition at +1 SD and -1 SD of agreeableness. (If there is no significant condition effect, we will collapse across conditions and regress the outcome variables only on agreeableness.)\nii.\tMediation analyses will be run to test the hypotheses regarding indirect pathways as listed under hypotheses. Mediation analyses will be conducted using the \u201clavaan\u201d package in R (Rosseel, 2012). Simple mediation analyses will be run for each outcome variable and each hypothesized mediator separately. For example, one model will examine agreeableness as the predictor, general communal motivation as the mediator, and negative, direct expressions of hurt feelings as the outcome variable. Another model will involve the same predictor and mediator, but with a different outcome variable, such as forgiveness. We will also run moderated mediation analyses to examine whether and how condition affects the pattern of the indirect pathways.\n", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question3c": "Agreeableness will be a predictor.

The aim of this study is to determine whether person-first language effectively reduces bias, and, if so, are there differences between disorders. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions based on language use. The conditions will be (1) person-first language, (2)  identity-first language, and (3) noun-based language. For each, they will read and rate three job applications with three different disorders: (1) schizophrenia, (2) major depressive disorder (MDD), and (3) epilepsy.

The original 22-item scale measures personality, power, competence, and professionalism of applicants (example items include: Intelligent, Powerful, Competent, Cooperative, and Strong). Because stigma influences perceived competence (Sadler &amp; Vaughn, 2015), four more items were added from the stereotype content model (Fiske et al., 2002) to measure competence. Ratings will be completed on a scale of 1 \u201cNot at all\u201d to 7 \u201cExtremely.\u201d After reading each application, participants will be asked to rate how much each characteristic was true of the applicant.\n\nPerceived social status was measured using The MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status (Adler et al., 2000, Ostrove et al., 2000). Participants were shown a picture of a ladder with rungs labeled from 1 through 10. Participants were instructed that the bottom of the ladder represented people who were the worst off (e.g., had the least education, least money, and least respected jobs), while the top of the ladder represented people who were the best off (e.g., had the most education, most money, and most respected jobs). The single rating served as the participants' score for their subjective social status.\n\n The Dangerousness Scale (Penn et al., 1994) was used to measure perceived dangerousness, or participants\u2019 beliefs about whether individuals with mental illness are dangerous (Sample items: \u201cIf I know a person has a mental illness, I will be less likely to trust him\u201d; \u201cIf a formal mental patient applied for a teaching position at a grade school, I would recommend hiring him/her.\u201d [reversed]). Ratings were completed on a scale of  1 \u201cStrongly agree\u201d to 7 \u201cStrongly disagree.\u201d Rather than pertaining directly to the character in the vignette, the items on the scale pertain to generalized beliefs about individuals with mental illness.\n\nWe used the Level of Contact Report (Holmes et al., 1999) to measure the level of intimate contact with mental illness. The scale consists of 12 items ranging from low intimacy (i.e.,  \u201cI have watched a movie or a television show in which a character depicted a person with mental illness\u201d) to high intimacy (\u201cI live with a person with a mental illness\u201d).

Identity-first language frames the disability first, then the person. (e.g., \u201ca schizophrenic person\u201d) Noun-based language refers to the person as their disorder or disability (e.g., \u201ca schizophrenic\u201d).\n", "q14.uploader": [], "q15.question": "The outcome measure will be perceived employability of the job applicant. The 22-item Employee Characteristics Scale (ECS) measures the employability of a job applicant (Christman &amp; Slaten, 1991). The original 22-item scale measures personality, power, competence, and professionalism of applicants (example items include: Intelligent, Powerful, Competent, Cooperative, and Strong). Because stigma influences perceived competence (Sadler &amp; Vaughn, 2015), four more items were added from the stereotype content model (Fiske et al., 2002) to measure competence. Ratings will be completed on a scale of 1 \u201cNot at all\u201d to 7 \u201cExtremely.\u201d After reading each application, participants will be asked to rate how much each characteristic was true of the applicant.\n\nPerceived social status was measured using The MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status (Adler et al., 2000, Ostrove et al., 2000). Participants were shown a picture of a ladder with rungs labeled from 1 through 10. Participants were instructed that the bottom of the ladder represented people who were the worst off (e.g., had the least education, least money, and least respected jobs), while the top of the ladder represented people who were the best off (e.g., had the most education, most money, and most respected jobs). The single rating served as the participants' score for their subjective social status.\n\n The Dangerousness Scale (Penn et al., 1994) was used to measure perceived dangerousness, or participants\u2019 beliefs about whether individuals with mental illness are dangerous (Sample items: \u201cIf I know a person has a mental illness, I will be less likely to trust him\u201d; \u201cIf a formal mental patient applied for a teaching position at a grade school, I would recommend hiring him/her.\u201d [reversed]). Ratings were completed on a scale of  1 \u201cStrongly agree\u201d to 7 \u201cStrongly disagree.\u201d Rather than pertaining directly to the character in the vignette, the items on the scale pertain to generalized beliefs about individuals with mental illness.\n\nWe used the Level of Contact Report (Holmes et al., 1999) to measure the level of intimate contact with mental illness. The scale consists of 12 items ranging from low intimacy (i.e.,  \u201cI have watched a movie or a television show in which a character depicted a person with mental illness\u201d) to high intimacy (\u201cI live with a person with a mental illness\u201d). Each item was given a ranking of intimacy, from 1 to 12. Participants were instructed to select all items that applied to them. The highest ranked item served as the participant\u2019s score for level of contact.\n", "q15.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Before conducting analyses of hypotheses, all variables will be graphed and assessed for normality.

We will include control variables as indicated. To test our main hypotheses, we will use 3 x 3 ANCOVAs to test for the main effects of language, disorder, and the interaction term of language and disorders, on the dependent variables of employability characteristics.

We found no evidence that trigger warnings were helpful for trauma survivors, for those who self-reported a PTSD diagnosis, or for those who qualified for probable PTSD, even when survivors' trauma matched the passages' content. We found substantial evidence that trigger warnings countertherapeutically reinforce survivors' view of their trauma as central to their identity.
