This measure, also called \u201csocial distancing\u201d, represents a paradigmatic, yet unprecedented form of collective action. It is paradigmatic because it relies on individuals\u2019 readiness to change behaviour, invest effort and agree to self-sacrifices for a collective benefit (Zomeren &amp; Iyer, 2009). It is unprecedented  because it needs to happen fast under threat conditions and it aims at a collective benefit which spans multiple geographical scales, from one\u2019s own household to the entire planet.\n\nIn such threatening contexts, people typically seek further affiliation and social contact (Dezecache, 2015; Dezecache et al., 2017). Yet, what is currently required is to decrease the amount of physical social interactions, which poses a unique challenge for collective action. Sustaining such collective action can be materially and mentally costly to the individual by virtue of affecting daily life, causing cognitive dissonance, triggering moral re-evaluations and deviating from familiar behavioural norms (Strong, 1990). Having a supportive social network can help with sustaining collective action by improving psychological well-being (Helliwell &amp; Putnam, 2004), providing a support network (Oliver &amp; Marwell, 1988) and fostering a sense of normativity (Ostrom, 2000). Relatedly, research suggests that sustainable behaviour change depends not only on what one personally believes is right (unconditional norm-following) but also on what one thinks others in their social networks believe is right (conditional on normative social expectations) and de facto do (empirical social expectations; Bicchieri, 2016). Building on a \u201cconditional norm-following\u201d framework has proven to be effective in other contexts, for instance when initiating collective actions in India related to hygienic norms (World Bank Group, 2008). Can perceived threat, social ties and normative social expectations explain commitment to the collective action required to combat COVID-19 as well?", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-04T10:57:12.154404", "date_modified": "2020-04-02T11:40:40.808576", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [""], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "2c81255a169632c7ef215a7a6fa857c798b4122e12432c108102bcbfb0c6c50c8e81fff695401fd352a1282955e436f9f9a6e63041cd78fe6550b3b80e44d8f7ecff78bcc3b839432f2f5afd3b4c3669750dbf1752023d1a945815b800e7013bb2182fa670c77dee64deb376fe736b77550b831c96facaf094add4804a607bae5f58a32f231b13960b11ccb97b237d67", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-04T10:57:12.136078", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Bahar Tuncgenc, Marwa El Zein, Yi Zhao, Justin Sulik, Guillaume Dezecache, Ophelia Deroy"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "AIM 1: To examine how the strength of people\u2019s social ties predict their engagement in collective action (i.e., keeping physical distance from others) across cultures and over time.\nHypothesis 1a: Having stronger social ties will positively predict participants\u2019 engagement in collective action (CA) through improving well-being.\nHypothesis 1b: The pattern hypothesised in 1a will be observed more strongly at the earlier stages of the pandemic as compared to later stages.\nHypothesis 1c: The pattern hypothesised in 1a will be observed more strongly in participants with a stronger collectivistic attitude.\n\nAIM 2: To examine how perceived empirical vs normative beliefs of different social groups predict people\u2019s engagement in collective action (i.e., keeping physical distance from others).\n\tHypothesis 2a: Including participants\u2019 expectations about others\u2019 actions and beliefs will predict engagement in CA above and beyond their own personal beliefs about what should be done.\n\tHypothesis 2b: At the earlier stages of the pandemic, higher expectations about others\u2019 CA engagement  will predict the participants\u2019 engagement in CA more than their expectations about others\u2019 beliefs about what should be done.

social neuroscience?  This question is explored by re-imagining Malinowski\u2019s classic ethnographic case study of the Kula in light of a contemporary social exchange theory of negotiation networks.  We propose: (1) sub-institutional patterns of power-dependence form a structural foundation for the rise of tacit meanings, which evolve through social negotiation into explicit, cultural meaning agreements; (2)  crucial sub-cultural categories form around the pursuit of both agentic  benefits and communal benefits; (3) an individual is culturally shaped through externalization, socialization, and internalization to value and seek both kinds of benefits; (4) an individual faces the existential task of navigating both agentic and communal situations across the negotiation network; (5)  the basic individual mechanism underlying such navigation entails motivated behavioral choice and motivated cultural cognition; (6) a behavioral choice rests on automatic, largely implicit and hot cognitive processing; (7) motivated cultural cognition rests mostly on the deliberate, mostly explicit, and cool selection of materials from the prevailing cultural toolkit for assembling a justification, but whose underlying trajectory is biased by an automatic, hot value-position, whether agentic or communal.  Based on the analysis, some directions for future empirical research are suggested.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-05T00:08:21.849648", "date_modified": "2020-04-07T21:15:23.091394", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["culture cognition social exchange case-study", "hot vs. cold  automatic vs. deliberative implicit vs. explicit agentic vs. communal power-dependence negotiation network inequality"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["John F.
