To examine these questions, we have designed a two-wave public opinion survey on the YouGov Pulse panel that includes independent experimental randomizations in each wave. In addition to collecting survey responses during each of the two waves, we are also passively collecting anonymized individual-level web traffic with users' consent, allowing us to measure their real-world behavior. Overall, our hypotheses and analysis will consist of two primary components: -An observational analysis of descriptive patterns of media trust and information consumption in our survey and behavioral data. -Tests of the effect of our experimental treatments on attitudes toward the media (survey outcomes) and information consumption (behavioral outcomes)."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Wave 1: Survey evidence of differences in media attitudes To test our hypotheses about news media attitudes, it is first necessary to determine how to best measure them. We have ten post-treatment survey questions that will serve as our dependent variables (plus one additional measure of feelings toward the news media that is only asked post-treatment in wave 2). Using the thematic groupings below, we will examine whether these questions scale together or not using only data from the control condition (which is not affected by the experimental manipulation in wave 1). Trust/confidence in media (general and specific organizations): -News media feeling thermometer (pre-treatment in wave 1; post-treatment in wave 2) -Confidence in people running the press -Confidence and trust in the New York Times, Fox News, and CNN (Economist and Guardian items excluded as relatively unfamiliar/foreign) Press accuracy/bias: -Accuracy of news posted online -Major news organizations fabricate -Does the media deal fairly with all sides or favor one side? Support for press freedom: -Criticism of leaders prevents politicians from doing their job (versus keeps them from doing things that shouldn't be done) -Are journalists an enemy of the people? -Government should be able to prevent publication of coverage it says is biased/inaccurate RQ1: Do measures of media trust and confidence in the press, perceived accuracy or bias, and support for limitations on freedom of the press correspond closely with each other? Based on the results of this analysis, we will construct a composite measures of media attitudes that we will use in the analyses below in addition to specific measures of media trust, perceptions of accuracy/bias, and support for press freedom. The hypotheses of interest below will typically be described as examining \"attitudes toward the media\" or similar terms, which refers to the composite outcome measure we intend to construct as a result of this analysis. We will also separately estimate effects on the three subscales listed above of media trust, perceptions of press accuracy/bias, and support for press freedom specifically for each hypothesis. Further details about how these measures will be constructed will be provided in the statistical analysis section below. Attitudes toward the news media vary widely. Over the last several decades, leading Republican and conservative voices have accused the mainstream media of having a liberal bias. The flow of negative claims about the press have escalated since 2016. Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked the press as \"fake news\" and accused it of fabrications on the campaign trail and now in the White House. We therefore expect that Republicans, conservatives, and Trump approvers will, on average, express significantly more negative attitudes toward the media than Democrats, liberals, and Trump disapprovers, respectively: H1a: Republicans will have more negative attitudes toward the news media than Democrats. Similarly, conservatives will have more negative attitudes toward the news media than either liberals or moderates and Trump approvers will have more negative attitudes toward the news media than Trump disapprovers. We also expect that differences in perceptions of media bias and and trust between Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, and Trump approvers and Trump disapprovers will vary by respondents' levels of political knowledge: H1b: The gap between Republicans and Democrats in attitudes toward the media will be greater among respondents with higher political knowledge than those with less knowledge. Similarly, the gap between liberals and conservatives and between Trump approvers and disapprovers will be greater among respondents with higher political knowledge than those with less knowledge. (We will also conduct a descriptive analysis of how attitudes toward the media vary over time when comparing our survey measures of these attitudes to those in other surveys that have used identical question wording. Given that our media attitude measures are measured post-treatment, we will verify that these findings hold using only respondents in our control condition.) Wave 1: Survey data/behavioral data We will conduct descriptive analyses of the extent that self-reports of news consumption relate to actual news consumption and the relationship between media trust and news consumption: RQ2a: To what extent are self-reports of outlet-specific news consumption correlated with actual consumption of news from those outlets? RQ2b: To what extent are attitudes toward the news media correlated with mainstream news consumption? RQ2c: To what extent is outlet-specific trust correlated with consumption of news from those outlets? Waves 1 and 2: Experimental effects on media attitudes measured in surveys In the first survey wave, we embed an experiment that uses random assignment to test the effects of messages about the media on attitudes toward the media. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions. In one condition, respondents are shown a news article about a highly salient media error - a story by CNN erroneously linking a Trump transition team member (Anthony Scaramucci) to the ongoing Russia investigation, which resulted in the responsible employees leaving the news network. A second condition instead tests the effect of Donald Trump attacking the media; in that condition, respondents are shown an article in which Trump calls reporting on the Russia investigation \"fake news.\" In the third condition, respondents are shown a placebo message about the Russia investigation, mentioning it in a similar manner to the first two conditions without mentioning either the CNN error or Trump's attacks on the media. Comparisons to this condition will allow us to isolate the effect of the first two treatments from the effect of reminders of Trump and the Russia investigation. Finally, respondents who were randomized into the control condition were shown an unrelated article about using sauces in cooking. We expect to observe directionally motivated reasoning in response to the negative information about the press. The messages about a media error and attacks on the media should have a greater effect on Trump approvers and Republicans (for whom they are more likely to be attitude-consistent) than among Trump disapprovers and Democrats, respectively. Our hypotheses and research questions about the experiment are the following: H2a: The media attack and media error conditions will both worsen attitudes toward the press among Trump approvers and Republicans (compared to the Russia placebo condition). H2b: The media error condition will worsen attitudes toward the press and toward CNN specifically for all respondents (compared to the Russia placebo condition). H2c: The media attack condition will worsen attitudes toward the press for all respondents (compared to the Russia placebo condition). H2d: The media attack and media error conditions will worsen attitudes toward the press more among Trump approvers than disapprovers and more among Republicans than Democrats (compared to the Russia placebo condition). We expect to observe this difference specifically for trust in CNN in the media error condition. Given the potential for backlash effects to a message from a disfavored source, we also propose the following research question for the response to the media attack condition among Trump disapprovers and Democrats: RQ3a: Will the media attack condition improve attitudes toward the media among Trump disapprovers and Democrats (compared to the Russia placebo condition)? We do not have strong theoretical expectations about the difference between the media attack and media error conditions but intend to evaluate this quantity. We therefore propose it as a research question: RQ3b: Will the media attack or media error condition worsen attitudes toward the press more for the full sample and for Trump approvers, Republicans, Trump disapprovers, and/or Democrats? We expect that the above hypotheses will hold with the same DVs in the second wave (persistence). We will test H2a/H2b/H2c/H2d and RQ3a/RQ3b again in wave 2 if we do not observe evidence of differential attrition in wave 2 participation (though this does not rule out post-treatment bias - see Montgomery, Nyhan and Torres: http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/post-treatment-bias.pdf). Details of how these tests will be conducted are provided below. Waves 1 and 2: Experimental effects on behavioral measures of information consumption We also expect that the media attack and error messages will have a significant effect on news consumption in the immediate aftermath of the wave 1 experimental manipulation: H3a: The media attack and media error conditions will reduce consumption of mainstream news sources and increase consumption of non-mainstream news sources among Trump approvers and Republicans in the week following treatment (compared to the Russia placebo condition). H3b: The media attack and media error conditions will reduce consumption of mainstream news sources among all respondents in the week following treatment (compared to the Russia placebo condition). H3c: The media attack and media error conditions will increase consumption of non-mainstream news sources among all respondents in the week following treatment (compared to the Russia placebo condition). (To maximize statistical power for detecting behavioral change, we will test both the individual effect of each treatment as well as their combined effect when pooled; see below.) H3d: The media error condition will reduce consumption of CNN among all respondents in the week following treatment (compared to the Russia placebo condition). H3e: The media attack and media error conditions will reduce mainstream news consumption more and increase non-mainstream news consumption more among Trump approvers than disapprovers and more among Republicans than Democrats in the week following treatment (compared to the Russia placebo condition). H3f: The media error condition will reduce consumption of CNN more among Trump approvers than disapprovers and more among Republicans than Democrats in the week following treatment (compared to the Russia placebo condition). (To maximize statistical power for detecting behavioral change, we will test both the individual effect of each treatment as well as their combined effect when pooled for the mainstream and non-mainstream news consumption outcomes; see below.) Waves 1 and 2: Information consumption and media attitudes in specific controversies We will also conduct more focused tests of information consumption on two issues: the number of refugees that should be admitted to the United States and Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in the Alabama special election. To further explore the relationship between media attitudes and behavior, we will first use the experiment embedded in wave 2, which encourages a random subset of participants to search for information about the issue of admitting refugees to the United States. As a manipulation check, we will first verify that respondents assigned to receive the refugee encouragement will be more likely to search for information about the refugee crisis in the week after Wave 2. If the manipulation is successful, we will test the following hypotheses: H4a: The effect of the refugee encouragement treatment on consumption of information about the refugee crisis from mainstream news and information sources will be greater for respondents with more positive attitudes toward the media compared to respondents with less positive attitudes toward the media. H4b: The effect of the refugee encouragement treatment on consumption of information about the refugee crisis from non-mainstream news and information sources will be greater for respondents with less positive attitudes toward the media compared to respondents with more positive attitudes toward the media. (Importantly, H4a and H4b are separate hypotheses because the amount of mainstream and non-mainstream news consumed are separate quantities and may not be strict substitutes.) H4c: In the week after Wave 2, respondents in the refugee encouragement treatment who were previously randomized into the media attack and media error conditions will be more likely to view information about the refugee crisis from non-mainstream and less likely to view information from mainstream news and information sources. (To maximize statistical power for detecting behavioral change, we will test both the individual effect of each treatment as well as their combined effect; see below.) Second, we will examine information consumption about Moore. On November 9, 2017, The Washington Post posted a story online in which credible accusations were made that Moore had multiple sexual encounters with minors while he was in his 30s. This story caused a major scandal and eventually led the national Republican Party to cut off Moore from campaign funding. In the meantime, an intensive campaign was conducted, via social media and other channels, to discredit the Post's reporting. (Breitbart was heavily involved in this campaign.) We will explore the effect of the unanticipated Moore scandal, which began once our study was already in the field, on attitudes toward the media in Wave 2 and behavioral measures of information consumption. H5a: Trump disapprovers and Democrats were more likely to read Post coverage of the Roy Moore controversy than Trump approvers and Republicans, respectively. We expect the converse to be true for Breitbart coverage of Moore. H5b: Trump approvers and Republicans consumed fewer Post articles, and more Breitbart articles, after the story was published compared to before. We expect the converse to be true for Trump disapprovers and Democrats and also expect that the difference in consumption change by outlet between groups will be significant. H5c: Respondents who were previously randomized into the media attack and media error conditions were less likely to consume Washington Post coverage of the Moore controversy (compared to Russia placebo condition). (To maximize statistical power for detecting behavioral change, we will test both the individual effect of each treatment as well as their combined effect when pooled for the mainstream and non-mainstream news consumption outcomes; see below.) RQ4: Will Trump approvers and Republicans who complete wave 2 surveys after the Washington Post story about Moore was published express relatively more negative attitudes toward the media compared to those who completed it before publication?"}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "As discussed above, our hypothesis are tested using data collected from a two-wave public opinion survey with embedded experiments where we also collect the web traffic data on a person's computer. We will examine our research questions and hypotheses using responses to survey questions and online behavioral data. The outcome measures will be coded as specified below. We will then conduct the statistical analyses described below. Randomization approach Respondents will be randomized by YouGov with equal probability in wave 1 to one of four conditions: a control condition in which they view an unrelated message, a placebo condition in which they read a story about the Russia investigation with no errors or attacks on the media, a media attack condition in which they read a story about the Russia investigation in which Donald Trump denounces the media, and a media error condition in which they read a story describing the retraction of an unsupported news article about the Russia investigation. Respondents will be independently randomized by YouGov with equal probability in wave 2 to one of two conditions: a control condition or to an information-seeking stimulus that seeks to induce respondents to search for more information about the issue of admitting refugees to the United States. Respondents, data collection and blinding We are conducting this study using a YouGov Pulse panel of US residents age 18 or older, which is recruited and maintained by YouGov. We expect this sample, which will be collected on the YouGov platform, to consist of approximately 2100 participants in wave 1 and 1500 participants in wave 2. Respondents are blind to condition. The data, which are anonymized, will include survey data and online behavioral data from respondents willing to install tracking software. The online tracking panel is currently branded as YouGov Pulse. Panelists are recruited from YouGov's traditional participant pool via incentives. The data to be used for this study covers approximately three weeks of web traffic - one week prior to the first survey, one week between surveys, and one week after the second survey. The software tracks web traffic (minus passwords and financial transactions) for all browsers installed on a user's computer and can be uninstalled at any time. Users provide full consent to download and install the software and identifying information is not collected. Interventions and dates of administration Invitations to participate in wave 1 of the study began to be sent on November 1, 2017. Respondents will be invited to complete wave 2 one week after completing wave 1. Data collection by YouGov will continue until the number of respondents meets the target sample size. Termination of data collection will be determined by YouGov, not the researchers, and will be decided blind to outcomes. The researchers will remain blind to the data until data collection is complete and this preregistration is filed. Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants All U.S. residents age 18 or older are eligible to participate. Participants must be members of the YouGov Pulse panel to be selected for inclusion. Primary and secondary outcome measures We describe the coding of survey and behavioral outcome measures below. In some cases, we will combine multiple measures to construct composite outcome measures. In those cases, we will use the procedures described in the statistical analysis section of this preregistration. Coding of raw outcome measures: [wave 1] We would like to get your feelings toward some of our political leaders and institutions who are in the news these days using something we call the feeling thermometer. Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you feel favorable and warm toward the person or institution. Ratings between 0 degrees and 50 degrees mean that you don't feel favorable toward the person or institution and that you don't care too much for that person or institution. You would rate them at the 50 degree mark if you don't feel particularly warm or cold toward them. If we come to a person or institution whose name you don't recognize, you don't need to rate them.

However, we may reverse the direction of coding for expositional reasons when it is more intuitive for higher values to indicate more negative perceptions (e.g., greater perceptions of bias). We will assess the dimensionality of the 11 post-treatment variables measuring attitudes toward the media using factor analysis with these variables. We will first estimate a composite measure of media attitudes using the loadings from the first dimension of a factor analysis estimated on the control group in each wave. We will then use those loadings to calculate the composite media attitude score for all respondents. As discussed above, the composite measure includes questions that tap subtle but important differences in dimensions of attitudes towards the media and the press (attitudes about trust/confidence in media, perceptions of press accuracy/bias, and support for press freedom). We will therefore also estimate separate factor scores for each subscale (trust/confidence in media, perceptions of press accuracy/bias, and support for press freedom) using an identical procedure to the main composite measure. (All factor analysis will be estimated using principal-components factor analysis with a varimax rotation.) (We will confirm that the results are similar in MPLUS using the ESEM WLSVM estimator to verify that findings are consistent between data treated as continuous and data treated as categorical.) Behavioral outcome measure coding: We will measure visits to the websites of the outlets listed in the question \"Which of these websites have you visited or used in the past week for news, if any?\" and in \"Please indicate how much trust and confidence you have in each news source listed below when it comes to reporting the news fully, accurately and fairly.\" Depending on the research question or hypothesis of interest, the time period of measurement may vary (e.g., the full period observed in the data, the period before wave 1, the period after wave 1, the period after wave 2, etc.). We will specify this time period in the statistical analysis section below. We will code news and information websites as \"mainstream\" if any of the following is true: -they are on the list of websites visited for news in our media exposure survey question (see above; based on behavioral data from a previous YouGov Pulse study) and are not affiliated with a particular political party or ideology; -had at least 5 million total unique monthly visits in our 2015 comScore data and ideology slant scores (Bakshy et al. 2015) between -0.55 and 0.55 inclusive and are based in the U.S.; -it is a Wikipedia article; -it is associated with one of the broadcast news networks (ABC, CBS, or NBC); -it is WSJ.com (omitted from our survey question because it is paywalled, but people may choose WSJ articles from a Google search) -it is one of the major fact-checking national organizations (PolitiFact, Snopes, or Factcheck.org; the Washington Post Fact Checker is excluded because it is part of the Washington Post, which is already a qualifying media outlet under the criteria above) The list is: abcnews.go.com, aol.com, buzzfeed.com, cbsnews.com, chicagotribune.com, cnbc.com, cnn.com, examiner.com, factcheck.org, fivethirtyeight.com, latimes.com, msn.com, nbcnews.com, nydailynews.com, nypost.com, nytimes.com, politico.com, politifact.com, realclearpolitics.com, snopes.com, theatlantic.com, thedailybeast.com, time.com, usnews.com, washingtonpost.com, wikipedia.org, wsj.com We count news and information websites as \"non-mainstream\" if they are not on the mainstream list above and either of the following is true: -they are on the list of websites visited for news in our media exposure survey question (which was based on traffic from a previous YouGov Pulse study); -they are classified as focusing on \"hard news\" topics by Bakshy et al. (2015) but fall outside the [-0.55, 0.55] ideological range (out of -2 to 2) The set of qualifying websites in this set includes Breitbart, Daily Kos, Fox News, Huffington Post, Talking Points Memo, and The Blaze. We will analyze web visit data (including scraped contents of pages visited) from respondents for the seven days after they each complete the Wave 2 survey to code for whether or not they searched for information about refugees. Respondents will be coded as having done so (in both binary and count terms) if their web visit data meet any of the following criteria: -Contain any Google searches with search terms including \"refug*\", \"syria\", or \"migr*\" -Pages containing the words \"refug*\", \"syria\", or \"migr*\" -URLs containing the words \"refug*\", \"syria\", or \"migr*\" We will measure visits to the Washington Post and Breitbart before and after the Roy Moore controversy as well as visits to pages containing the words \"Roy Moore\" after the controversy began (we assume all coverage published during the study period after the controversy began at least referenced it). We will consider effects on total webpages visited from mainstream and non-mainstream news and information sources using the criteria described above (we expect that most people will visit at least one website in both categories during the study period and thus exclude a binary measure) and both a binary and count measure for specific behavioral information exposure and search measures (Roy Moore and refugees) using the criteria defined above. Duplicate visits to webpages will not be counted if they are successive (i.e., a page that was reloaded after first opening it). URLs are cleaned of referrer information and other parameters before de-duplication. Statistical analyses All models will be estimated using ordinary least squares with robust standard errors.

This is our primary measure of attrition. If we observe significant differential attrition based on condition, we may use extreme value bounds or a related strategy to bound the possible effects on our results. We will also test for attrition based on the following observable characteristics: -attitudes toward the media measured in wave 1 -political characteristics (partisanship and political knowledge) -demographic characteristics (race, sex, and age) Due to the large number of characteristics on which we will assess imbalance, we will use a correction for multiple comparisons. If we do not observe differential attrition, we will estimate the same models described above for H2a/H2b/H2c/H2d and RQ3a/RQ3b using wave 2 outcome data (i.e., the wave 2 measures of media attitudes, including attitudes toward cnn).

In addition to collecting survey responses during each of the two waves, we are also passively collecting anonymized individual-level web traffic with users' consent, allowing us to measure their real-world behavior. Overall, our hypotheses and analysis will consist of two primary components: -An observational analysis of descriptive patterns of media trust and information consumption in our survey and behavioral data. -Tests of the effect of our experimental treatments on attitudes toward the media (survey outcomes) and information consumption (behavioral outcomes).", "q16": "Wave 1: Survey evidence of differences in media attitudes To test our hypotheses about news media attitudes, it is first necessary to determine how to best measure them. We have ten post-treatment survey questions that will serve as our dependent variables (plus one additional measure of feelings toward the news media that is only asked post-treatment in wave 2). Using the thematic groupings below, we will examine whether these questions scale together or not using only data from the control condition (which is not affected by the experimental manipulation in wave 1). Trust/confidence in media (general and specific organizations): -News media feeling thermometer (pre-treatment in wave 1; post-treatment in wave 2) -Confidence in people running the press -Confidence and trust in the New York Times, Fox News, and CNN (Economist and Guardian items excluded as relatively unfamiliar/foreign) Press accuracy/bias: -Accuracy of news posted online -Major news organizations fabricate -Does the media deal fairly with all sides or favor one side? Support for press freedom: -Criticism of leaders prevents politicians from doing their job (versus keeps them from doing things that shouldn't be done) -Are journalists an enemy of the people? -Government should be able to prevent publication of coverage it says is biased/inaccurate RQ1: Do measures of media trust and confidence in the press, perceived accuracy or bias, and support for limitations on freedom of the press correspond closely with each other? Based on the results of this analysis, we will construct a composite measures of media attitudes that we will use in the analyses below in addition to specific measures of media trust, perceptions of accuracy/bias, and support for press freedom. The hypotheses of interest below will typically be described as examining \"attitudes toward the media\" or similar terms, which refers to the composite outcome measure we intend to construct as a result of this analysis. We will also separately estimate effects on the three subscales listed above of media trust, perceptions of press accuracy/bias, and support for press freedom specifically for each hypothesis. Further details about how these measures will be constructed will be provided in the statistical analysis section below. Attitudes toward the news media vary widely. Over the last several decades, leading Republican and conservative voices have accused the mainstream media of having a liberal bias. The flow of negative claims about the press have escalated since 2016. Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked the press as \"fake news\" and accused it of fabrications on the campaign trail and now in the White House. We therefore expect that Republicans, conservatives, and Trump approvers will, on average, express significantly more negative attitudes toward the media than Democrats, liberals, and Trump disapprovers, respectively: H1a: Republicans will have more negative attitudes toward the news media than Democrats. Similarly, conservatives will have more negative attitudes toward the news media than either liberals or moderates and Trump approvers will have more negative attitudes toward the news media than Trump disapprovers. We also expect that differences in perceptions of media bias and and trust between Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, and Trump approvers and Trump disapprovers will vary by respondents' levels of political knowledge: H1b: The gap between Republicans and Democrats in attitudes toward the media will be greater among respondents with higher political knowledge than those with less knowledge. Similarly, the gap between liberals and conservatives and between Trump approvers and disapprovers will be greater among respondents with higher political knowledge than those with less knowledge. (We will also conduct a descriptive analysis of how attitudes toward the media vary over time when comparing our survey measures of these attitudes to those in other surveys that have used identical question wording. Given that our media attitude measures are measured post-treatment, we will verify that these findings hold using only respondents in our control condition.) Wave 1: Survey data/behavioral data We will conduct descriptive analyses of the extent that self-reports of news consumption relate to actual news consumption and the relationship between media trust and news consumption: RQ2a: To what extent are self-reports of outlet-specific news consumption correlated with actual consumption of news from those outlets? RQ2b: To what extent are attitudes toward the news media correlated with mainstream news consumption? RQ2c: To what extent is outlet-specific trust correlated with consumption of news from those outlets? Waves 1 and 2: Experimental effects on media attitudes measured in surveys In the first survey wave, we embed an experiment that uses random assignment to test the effects of messages about the media on attitudes toward the media. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions. In one condition, respondents are shown a news article about a highly salient media error - a story by CNN erroneously linking a Trump transition team member (Anthony Scaramucci) to the ongoing Russia investigation, which resulted in the responsible employees leaving the news network. A second condition instead tests the effect of Donald Trump attacking the media; in that condition, respondents are shown an article in which Trump calls reporting on the Russia investigation \"fake news.\" In the third condition, respondents are shown a placebo message about the Russia investigation, mentioning it in a similar manner to the first two conditions without mentioning either the CNN error or Trump's attacks on the media. Comparisons to this condition will allow us to isolate the effect of the first two treatments from the effect of reminders of Trump and the Russia investigation. Finally, respondents who were randomized into the control condition were shown an unrelated article about using sauces in cooking. We expect to observe directionally motivated reasoning in response to the negative information about the press. The messages about a media error and attacks on the media should have a greater effect on Trump approvers and Republicans (for whom they are more likely to be attitude-consistent) than among Trump disapprovers and Democrats, respectively. Our hypotheses and research questions about the experiment are the following: H2a: The media attack and media error conditions will both worsen attitudes toward the press among Trump approvers and Republicans (compared to the Russia placebo condition). H2b: The media error condition will worsen attitudes toward the press and toward CNN specifically for all respondents (compared to the Russia placebo condition). H2c: The media attack condition will worsen attitudes toward the press for all respondents (compared to the Russia placebo condition). H2d: The media attack and media error conditions will worsen attitudes toward the press more among Trump approvers than disapprovers and more among Republicans than Democrats (compared to the Russia placebo condition). We expect to observe this difference specifically for trust in CNN in the media error condition. Given the potential for backlash effects to a message from a disfavored source, we also propose the following research question for the response to the media attack condition among Trump disapprovers and Democrats: RQ3a: Will the media attack condition improve attitudes toward the media among Trump disapprovers and Democrats (compared to the Russia placebo condition)? We do not have strong theoretical expectations about the difference between the media attack and media error conditions but intend to evaluate this quantity. We therefore propose it as a research question: RQ3b: Will the media attack or media error condition worsen attitudes toward the press more for the full sample and for Trump approvers, Republicans, Trump disapprovers, and/or Democrats? We expect that the above hypotheses will hold with the same DVs in the second wave (persistence). We will test H2a/H2b/H2c/H2d and RQ3a/RQ3b again in wave 2 if we do not observe evidence of differential attrition in wave 2 participation (though this does not rule out post-treatment bias - see Montgomery, Nyhan and Torres: http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/post-treatment-bias.pdf). Details of how these tests will be conducted are provided below. Waves 1 and 2: Experimental effects on behavioral measures of information consumption We also expect that the media attack and error messages will have a significant effect on news consumption in the immediate aftermath of the wave 1 experimental manipulation: H3a: The media attack and media error conditions will reduce consumption of mainstream news sources and increase consumption of non-mainstream news sources among Trump approvers and Republicans in the week following treatment (compared to the Russia placebo condition). H3b: The media attack and media error conditions will reduce consumption of mainstream news sources among all respondents in the week following treatment (compared to the Russia placebo condition). H3c: The media attack and media error conditions will increase consumption of non-mainstream news sources among all respondents in the week following treatment (compared to the Russia placebo condition). (To maximize statistical power for detecting behavioral change, we will test both the individual effect of each treatment as well as their combined effect when pooled; see below.) H3d: The media error condition will reduce consumption of CNN among all respondents in the week following treatment (compared to the Russia placebo condition). H3e: The media attack and media error conditions will reduce mainstream news consumption more and increase non-mainstream news consumption more among Trump approvers than disapprovers and more among Republicans than Democrats in the week following treatment (compared to the Russia placebo condition). H3f: The media error condition will reduce consumption of CNN more among Trump approvers than disapprovers and more among Republicans than Democrats in the week following treatment (compared to the Russia placebo condition). (To maximize statistical power for detecting behavioral change, we will test both the individual effect of each treatment as well as their combined effect when pooled for the mainstream and non-mainstream news consumption outcomes; see below.) Waves 1 and 2: Information consumption and media attitudes in specific controversies We will also conduct more focused tests of information consumption on two issues: the number of refugees that should be admitted to the United States and Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in the Alabama special election. To further explore the relationship between media attitudes and behavior, we will first use the experiment embedded in wave 2, which encourages a random subset of participants to search for information about the issue of admitting refugees to the United States. As a manipulation check, we will first verify that respondents assigned to receive the refugee encouragement will be more likely to search for information about the refugee crisis in the week after Wave 2. If the manipulation is successful, we will test the following hypotheses: H4a: The effect of the refugee encouragement treatment on consumption of information about the refugee crisis from mainstream news and information sources will be greater for respondents with more positive attitudes toward the media compared to respondents with less positive attitudes toward the media. H4b: The effect of the refugee encouragement treatment on consumption of information about the refugee crisis from non-mainstream news and information sources will be greater for respondents with less positive attitudes toward the media compared to respondents with more positive attitudes toward the media. (Importantly, H4a and H4b are separate hypotheses because the amount of mainstream and non-mainstream news consumed are separate quantities and may not be strict substitutes.) H4c: In the week after Wave 2, respondents in the refugee encouragement treatment who were previously randomized into the media attack and media error conditions will be more likely to view information about the refugee crisis from non-mainstream and less likely to view information from mainstream news and information sources. (To maximize statistical power for detecting behavioral change, we will test both the individual effect of each treatment as well as their combined effect; see below.) Second, we will examine information consumption about Moore. On November 9, 2017, The Washington Post posted a story online in which credible accusations were made that Moore had multiple sexual encounters with minors while he was in his 30s. This story caused a major scandal and eventually led the national Republican Party to cut off Moore from campaign funding. In the meantime, an intensive campaign was conducted, via social media and other channels, to discredit the Post's reporting. (Breitbart was heavily involved in this campaign.) We will explore the effect of the unanticipated Moore scandal, which began once our study was already in the field, on attitudes toward the media in Wave 2 and behavioral measures of information consumption. H5a: Trump disapprovers and Democrats were more likely to read Post coverage of the Roy Moore controversy than Trump approvers and Republicans, respectively. We expect the converse to be true for Breitbart coverage of Moore. H5b: Trump approvers and Republicans consumed fewer Post articles, and more Breitbart articles, after the story was published compared to before. We expect the converse to be true for Trump disapprovers and Democrats and also expect that the difference in consumption change by outlet between groups will be significant. H5c: Respondents who were previously randomized into the media attack and media error conditions were less likely to consume Washington Post coverage of the Moore controversy (compared to Russia placebo condition). (To maximize statistical power for detecting behavioral change, we will test both the individual effect of each treatment as well as their combined effect when pooled for the mainstream and non-mainstream news consumption outcomes; see below.) RQ4: Will Trump approvers and Republicans who complete wave 2 surveys after the Washington Post story about Moore was published express relatively more negative attitudes toward the media compared to those who completed it before publication?", "q17": "As discussed above, our hypothesis are tested using data collected from a two-wave public opinion survey with embedded experiments where we also collect the web traffic data on a person's computer. We will examine our research questions and hypotheses using responses to survey questions and online behavioral data. The outcome measures will be coded as specified below. We will then conduct the statistical analyses described below. Randomization approach Respondents will be randomized by YouGov with equal probability in wave 1 to one of four conditions: a control condition in which they view an unrelated message, a placebo condition in which they read a story about the Russia investigation with no errors or attacks on the media, a media attack condition in which they read a story about the Russia investigation in which Donald Trump denounces the media, and a media error condition in which they read a story describing the retraction of an unsupported news article about the Russia investigation. Respondents will be independently randomized by YouGov with equal probability in wave 2 to one of two conditions: a control condition or to an information-seeking stimulus that seeks to induce respondents to search for more information about the issue of admitting refugees to the United States. Respondents, data collection and blinding We are conducting this study using a YouGov Pulse panel of US residents age 18 or older, which is recruited and maintained by YouGov. We expect this sample, which will be collected on the YouGov platform, to consist of approximately 2100 participants in wave 1 and 1500 participants in wave 2. Respondents are blind to condition. The data, which are anonymized, will include survey data and online behavioral data from respondents willing to install tracking software. The online tracking panel is currently branded as YouGov Pulse. Panelists are recruited from YouGov's traditional participant pool via incentives. The data to be used for this study covers approximately three weeks of web traffic - one week prior to the first survey, one week between surveys, and one week after the second survey. The software tracks web traffic (minus passwords and financial transactions) for all browsers installed on a user's computer and can be uninstalled at any time. Users provide full consent to download and install the software and identifying information is not collected. Interventions and dates of administration Invitations to participate in wave 1 of the study began to be sent on November 1, 2017. Respondents will be invited to complete wave 2 one week after completing wave 1. Data collection by YouGov will continue until the number of respondents meets the target sample size. Termination of data collection will be determined by YouGov, not the researchers, and will be decided blind to outcomes. The researchers will remain blind to the data until data collection is complete and this preregistration is filed. Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants All U.S. residents age 18 or older are eligible to participate. Participants must be members of the YouGov Pulse panel to be selected for inclusion. Primary and secondary outcome measures We describe the coding of survey and behavioral outcome measures below. In some cases, we will combine multiple measures to construct composite outcome measures. In those cases, we will use the procedures described in the statistical analysis section of this preregistration. Coding of raw outcome measures: [wave 1] We would like to get your feelings toward some of our political leaders and institutions who are in the news these days using something we call the feeling thermometer. Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you feel favorable and warm toward the person or institution. Ratings between 0 degrees and 50 degrees mean that you don't feel favorable toward the person or institution and that you don't care too much for that person or institution. You would rate them at the 50 degree mark if you don't feel particularly warm or cold toward them. If we come to a person or institution whose name you don't recognize, you don't need to rate them.

However, we may reverse the direction of coding for expositional reasons when it is more intuitive for higher values to indicate more negative perceptions (e.g., greater perceptions of bias). We will assess the dimensionality of the 11 post-treatment variables measuring attitudes toward the media using factor analysis with these variables. We will first estimate a composite measure of media attitudes using the loadings from the first dimension of a factor analysis estimated on the control group in each wave. We will then use those loadings to calculate the composite media attitude score for all respondents. As discussed above, the composite measure includes questions that tap subtle but important differences in dimensions of attitudes towards the media and the press (attitudes about trust/confidence in media, perceptions of press accuracy/bias, and support for press freedom). We will therefore also estimate separate factor scores for each subscale (trust/confidence in media, perceptions of press accuracy/bias, and support for press freedom) using an identical procedure to the main composite measure. (All factor analysis will be estimated using principal-components factor analysis with a varimax rotation.) (We will confirm that the results are similar in MPLUS using the ESEM WLSVM estimator to verify that findings are consistent between data treated as continuous and data treated as categorical.) Behavioral outcome measure coding: We will measure visits to the websites of the outlets listed in the question \"Which of these websites have you visited or used in the past week for news, if any?\" and in \"Please indicate how much trust and confidence you have in each news source listed below when it comes to reporting the news fully, accurately and fairly.\" Depending on the research question or hypothesis of interest, the time period of measurement may vary (e.g., the full period observed in the data, the period before wave 1, the period after wave 1, the period after wave 2, etc.). We will specify this time period in the statistical analysis section below. We will code news and information websites as \"mainstream\" if any of the following is true: -they are on the list of websites visited for news in our media exposure survey question (see above; based on behavioral data from a previous YouGov Pulse study) and are not affiliated with a particular political party or ideology; -had at least 5 million total unique monthly visits in our 2015 comScore data and ideology slant scores (Bakshy et al. 2015) between -0.55 and 0.55 inclusive and are based in the U.S.; -it is a Wikipedia article; -it is associated with one of the broadcast news networks (ABC, CBS, or NBC); -it is WSJ.com (omitted from our survey question because it is paywalled, but people may choose WSJ articles from a Google search) -it is one of the major fact-checking national organizations (PolitiFact, Snopes, or Factcheck.org; the Washington Post Fact Checker is excluded because it is part of the Washington Post, which is already a qualifying media outlet under the criteria above) The list is: abcnews.go.com, aol.com, buzzfeed.com, cbsnews.com, chicagotribune.com, cnbc.com, cnn.com, examiner.com, factcheck.org, fivethirtyeight.com, latimes.com, msn.com, nbcnews.com, nydailynews.com, nypost.com, nytimes.com, politico.com, politifact.com, realclearpolitics.com, snopes.com, theatlantic.com, thedailybeast.com, time.com, usnews.com, washingtonpost.com, wikipedia.org, wsj.com We count news and information websites as \"non-mainstream\" if they are not on the mainstream list above and either of the following is true: -they are on the list of websites visited for news in our media exposure survey question (which was based on traffic from a previous YouGov Pulse study); -they are classified as focusing on \"hard news\" topics by Bakshy et al. (2015) but fall outside the [-0.55, 0.55] ideological range (out of -2 to 2) The set of qualifying websites in this set includes Breitbart, Daily Kos, Fox News, Huffington Post, Talking Points Memo, and The Blaze. We will analyze web visit data (including scraped contents of pages visited) from respondents for the seven days after they each complete the Wave 2 survey to code for whether or not they searched for information about refugees. Respondents will be coded as having done so (in both binary and count terms) if their web visit data meet any of the following criteria: -Contain any Google searches with search terms including \"refug*\", \"syria\", or \"migr*\" -Pages containing the words \"refug*\", \"syria\", or \"migr*\" -URLs containing the words \"refug*\", \"syria\", or \"migr*\" We will measure visits to the Washington Post and Breitbart before and after the Roy Moore controversy as well as visits to pages containing the words \"Roy Moore\" after the controversy began (we assume all coverage published during the study period after the controversy began at least referenced it). We will consider effects on total webpages visited from mainstream and non-mainstream news and information sources using the criteria described above (we expect that most people will visit at least one website in both categories during the study period and thus exclude a binary measure) and both a binary and count measure for specific behavioral information exposure and search measures (Roy Moore and refugees) using the criteria defined above. Duplicate visits to webpages will not be counted if they are successive (i.e., a page that was reloaded after first opening it). URLs are cleaned of referrer information and other parameters before de-duplication. Statistical analyses All models will be estimated using ordinary least squares with robust standard errors. We will estimate all experimental models in the paper using the control condition as a baseline and present those in the main text or the appendix, but to facilitate reader understanding of placebo versus treatment differences we may report models using the Russia investigation placebo condition as the baseline and excluding the control condition (results will be identical). We will compute the appropriate linear combinations of coefficients to test the relevant hypotheses (e.g., mediaerror-russiaplacebo when the control condition is the excluded category).

This is our primary measure of attrition. If we observe significant differential attrition based on condition, we may use extreme value bounds or a related strategy to bound the possible effects on our results. We will also test for attrition based on the following observable characteristics: -attitudes toward the media measured in wave 1 -political characteristics (partisanship and political knowledge) -demographic characteristics (race, sex, and age) Due to the large number of characteristics on which we will assess imbalance, we will use a correction for multiple comparisons. If we do not observe differential attrition, we will estimate the same models described above for H2a/H2b/H2c/H2d and RQ3a/RQ3b using wave 2 outcome data (i.e., the wave 2 measures of media attitudes, including attitudes toward cnn).

"value": "(Note: This study is a follow-up to a previously preregistered study [EGAP 20151201AA]; some portions of the preregistration are repeated and/or adapted here.) Little is known about why people view political fact\u00ad-checking content or whether such content is effective in informing the public. This study will evaluate whether people engage in selective exposure to fact-checking and what effects it has on what they know about politics, which may also vary with their prior political beliefs. Specifically, we examine how nationally representative samples of respondents in the United States select and respond to information from fact-checking websites using a variant of a doubly randomized preference trial (DRPT) design, which allows us to contrast the effects of randomly assigned exposure to fact-\u00adchecking with the effects when people have an option to select non\u00adpolitical news instead. This study promises to help us understand when and why people select fact-checks versus other types of information on platforms like Google News (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/13/google-news-fact-check-trump-clinton-us-election) and Medium and on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Our study will also include anonymous tracking data on U.S. participants\u2019 online website visits for two weeks before and two weeks after the study. These data, which respondents have already consented to provide anonymously to YouGov as part of their participation in the YouGov Pulse panel, will allow us to determine the real-world prevalence of fact-checking consumption, the conditions under which people are most likely to seek out fact-checks, and the extent of selective exposure to fact-checking. These data will also allow us to measure respondents\u2019 exposure to so-called \u201cfake news\u201d and to assess its prevalence and correlates. In addition, we will be able to examine whether participants assigned to receive fact-checking content are more likely to subsequently seek out such information on their own - an important question for understanding whether reading fact-checks is a habit-forming behavior."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: Selective exposure We expect that people will not choose to read fact-checks about a favored party as frequently as those about a disfavored party. (We maintain this hypothesis even though our previous study [EGAP 20151201AA] found a preference for reading fact-checks about a preferred candidate. We think those results may not translate for two reasons. First, the ratings in the Italian study were not clearly negative. Second, the US context may simply be different; Italy has a fluid multi-party system compared to a stable two party system where partisan loyalties and identity are stronger, especially in the period immediately before a presidential election.) Like the previous study, the choice question describes the content of the fact-check using a neutral report of a claim made by a candidate. Nonetheless, our specific expectation is that respondents will be more likely to choose to read a fact-check of a statement from a candidate they do not support than a fact-check of a candidate they support. (Unlike in the Italian case, we focus on candidate preference as the directional motivation of interest rather than party.) These effects may vary by political sophistication. Our previous study compared interest in political fact-checks to non-political news. However, that design potentially confounded interest in fact-checks with interest in politics (no political news items were offered that were not fact-checks). We therefore offer respondents a choice between a fact-check of a negative claim about each candidate, a neutral political news item about each candidate that is not a fact-check, and two non-political news items. This design allows us to distinguish selective exposure to fact-checks from interest in news about candidates more generally. Using the Pulse web tracking data, we will further test hypotheses related to selective exposure. First, we will code for whether respondents visited the primary national fact-checking sites - PolitiFact (including its state affiliates), FactCheck.org, and the Washington Post Fact Checker. Previous web tracking data collected by one of the authors (Guess) suggests there will be few visits to fact-checking websites. If there is any period likely to produce traffic to fact-checking websites, it is in the period immediately prior to a presidential election with two relatively unpopular candidates. If there are enough visits to fact-checking websites to analyze, we will create two primary outcome measures: (1) exposure to any fact-checking content (dichotomous) and (2) number of visits to these pages. Depending on data availability, we may augment these measures of exposure to any fact-checking content with measures designed to differentiate between exposure to predisposition-consistent and predisposition-inconsistent content (i.e., coding for whether the fact-check was favorable or unfavorable to Clinton and/or Trump). Finally, we will test whether respondents are disproportionately likely to view \"fake news\" that is consistent with their political predispositions relative to predisposition-inconsistent \"fake news.\" Descriptive inference: -We will provide the first real-world behavioral estimate of the prevalence of fact-checking consumption during a presidential election campaign. -We will measure the correlation between respondents' self-reports of interest in fact-checking, interest in politics, and political sophistication and their actual fact-check consumption (both dichotomous and count measures). -We will assess whether the article preference measure in our survey instrument correlates with prior web behavior - i.e., whether people who read fact-checks on their own are more likely to select one as an article they'd like to read in our study. (Behavior may differ between a study and the real world; we also anticipate that fact-checking consumption may be relatively rare and we may thus be underpowered to detect this relationship.) -We will measure the prevalence of fake-news consumption in our panel (who sees it, how often, etc.) and how it varies by candidate support and other attitudinal and demographic factors as well as how it varies over time. We may also examine how these measures correspond to results from a post-election survey about recall of and belief in fake news conducted by Buzzfeed and Ipsos. We will then assess the following hypotheses (conditional on past fact-checking consumption being prevalent enough to evaluate its relationship to other factors of interest): Selective exposure: -H1a: We will examine whether there is selective exposure in past fact-check consumption such that people tend to read predisposition-consistent articles and avoid predisposition-inconsistent articles. (We will seek to obtain a prior YouGov measure of candidate preference for our respondents and/or validate the stability of candidate preference in panel data from other sources to account for possible concerns about post-treatment bias. We also plan to conduct an exploratory analysis of how people choose among fact-checks of the two candidates versus political news about them that does not include fact-checks.) -H1b: Respondents will be more likely to choose to read a fact-check of a statement from a candidate they do not support than a fact-check of a candidate they support in our study. -H1c: We will examine whether whether the relationship between candidate preference and past or intended fact-check consumption is moderated by political sophistication. -H1d: Parallel to H1a, we will examine whether people are more likely to read predisposition-consistent articles/pages containing fake news than predisposition-inconsistent fake news. (We define \"fake news\" as the completely false stories that are increasingly widely circulated online - see below for how we measure this concept.) -H1e: We will examine whether whether the relationship between candidate preference and past fake-news consumption is moderated by political sophistication. H2-H3: Differential learning effects Our design asks people to select the content they are interested in and separately randomizes what content people receive. While we discuss the design in more detail below, key features are necessary to explain our hypotheses. Respondents are assigned to either be randomly exposed to an article regardless of their preference (50%) or to receive the content they prefer (50%). Those who are assigned to be randomly assigned an article are then randomly assigned with equal probability to receive one of six articles (a negative fact-check of Clinton, a negative fact-check of Trump, a political article about Clinton that is not a fact-check, a political article about Trump that is not a fact-check, or one of two non-political articles). On average, we expect that exposure to fact-checks leads to learning about politics, but this effect may vary by respondents' political preferences and be diminished by respondents' ability to select out of fact-check exposure. Thus, our overall expectations are that respondents in the assigned exposure condition who are randomly assigned to a fact-check will have more accurate beliefs about the content of that fact-check than those who are randomly assigned to a non-political article (H2a). We expect the learning effects of randomly assigned fact-check exposure (versus non-political articles) to be lower for counter-attitudinal information than for pro-attitudinal information (H2b). We also expect accuracy of respondent beliefs on a given topic to be lower in the choice condition than when they are assigned to a relevant fact-check (H2c). To understand more precisely how fact-checking exposure affects belief accuracy in the real world, we will test how the effects of exposure to each fact-check vary by candidate preference and which articles people would actually choose to read when given a choice. We expect that each fact-check will be less effective among people who would choose to read it than among those who would not because people who would choose to read a fact-check are likely to be more politically knowledgeable already and therefore will have more accurate beliefs (H3a). We expect fact checks to be more effective among people for whom the fact check is consistent with their candidate preference (H3b). RQ: Habit formation We will also test whether viewing fact-check content affects self-reported attitudes toward fact-checking and subsequent consumption behavior. For subjects in the assigned exposure condition, we will first test whether those who receive fact-checking content view fact-checking more favorably (self-reports of attitudes on our survey). We will also test whether they are more likely to choose to visit a fact-checking website when given the option at the end of the survey and to subsequently visit fact-checking sites on the Internet in on our web tracking data than those who received non-political content (our behavioral measures of interest, which could potentially diverge from attitudinal self-reports)."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "Trial design We adopt a variant of a patient preference trial (PPT) design in which some respondents are randomized to receive a treatment or not and others are allowed to choose their condition (Arceneaux, Johnson, and Murphy 2012; Knox et al. N.d.). In this case, the treatment is exposure to a given fact-check versus other content. Randomization approach We use a simple randomization approach. Respondents are randomly assigned to the article choice condition with 50% probability and to the assigned exposure conditions with 50% probability. An independent randomization assigns each respondent in the assigned exposure to one of six articles with equal probability (1/6). Respondents, data collection and blinding We are conducting this study using a YouGov Pulse panel. We expect this sample, which will take the survey on the YouGov survey platform, to consist of approximately 3,000 people. Respondents are blind to condition. These data, which are completely anonymized, will be collected by the online polling firm YouGov from respondents willing to install tracking software. The online tracking panel is currently branded as YouGov Pulse. Panelists are recruited from YouGov\u2019s traditional participant pool via incentives. The data to be used for this study covers 4 weeks of web traffic from roughly 3,000 respondents. The software tracks web traffic (minus passwords and financial transactions) for all browsers installed on a user's computer and can be uninstalled at any time. Users provide full consent to download and install the software and identifying information is not collected. Interventions and dates of administration The primary intervention is assignment to see one of two fact-checks (assigned treatment), assignment to see one of two political non-fact-check articles (alternative political content), assignment to one of two non-political placebo articles (assigned control), or being given the option to choose which article you would like to read (choice). The study was launched October 22, 2016 by YouGov, which kept it open until they received 3,000 responses (the contracted total). The authors remain blind to the data at the time of the preregistration. Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants All U.S. residents age 18 or older are eligible to participate. Participants must be members of the YouGov Pulse panel to be selected for inclusion. Primary and secondary outcome measures A primary outcome of interest is whether people express a preference to be exposed to fact-checking content and whether that content is pro- or counter-attitudinal. We measure this outcome through a survey question asking people to say which of six different articles they would like to read. Fact-check: Donald Trump would \"engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security\" Fact-check: Hillary Clinton wants illegal immigrants \"collecting Social Security benefits\" How Much Is Your Sleep Worth? Why mattresses are the new iPhones The 10 Best (and 5 Worst) Food Developments of the Last 10 Years Netanyahu Meets Trump at Trump Tower Clinton Reaffirms Opposition to UNSC Resolution in Meeting with Netanyahu In addition, we want to assess how much people learn from exposure to fact-checks and whether how much one learns is contingent on choosing exposure. To measure how much one learns from fact-checks, we ask respondents to assess statements related to the content of the fact-checks. These questions are presented below. Both statements were false so responses will be measured on a 1-4 scale where 4=the most accurate and 1=the most inaccurate response. Hillary Clinton would allow illegal immigrants who arrive here to stay and immediately begin to collect Social Security benefits. Donald Trump wants to allow people to put a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes into personal retirement accounts that would be invested in private stocks and bonds. We will also consider how favorable people are towards fact-checking as a secondary outcome measure. The question we will use to measure attitudes towards fact-checking is presented below. We would like to again ask about your views of fact-checking, a new development in journalism that seeks to hold politicians accountable when they make false or misleading statements. In general, how favorable or unfavorable is your overall opinion of the fact-checking movement in journalism? -Very favorable -Somewhat favorable -Slightly favorable -Slightly unfavorable -Somewhat unfavorable -Very unfavorable To verify that respondents read the stimulus articles, they were asked the following questions after seeing a fact-check and given up to three attempts to correctly answer the question before being allowed to proceed. We will analyze passage rates for these questions to ensure that most respondents appeared to have read and understood the articles. [new page - after Kaine fact-check] Which issue was in dispute in the article you just read? (randomize order of choices) -A candidate\u2019s plan for Social Security [correct] -The U.S. budget deficit -Immigration -A candidate\u2019s nominees to the US Supreme Court [new page - after Trump ad fact-check] Which issue was in dispute in the article you just read? (randomize order of choices) -A candidate\u2019s immigration policy [correct] -The war in Libya -A candidate\u2019s jobs program -Health care (Another potential secondary outcome measure we may consider is the time users have spent on each page of the web survey.) Fact-checking consumption will be measured using visits to the three major national fact-checkers - PolitiFact (including state affiliates), Washington Post Fact-Checker, and Factcheck.org. Measures of whether a statement is supported or not by the fact-check and what is pro-Trump/pro-Clinton will be created by coders who are blind to the hypotheses of this study using the ratings of the statements where available, the identities of the speakers, and the text of the article. Fact-checks that are ambiguous about the veracity of the statement (e.g., \u201cHalf-true\u201d on PolitiFact) or on the implications of the findings for the two sides in the election will be excluded. If consumption of fact-checking from these websites is extremely rare, we may expand the coding to include visits to fact-checking sites in the United States that were identified by the Duke Reporters\u2019 Lab as active during the election (http://reporterslab.org/fact-checkers-reach-keeps-growing/) and/or to URL identified as fact-checks on Twitter that do not appear on a dedicated fact-checking website. Fake news consumption will be measured using a list of visits to fake news articles identified by Craig Silverman of Buzzfeed as most widely shared on social media before the election (https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook?utm_term=.dgjEayPpY#.vwomaLkQD) and shared with the authors. Our procedure for using this list is as follows: Create a list of web domains that posted the fake news articles in the list. Drop any domains that are not strictly \u201cfake news\u201d (excluding YouTube videos posted by \u201cfake news\u201d sites). To determine this, we use the domains identified by Facebook Research as \u201chard news\u201d via machine learning classification (Bakshy et al. 2015) and remove any domain on this list. Any pages on the resulting list of domains is classified as \u201cfake news\u201d for the purposes of our analysis. Measures of whether a fake news article is favorable or unfavorable to Trump or Clinton will be created by coders who are blind to the hypothesis of this study. Fake news that is ambiguous about the implications for the candidates will be excluded. Statistical analyses We will test our hypothesis on the outcome variables described above by analyzing the average treatment effect of assignment to treatment (typically relative to the appropriate non-political control condition). These models will be estimated using ordinary least squares with robust standard errors. Many of our analyses focus on pro- and counter-attitudinal information and fact-checks, which requires identifying how we will measure pro- and counter-attitudinal. Our general approach is that anything that is consistent with one\u2019s political predispositions is pro-attitudinal, while anything that runs counter to one\u2019s predispositions is counter-attitudinal. We will use candidate choice as our primary way to assess pro- and counter-attitudinal information. When a person says they intend to vote for a major-party candidate, we assume that a fact-check contradicting a claim by their preferred candidate (or supporting a claim by the other candidate) will be considered counter-attitudinal. Similarly, when a person supports a major-party candidate, we assume that a fact-check contradicting a claim by the other candidate (or supporting a claim by their preferred candidate) will be considered pro-attitudinal information. Note that this coding scheme is not mutually exclusive. Some people could see both of the available fact-checks as either pro- or counter-attitudinal. (Given the relative unpopularity of the candidates even among those voting for them, a feeling thermometer may better isolate the subset of respondents who are likely to engage in motivated reasoning [see, e.g., Nyhan, Reifler, and Ubel 2013; Roush N.d.]. For that reason, we may elect to replace candidate choice as our key moderator with feeling thermometers to assess directionally motivated reasoning.) Given that relatively few voters will select a third-party candidate in the vote choice question or say they don\u2019t know who they will support, we will omit this group from our primary results (but will report results including them in an appendix). The omitted category in models below that include a Trump support indicator is thus Clinton support. We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models, including treatment effects by subgroup and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. These include subgroups defined by candidate preference, article preference, political knowledge, etc. (see above). We measure political knowledge using an eight-item additive scale of statements where respondents can say \u201ctrue\u201d, \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t know.\u201d Correct answers will be coded as 1; all others as 0. Notes: For any interaction terms, scales, and moderators, if results are consistent using a median/tercile split or indicators rather than a continuous scale, we may present the latter in the main text for ease of exposition and include the continuous scale results in an appendix. We will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from any interaction models described below. We will also use indicators to test whether the linearity assumption holds for interactions with continuous measures and replace those in the models below if it does not. (See Hainmueller et al N.d.) In some cases, we may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity. If so, we will verify that we can reject the null of no difference in treatment effects in a more complex interactive model reported in an appendix when possible (may not be feasible with the Knox et al. estimator). Don\u2019t know responses will be considered missing data for the accuracy outcome measures. If these are sufficiently common, we will consider coding them at the midpoint of the four-point accuracy scale (2.5). Our preferred knowledge outcome measures are four-point accuracy scales where the most accurate response is \u201cNot accurate at all.\u201d However, if concerns are raised about which response is most accurate, we may consider a binary outcome measure where \u201cNot very accurate\u201d and \u201cNot accurate at all\u201d are coded as 1 and \u201cVery accurate\u201d and \u201cSomewhat accurate\u201d are coded as 0. If feasible, we will implement an estimator designed for a DRPT design instead of or in addition to OLS with robust standard errors (Gaines and Kuklinski 2007; Knox et al. N.d.). We may also use seemingly unrelated regression to increase the efficiency of our estimation for correlated variables. Finally, we may use multinomial regression for the article choice outcome if there is an indication that choice behaviors vary in complex ways that our individual article choice measure does not capture. A pre-test on Mechanical Turk found that 32% of respondents preferred to read a fact-check article among the six offered to respondents in the study. However, if too few respondents on YouGov select fact-checking articles as their preferred content choice, we will instead pool the respondents who selected any political news article (whether fact-checking or not) to increase statistical power. We will pool the respondents in this way if fewer than 10% of respondents select a fact-checking article. In our observational analyses, we will control for the following standard outcome measures in addition to measures of candidate preference and political knowledge: sex (indicator for female), age (indicators for age categories of 30-44, 45-59, and 60+; 18-29 excluded), race (indicator for black) Additional notes: -We will also compute and report summary statistics for our sample as well as measures of respondent attention and comprehension, including both response timing data and accuracy of answers to manipulation check questions about the stimulus articles. -Our primary experimental effect estimates will be unweighted per Franco et al. (N.d.), though we may also report weighted results. -The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity. -Note: We may estimate models that include a standard set of demographic covariates (indicators for gender, age groups, race, and political knowledge) if including those demographic measures has a substantively important effect on the precision of our treatment effect estimates. In that case, however, both models would be reported. -Where applicable, regression results for binary dependent variables will be verified for robustness using probit. Regression results for individual ordered dependent variables will be verified for robustness using ordered probit. Regression results for ordered scales constructed from multinomial data will be verified for robustness using multinomial logit or multinomial probit. Regression results for count variables will be verified for robustness using Poisson regression with robust standard errors or negative binomial regression. - As a robustness check, we will use the Pulse tracking data to test whether respondents used search engines to look up answers to any knowledge questions. Relatedly, we may test for correlations between self-reported and actual (as measured by Pulse) knowledge cheating. -Duplicate visits to the same URL will be counted in measures of fact-checking and fake news consumption if they are not successive (i.e., a page that was reloaded after first opening it). -In analyzing the data, we may check if the learning effects of randomly assigned fact-check exposure (versus non-political articles) are higher for people with greater political knowledge or whether learning effects (versus non-political articles) are greater for respondents who read one or more fact-checks (binary measure) in the two weeks prior to the study than those who did not, but do not consider these to be primary hypotheses or research questions of the study.

preregistration are repeated and/or adapted here.) Little is known about why people view political fact\u00ad-checking content or whether such content is effective in informing the public. This study will evaluate whether people engage in selective exposure to fact-checking and what effects it has on what they know about politics, which may also vary with their prior political beliefs. Specifically, we examine how nationally representative samples of respondents in the United States select and respond to information from fact-checking websites using a variant of a doubly randomized preference trial (DRPT) design, which allows us to contrast the effects of randomly assigned exposure to fact-\u00adchecking with the effects when people have an option to select non\u00adpolitical news instead. This study promises to help us understand when and why people select fact-checks versus other types of information on platforms like Google News (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/13/google-news-fact-check-trump-clinton-us-election) and Medium and on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Our study will also include anonymous tracking data on U.S. participants\u2019 online website visits for two weeks before and two weeks after the study. These data, which respondents have already consented to provide anonymously to YouGov as part of their participation in the YouGov Pulse panel, will allow us to determine the real-world prevalence of fact-checking consumption, the conditions under which people are most likely to seek out fact-checks, and the extent of selective exposure to fact-checking. These data will also allow us to measure respondents\u2019 exposure to so-called \u201cfake news\u201d and to assess its prevalence and correlates. In addition, we will be able to examine whether participants assigned to receive fact-checking content are more likely to subsequently seek out such information on their own - an important question for understanding whether reading fact-checks is a habit-forming behavior.", "q16": "H1: Selective exposure We expect that people will not choose to read fact-checks about a favored party as frequently as those about a disfavored party. (We maintain this hypothesis even though our previous study [EGAP 20151201AA] found a preference for reading fact-checks about a preferred candidate. We think those results may not translate for two reasons. First, the ratings in the Italian study were not clearly negative. Second, the US context may simply be different; Italy has a fluid multi-party system compared to a stable two party system where partisan loyalties and identity are stronger, especially in the period immediately before a presidential election.) Like the previous study, the choice question describes the content of the fact-check using a neutral report of a claim made by a candidate. Nonetheless, our specific expectation is that respondents will be more likely to choose to read a fact-check of a statement from a candidate they do not support than a fact-check of a candidate they support. (Unlike in the Italian case, we focus on candidate preference as the directional motivation of interest rather than party.) These effects may vary by political sophistication. Our previous study compared interest in political fact-checks to non-political news. However, that design potentially confounded interest in fact-checks with interest in politics (no political news items were offered that were not fact-checks). We therefore offer respondents a choice between a fact-check of a negative claim about each candidate, a neutral political news item about each candidate that is not a fact-check, and two non-political news items. This design allows us to distinguish selective exposure to fact-checks from interest in news about candidates more generally. Using the Pulse web tracking data, we will further test hypotheses related to selective exposure. First, we will code for whether respondents visited the primary national fact-checking sites - PolitiFact (including its state affiliates), FactCheck.org, and the Washington Post Fact Checker. Previous web tracking data collected by one of the authors (Guess) suggests there will be few visits to fact-checking websites. If there is any period likely to produce traffic to fact-checking websites, it is in the period immediately prior to a presidential election with two relatively unpopular candidates. If there are enough visits to fact-checking websites to analyze, we will create two primary outcome measures: (1) exposure to any fact-checking content (dichotomous) and (2) number of visits to these pages. Depending on data availability, we may augment these measures of exposure to any fact-checking content with measures designed to differentiate between exposure to predisposition-consistent and predisposition-inconsistent content (i.e., coding for whether the fact-check was favorable or unfavorable to Clinton and/or Trump). Finally, we will test whether respondents are disproportionately likely to view \"fake news\" that is consistent with their political predispositions relative to predisposition-inconsistent \"fake news.\" Descriptive inference: -We will provide the first real-world behavioral estimate of the prevalence of fact-checking consumption during a presidential election campaign. -We will measure the correlation between respondents' self-reports of interest in fact-checking, interest in politics, and political sophistication and their actual fact-check consumption (both dichotomous and count measures). -We will assess whether the article preference measure in our survey instrument correlates with prior web behavior - i.e., whether people who read fact-checks on their own are more likely to select one as an article they'd like to read in our study. (Behavior may differ between a study and the real world; we also anticipate that fact-checking consumption may be relatively rare and we may thus be underpowered to detect this relationship.) -We will measure the prevalence of fake-news consumption in our panel (who sees it, how often, etc.) and how it varies by candidate support and other attitudinal and demographic factors as well as how it varies over time. We may also examine how these measures correspond to results from a post-election survey about recall of and belief in fake news conducted by Buzzfeed and Ipsos. We will then assess the following hypotheses (conditional on past fact-checking consumption being prevalent enough to evaluate its relationship to other factors of interest): Selective exposure: -H1a: We will examine whether there is selective exposure in past fact-check consumption such that people tend to read predisposition-consistent articles and avoid predisposition-inconsistent articles. (We will seek to obtain a prior YouGov measure of candidate preference for our respondents and/or validate the stability of candidate preference in panel data from other sources to account for possible concerns about post-treatment bias. We also plan to conduct an exploratory analysis of how people choose among fact-checks of the two candidates versus political news about them that does not include fact-checks.) -H1b: Respondents will be more likely to choose to read a fact-check of a statement from a candidate they do not support than a fact-check of a candidate they support in our study. -H1c: We will examine whether whether the relationship between candidate preference and past or intended fact-check consumption is moderated by political sophistication. -H1d: Parallel to H1a, we will examine whether people are more likely to read predisposition-consistent articles/pages containing fake news than predisposition-inconsistent fake news. (We define \"fake news\" as the completely false stories that are increasingly widely circulated online - see below for how we measure this concept.) -H1e: We will examine whether whether the relationship between candidate preference and past fake-news consumption is moderated by political sophistication. H2-H3: Differential learning effects Our design asks people to select the content they are interested in and separately randomizes what content people receive. While we discuss the design in more detail below, key features are necessary to explain our hypotheses. Respondents are assigned to either be randomly exposed to an article regardless of their preference (50%) or to receive the content they prefer (50%). Those who are assigned to be randomly assigned an article are then randomly assigned with equal probability to receive one of six articles (a negative fact-check of Clinton, a negative fact-check of Trump, a political article about Clinton that is not a fact-check, a political article about Trump that is not a fact-check, or one of two non-political articles). On average, we expect that exposure to fact-checks leads to learning about politics, but this effect may vary by respondents' political preferences and be diminished by respondents' ability to select out of fact-check exposure. Thus, our overall expectations are that respondents in the assigned exposure condition who are randomly assigned to a fact-check will have more accurate beliefs about the content of that fact-check than those who are randomly assigned to a non-political article (H2a). We expect the learning effects of randomly assigned fact-check exposure (versus non-political articles) to be lower for counter-attitudinal information than for pro-attitudinal information (H2b). We also expect accuracy of respondent beliefs on a given topic to be lower in the choice condition than when they are assigned to a relevant fact-check (H2c). To understand more precisely how fact-checking exposure affects belief accuracy in the real world, we will test how the effects of exposure to each fact-check vary by candidate preference and which articles people would actually choose to read when given a choice. We expect that each fact-check will be less effective among people who would choose to read it than among those who would not because people who would choose to read a fact-check are likely to be more politically knowledgeable already and therefore will have more accurate beliefs (H3a). We expect fact checks to be more effective among people for whom the fact check is consistent with their candidate preference (H3b). RQ: Habit formation We will also test whether viewing fact-check content affects self-reported attitudes toward fact-checking and subsequent consumption behavior. For subjects in the assigned exposure condition, we will first test whether those who receive fact-checking content view fact-checking more favorably (self-reports of attitudes on our survey). We will also test whether they are more likely to choose to visit a fact-checking website when given the option at the end of the survey and to subsequently visit fact-checking sites on the Internet in on our web tracking data than those who received non-political content (our behavioral measures of interest, which could potentially diverge from attitudinal self-reports).", "q17": "Trial design We adopt a variant of a patient preference trial (PPT) design in which some respondents are randomized to receive a treatment or not and others are allowed to choose their condition (Arceneaux, Johnson, and Murphy 2012; Knox et al. N.d.). In this case, the treatment is exposure to a given fact-check versus other content. Randomization approach We use a simple randomization approach. Respondents are randomly assigned to the article choice condition with 50% probability and to the assigned exposure conditions with 50% probability. An independent randomization assigns each respondent in the assigned exposure to one of six articles with equal probability (1/6). Respondents, data collection and blinding We are conducting this study using a YouGov Pulse panel. We expect this sample, which will take the survey on the YouGov survey platform, to consist of approximately 3,000 people. Respondents are blind to condition. These data, which are completely anonymized, will be collected by the online polling firm YouGov from respondents willing to install tracking software. The online tracking panel is currently branded as YouGov Pulse. Panelists are recruited from YouGov\u2019s traditional participant pool via incentives. The data to be used for this study covers 4 weeks of web traffic from roughly 3,000 respondents. The software tracks web traffic (minus passwords and financial transactions) for all browsers installed on a user's computer and can be uninstalled at any time. Users provide full consent to download and install the software and identifying information is not collected. Interventions and dates of administration The primary intervention is assignment to see one of two fact-checks (assigned treatment), assignment to see one of two political non-fact-check articles (alternative political content), assignment to one of two non-political placebo articles (assigned control), or being given the option to choose which article you would like to read (choice). The study was launched October 22, 2016 by YouGov, which kept it open until they received 3,000 responses (the contracted total). The authors remain blind to the data at the time of the preregistration. Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants All U.S. residents age 18 or older are eligible to participate. Participants must be members of the YouGov Pulse panel to be selected for inclusion. Primary and secondary outcome measures A primary outcome of interest is whether people express a preference to be exposed to fact-checking content and whether that content is pro- or counter-attitudinal. We measure this outcome through a survey question asking people to say which of six different articles they would like to read. Fact-check: Donald Trump would \"engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security\" Fact-check: Hillary Clinton wants illegal immigrants \"collecting Social Security benefits\" How Much Is Your Sleep Worth? Why mattresses are the new iPhones The 10 Best (and 5 Worst) Food Developments of the Last 10 Years Netanyahu Meets Trump at Trump Tower Clinton Reaffirms Opposition to UNSC Resolution in Meeting with Netanyahu In addition, we want to assess how much people learn from exposure to fact-checks and whether how much one learns is contingent on choosing exposure. To measure how much one learns from fact-checks, we ask respondents to assess statements related to the content of the fact-checks. These questions are presented below. Both statements were false so responses will be measured on a 1-4 scale where 4=the most accurate and 1=the most inaccurate response. Hillary Clinton would allow illegal immigrants who arrive here to stay and immediately begin to collect Social Security benefits. Donald Trump wants to allow people to put a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes into personal retirement accounts that would be invested in private stocks and bonds. We will also consider how favorable people are towards fact-checking as a secondary outcome measure. The question we will use to measure attitudes towards fact-checking is presented below. We would like to again ask about your views of fact-checking, a new development in journalism that seeks to hold politicians accountable when they make false or misleading statements. In general, how favorable or unfavorable is your overall opinion of the fact-checking movement in journalism? -Very favorable -Somewhat favorable -Slightly favorable -Slightly unfavorable -Somewhat unfavorable -Very unfavorable To verify that respondents read the stimulus articles, they were asked the following questions after seeing a fact-check and given up to three attempts to correctly answer the question before being allowed to proceed. We will analyze passage rates for these questions to ensure that most respondents appeared to have read and understood the articles. [new page - after Kaine fact-check] Which issue was in dispute in the article you just read? (randomize order of choices) -A candidate\u2019s plan for Social Security [correct] -The U.S. budget deficit -Immigration -A candidate\u2019s nominees to the US Supreme Court [new page - after Trump ad fact-check] Which issue was in dispute in the article you just read? (randomize order of choices) -A candidate\u2019s immigration policy [correct] -The war in Libya -A candidate\u2019s jobs program -Health care (Another potential secondary outcome measure we may consider is the time users have spent on each page of the web survey.) Fact-checking consumption will be measured using visits to the three major national fact-checkers - PolitiFact (including state affiliates), Washington Post Fact-Checker, and Factcheck.org. Measures of whether a statement is supported or not by the fact-check and what is pro-Trump/pro-Clinton will be created by coders who are blind to the hypotheses of this study using the ratings of the statements where available, the identities of the speakers, and the text of the article. Fact-checks that are ambiguous about the veracity of the statement (e.g., \u201cHalf-true\u201d on PolitiFact) or on the implications of the findings for the two sides in the election will be excluded. If consumption of fact-checking from these websites is extremely rare, we may expand the coding to include visits to fact-checking sites in the United States that were identified by the Duke Reporters\u2019 Lab as active during the election (http://reporterslab.org/fact-checkers-reach-keeps-growing/) and/or to URL identified as fact-checks on Twitter that do not appear on a dedicated fact-checking website. Fake news consumption will be measured using a list of visits to fake news articles identified by Craig Silverman of Buzzfeed as most widely shared on social media before the election (https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook?utm_term=.dgjEayPpY#.vwomaLkQD) and shared with the authors. Our procedure for using this list is as follows: Create a list of web domains that posted the fake news articles in the list. Drop any domains that are not strictly \u201cfake news\u201d (excluding YouTube videos posted by \u201cfake news\u201d sites). To determine this, we use the domains identified by Facebook Research as \u201chard news\u201d via machine learning classification (Bakshy et al. 2015) and remove any domain on this list. Any pages on the resulting list of domains is classified as \u201cfake news\u201d for the purposes of our analysis. Measures of whether a fake news article is favorable or unfavorable to Trump or Clinton will be created by coders who are blind to the hypothesis of this study. Fake news that is ambiguous about the implications for the candidates will be excluded. Statistical analyses We will test our hypothesis on the outcome variables described above by analyzing the average treatment effect of assignment to treatment (typically relative to the appropriate non-political control condition). These models will be estimated using ordinary least squares with robust standard errors. Many of our analyses focus on pro- and counter-attitudinal information and fact-checks, which requires identifying how we will measure pro- and counter-attitudinal. Our general approach is that anything that is consistent with one\u2019s political predispositions is pro-attitudinal, while anything that runs counter to one\u2019s predispositions is counter-attitudinal. We will use candidate choice as our primary way to assess pro- and counter-attitudinal information. When a person says they intend to vote for a major-party candidate, we assume that a fact-check contradicting a claim by their preferred candidate (or supporting a claim by the other candidate) will be considered counter-attitudinal. Similarly, when a person supports a major-party candidate, we assume that a fact-check contradicting a claim by the other candidate (or supporting a claim by their preferred candidate) will be considered pro-attitudinal information. Note that this coding scheme is not mutually exclusive. Some people could see both of the available fact-checks as either pro- or counter-attitudinal. (Given the relative unpopularity of the candidates even among those voting for them, a feeling thermometer may better isolate the subset of respondents who are likely to engage in motivated reasoning [see, e.g., Nyhan, Reifler, and Ubel 2013; Roush N.d.]. For that reason, we may elect to replace candidate choice as our key moderator with feeling thermometers to assess directionally motivated reasoning.) Given that relatively few voters will select a third-party candidate in the vote choice question or say they don\u2019t know who they will support, we will omit this group from our primary results (but will report results including them in an appendix). The omitted category in models below that include a Trump support indicator is thus Clinton support. We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models, including treatment effects by subgroup and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. These include subgroups defined by candidate preference, article preference, political knowledge, etc. (see above). We measure political knowledge using an eight-item additive scale of statements where respondents can say \u201ctrue\u201d, \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t know.\u201d Correct answers will be coded as 1; all others as 0. Notes: For any interaction terms, scales, and moderators, if results are consistent using a median/tercile split or indicators rather than a continuous scale, we may present the latter in the main text for ease of exposition and include the continuous scale results in an appendix. We will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from any interaction models described below. We will also use indicators to test whether the linearity assumption holds for interactions with continuous measures and replace those in the models below if it does not. (See Hainmueller et al N.d.) In some cases, we may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity. If so, we will verify that we can reject the null of no difference in treatment effects in a more complex interactive model reported in an appendix when possible (may not be feasible with the Knox et al. estimator). Don\u2019t know responses will be considered missing data for the accuracy outcome measures. If these are sufficiently common, we will consider coding them at the midpoint of the four-point accuracy scale (2.5). Our preferred knowledge outcome measures are four-point accuracy scales where the most accurate response is \u201cNot accurate at all.\u201d However, if concerns are raised about which response is most accurate, we may consider a binary outcome measure where \u201cNot very accurate\u201d and \u201cNot accurate at all\u201d are coded as 1 and \u201cVery accurate\u201d and \u201cSomewhat accurate\u201d are coded as 0. If feasible, we will implement an estimator designed for a DRPT design instead of or in addition to OLS with robust standard errors (Gaines and Kuklinski 2007; Knox et al. N.d.). We may also use seemingly unrelated regression to increase the efficiency of our estimation for correlated variables. Finally, we may use multinomial regression for the article choice outcome if there is an indication that choice behaviors vary in complex ways that our individual article choice measure does not capture. A pre-test on Mechanical Turk found that 32% of respondents preferred to read a fact-check article among the six offered to respondents in the study. However, if too few respondents on YouGov select fact-checking articles as their preferred content choice, we will instead pool the respondents who selected any political news article (whether fact-checking or not) to increase statistical power. We will pool the respondents in this way if fewer than 10% of respondents select a fact-checking article. In our observational analyses, we will control for the following standard outcome measures in addition to measures of candidate preference and political knowledge: sex (indicator for female), age (indicators for age categories of 30-44, 45-59, and 60+; 18-29 excluded), race (indicator for black) Additional notes: -We will also compute and report summary statistics for our sample as well as measures of respondent attention and comprehension, including both response timing data and accuracy of answers to manipulation check questions about the stimulus articles. -Our primary experimental effect estimates will be unweighted per Franco et al. (N.d.), though we may also report weighted results. -The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity. -Note: We may estimate models that include a standard set of demographic covariates (indicators for gender, age groups, race, and political knowledge) if including those demographic measures has a substantively important effect on the precision of our treatment effect estimates. In that case, however, both models would be reported. -Where applicable, regression results for binary dependent variables will be verified for robustness using probit. Regression results for individual ordered dependent variables will be verified for robustness using ordered probit. Regression results for ordered scales constructed from multinomial data will be verified for robustness using multinomial logit or multinomial probit. Regression results for count variables will be verified for robustness using Poisson regression with robust standard errors or negative binomial regression. - As a robustness check, we will use the Pulse tracking data to test whether respondents used search engines to look up answers to any knowledge questions. Relatedly, we may test for correlations between self-reported and actual (as measured by Pulse) knowledge cheating. -Duplicate visits to the same URL will be counted in measures of fact-checking and fake news consumption if they are not successive (i.e., a page that was reloaded after first opening it). -In analyzing the data, we may check if the learning effects of randomly assigned fact-check exposure (versus non-political articles) are higher for people with greater political knowledge or whether learning effects (versus non-political articles) are greater for respondents who read one or more fact-checks (binary measure) in the two weeks prior to the study than those who did not, but do not consider these to be primary hypotheses or research questions of the study.
