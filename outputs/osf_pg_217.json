This effect should be especially prominent on the first two trials of the test phase. \n\nIf performance in the Consistent Label condition does not show this pattern and infants instead successfully remember individuals from familiarization, this will suggest that at 7 months, consistently-applied labels may benefit categorization by boosting attention to individual exemplars.\n\nFor Distinct Labels: If applying distinct labels to each exemplar highlights differences among the exemplars, then we hypothesize that 7-month-old infants should more readily distinguish a previously seen exemplar and a new exemplar of the same category.  As a result, we predict greater looking towards a new object of the same category versus a previously seen exemplar (in other words, a novelty preference). This effect should be especially prominent on the first two trials of the test phase. \n\nLastly, we also hypothesize that novelty preference scores between the two conditions (Consistent Labels VS Distinct Labels) will be different, indicating a significant effect of condition on infants\u2019 memory for the individual exemplars. This effect should be especially prominent on the first two trials of the test phase. \n\nIf performance in both conditions is at chance, this may suggest that the task is too difficult for the younger infants.
