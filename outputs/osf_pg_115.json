Participants are adults who reside in a study park\u2019s zone of influence, which is deemed to be 0.5km (0.31mi), which is an approximate 15-minute walk to the park and also a reasonable maximum distance for hearing birdsong in an urban setting. Participants will be recruited from within a 16-cell grid (120m2/cell) around each park. Thus, the unit of measurement is the individual, but the unit of assignment-to-intervention is neighborhood. We conducted a pilot study in two neighborhoods in 2018 (n = 69 participants enrolled) and received funding at the end of the summer in 2019, yielding a truncated field season (n=170 participants). The first full field season for this study will be 2020. To recruit participants, we mail postcards and conduct recruitment activities (e.g., information booths) in each neighborhood. Field staff then visit homes in each study neighborhood to brief potential participants on the study, request participation, and screen for inclusion. We recruit only one English-speaking male or female (\u2265 18y) without mobility issues per household, which is at the household\u2019s discretion. To ensure participant comprehension and confirm contact information, we use an electronic text message to finalize enrollment. Participants are then instructed on the correct usage of the accelerometer (Actigraph GT3X), Global Positioning System (GPS) device (Canmore) and cortisol sample collection and instructed that a study shuttle will take them to their scheduled health appointment in our study office. The target total sample is 450 adults to be recruited and retained. To retain participants, we will employ a set of strategies including: 1) sending holiday cards with neighborhood-level results; 2) sending birthday cards; and 3) sending periodic, brief surveys through StANDApp.\n\nPhysical activity (primary outcome) measured using accelerometry. PA and sedentary behavior are measured using the ActiGraph accelerometer (ActiGraph model GT3X; Pensacola, FL). The ActiGraph is a triaxial accelerometer that measures acceleration in three planes of motion. Accelerometers capture and filter acceleration signals that are digitized and recorded as count values that are stored in investigator-defined intervals. Raw data are stored and may also be used for analyses. The accelerometers will be worn on an elastic waistband, placed at the right hip, for all waking hours over seven days at each of the study\u2019s four measurement time points (all during the summer or early autumn). Data will be collected in raw mode (30 Hz) and aggregated to 1-min values for analyses. The primary outcome is total PA counts per week, which has been associated with cardio-metabolic outcomes and biomarkers. Analyses will also include number of minutes spent at given PA intensity levels using cut-points of Freedson et al. (\u22651952 counts/min) for moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA and Matthews et al. (&lt;100 counts/min) for sedentary behavior, with light PA as 100-1951 counts/min. We will also explore PA intensity levels using vector magnitude cutpoints. In addition, these measures will be stratified by whether the PA occurred in the study park, in any greenspace, or elsewhere (based on GPS data). This will provide an indication of the proportion of \u2018green PA\u2019 from total PA. Periods of 60 minutes or more of continuous zeroes are considered non-wear times and not included in the calculation of total wear time. To be included, we will require \u22654 days of PA data (wear time \u22658-10 hr/day) per time point. If high levels of missing data exist, imputation strategies will be utilized. PA data will be collected at the same time of year (summer months only) to account for seasonality.\n\nMobility and park contact measured using GPS data. GPS units (Canmore) will be worn for one week, on an elastic belt with an accelerometer. At the end of the week of observation, data will be downloaded. To calculate the amount of time spent in \u2018green PA\u2019, these data will be linked with accelerometer data using time. Accelerometer data are then restricted using a threshold for PA and lux (&gt;400). Speed is calculated and data are further restricted by excluding speeds &gt;25kmph. This results in total green PA. We will also use GPS data to calculate the actual contact time spent within view of the park and usage of park. To calculate time spent within view of park, we will create \u2018viewsheds\u2019 around each park to determine all possible viewpoints from which the park can be seen, accounting for obstacles such as buildings, as we have done previously. To calculate usage of park, all GPS points located within 10m of the park boundaries will be compiled to calculate time spent in park.\n\nStress measures (secondary outcome). We will measure salivary cortisol, perceived stress and anxiety. Stress alters the dynamics of the diurnal rhythm of cortisol secretion, and people who are chronically stressed exhibit lower morning and higher evening concentrations, yielding flattened slopes. Samples will be collected using the passive drool method at waking, and 12-hr after waking to permit calculation of time point concentrations and the slope of cortisol from waking to evening. The saliva collection kit contains collection supplies, a response sheet and reminder instructions. Participants will be reminded to take and freeze samples at designated times the day before their scheduled health appointment via StANDApp and/or text. Participants will also be reminded to bring kits to their appointment the next day. In the field, samples will be stored in a manual-defrost freezer and shipped on dry ice (once per measurement period) to Northwestern University\u2019s Laboratory for Human Biology Research where they will be thawed, centrifuged and the supernatant aliquoted into replicate samples in smaller tubes and analyzed in duplicate. Low, medium, and high concentration controls will be prepared in at t=0 for use throughout the study to monitor inter-assay variability. Cortisol will be measured using the Salimetrics ELISA kit as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nWe will also use two stress indicators via the survey, including: 1) Anxiety and Depression, measured via NIH\u2019s Adult PROMIS-29 Profile v2.0; and 2) the Perceived Stress Scale, comprising 10 items (e.g., feeling nervous) measured on Likert-type scale (0=low, 40=max stress). The perceived stress scale has been validated in multiple populations, and the face validity and scale content were ranked high with a Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin coefficient of 0.82. The scale\u2019s internal consistency reliability was good in multiple languages and convergent validity was supported by expected relationships with other mental health measures, including anxiety and depression. The PROMIS-29\u2019s (our measures of anxiety and depressive symptoms) internal consistency for sub-domains has been shown to be high (Cronbach's \u03b1\u2009&gt;\u20090.88), with adequate structural validity for most domains (CFI\u2009&gt;\u20090.95, RMSEA\u2009&lt;\u20090.05) (78).\n\nAnthropometric and cardio-metabolic measures (downstream outcomes).  Cardio-metabolic outcomes will include body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin A1C (A1C) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Height will be measured twice using a stadiometer (SECA Corp). Weight will be measured twice using a scale with bioelectric impedance capability (Tanita TBF-300). Waist and hip measurements will be taken twice with a Gulick tape, according to World Health Organization (WHO) procedures and the waist-to-hip ratio calculated. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures will be measured as markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk using an automatic upper arm monitor (Omron HEM-711DLX), according to American College of Cardiology recommendations (80). With the patient seated, two blood pressure measurements will be taken at 30 second intervals. The average of each set of measurements will be used for height, weight, waist and hip measurements and blood pressure. BMI will be calculated and expressed as kg/m2. A1C will be measured from blood samples collected from finger-tip sticks using portable analyzers and test strips (A1CNow+). Participants will be given these results immediately, including normal ranges and recommendations for consulting a physician. CRP will be measured to indicate chronic inflammation, associated with obesity, Type 2 diabetes, cancer, and CVD. DBS samples will be collected on Whatman 903 Protein Saver Cards from finger sticks following collection of blood for the A1C analyses. DBS serves as the lowest risk, least invasive blood sampling technique. Circulating levels of CRP in young, healthy adults average 0.8 mg/l. Chronic stress induces small changes in the range of 2-5 ng/l necessitating the use of high-sensitivity assays for CRP. Upon collection of DBS, samples will be transferred to Northwestern University\u2019s Laboratory for Human Biology Research where CRP will be eluted from the DBS and assayed using a CRP assay previously validated in their laboratory for use with DBS. To reduce inter-assay variability and improve quality control, all samples will be stored with humidity sponges and oxygen absorbents and frozen (-20\u00b0C) until the final data collection year (2022) and then analyzed concurrently, with no expected degradation.\n\nSurvey. Basic demographic data information (age, sex, ethnicity, employment, household composition, length of residence) will be collected at recruitment or when re-contacted at each timepoint. Then, each participant will complete a self-administered paper survey in the privacy of their own home to assess: income, perceptions of the neighborhood, disease and prescription medication history, diet, perceived stress, anxiety and depression symptoms (discussed previously), nature-relatedness; all which were considered potential correlates of device-based PA and stress. Questions about the perceptions of the social and environmental features of neighborhoods have been shown to have moderate to high agreement (rho range=0.42-0.91). Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating (FLASHE) questions related to diet were reviewed by the scientific experts for consistency with existing, validated measures. The nature-relatedness scale (NR-6) has been shown to demonstrate good internal consistency, temporal stability, and predict happiness, environmental concern, and nature contact. Measures that may serve as confounders include: 1) symptoms of acute illness or infection or prescription medication which could influence biomarker measures; 2) attitudes toward nature using the NR-6, because these may influence behaviors; and 3) perceived safety which may influence stress, PA, and park usage.\n\nPark observations and imagery. The positive visual exposures of interest include the presence of people using the park, signage, mowing and other signs of care, diversity of plants and birds and greenness. Negative visual exposures include the presence of litter, arson, graffiti and broken windows of buildings along the park perimeter (called signs of disorder). We will employ two methods to obtain these data. First, Audubon volunteers will inventory plants in quadrants and count bird species using point counts less than three hours after sunrise, measuring species abundances. Volunteers will be trained by Audubon, and inter-observer reliability assessed by having two or more observers collect data simultaneously but independently. Plant/bird species richness and biodiversity measurement will employ the well-established Shannon Diversity and Simpson Indexes and Evar Evenness Index. Trained graduate students will also make observations of signs of care and the System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities (SOPARC). SOPARC provides an assessment of park users\u2019 PA levels, gender, activity types, and estimated age and ethnicity groupings as well as information on a park\u2019s level of accessibility, usability, supervision, and organization with a high internal correlation between items (r=0.75), and exhibiting high inter-rater reliability (0.80-0.99). All nine parks, each of which consists of only one target area due their small size, will be observed twice over one day (9am-2pm) during randomly scheduled days without rain in summer months, by two raters. INT and CNT parks will be observed at the same time on different days for parallel observations. Signs of care involve observations (presence/absence) of manmade and natural items in a park and provides a categorical quality rating for each item, which is based on qualitative work in Detroit. Second, we will measure visual greenness and negative visual exposures (signs of disorder) via 360\u00b0 images captured along each park perimeter, using a mounted camera (Samsung Gear 360). Images will be used to measure visual greenness, by quantifying pixels of greenery using methods we developed. Images will also be used to assess negative exposures using Marco et al.\u2019s neighbor disorder coding protocol, which has shown acceptable ICCs (0.41-0.60) for the mean level of subscales of physical disorder and decay and has also been validated (showing high correlations) with physical audits, police impressions, and neighborhood socioeconomic status. This virtual auditing approach has been validated across several samples. We will employ two weighting schemes to create individual-level visual exposures from the park measures. First, we will weight each exposure by the actual contact time spent within view of the park in the one-week observation time using the GPS data as described previously. Second, we will calculate the percentage of the viewshed occupied by the park, as seen from the participant\u2019s home by capturing a 360\u00b0 image from the front door of the home location. We will then create weights using these measures, to be applied to each of the visual exposures above. \n\nNeighborhood soundscapes. Positive and negative auditory exposures will be assessed by acoustic recordings collected by 90 AudioMoth v1.1.0 acoustic loggers (Open Acoustic Devices).  Nine devices will be placed at least 100 m apart randomly in a 500 m grid around each park, and one device will be placed inside each park. We will record for one week in June, corresponding with Audubon\u2019s bird surveys, selecting days to standardize weather conditions. To predict negative auditory exposure, we will calculate environmental noise metrics known to relate to human annoyance, health, and perception including: LAeq,T (A-weighted equivalent sound level (L) over time); LAmax (maximum A-weighted equivalent L over time); LA10 and LA90 (A-weighted L exceeded 10 and 90% of time); LA10 - LA90, LDN (Day-Night average L, where night events receive a 10dB penalty); LDEN (Day-Evening-High equivalency L); roughness (temporal variation in amplitude), and sharpness (126-129). \nTo examine positive auditory exposure, trained staff will count the number and duration of sound categories using observations of spectrograms in Raven Pro software (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). Sound categories are \u2018anthropogenic\u2019 (e.g., vehicle, people), \u2018geological\u2019 (e.g., wind), and \u2018biological\u2019 (e.g., birdsong). Additionally, we will further categorize bird song to species, in order to generate species richness and diversity of the acoustic community. We will combine the duration/frequency and richness of biological with geological sounds into a metric of positive exposure. Using values of each acoustic exposure metric, we will then predict levels throughout the study area using spatial kriging models. We will extract the positive and negative exposure levels for participants at each time point. \n\nWeather data. While we restrict data collection to summer months (May-September), weather conditions at the time of data collection and the two weeks prior to data collection may influence both exposures of interest and outcomes. Thus, we will compile daily precipitation and high temperature data for every day during data collection and the two weeks preceding data collection for each time point, from the weather station at Detroit airport (DTW)."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "With a total of 9 parks (4 in INT, 5 in CNT), we will need a sample of 450 participants, or 50 per park, to detect EF = 0.35 with 82% power, based on a two-sided test at significance level 5%.

Participants are adults who reside in a study park\u2019s zone of influence, which is deemed to be 0.5km (0.31mi), which is an approximate 15-minute walk to the park and also a reasonable maximum distance for hearing birdsong in an urban setting. Participants will be recruited from within a 16-cell grid (120m2/cell) around each park. Thus, the unit of measurement is the individual, but the unit of assignment-to-intervention is neighborhood. We conducted a pilot study in two neighborhoods in 2018 (n = 69 participants enrolled) and received funding at the end of the summer in 2019, yielding a truncated field season (n=170 participants). The first full field season for this study will be 2020. To recruit participants, we mail postcards and conduct recruitment activities (e.g., information booths) in each neighborhood. Field staff then visit homes in each study neighborhood to brief potential participants on the study, request participation, and screen for inclusion. We recruit only one English-speaking male or female (\u2265 18y) without mobility issues per household, which is at the household\u2019s discretion. To ensure participant comprehension and confirm contact information, we use an electronic text message to finalize enrollment. Participants are then instructed on the correct usage of the accelerometer (Actigraph GT3X), Global Positioning System (GPS) device (Canmore) and cortisol sample collection and instructed that a study shuttle will take them to their scheduled health appointment in our study office. The target total sample is 450 adults to be recruited and retained. To retain participants, we will employ a set of strategies including: 1) sending holiday cards with neighborhood-level results; 2) sending birthday cards; and 3) sending periodic, brief surveys through StANDApp.\n\nPhysical activity (primary outcome) measured using accelerometry. PA and sedentary behavior are measured using the ActiGraph accelerometer (ActiGraph model GT3X; Pensacola, FL). The ActiGraph is a triaxial accelerometer that measures acceleration in three planes of motion. Accelerometers capture and filter acceleration signals that are digitized and recorded as count values that are stored in investigator-defined intervals. Raw data are stored and may also be used for analyses. The accelerometers will be worn on an elastic waistband, placed at the right hip, for all waking hours over seven days at each of the study\u2019s four measurement time points (all during the summer or early autumn). Data will be collected in raw mode (30 Hz) and aggregated to 1-min values for analyses. The primary outcome is total PA counts per week, which has been associated with cardio-metabolic outcomes and biomarkers. Analyses will also include number of minutes spent at given PA intensity levels using cut-points of Freedson et al. (\u22651952 counts/min) for moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA and Matthews et al. (&lt;100 counts/min) for sedentary behavior, with light PA as 100-1951 counts/min. We will also explore PA intensity levels using vector magnitude cutpoints. In addition, these measures will be stratified by whether the PA occurred in the study park, in any greenspace, or elsewhere (based on GPS data). This will provide an indication of the proportion of \u2018green PA\u2019 from total PA. Periods of 60 minutes or more of continuous zeroes are considered non-wear times and not included in the calculation of total wear time. To be included, we will require \u22654 days of PA data (wear time \u22658-10 hr/day) per time point. If high levels of missing data exist, imputation strategies will be utilized. PA data will be collected at the same time of year (summer months only) to account for seasonality.\n\nMobility and park contact measured using GPS data. GPS units (Canmore) will be worn for one week, on an elastic belt with an accelerometer. At the end of the week of observation, data will be downloaded. To calculate the amount of time spent in \u2018green PA\u2019, these data will be linked with accelerometer data using time. Accelerometer data are then restricted using a threshold for PA and lux (&gt;400). Speed is calculated and data are further restricted by excluding speeds &gt;25kmph. This results in total green PA. We will also use GPS data to calculate the actual contact time spent within view of the park and usage of park. To calculate time spent within view of park, we will create \u2018viewsheds\u2019 around each park to determine all possible viewpoints from which the park can be seen, accounting for obstacles such as buildings, as we have done previously. To calculate usage of park, all GPS points located within 10m of the park boundaries will be compiled to calculate time spent in park.\n\nStress measures (secondary outcome). We will measure salivary cortisol, perceived stress and anxiety. Stress alters the dynamics of the diurnal rhythm of cortisol secretion, and people who are chronically stressed exhibit lower morning and higher evening concentrations, yielding flattened slopes. Samples will be collected using the passive drool method at waking, and 12-hr after waking to permit calculation of time point concentrations and the slope of cortisol from waking to evening. The saliva collection kit contains collection supplies, a response sheet and reminder instructions. Participants will be reminded to take and freeze samples at designated times the day before their scheduled health appointment via StANDApp and/or text. Participants will also be reminded to bring kits to their appointment the next day. In the field, samples will be stored in a manual-defrost freezer and shipped on dry ice (once per measurement period) to Northwestern University\u2019s Laboratory for Human Biology Research where they will be thawed, centrifuged and the supernatant aliquoted into replicate samples in smaller tubes and analyzed in duplicate. Low, medium, and high concentration controls will be prepared in at t=0 for use throughout the study to monitor inter-assay variability. Cortisol will be measured using the Salimetrics ELISA kit as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nWe will also use two stress indicators via the survey, including: 1) Anxiety and Depression, measured via NIH\u2019s Adult PROMIS-29 Profile v2.0; and 2) the Perceived Stress Scale, comprising 10 items (e.g., feeling nervous) measured on Likert-type scale (0=low, 40=max stress). The perceived stress scale has been validated in multiple populations, and the face validity and scale content were ranked high with a Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin coefficient of 0.82. The scale\u2019s internal consistency reliability was good in multiple languages and convergent validity was supported by expected relationships with other mental health measures, including anxiety and depression. The PROMIS-29\u2019s (our measures of anxiety and depressive symptoms) internal consistency for sub-domains has been shown to be high (Cronbach's \u03b1\u2009&gt;\u20090.88), with adequate structural validity for most domains (CFI\u2009&gt;\u20090.95, RMSEA\u2009&lt;\u20090.05) (78).\n\nAnthropometric and cardio-metabolic measures (downstream outcomes).  Cardio-metabolic outcomes will include body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin A1C (A1C) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Height will be measured twice using a stadiometer (SECA Corp). Weight will be measured twice using a scale with bioelectric impedance capability (Tanita TBF-300). Waist and hip measurements will be taken twice with a Gulick tape, according to World Health Organization (WHO) procedures and the waist-to-hip ratio calculated. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures will be measured as markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk using an automatic upper arm monitor (Omron HEM-711DLX), according to American College of Cardiology recommendations (80). With the patient seated, two blood pressure measurements will be taken at 30 second intervals. The average of each set of measurements will be used for height, weight, waist and hip measurements and blood pressure. BMI will be calculated and expressed as kg/m2. A1C will be measured from blood samples collected from finger-tip sticks using portable analyzers and test strips (A1CNow+). Participants will be given these results immediately, including normal ranges and recommendations for consulting a physician. CRP will be measured to indicate chronic inflammation, associated with obesity, Type 2 diabetes, cancer, and CVD. DBS samples will be collected on Whatman 903 Protein Saver Cards from finger sticks following collection of blood for the A1C analyses. DBS serves as the lowest risk, least invasive blood sampling technique. Circulating levels of CRP in young, healthy adults average 0.8 mg/l. Chronic stress induces small changes in the range of 2-5 ng/l necessitating the use of high-sensitivity assays for CRP. Upon collection of DBS, samples will be transferred to Northwestern University\u2019s Laboratory for Human Biology Research where CRP will be eluted from the DBS and assayed using a CRP assay previously validated in their laboratory for use with DBS. To reduce inter-assay variability and improve quality control, all samples will be stored with humidity sponges and oxygen absorbents and frozen (-20\u00b0C) until the final data collection year (2022) and then analyzed concurrently, with no expected degradation.\n\nSurvey. Basic demographic data information (age, sex, ethnicity, employment, household composition, length of residence) will be collected at recruitment or when re-contacted at each timepoint. Then, each participant will complete a self-administered paper survey in the privacy of their own home to assess: income, perceptions of the neighborhood, disease and prescription medication history, diet, perceived stress, anxiety and depression symptoms (discussed previously), nature-relatedness; all which were considered potential correlates of device-based PA and stress. Questions about the perceptions of the social and environmental features of neighborhoods have been shown to have moderate to high agreement (rho range=0.42-0.91). Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating (FLASHE) questions related to diet were reviewed by the scientific experts for consistency with existing, validated measures. The nature-relatedness scale (NR-6) has been shown to demonstrate good internal consistency, temporal stability, and predict happiness, environmental concern, and nature contact. Measures that may serve as confounders include: 1) symptoms of acute illness or infection or prescription medication which could influence biomarker measures; 2) attitudes toward nature using the NR-6, because these may influence behaviors; and 3) perceived safety which may influence stress, PA, and park usage.\n\nPark observations and imagery. The positive visual exposures of interest include the presence of people using the park, signage, mowing and other signs of care, diversity of plants and birds and greenness. Negative visual exposures include the presence of litter, arson, graffiti and broken windows of buildings along the park perimeter (called signs of disorder). We will employ two methods to obtain these data. First, Audubon volunteers will inventory plants in quadrants and count bird species using point counts less than three hours after sunrise, measuring species abundances. Volunteers will be trained by Audubon, and inter-observer reliability assessed by having two or more observers collect data simultaneously but independently. Plant/bird species richness and biodiversity measurement will employ the well-established Shannon Diversity and Simpson Indexes and Evar Evenness Index. Trained graduate students will also make observations of signs of care and the System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities (SOPARC). SOPARC provides an assessment of park users\u2019 PA levels, gender, activity types, and estimated age and ethnicity groupings as well as information on a park\u2019s level of accessibility, usability, supervision, and organization with a high internal correlation between items (r=0.75), and exhibiting high inter-rater reliability (0.80-0.99). All nine parks, each of which consists of only one target area due their small size, will be observed twice over one day (9am-2pm) during randomly scheduled days without rain in summer months, by two raters. INT and CNT parks will be observed at the same time on different days for parallel observations. Signs of care involve observations (presence/absence) of manmade and natural items in a park and provides a categorical quality rating for each item, which is based on qualitative work in Detroit. Second, we will measure visual greenness and negative visual exposures (signs of disorder) via 360\u00b0 images captured along each park perimeter, using a mounted camera (Samsung Gear 360). Images will be used to measure visual greenness, by quantifying pixels of greenery using methods we developed. Images will also be used to assess negative exposures using Marco et al.\u2019s neighbor disorder coding protocol, which has shown acceptable ICCs (0.41-0.60) for the mean level of subscales of physical disorder and decay and has also been validated (showing high correlations) with physical audits, police impressions, and neighborhood socioeconomic status. This virtual auditing approach has been validated across several samples. We will employ two weighting schemes to create individual-level visual exposures from the park measures. First, we will weight each exposure by the actual contact time spent within view of the park in the one-week observation time using the GPS data as described previously. Second, we will calculate the percentage of the viewshed occupied by the park, as seen from the participant\u2019s home by capturing a 360\u00b0 image from the front door of the home location. We will then create weights using these measures, to be applied to each of the visual exposures above. \n\nNeighborhood soundscapes. Positive and negative auditory exposures will be assessed by acoustic recordings collected by 90 AudioMoth v1.1.0 acoustic loggers (Open Acoustic Devices).  Nine devices will be placed at least 100 m apart randomly in a 500 m grid around each park, and one device will be placed inside each park. We will record for one week in June, corresponding with Audubon\u2019s bird surveys, selecting days to standardize weather conditions. To predict negative auditory exposure, we will calculate environmental noise metrics known to relate to human annoyance, health, and perception including: LAeq,T (A-weighted equivalent sound level (L) over time); LAmax (maximum A-weighted equivalent L over time); LA10 and LA90 (A-weighted L exceeded 10 and 90% of time); LA10 - LA90, LDN (Day-Night average L, where night events receive a 10dB penalty); LDEN (Day-Evening-High equivalency L); roughness (temporal variation in amplitude), and sharpness (126-129). \nTo examine positive auditory exposure, trained staff will count the number and duration of sound categories using observations of spectrograms in Raven Pro software (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). Sound categories are \u2018anthropogenic\u2019 (e.g., vehicle, people), \u2018geological\u2019 (e.g., wind), and \u2018biological\u2019 (e.g., birdsong). Additionally, we will further categorize bird song to species, in order to generate species richness and diversity of the acoustic community. We will combine the duration/frequency and richness of biological with geological sounds into a metric of positive exposure. Using values of each acoustic exposure metric, we will then predict levels throughout the study area using spatial kriging models. We will extract the positive and negative exposure levels for participants at each time point. \n\nWeather data. While we restrict data collection to summer months (May-September), weather conditions at the time of data collection and the two weeks prior to data collection may influence both exposures of interest and outcomes. Thus, we will compile daily precipitation and high temperature data for every day during data collection and the two weeks preceding data collection for each time point, from the weather station at Detroit airport (DTW).", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "n/a", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Refer to the attached Table 1 for the tools, scale of measurement, and measurements that will be obtained annually 2019-2024.", "q17.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e83965c8140b40161423049", "file_name": "Table1_Variables_StANDReg-OSF_31Mar2020.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/surx7/files/osfstorage/5e83965c8140b40161423049", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e83965c8140b40161423049"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "e47635119947e2673d919969ee95aee5e5f056af8782284883ebedfa54571835"}}], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Assuming a longitudinal panel design, we will compare intervention parks (INT) to control parks (CNT) at baseline using as appropriate ANOVA-F-tests, chi-square tests and non-parametric tests to determine equivalence of potentially confounding physiological and contextual participant characteristics.

Based on the effect size obtained in a previous study (f = 0.15), with alpha = .05, power = .90, this 2 \u00d7 2\u00d7 2 experiment requires a sample size of 469. Participants who identify as British nationals aged 18 or above will be recruited via Prolific Academic (www.prolific.ac) and will receive approximately \u00a31.42 in exchange for participation. We will exclude participants who fail at least one attention check item, and report being \u201cnot at all offended\u201d by the incident. \nProcedure. Participants will first read a Wikipedia-style article that either describes East Timorese as highly sociable (high warmth condition) or unsociable (low warmth condition). Following the warmth manipulation, participants will complete attention checks, and measures of warmth and trust. Participants will then read a fictitious news article titled, \u201cEast Timor to investigate abuse of British tourists during custom checks,\u201d which describes the fictional offense based on a real-world incident of alleged abuse of a Taiwanese tour group in Vietnam (DeAeth, 2019). The article will recount that a group of British tourists visiting East Timor were harassed and coerced into paying bribes to customs and immigration officials. The article will also mention that female travelers reported being inappropriately touched by male security officials. The article will also contain the apology manipulation.

As in two previous experiments, the \u201cnot at all\u201d participants will be excluded from further analyses. Participants will then complete the measure of forgiveness towards East Timorese in general. Finally, participants will be debriefed, in writing, about the true purpose of the study and thanked for their participation.\nMaterials.\nApology manipulation. In the no-apology condition, participants will read, \u201cFollowing the official inquiry from the UK, the East Timorese government pledged to launch an investigation into the accusations but is yet to issue an official apology.\u201d Participants in the apology condition will read, \u201cFollowing the official inquiry from the UK, the East Timorese government issued an apology and pledged to launch an investigation into the accusations.\u201d They will be presented with the full text of the ostensible apology. \nWarmth manipulation. In the high warmth condition, East Timorese will be described as warm, friendly, and sociable people who enjoy spending time with others, greet friends and family with a big hug and openly smile and talk to strangers. Participants in the low-warmth condition will read that East Timorese are unfriendly, cold, and unsociable people who prefer doing things alone, are reserved in their interactions with others and never smile or talk to strangers. The warmth manipulation will not contain morality-related information.  \nPerceived warmth.

Items will be rated on a seven-point Likert-scale, anchored at 1 (strongly disagree) and 7 (strongly agree), and will be averaged to obtain a composite trust score.\nOffendedness. Participants will be asked \u201cHow offended were you by the incident described in the passage?\u201d and will indicate whether they are \u201cnot at all,\u201d \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery much\u201d offended. Those who report being \u201cnot at all offended\u201d will be removed from further analyses.\nForgiveness. Forgiveness towards East Timorese will be measured using six items. Four items are adapted from Wohl et al.

In the case of the novel corona virus (nCOVID-19) outbreak in late 2019/ early 2020 that started in Wuhan, China there suddenly is a pandemic crisis that affects the whole world and poses a variety of real-life moral dilemmas.

As studies have shown that the level of relationship to a threatened other can alter moral decision-making (e.g. Topolski, Weaver, Martin, and McCoy, 2013), we do expect that personal affectedness will modulate the decision-making process.

The criticism of the lack of external validity and low plausibility has been much discussed for trolley dilemmas but is at the same time difficult to overcome (Bauman, McGraw, Bartels, &amp; Warren, 2014; K\u00f6rner, Joffe, &amp; Deutsch, 2019). In the case of the novel corona virus (nCOVID-19) outbreak in late 2019/ early 2020 that started in Wuhan, China there suddenly is a pandemic crisis that affects the whole world and poses a variety of real-life moral dilemmas. Even more interestingly, these moral dilemmas occur on different levels. Some are personal, some are posed on structural and societal levels, including economic decision-making. The goal of the current study is to investigate how moral decision-making is influenced by personal exposure to a crisis, how personal and timely proximity plays a role and how it is perceived in three different societies (Iran, Italy, Germany) that have different peaks of the outbreak and a different approach of dealing with the situation by their respective governments. As studies have shown that the level of relationship to a threatened other can alter moral decision-making (e.g. Topolski, Weaver, Martin, and McCoy, 2013), we do expect that personal affectedness will modulate the decision-making process. Furthermore, previous research indicates that there are demographic differences, such as age or education that modulate how much people adapt to protective behavior measures (Bish &amp; Michie, 2010). These differences based on demographics might also be observable in the moral decision-making.", "q4": "We do expect a difference between personal and institutional scenarios\n\nPersonal scenarios\n\u2022\tFor time-point 1 we expect that the more the person is affected himself or herself or they or their family members are part of a risk group, the more likely they will choose to help the individual (deontological choice).

The present study explored mRNA expression levels and prognostic values of MT1 isoforms in ccRCC tissues using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Profiling and Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and Oncomine database. The study observed that mRNA expression levels of six members of MT1 isoforms decreased in renal cancer tumor tissues compared with normal tissues. We further found that high-expression of MT1G, MT1H, MT1F and MT1X was related with poor overall survival time in ccRCC patients and high-expression of MT1G, MT1F and MT1X were inversely associated with disease-free survival time in ccRCC patients. Based on the correlation analysis, MT1G was identified to be co-expressed with MT1H and MT1F in ccRCC tissues.

Accordingly, these analyses have not been able to examine whether individual differences in emotional granularity might correspond with the performance of a classifier trained on participants' own data. This is an important distinction, as, in theory, individuals with higher granularity may not evidence the same patterns of physiological activity as individuals with lower granularity; as such, comparing classifier performance on nomothetically-supervised data (e.g., trained to identify instances of induced anger or fear) may not yield meaningful results.

However, the data used in these analyses has not been collected in an idiographic manner, such that each individual's data may represent instances from different emotions (i.e., classes). Accordingly, these analyses have not been able to examine whether individual differences in emotional granularity might correspond with the performance of a classifier trained on participants' own data. This is an important distinction, as, in theory, individuals with higher granularity may not evidence the same patterns of physiological activity as individuals with lower granularity; as such, comparing classifier performance on nomothetically-supervised data (e.g., trained to identify instances of induced anger or fear) may not yield meaningful results.
