knowledge is costly, yet an informed electorate is thought to be a vital component of a well-functioning democracy. This field experiment examines which situational motivations increase an individual\u2019s willingness to consume political information. It will also explore the consequences of consuming this information on interest in politics, policy attitudes and vote choice. Experimental Design: This experiment will be carried out in partnership with a mid-sized daily newspaper in California. In May 2014, about one month prior to California\u2019s statewide primary elections, the newspaper will send emails to 100,000 members of their email list. Members of the list will receive a randomly assigned message drawn from four different types designed by the researchers. Each email version will highlight a different motivation for visiting the newspaper\u2019s primary election voter guide and ask recipients to click through to the newspaper\u2019s website. The four email conditions are: 1. Instrumental Gains: This email highlights the state government\u2019s role in funding education. We anticipate will be particularly effective at encouraging traffic among parents and have blocked on parent status in our experimental design. 2. Civic duty: This email message stresses the fact that \u201cgood citizens\u201d do their part to hold government officials in check by staying informed. 3. Polarization: This message stresses the partisan infighting in the state house in California, and urges people to keep up with the latest episode in the battle between the two parties. 4. Placebo: This email message simply encourages people to visit the newspaper\u2019s web site to stay informed, but will not highlight any particular motivation for doing so. 5. Control: A fifth group will be randomly selected to receive no email of any kind. This group will later be invited, along with the email recipients, to fill out a survey about the election. Individuals on the email list were assigned into experimental conditions in the following manner. First, 100,000 email addresses were randomly selected from a larger list maintained by the newspaper. Based on a request by the newspaper, 50,000 of the names sampled were drawn from individuals that currently subscribe to receive emails from the newspaper, and 50,000 were drawn from individuals who do not currently subscribe to any of the newspapers email lists. Within both the subscriber and non-subscriber samples we used marketing data to block members of the email list into three groups: those with children (whom we expect to respond especially strongly to the Instrumental Gains treatment); those without children; and those for whom parent-status is not available. This design results in six blocks of respondents. Within each of the six blocks, individuals were randomly assigned with equal probability to receive either no email, or one of the four email messages described above. Following the delivery of these emails, the newspaper will gather behavioral measures of the rates at which members of the five conditions (1) opened the emails and (2) clicked through to the web site, which will both serve as dependent variables in the analysis. Additional data on post-treatment web site traffic patterns among participants will also be collected. Approximately one week after the distribution of these emails, participants (including those in the control group) will be sent another email asking them to take an online survey designed by the researchers. The survey will measure demographic variables not available from the newspaper, and will also measure several additional dependent variables including political interest, intention to turnout in the primary election, vote preferences for the Gubernatorial, Congressional and State Assembly primary elections in a respondent\u2019s district, and respondent issue positions. Advances Over Previous Research Unlike prior studies of news consumption, which recruited volunteers and largely relied on self-reported measures, our field experiment is unique in that the data are collected in an unobtrusive manner (no mention of the research being conducted appears in the treatment emails) and is being delivered by a typical source of political information, a daily newspaper. Our analysis of the effects of news consumption will also have several advantages relative to previous work. First, the effects of news consumption will be examined in an ecologically valid manner. Using respondent zip codes, candidate options on the survey will match those each individual will face in the June primary. Second, the treatment, in this case exposure to a voter guide listing candidate\u2019s issue positions, is commonly employed by media outlets and represents a common way in which voters encounter political information.\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"Hypotheses: H1. Motivational emails will increase consumption of political information. Among those who receive an email, the motivational emails will cause individuals to score higher on the following measures than those who receive the placebo email: a) The rate at which emails are opened. b) The click-through rate to the newspaper\u2019s web site. H2: Voter Guide use will increase political participation, knowledge and spatial voting. Among those who receive an email, the motivational emails will increase use of the voter guide relative to the placebo email group. Consequently, we expect those receiving the emails to score higher on these outcomes: a) The willingness of individuals to participate in politics (as measured by political interest and turnout questions) b) The rate at which a set of political knowledge questions administered on the post-treatment survey are answered correctly. c) The degree to which the issue positions of participants matches the issue positions of the candidates for whom they intend to vote (i.e. spatial voting as measured in the post-treatment survey). We will also compare the treatment groups to the groups that received no email. We expect differences in participation, knowledge and spatial voting to be sharper when comparing the no-email individuals to the email groups (H2 c-e). This is because those in the group will likely have a relatively low rate of voter guide use. H3: Targeted Emails Will Prove More Effective At Increasing Information Consumption We expect that parents will respond more strongly to the Instrumental Gains treatment than will non-parents. We anticipate this because the message stresses education funding, a political issue with arguably disproportionately affects/concerns parents. More specifically, (a) parents who receive the Instrumental Gains treatment should open emails and click through to the newspaper web site at higher rates than non parents in the same condition, (b) among parents, those who received the Instrumental Gains treatment should score higher on post-treatment political knowledge questions than parents in other conditions, and (c) among parents, the issue positions of those who received the Instrumental Gains treatment should conform more to the issue positions of those individuals\u2019 preferred candidates than parents who were assigned to other conditions (i.e., they should exhibit higher levels of spatial voting). H4: Knowledge Effects Should be more pronounced for State Assembly Races Because state politics are not widely covered outside of local media sources, (while national politics are covered by a range of media outlets), we expect our encouragement emails to increase knowledge of State Assembly candidates more than knowledge of U.S. House candidates.\""}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "\"The newspaper will supply the researchers with measures of email opens, click-throughs and web site traffic data at the participant level prior to the administration of the post-treatment online survey. At this time it appears we will only receive traffic data for those who received an email and chose to click through, (though the newspaper has indicated they may remedy this issue prior to implementation). If that is the case, the traffic data will be censored, preventing its use in our later analysis. However, email opens and click-through rates will be available for all treated individuals, and responses on the post-treatment survey will be available for the entire sample of participants. Some individuals may choose not to take the post-treatment survey, but we anticipate that the tendency to take the survey should be roughly evenly distributed across treatment conditions. Intention To Treat Effects of Intervention To test H1(a-c), we will compare the mean email open and click-through rates across treatment conditions. To test H2b, the political knowledge hypothesis, we will compare the rates at which respondents correctly identified the positions of candidates running in their district across all conditions. The issues on which respondents will be quizzed will match the issues listed in the newspaper\u2019s online Voting Guide. U.S. House candidates were asked their positions on the following six issues: immigration reform, the federal minimum wage, drone strikes, government surveillance, health care and climate change. State Assembly candidates were asked about: high-speed rail, irrigation, legalizing marijuana, tax rates, social services and gun restrictions. Respondents will be given a random subset of these issues and asked to identify the positions of the candidates in their district, whose name, party and occupation will be supplied, on these issues. To test H2c, we will ask survey participants for their own positions on the same issues. Because we know the issues of the candidates in the voter guide, we will be able to assess the extent to which the issue positions of each respondent align with those of their preferred candidates (in developing the voter guide the newspaper had candidates answer the same survey questions that voters will not answer). We will then compare the alignment between own positions and candidate positions in the treatment and control groups to assess whether there is a difference. All the H3 and H4 hypotheses will be tested in a similar manner among the relevant subgroups. Complier Average Treatment Effects of Intervention: When comparing scores on all dependent variables across treatment groups, a simple difference in means test will be used to estimate intention to treat effects of this intervention. However, given that there will likely be two-sided noncompliance issues with using the voter guide (e.g., all individuals in the treatment group will not use the guide; some individuals in the control group may use the guide) we have also developed two ex-ante plans to estimate complier average treatment effects and make more efficient use of our data. We will use two approaches to estimate complier average treatment effects. First, because we will have behavioral data on email clickthroughs for all individuals in the treatment groups, we can instrument clicking through to the voter guide with assignment to one of the motivational email groups relative to the placebo treatment group. This instrumented measure of voter guide use can then be used in subsequent analyses on the effect of the voter guide on political information and propensity to engage in spatial voting. This approach will only be effective if large differences in click through rates exist between the placebo group and the other motivational treatment groups. Absent these large differences we will only have a weak instrument for voter guide use. Accordingly, we have also developed a second approach to estimate these effects. Second, we will measure voter guide use among all individuals in our follow up survey with a self-report measure. We can then instrument this self-report measure with assignment to one of the email treatment groups relative to the control group that received no email. This approach will be favorable if large differences in voter guide utilization exist between those receiving or not receiving the email. Our initial expectation is that this second approach will prove more useful in this setting as the instrument for this analysis should be stronger and, in instrumenting a self-reported measure of news consumption, we will reduce the measurement error commonly associated with these exposure self-reports.\""}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q27": {"extra": [], "value": "A mid-sized daily newspaper in California"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q30": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q38": {"extra": {}, "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "The Causes and Consequences of Consuming Political Information", "q2": "Jonathan Mummolo | Erik Peterson", "q3": "20140503AA", "q4": "05/03/2014 - 12:27", "q5": "", "q6": "", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to realization of outcomes", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "5/5/14", "q12": "", "q13": "", "q14": "No", "q15": "\"Background: Attaining political knowledge is costly, yet an informed electorate is thought to be a vital component of a well-functioning democracy.

More specifically, (a) parents who receive the Instrumental Gains treatment should open emails and click through to the newspaper web site at higher rates than non parents in the same condition, (b) among parents, those who received the Instrumental Gains treatment should score higher on post-treatment political knowledge questions than parents in other conditions, and (c) among parents, the issue positions of those who received the Instrumental Gains treatment should conform more to the issue positions of those individuals\u2019 preferred candidates than parents who were assigned to other conditions (i.e., they should exhibit higher levels of spatial voting). H4: Knowledge Effects Should be more pronounced for State Assembly Races Because state politics are not widely covered outside of local media sources, (while national politics are covered by a range of media outlets), we expect our encouragement emails to increase knowledge of State Assembly candidates more than knowledge of U.S. House candidates.\"", "q17": "\"The newspaper will supply the researchers with measures of email opens, click-throughs and web site traffic data at the participant level prior to the administration of the post-treatment online survey. At this time it appears we will only receive traffic data for those who received an email and chose to click through, (though the newspaper has indicated they may remedy this issue prior to implementation). If that is the case, the traffic data will be censored, preventing its use in our later analysis. However, email opens and click-through rates will be available for all treated individuals, and responses on the post-treatment survey will be available for the entire sample of participants. Some individuals may choose not to take the post-treatment survey, but we anticipate that the tendency to take the survey should be roughly evenly distributed across treatment conditions. Intention To Treat Effects of Intervention To test H1(a-c), we will compare the mean email open and click-through rates across treatment conditions. To test H2b, the political knowledge hypothesis, we will compare the rates at which respondents correctly identified the positions of candidates running in their district across all conditions. The issues on which respondents will be quizzed will match the issues listed in the newspaper\u2019s online Voting Guide. U.S. House candidates were asked their positions on the following six issues: immigration reform, the federal minimum wage, drone strikes, government surveillance, health care and climate change. State Assembly candidates were asked about: high-speed rail, irrigation, legalizing marijuana, tax rates, social services and gun restrictions. Respondents will be given a random subset of these issues and asked to identify the positions of the candidates in their district, whose name, party and occupation will be supplied, on these issues. To test H2c, we will ask survey participants for their own positions on the same issues. Because we know the issues of the candidates in the voter guide, we will be able to assess the extent to which the issue positions of each respondent align with those of their preferred candidates (in developing the voter guide the newspaper had candidates answer the same survey questions that voters will not answer). We will then compare the alignment between own positions and candidate positions in the treatment and control groups to assess whether there is a difference. All the H3 and H4 hypotheses will be tested in a similar manner among the relevant subgroups. Complier Average Treatment Effects of Intervention: When comparing scores on all dependent variables across treatment groups, a simple difference in means test will be used to estimate intention to treat effects of this intervention. However, given that there will likely be two-sided noncompliance issues with using the voter guide (e.g., all individuals in the treatment group will not use the guide; some individuals in the control group may use the guide) we have also developed two ex-ante plans to estimate complier average treatment effects and make more efficient use of our data. We will use two approaches to estimate complier average treatment effects. First, because we will have behavioral data on email clickthroughs for all individuals in the treatment groups, we can instrument clicking through to the voter guide with assignment to one of the motivational email groups relative to the placebo treatment group. This instrumented measure of voter guide use can then be used in subsequent analyses on the effect of the voter guide on political information and propensity to engage in spatial voting. This approach will only be effective if large differences in click through rates exist between the placebo group and the other motivational treatment groups. Absent these large differences we will only have a weak instrument for voter guide use. Accordingly, we have also developed a second approach to estimate these effects. Second, we will measure voter guide use among all individuals in our follow up survey with a self-report measure. We can then instrument this self-report measure with assignment to one of the email treatment groups relative to the control group that received no email. This approach will be favorable if large differences in voter guide utilization exist between those receiving or not receiving the email. Our initial expectation is that this second approach will prove more useful in this setting as the instrument for this analysis should be stronger and, in instrumenting a self-reported measure of news consumption, we will reduce the measurement error commonly associated with these exposure self-reports.\"", "q18": "", "q19": "", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "", "q25": "",

How do normal people in the US and around the world decide if torture is right or wrong? For that matter, how do policymakers or scholars? In the past decade, torture has received dramatic policy and scholarly attention, especially in the context of counterterrorism. Research on torture has focused on perceptions of the practice (Carlsmith, 2008), support of the practice (Gronke et al. 2010), perceptions of what constitutes torture (Nordgren, McDonnell & Lowenstein, 2007; Norris, Larsen & Stastny, 2010), why the use of torture persists despite arguments against it (Arrigo & Bennett, 2007), and the efficacy of the practice (e.g. Carlsmith & Sood, 2009; Gray & Wegner, 2010; Janoff-Bulman, 2007; Santucci, 2008). While many of these studies assess stated attitudes toward torture, we do not know how media influences perceptions of this practice. More importantly, we do not know whether people take action that is in line with their stated beliefs on torture. In sum, we are left with an inadequate understanding of how people view torture based on perceived efficacy of the tactic and how stated beliefs are related to actual behaviors in support of those beliefs. The preliminary project involved a smaller number of undergraduate participants. We received a small internal grant from American University to gather information from college students. The secondary phase, for which we are now seeking funding, will use a community sample and an intelligence community sample. Most experimental studies use undergraduates as they are open and accessible. They, however, are not representative of the larger population. In our case, we are particularly interested in voting age adults, the same people that support policymakers that choose to torture or not. Additionally, we want to understand the exact kind of people that might implement these policies. Our sampling plan is to oversample DC area adults that are in or connected to the intelligence community. We will pay participants for their involvement. Because of our connections to this community, we will use snowball sampling to add additional subjects from various agencies. Currently, several of Professor Young\u2019s former students work in agencies, such as the Defense Intelligence Agency, Department of Homeland Security, and other places in the US security apparatus. In the aftermath of September 11th, some politicians introduced the idea that torture is a necessary evil and have attempted to justify the use of torture or enhanced interrogation techniques by stating that these tactics are essential to the war on terror (e.g. Gearty, 2007). Those who support torture or enhanced interrogations tactics often justify this belief on utilitarian grounds (Carlsmith & Sood, 2009). Carlsmith (2008), however, found that while people abstractly support utilitarian laws and policies toward torture, their behaviors often contradict their stated attitudes in favor of retributive motivations. In fact, many scholars and activists argue that torture to gather information in interrogations is strategically counterproductive (e.g. Carlsmith & Sood, 2009; Janoff-Bulman, 2007; Santucci, 2008). Much of this discussion is anecdotal and lacks scientific rigor. Military interrogators say that torture is not effective at gathering accurate and reliable information (Janoff-Bulman, 2007). US courts have long recognized that confessions obtained during duress are neither reliable nor constitutional (Redlich, 2007). Additionally, contrary to what politicians and the media believe, torture is generally not favored by the US public (Crandall et al., 2009). In fact, Gronke et al. (2010) found the majority of Americans opposed the use of torture, as did the majority of the soldiers in Iraq, between 2001 and 2009. Given that we know torture may not be as popular as some argue, we need to know the factors that increase or decrease its popularity. Popular culture is one vehicle that might have this influence. When torture is shown in television and movies, there is generally a ticking-bomb scenario where the use of enhanced interrogation tactics yields the information desired by the torturer. Janoff-Bulman (2007) states that this depiction \u201cseems to fundamentally define how we think about and react to torture interrogations\u201d (p.431). Horne (2009), among others, also argues that such depictions of torture impact public perceptions of the efficacy of torture and may alter support for these tactics. \""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"The aim of the present study is to examine how perceived efficacy of torture in interrogations impacts proclivity to support the use of torture.

The experiment is intended to test different modalities for recruiting citizens into an SMS-based election monitoring system, and to compare the causal effect of citizen monitors to professional election monitors. The project is divided into four phases. \u2022 In Phase 1, we collaborated with Praekelt (PK) to recruit South African citizens into an interactive political survey platform via a variety of media (SMS/USSD recruitment on non-smart phones, social media such as Mxit, and paid print advertising). Incentives to participate were randomized within the group recruited via SMS/USSD. \u2022 In Phase 2, these individuals were invited to report on election-related events and were periodically asked to interact with the system during the month leading up to the election. Ordering of questions and incentives to reply were randomized. \u2022 In Phase 3, we recruited a set of citizen monitors from the Phase 2 participants as well as a set of \u2018professional\u2019 election monitors through a firm called Knowledge Pele (KP), and we conducted an election monitoring experiment on election day that allows us to estimate the impact of professional and citizen monitoring on electoral outcomes. \u2022 In Phase 4, we conduct a set of followup survey experiments after election day to gauge the satisfaction of participating citizens with the electoral process.\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"The hypothesis for the analysis of Phase 1 is that the push of an SMS will increase enrollment, and that the enrollment will increase as the degree of cost borne by the citizen decreases. Phase 2 is an exploratory phase that aims to understand the extent to which the presence of costs to respond to SMSs, the Phase 1 recruitment method, and the ordering of survey questions drives the willingness of citizens to engage with the system by answering questions and reporting on political activity in their neighborhood.

The experiment is intended to test different modalities for recruiting citizens into an SMS-based election monitoring system, and to compare the causal effect of citizen monitors to professional election monitors. The project is divided into four phases. \u2022 In Phase 1, we collaborated with Praekelt (PK) to recruit South African citizens into an interactive political survey platform via a variety of media (SMS/USSD recruitment on non-smart phones, social media such as Mxit, and paid print advertising). Incentives to participate were randomized within the group recruited via SMS/USSD. \u2022 In Phase 2, these individuals were invited to report on election-related events and were periodically asked to interact with the system during the month leading up to the election. Ordering of questions and incentives to reply were randomized. \u2022 In Phase 3, we recruited a set of citizen monitors from the Phase 2 participants as well as a set of \u2018professional\u2019 election monitors through a firm called Knowledge Pele (KP), and we conducted an election monitoring experiment on election day that allows us to estimate the impact of professional and citizen monitoring on electoral outcomes. \u2022 In Phase 4, we conduct a set of followup survey experiments after election day to gauge the satisfaction of participating citizens with the electoral process.\"", "q16": "\"The hypothesis for the analysis of Phase 1 is that the push of an SMS will increase enrollment, and that the enrollment will increase as the degree of cost borne by the citizen decreases.

As of October 29, 2014, more than 13,000 people have been infected and more than 4,900 have died (World Health Organization, 2014). In late September, the CDC confirmed the first travel-associated case of Ebola to be diagnosed in the United States and shortly thereafter two American health workers became infected in the course of treating that patient (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). Since then, individual Americans, the media, and politicians have shifted their attention toward the origins and spread of the disease, and its implications for U.S. public health and immigration. Google trends, for example, illustrates an unprecedented spike in Google searches for Ebola since October. Meanwhile, politicians, particularly those competing in the upcoming U.S. midterm elections have called for travel bans from West African countries at the heart of the Ebola epidemic.
