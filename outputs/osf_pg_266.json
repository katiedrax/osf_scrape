In order to gain the most precise information as possible from the exploratory analyses in this study, we aim to collect as much data as possible within the limits of the organisation and the study period.\n\nGiven the richness of data on the within-participant predictors, and based on similar previous research (ten Broeke et al., manuscript in preparation), we anticipate adequate power to detect small effects for the within-participant predictors. For the between-participant predictors, we conducted an a-priori sensitivity analysis to get an idea of the magnitude of the effect sizes we can detect with adequate power (.80). Specifically, we ran a power simulation in R, using the paramtest package. Using information from our previous research (ten Broeke et al., manuscript in preparation), we ran power simulations for a set of different effect sizes, to determine the magnitude of the HR\u2019s (for a 1 standard deviation increase in any between-participant predictors) we can detect with a power of .80.\n\nThe simulation indicated that, given an anticipated participation rate of 85% (n ~100), we can detect HR\u2019s of approximately 1.44 and higher for positive associations with the hazard to stand up or the hazard to sit down, or 0.72 and lower for negative associations, which can be considered medium effects (Azuero, 2016).

We use the \u2018efron\u2019 method for handling ties. Unless otherwise specified, for each model, we determine statistical significance of the fixed effects. When statistically significant, we will interpret the hazard ratio (HR; antilog of the raw coefficient) of the fixed predictors. In addition, we will visually examine plotted survival functions separated for relevant levels of the predictor variables.\n\nRQ1) How are characteristics of the office/room design related to the hazard to stand up when sitting and the hazard to sit down when standing?\n\nFirst, we fit two shared frailty cox models, one predicting the hazard to stand up when sitting, and one predicting the hazard to sit down when standing, with roomtype (office vs. meeting room vs. canteen) as predictor.\n\nSit-to-stand\ncoxph(Surv(time.to.event.m, event) ~ roomtype + frailty(ptcpID), data = data_sit.to.stand)\nStand-to-sit\ncoxph(Surv(time.to.event.m, event) ~ roomtype + frailty(ptcpID), data = data_stand.to.sit)\n\nNext, we conduct the following analysis steps for each roomtype separately: \n1.\tWe explore the variance on the individual characteristics, using graphs (e.g., boxplots, scatterplots). Based on these explorations, we exclude characteristics with only little variance. We also explore correlations between individual characteristics, using graphs, correlation tables and chi-square tests. Characteristics that correlate highly, we handle by excluding characteristics that are redundant, or merging characteristics into one overarching characteristics. \n2.\tWe perform exploratory cluster analysis for mixed data types, to cluster the rooms based on their design characteristics. We start out with using Gower distance as distance-metrics, and partitioning around mediods (PAM) as clustering algoritm. Based on silhouette width statistics, descriptive statistics and visualisation of clusters, we will determine a number of clusters that yields a meaningful interpretation of different offices/meeting rooms/canteens with different typical design characteristics. \n3.\tWithin each roomtype, we will fit two shared frailty cox models with cluster as predictor, to explore the relation between different room designs and sitting patterns.\n\nSit-to-stand\ncoxph(Surv(time.to.event.m, event) ~ cluster + frailty(ptcpID), data = data_sit.to.stand)\nStand-to-sit\ncoxph(Surv(time.to.event.m, event) ~ cluster + frailty(ptcpID), data = data_stand.to.sit)\n\nRQ2) How are the following characteristics of workplace spatial lay-out related to the hazard to stand up when sitting and to the hazard to sit down when standing?\n\nFor each workplace spatial lay-out predictor, we fit two shared frailty cox models: one predicting the hazard to stand up when sitting, and one predicting the hazard to sit down when standing. We summarise Hazard Ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals for each predictor in a dot-whisker diagram to interpret the results. \n\nSit-to-stand\ncoxph(Surv(time.to.event.m, event) ~ spatial-layout-predictor + frailty(ptcpID), data = data_sit.to.stand)\nStand-to-sit\ncoxph(Surv(time.to.event.m, event) ~ spatial-layout-predictor + frailty(ptcpID), data = data_stand.to.sit)"}, "outliers": {"extra": [], "value": "Inclusion criteria\nWe recruit a sample of desk-based workers from two different worksites (4 different locations) in the Netherlands. Inclusion criteria to participate in the study are:\n-\tWorking at one of the participating worksites\n-\tDesk-based work\n-\tAge 18 or older\n-\tWorking at the office location at for at least 16 working hours in total during the measurement week\n\nData exclusion\n\u2022\tPhysical conditions. In the intake questionnaire, participants are asked whether they currently experiente any medical or physical condition limiting them in sitting and/or standing, or in sitting down and/or standing up. We visually explore and statistically test whether the hazard to stand up when sitting and the hazard to sit down when standing is different in these participants compared to healthy participants. In case of concern, we perform sensitivity analyses by refitting each model excluding participants with a physical condition. When refitting the model changes the interpretation of results, we report on this. \n\u2022\tWorking hours. We exclude observations that fall outside of participants working hours. For this, we use self-reported working start and end times. We first narrow the work time window with 15 minutes on both start and end, to correct for recall bias, settling into the building, and make sure commuting behavior is not included. Next, we exclude observations that fall in non-working hours. For observations crossing work start and end times, we retain only observations with at least 50% of time inside the (narrowed) worktime window, and we exclude all other crossing observations. Data of participants for whom no worktime data is available are excluded completely.\n\u2022\tNon-wear and extreme values. We identify sedentary episodes with a duration longer than 8 hours as non-wear (i.e., time period in which the participant did not wear the activPAL monitor) and therefore these are excluded from the analyses (Edwardson et al., 2017). We identify active episodes with a duration longer than 8 hours as technological failure or extreme values, and therefore these are excluded from the analyses. \n\u2022\tDay-reconstruction data: Time spent in rooms. The day-reconstruction data is used to link the activPAL data to the workplace spatial layout data and the office design characteristics data. For each participant, all sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transitions that in total (i.e., both starttime and endtime) fall between the self-reported starttime and endtime of the period in a certain room, are linked to the characteristics of that room. \nAssumptions\nWe test the assumptions of multilevel time-to-event analysis as follows:\n\u2022\tDistribution of predictors. We visually explore histograms to examine the distribution of predictors. In case of serious concerns we refit the model with a transformation of the predictor variable. We use a transformation on the predictor that sufficiently creates a normal distribution, starting with square root transformation, followed by log transformation, followed by inverse transformation (Tabachnik &amp; Fidell, 2013). In case no transformation is useful, we dichotomize the predictor. When refitting the model changes the interpretation of the results, we report on this. \n\u2022\tResiduals are examined for each model:\no\tDeviance residuals. We examine deviance residuals to detect cases that are not predicted well by the model. We evaluate whether the proportion of residuals &gt; 3 is approximately 0%, the proportion of residuals &gt; 2.5 is approximately 1%, and the proportion of residuals &gt; 2 is approximately 5%. In case of concern, we refit the model excluding cases with a deviance residual &gt; 3. When refitting the model changes the interpretation of the results, we report on this.  \no\tSchoenfeld residuals. We plot schoenfeld residuals against ranked event times, and we test the correlation between schoenfeld residuals and ranked event times, to test the proportionality assumption. A significant correlation indicates violation of the assumption. If the assumption is violated, we follow recommendations by Singer and Willet (2003), and refit and examine a model including an interaction with time as a predictor, to represent the time varying effect.\no\tScore residuals. We plot score residuals against ranked event times to detect influential and high leverage cases. In case high-influential cases are concentrated at specific event times, we refit the model excluding observations with extreme score residuals (as the absolute value of score residuals is not meaningful, we choose the cut-off for extreme values based on visual inspection of the graph). When refitting the model changes the interpretation of the results, we report on this. \n\nMissing data handling\nPairwise deletion"}, "dependent": {"extra": [], "value": "Dependent variables and measurement\n\u2022\tThe hazard to stand up when sitting, i.e., the probability of standing up per minute of sitting (precision in seconds)\n\u2022\tThe hazard to sit down when standing, i.e., the probability of sitting down per minute of standing (precision in seconds)\n\nSitting behaviour is defined as \u201cany waking behaviour characterized by an energy expenditure \u2264 1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs), while in a sitting, reclining or lying posture\u201d. In this study, we distinguish between sitting behaviour and activity, referring to all non-sitting behaviour. Sitting behaviour and activity are assessed using an activPAL3 micro (PAL Technologies Ltd, Glasgow, UK), a device that is worn on the thigh that directly assesses posture using triaxial accelerometry. ActivPALs are known to have a good reliability and validity to measure sitting and activity behaviour (for more information on the activPAL see Edwardson et al., 2017). Placement is standardised to the anterior midline of the upper right thigh, with monitors inserted into a flexible waterproof sleeve and attached using a breathable, hypoallergenic dressing. Participants are asked to wear the monitor 24 hours over an 7-day period and not to remove the monitor. The activPAL measures sitting behaviour and activity with seconds precision, and provides timestamped activity code (sitting/lying down; standing; or stepping) for each transition between postures and each step. For this study, standing and stepping are taken together as active, so the data contains a new row for each sit-active and active-sit transition. \n-\tEvent times in minutes (precision in seconds) are calculated by subtracting the time of the previous event from the time of the current event, e.g., the time of the previous stand up events is subtracted from the current sit-down event.\n\nPredictor variables and measurement\n\nWorkplace spatial layout. \nWorkplace spatial layout variables are calculated in the same way as Fisher and colleagues (2018), using floor plans and the Spatial Metric Calculator tool which was developed by the Active Buildings study, funded by the National Institute for Health Research\u2019s School for Public Health Research (NIHR SPHR).

In order to gain the most precise information as possible from the exploratory analyses in this study, we aim to collect as much data as possible within the limits of the organisation and the study period.\n\nGiven the richness of data on the within-participant predictors, and based on similar previous research (ten Broeke et al., manuscript in preparation), we anticipate adequate power to detect small effects for the within-participant predictors. For the between-participant predictors, we conducted an a-priori sensitivity analysis to get an idea of the magnitude of the effect sizes we can detect with adequate power (.80). Specifically, we ran a power simulation in R, using the paramtest package. Using information from our previous research (ten Broeke et al., manuscript in preparation), we ran power simulations for a set of different effect sizes, to determine the magnitude of the HR\u2019s (for a 1 standard deviation increase in any between-participant predictors) we can detect with a power of .80.\n\nThe simulation indicated that, given an anticipated participation rate of 85% (n ~100), we can detect HR\u2019s of approximately 1.44 and higher for positive associations with the hazard to stand up or the hazard to sit down, or 0.72 and lower for negative associations, which can be considered medium effects (Azuero, 2016). ", "analyses": "We perform all analyses in R / R studio, using the survival package (Therneau, 2015). We split the complete data into two datasets for separate analyses on the two dependent variables, i.e., the hazard to stand up when sitting and the hazard to sit down when standing: \n\u2022\tdata_sit.to.stand = only includes event times (rows) for sit-to-stand events\n\u2022\tdata_stand.to.sit = only includes events times (rows) for stand-to-sit events\nFor all research questions, we fit several shared frailty cox models using the coxph function, with the predictor(s) of interest, and a frailty term for participant, as predictors of the hazard to stand up when sitting or the hazard to sit down when standing. We use the \u2018efron\u2019 method for handling ties. Unless otherwise specified, for each model, we determine statistical significance of the fixed effects. When statistically significant, we will interpret the hazard ratio (HR; antilog of the raw coefficient) of the fixed predictors. In addition, we will visually examine plotted survival functions separated for relevant levels of the predictor variables.\n\nRQ1) How are characteristics of the office/room design related to the hazard to stand up when sitting and the hazard to sit down when standing?\n\nFirst, we fit two shared frailty cox models, one predicting the hazard to stand up when sitting, and one predicting the hazard to sit down when standing, with roomtype (office vs. meeting room vs. canteen) as predictor.\n\nSit-to-stand\ncoxph(Surv(time.to.event.m, event) ~ roomtype + frailty(ptcpID), data = data_sit.to.stand)\nStand-to-sit\ncoxph(Surv(time.to.event.m, event) ~ roomtype + frailty(ptcpID), data = data_stand.to.sit)\n\nNext, we conduct the following analysis steps for each roomtype separately: \n1.\tWe explore the variance on the individual characteristics, using graphs (e.g., boxplots, scatterplots). Based on these explorations, we exclude characteristics with only little variance. We also explore correlations between individual characteristics, using graphs, correlation tables and chi-square tests. Characteristics that correlate highly, we handle by excluding characteristics that are redundant, or merging characteristics into one overarching characteristics. \n2.\tWe perform exploratory cluster analysis for mixed data types, to cluster the rooms based on their design characteristics. We start out with using Gower distance as distance-metrics, and partitioning around mediods (PAM) as clustering algoritm. Based on silhouette width statistics, descriptive statistics and visualisation of clusters, we will determine a number of clusters that yields a meaningful interpretation of different offices/meeting rooms/canteens with different typical design characteristics. \n3.\tWithin each roomtype, we will fit two shared frailty cox models with cluster as predictor, to explore the relation between different room designs and sitting patterns.\n\nSit-to-stand\ncoxph(Surv(time.to.event.m, event) ~ cluster + frailty(ptcpID), data = data_sit.to.stand)\nStand-to-sit\ncoxph(Surv(time.to.event.m, event) ~ cluster + frailty(ptcpID), data = data_stand.to.sit)\n\nRQ2) How are the following characteristics of workplace spatial lay-out related to the hazard to stand up when sitting and to the hazard to sit down when standing?\n\nFor each workplace spatial lay-out predictor, we fit two shared frailty cox models: one predicting the hazard to stand up when sitting, and one predicting the hazard to sit down when standing. We summarise Hazard Ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals for each predictor in a dot-whisker diagram to interpret the results. \n\nSit-to-stand\ncoxph(Surv(time.to.event.m, event) ~ spatial-layout-predictor + frailty(ptcpID), data = data_sit.to.stand)\nStand-to-sit\ncoxph(Surv(time.to.event.m, event) ~ spatial-layout-predictor + frailty(ptcpID), data = data_stand.to.sit)", "outliers": "Inclusion criteria\nWe recruit a sample of desk-based workers from two different worksites (4 different locations) in the Netherlands. Inclusion criteria to participate in the study are:\n-\tWorking at one of the participating worksites\n-\tDesk-based work\n-\tAge 18 or older\n-\tWorking at the office location at for at least 16 working hours in total during the measurement week\n\nData exclusion\n\u2022\tPhysical conditions. In the intake questionnaire, participants are asked whether they currently experiente any medical or physical condition limiting them in sitting and/or standing, or in sitting down and/or standing up. We visually explore and statistically test whether the hazard to stand up when sitting and the hazard to sit down when standing is different in these participants compared to healthy participants. In case of concern, we perform sensitivity analyses by refitting each model excluding participants with a physical condition. When refitting the model changes the interpretation of results, we report on this. \n\u2022\tWorking hours. We exclude observations that fall outside of participants working hours. For this, we use self-reported working start and end times. We first narrow the work time window with 15 minutes on both start and end, to correct for recall bias, settling into the building, and make sure commuting behavior is not included. Next, we exclude observations that fall in non-working hours. For observations crossing work start and end times, we retain only observations with at least 50% of time inside the (narrowed) worktime window, and we exclude all other crossing observations. Data of participants for whom no worktime data is available are excluded completely.\n\u2022\tNon-wear and extreme values. We identify sedentary episodes with a duration longer than 8 hours as non-wear (i.e., time period in which the participant did not wear the activPAL monitor) and therefore these are excluded from the analyses (Edwardson et al., 2017). We identify active episodes with a duration longer than 8 hours as technological failure or extreme values, and therefore these are excluded from the analyses. \n\u2022\tDay-reconstruction data: Time spent in rooms. The day-reconstruction data is used to link the activPAL data to the workplace spatial layout data and the office design characteristics data. For each participant, all sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transitions that in total (i.e., both starttime and endtime) fall between the self-reported starttime and endtime of the period in a certain room, are linked to the characteristics of that room. \nAssumptions\nWe test the assumptions of multilevel time-to-event analysis as follows:\n\u2022\tDistribution of predictors. We visually explore histograms to examine the distribution of predictors. In case of serious concerns we refit the model with a transformation of the predictor variable. We use a transformation on the predictor that sufficiently creates a normal distribution, starting with square root transformation, followed by log transformation, followed by inverse transformation (Tabachnik &amp; Fidell, 2013). In case no transformation is useful, we dichotomize the predictor. When refitting the model changes the interpretation of the results, we report on this. \n\u2022\tResiduals are examined for each model:\no\tDeviance residuals. We examine deviance residuals to detect cases that are not predicted well by the model. We evaluate whether the proportion of residuals &gt; 3 is approximately 0%, the proportion of residuals &gt; 2.5 is approximately 1%, and the proportion of residuals &gt; 2 is approximately 5%. In case of concern, we refit the model excluding cases with a deviance residual &gt; 3. When refitting the model changes the interpretation of the results, we report on this.  \no\tSchoenfeld residuals. We plot schoenfeld residuals against ranked event times, and we test the correlation between schoenfeld residuals and ranked event times, to test the proportionality assumption. A significant correlation indicates violation of the assumption. If the assumption is violated, we follow recommendations by Singer and Willet (2003), and refit and examine a model including an interaction with time as a predictor, to represent the time varying effect.\no\tScore residuals. We plot score residuals against ranked event times to detect influential and high leverage cases. In case high-influential cases are concentrated at specific event times, we refit the model excluding observations with extreme score residuals (as the absolute value of score residuals is not meaningful, we choose the cut-off for extreme values based on visual inspection of the graph). When refitting the model changes the interpretation of the results, we report on this. \n\nMissing data handling\nPairwise deletion", "dependent": "Dependent variables and measurement\n\u2022\tThe hazard to stand up when sitting, i.e., the probability of standing up per minute of sitting (precision in seconds)\n\u2022\tThe hazard to sit down when standing, i.e., the probability of sitting down per minute of standing (precision in seconds)\n\nSitting behaviour is defined as \u201cany waking behaviour characterized by an energy expenditure \u2264 1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs), while in a sitting, reclining or lying posture\u201d. In this study, we distinguish between sitting behaviour and activity, referring to all non-sitting behaviour. Sitting behaviour and activity are assessed using an activPAL3 micro (PAL Technologies Ltd, Glasgow, UK), a device that is worn on the thigh that directly assesses posture using triaxial accelerometry. ActivPALs are known to have a good reliability and validity to measure sitting and activity behaviour (for more information on the activPAL see Edwardson et al., 2017). Placement is standardised to the anterior midline of the upper right thigh, with monitors inserted into a flexible waterproof sleeve and attached using a breathable, hypoallergenic dressing. Participants are asked to wear the monitor 24 hours over an 7-day period and not to remove the monitor. The activPAL measures sitting behaviour and activity with seconds precision, and provides timestamped activity code (sitting/lying down; standing; or stepping) for each transition between postures and each step.

Kazuko Yatsushiro, Mana Asano, Andreea Nicolae"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "When adult speakers hear a sentence like \"Kai had peas or broccoli last night\", they understand that Kai didn't have both peas and broccoli last night. Logically, however, the sentence should be true even when Kai had both peas and broccoli. The missing interpretation is due to what is called a Scalar Implicature. Descriptively speaking, given some expressions that form a scale in the sense of Horn (1972) (such as \"and\" and \"or\"), a speaker is expected to use an expression that makes the sentence true in fewer situations, in this case, \"and\"; the speaker is expected to be as informative as possible. When a speaker uses disjunction, rather than conjunction, the hearer interprets that the speaker did not know whether the sentence with conjunction was true or not (Kai had peas and broccoli), hence, interprets it as \"Kai had peas or broccoli, but not both.\"\n\nIt has been observed, however, that children interpret sentences with disjunction differently from adults. Singh et al. (2016) reports that the English speaking children that they tested accepted the use of disjunction when both disjuncts were true while rejecting its use when only one of the disjuncts was true. Tieu et al. (2017) report similar results from French and Japanese 4- to 5-year-old children. These authors argue that this behavior can be explained by assuming that children do not know that conjunction and disjunction form a scale, and as a result, their interpretation of disjunction resembles that of conjunction (conjunctive interpretation rather than exclusive interpretation).\n\nMore recently, some studies show that changes in experimental material and or condition lead to slightly different results. Skordos et al. (2018) observe that, while Tieu et al.'s result was replicated when they used an identical design, when the condition included an additional object in the scene (three, rather than two potential objects), children started accepting the use of disjunction also in the condition when only one of the disjuncts was true. If this is the case, whether the explanation that Singh et al. propose can be maintained or not remains a question; namely, that children do not have conjunction as an alternative to disjunction, and as a result, an obligatory strengthening mechanism leads them to comprehend disjunction as a conjunction.\n\nInspired by a study by Shimada (2014), which observes that disjunction in subject and object positions is interpreted differently by both children and adults, Otani et al. (in preparation) tested disjunction in the subject position, adapting the design, used in Tieu et al. (2017). The data from the experiment show that, unlike when the disjunction is in the object position as in Tieu et al. (2017), fewer Japanese speaking children interpreted the disjunction conjunctively. That is, the interpretation of disjunction seems to differ depending on whether it is in the subject position or in the object position. \n\nThere are at least two differences between the subject and object positions: Case (Nominative vs. Accusative), and structural position. In order to test whether the sentence initial position is somehow privileged, we will test sentences where the disjunction occurs in the object, but crucially the object is displaced to the pre-subject position via scrambling. \n\nOLD: Tieu et. al. (2017) reported that, in positive sentences, children interpret disjunction in the object position conjunctively. However, Otani et. al. (in progress) investigated children's comprehension of disjunction in subject position in positive sentences and found that a majority of  Japanese children interpreted disjunction exclusively. Here, a question arises  as to how the interpretive difference on disjunction between subject and object positions is derived.  We have two possibilities to explain the interpretive difference, the word order and the case marker. Therefore, in the current study, we will conduct an experiment on the interpretation of disjunction in scrambled objects, which get an accusative case placed in sentence initial position."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "structural position: sentence initial versus not sentence initial position\n\ncase marker: nominative versus accusative \n\nPrevious result: In sentence initial+nominative experiment, Otani et al. found disjunction to be interpreted less conjunctively than in non-sentence initial+accusative experiment (Tieu et al.)\n\nQuestion: Is the difference in results due to the structural position change, or the case marker change?\n\nThis experiment: looks at sentence initial+accusative. \n\nIf the results indicate no change from Otani et al.'s results, then the cause for decrease in conjunctive interpretation is structural position. \n\nIf the results indicate a change from Otani et al.'s results:\n- either the results are the same as Tieu et al., then the case marking (i.e. Nom) is the cause for the decrease in conjunctive interpretations. \n- or the results are (approximately) like in Otani et al. in which case the cause is structural position"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

In this task, the participant hears a story, narrated by an experimenter, to set-up the scene, while looking at a tablet computer.

The participant's task is to say whether the puppet predicted what happens next correctly, after watching what happens next on the tablet.\n\nMaterial: 4 items where both disjuncts are true (2DT condition), 4 items where only one of the disjuncts is true (1DT condition), and 2 items where neither disjuncts are true (0DT condition) are presented to the participant.

When a speaker uses disjunction, rather than conjunction, the hearer interprets that the speaker did not know whether the sentence with conjunction was true or not (Kai had peas and broccoli), hence, interprets it as \"Kai had peas or broccoli, but not both.\"\n\nIt has been observed, however, that children interpret sentences with disjunction differently from adults. Singh et al. (2016) reports that the English speaking children that they tested accepted the use of disjunction when both disjuncts were true while rejecting its use when only one of the disjuncts was true. Tieu et al. (2017) report similar results from French and Japanese 4- to 5-year-old children. These authors argue that this behavior can be explained by assuming that children do not know that conjunction and disjunction form a scale, and as a result, their interpretation of disjunction resembles that of conjunction (conjunctive interpretation rather than exclusive interpretation).\n\nMore recently, some studies show that changes in experimental material and or condition lead to slightly different results. Skordos et al. (2018) observe that, while Tieu et al.'s result was replicated when they used an identical design, when the condition included an additional object in the scene (three, rather than two potential objects), children started accepting the use of disjunction also in the condition when only one of the disjuncts was true. If this is the case, whether the explanation that Singh et al. propose can be maintained or not remains a question; namely, that children do not have conjunction as an alternative to disjunction, and as a result, an obligatory strengthening mechanism leads them to comprehend disjunction as a conjunction.\n\nInspired by a study by Shimada (2014), which observes that disjunction in subject and object positions is interpreted differently by both children and adults, Otani et al. (in preparation) tested disjunction in the subject position, adapting the design, used in Tieu et al. (2017). The data from the experiment show that, unlike when the disjunction is in the object position as in Tieu et al. (2017), fewer Japanese speaking children interpreted the disjunction conjunctively. That is, the interpretation of disjunction seems to differ depending on whether it is in the subject position or in the object position. \n\nThere are at least two differences between the subject and object positions: Case (Nominative vs. Accusative), and structural position. In order to test whether the sentence initial position is somehow privileged, we will test sentences where the disjunction occurs in the object, but crucially the object is displaced to the pre-subject position via scrambling. \n\nOLD: Tieu et. al. (2017) reported that, in positive sentences, children interpret disjunction in the object position conjunctively. However, Otani et. al. (in progress) investigated children's comprehension of disjunction in subject position in positive sentences and found that a majority of  Japanese children interpreted disjunction exclusively. Here, a question arises  as to how the interpretive difference on disjunction between subject and object positions is derived.  We have two possibilities to explain the interpretive difference, the word order and the case marker. Therefore, in the current study, we will conduct an experiment on the interpretation of disjunction in scrambled objects, which get an accusative case placed in sentence initial position.", "q4": "structural position: sentence initial versus not sentence initial position\n\ncase marker: nominative versus accusative \n\nPrevious result: In sentence initial+nominative experiment, Otani et al. found disjunction to be interpreted less conjunctively than in non-sentence initial+accusative experiment (Tieu et al.)\n\nQuestion: Is the difference in results due to the structural position change, or the case marker change?\n\nThis experiment: looks at sentence initial+accusative. \n\nIf the results indicate no change from Otani et al.'s results, then the cause for decrease in conjunctive interpretation is structural position. \n\nIf the results indicate a change from Otani et al.'s results:\n- either the results are the same as Tieu et al., then the case marking (i.e. Nom) is the cause for the decrease in conjunctive interpretations. \n- or the results are (approximately) like in Otani et al. in which case the cause is structural position", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

In this task, the participant hears a story, narrated by an experimenter, to set-up the scene, while looking at a tablet computer. After the story is told, a puppet shows up in the screen of the tablet computer, and makes a prediction about what happens next. The participant's task is to say whether the puppet predicted what happens next correctly, after watching what happens next on the tablet.\n\nMaterial: 4 items where both disjuncts are true (2DT condition), 4 items where only one of the disjuncts is true (1DT condition), and 2 items where neither disjuncts are true (0DT condition) are presented to the participant.

For the list 1, the items were ordered in alternating orders for 2DT and 1DT. 0DT items were inserted after two stories each of 2DT and 1DT. Three Fillers were inserted to divide the rest of the items into three groups. For the list 2, the order of the non-filler items were simply reversed.

Many methods are used to treat, including pudilan anti-inflammatory oral liquid and doxycycline and laser therapy, but these take a long time to produce positive effects and compliance is low. Previous reviews into acupuncture for RAS has been growing, but a systematic review is not available. Therefore, this protocol was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture on RAS, by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis.\nMethods and analysis The following databases will be searched from their inception to 1 February 2020: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in English or Chinese associated with acupuncture for patients with RAS will be included. Eligible study conference abstracts and reference lists of manuscripts will also be searched. The data collection and analysis will be conducted independently by two reviewers. The risk of bias of each study will be conducted by the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The heterogeneity will be measured by the I2 statistic. According to heterogeneity testing, data will be synthesized using a fixed-effects model or a random-effects model. A meta-analysis will be performed using Rev Man V.5.3.5 statistical software for each outcome. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis are planned according to clinical evidence.
