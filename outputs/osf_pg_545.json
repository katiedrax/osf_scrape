However, attrition across European universities is high (Vossensteyn et al., 2015). According to Aamodt and Hovdhaugen (2011), attrition rates among investigated cohorts of Norwegian students are stable and vary around 20%. The issue represents a social (e.g., ineffective use of governmental funding, financial loss for state universities) as well as individual loss (e.g., time spent unemployed). Attrition is a multifaceted phenomenon and can vary depending on the reasons and observed consequences of the behavior, e.g., drop-out, transfer out, stop-out, opt-out (Hoyt &amp; Winn, 2004). Few studies explicitly investigate differences in factors predicting these types of attrition. To our knowledge, only Hovdhaugen (2009) addressed this issue in the Norwegian context by comparing causes of drop-out and transfer out behaviors among university students. Consequently, a cross-cultural investigation of the phenomenon is required. Further, based on the Student Attrition Model by Bean (1982), and The Student Retention Integrated Model by Cabrera, Nora, and Castaneda (1993), students\u2019 intentions are significant determinants of future behavior. The assumption is in accordance with the Theory of Reasoned Action (Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1991). However, not every intention is realized (Bagozzi &amp; Yi, 1989). The solution has been proposed by Gollwitzer (1990) in the Mindset Theory of Action Phases, implementation intentions. The available evidence facilitates validity of the notion (Bagozzi &amp; Yi, 1989; Rise, Thompson, &amp; Verplanken, 2003). In the current study, we aim to investigate if two Tinto\u2019s (1975) most prominent constructs of academic and social integration would show the same pattern of relationship with drop-out and transfer out intentions/implementation intentions. The relationships between these two constructs and attrition intentions has been rarely investigated.

The items were chosen based on their internal reliability (Cronbach\u2019s Alpha .72; Diseth, 2001), possible data collection issues, and diversity of our sample (e.g., humanity, medicine, STEM students). Response options ranged from 1 = Totally agree to 5 = Totally disagree. A subset of two items will be used in the second part of the questionnaire based on highest loadings (results of the first questionnaire).\n\nItems (English/ the Norwegian translation is used in the survey): \no\tI organise my study time carefully to make the best use of it / Jeg organiserer studietiden min n\u00f8ye for \u00e5 utnytte den best mulig.\no\tI\u2019m pretty good at getting down to work whenever I need to / Jeg er ganske flink \u00e5 komme i gang med skolearbeidet n\u00e5r jeg trenger.\no\tI work steadily through the term or semester, rather than leave it all until the last minute / Jeg jobber heller jevnt gjennom hele semesteret fremfor \u00e5 la alt vente til siste liten\no\tI generally make good use of my time during the day / Stort sett kan jeg bruke tiden godt gjennom arbeidsdagen.\n\nAcademic self-efficacy.  The measurement index is borrowed from a Danish study by Herrmann, Bager-Elsborg, and McCune (2017). Scale is based on MSLQ (Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire) by Pintrich et al. (1991). Self-efficacy, as it is used here, refers to the students\u2019 self-appraisal of their ability to master a task and includes judgment about their ability to accomplish a task as well as their confidence in their skills to perform that task (Pintrich et al. 1991). Three items were chosen based on the reported highest loadings (Hermann et al., 2017). Original Cronbach\u2019s alpha (five items) was .83. A subset of two items will be used in the second part of the questionnaire based on highest loadings (results of the first questionnaire).\n\nItems (English/ the Norwegian translation is used in the survey):: \n\no\tI am confident that I can acquire the skills necessary to excel within my field of study / Jeg er trygg p\u00e5 at jeg kan tilegne meg ferdighetene som er n\u00f8dvendige for \u00e5 utmerke meg innen mitt studiefelt.\no\tI believe I will do well in my studies, as long as I make an effort / Jeg har tro p\u00e5 at jeg skal gj\u00f8re det bra i studiet, s\u00e5 lenge jeg gj\u00f8r en innsats.\no\tI expect to do well in my studies / Jeg forventer at jeg skal gj\u00f8re det godt i studiet.\n\nPerformance. Respondents\u2019 achievement is measured by self-reported grade that they usually receive: \u201cWhat is your typical grade at university?\u201d. Response options ranged from A to F, which is a standardized grading system applied across Norwegian universities. Respondents are also asked to report their school grade average (1 = Lowest; 6 = Highest). \n\nAcademic and social integration. The academic and intellectual development subscale from the Institutional Integration Scale is chosen as a measure of academic integration (Pascarella &amp; Terenzini, 1980). Response alternatives were: 1 = Not true of me; 5 = Totally true of me. Original Cronbach\u2019s Alpha (seven items) was .74. Three items from Peer-group interaction subscale are borrowed from the same measurement index (Pascarella &amp; Terenzini, 1980). Original Cronbach\u2019s Alpha (Seven Items) .84.\n\n\nItems (Academic Integration; English/ the Norwegian translation is used in the survey): \n\no\tI am satisfied with the extent of my intellectual development since enrolling in this university / Jeg er forn\u00f8yd med hvor mye jeg har utviklet meg intellektuelt siden jeg startet p\u00e5 universitetet.\no\tMy academic experience has had a positive influence on my intellectual growth and interest in ideas / Mine akademiske erfaringer fra universitetet har hatt positiv innflytelse p\u00e5 min intellektuelle utvikling og faglige interesser.\no\tMy interest in ideas and intellectual matters has increased since coming to this university / Min interesse for ideer og intellektuelle sp\u00f8rsm\u00e5l har \u00f8kt siden jeg begynte p\u00e5 universitetet.\n\nItems (Social Integration; English/ the Norwegian translation is used in the survey):\no\tSince coming to this university I have developed close personal relationships with other students / Jeg har utviklet n\u00e6re personlige relasjoner med andre medstudenter etter at jeg kom til dette universitetet.\no\tThe student friendships I have developed at this university have been personally satisfying / De vennskapene jeg har utviklet med andre medstudenter p\u00e5 dette universitetet har v\u00e6rt personlig tilfredsstillende.\no\tIt has been difficult for me to meet and make friends with other students / Det har v\u00e6rt vanskelig for meg \u00e5 m\u00f8te og bli venner med andre studenters\n\nDrop-out intentions. Two items are taken from the study by Hardre and Reeve (2003): \u201cI sometimes consider dropping out of university before graduation\u201d, \u201cI intend to drop out of school before graduation\u201d. Original Cronbach\u2019s Alpha (three items) .79. The third item was excluded due to complexity and unclear logic for inclusion in the original study (\u201cI sometimes feel unsure about continuing my studies year after year\u201d). Based on the Mindset theory of Action Phases (Gollwitzer, 1990), two additional items were designed for this study which intend to measure predesisional and preactional intentions.\n\nItems (English/ the Norwegian translation is used in the survey):\n\no\tI sometimes consider dropping out of university before graduation / Av og til vurderer jeg \u00e5 slutte studiene f\u00f8r jeg er ferdig med planlagt studiel\u00f8p (eksamen, grad).\no\tI intend to drop out of university before graduation / Jeg kommer til \u00e5 slutte \u00e5 studere f\u00f8r jeg er ferdig med planlagt studiel\u00f8p (eksamen, grad).\no\tI sometimes think that other job opportunities suit me better than those I can get with my current education / Av og til tenker jeg at andre jobbmuligheter enn de studiene gir, passer bedre for meg.\no\tI know what I am going to do if I withdraw from my studies / Jeg vet hva blir mitt neste steg hvis jeg avbryter studiene.\n\nTransfer-out intentions. Two items are taken from the same study by Hardre and Reeve (2003) but rephrased with a focus on transfer-out intentions (e.g., consider changing university, intend to change university). Transfer-out intentions were divided into intentions to change university and study field and were asked separately. Similar to the drop-out intentions\u2019 measure, two items were devised based on the Mindset Theory of Action Phases (Gollwitzer, 1990).\n\nItems (University; English/ the Norwegian translation is used in the survey):\n\no\tI sometimes consider changing university before graduation / Av og til vurderer jeg \u00e5 slutte studiene f\u00f8r jeg er ferdig med planlagt studiel\u00f8p (eksamen, grad).\no\tI intend to change university before graduation / Jeg kommer til \u00e5 slutte \u00e5 studere f\u00f8r jeg er ferdig med planlagt studiel\u00f8p (eksamen, grad).\no\tI sometimes think about how my life would be if I change my studyplace/ Av og til tenker jeg at andre jobbmuligheter enn de studiene gir, passer bedre for meg.\no\tI know what I am going to do if I withdraw from my studies / Jeg vet hva blir mitt neste steg hvis jeg avbryter studiene.\n\nItems (Study Field; English/ the Norwegian translation is used in the survey):\n\no\tI sometimes consider changing stuy field before graduation / Av og til vurderer jeg \u00e5 endre studieretning f\u00f8r jeg er ferdig med planlagt studiel\u00f8p (eksamen, grad).\no\tI intend to change study field before graduation / Jeg kommer til \u00e5 endre studieretning f\u00f8r jeg er ferdig med planlagt studiel\u00f8p (eksamen, grad).\no\tI sometimes think about advantages and disadvantages of changing study field/ Av og til vurderer jeg fordeler og ulemper ved \u00e5 endre studieretning.\no\tI am waiting for possibility to change my study field / Jeg venter p\u00e5 en mulighet for \u00e5 endre studieretning.\n\nTime-to-degree. The time students would spend on degree completion was a self-reported measure borrowed from Gillingham, Seneca, and Taussig (1991). Two questions are asked: \u201cHow long time have you spent studying at this program\u201d, \u201cHow long do you expect it would take to finish your education\u201d. Time-to-degree is a sum score of the time already spent in the program and self-reported expected remaining time. \n\nProcrastination. A subset of two items from the Academic Procrastination Scale (APS; Mccloskey &amp; Scielzo, 2015; Yockey, 2016) will be used in the first part of the survey as an index of academic procrastination (e.g., When given an assignment, I usually put it away and forget about it until it is almost due\u201d; \u201cCramming\u201d and last minute studying is the best way that I study for a big test). Only two items were chosen due to the length of the questionnaire and served as an approximation of procrastination tendencies. Two items were chosen based on their high factor loadings. The items were translated to Norwegian with backward translations and discussion/correction (Kent Norby, unpublished). Cronbach alpha for 25 items is .94 (Mccloskey &amp; Scielzo, 2015). In the second part of the questionnaire, the seven items from APS will be acquired. \n\nItems (English/ the Norwegian translation is used in the survey):\n\no\tMy attention span for schoolwork is very short / Mitt oppmerksomhetsspenn for skolearbeid er veldig kort.\no\tI know I should work on school work, but I just don\u2019t do it / Jeg vet jeg burde jobbe med skolearbeid, men jeg gj\u00f8r det ikke.\no\tI get distracted by other, more fun, things when I am supposed to work on schoolwork / Jeg blir distrahert av andre, mer morsomme ting, n\u00e5r jeg skulle jobbe med skolearbeid.\no\t\u201cCramming\u201d and last minute studying is the best way that I study for a big test / \u00abSkippertak\u00bb og jobb i siste liten er m\u00e5ten jeg best forbereder meg til store pr\u00f8ver\no\tWhen given an assignment, I usually put it away and forget about it until it is almost due / N\u00e5r jeg f\u00e5r utdelt en oppgave, legger jeg den vanligvis til side helt til tidsfristen nesten er g\u00e5tt ut\no\tFriends usually distract me from schoolwork / Venner distraherer meg vanligvis fra skolearbeid.\no\tI don\u2019t spend much time studying school material until the end of the semester / Jeg bruker ikke mye tid p\u00e5 \u00e5 studere pensum f\u00f8r slutten av semesteret.\n\n\nOur main outcome variables are students\u2019 drop-out intentions, university transfer out intentions, study field transfer out intentions. Covariates included in the model: age, gender, parents\u2019 education level, school performance, field of study, and transfer-out history (if a student have changed his field of study).  \n\nLatent variables (factors) include: time-management skills, academic self-efficacy, academic integration, social integration, drop-out intentions, drop-out implementation intentions, university transfer out intentions, university transfer out implementation intentions, study field transfer out intentions, study field transfer out implementation intentions, and procrastination.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Preregistration (02.01.20).docx"}, "nodeId": "gszjq", "sha256": "725b9a286cf9b12d2bdbc81e6cfbfec94749960fd67f741f9382d0793f541d10", "viewUrl": "/project/98knj/files/osfstorage/5e0e0977db73290016bfef70/", "selectedFileName": "Preregistration (02.01.20).docx"}], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Time-to-degree: Sum of two items (see Variables section).

The difference between the Model 1 and Model 2 is the relationship between time-management skills, academic self-efficacy and attrition intentions. According to Bean and Eaton (2001), the variables predict students\u2019 integration leading to intentions to persist or withdraw. Further, Elliot (2010) indicated that relationship between academic self-efficacy and social integration was insignificant. The opposite was found concerning the relationship between academic self-efficacy and academic integration. Thus, we expect that academic self-efficacy would not mediate the relationship between time-management skills and social integration. In sum, we aim to test two alternative models. The one depicted in the Figure one (Model 1) is expected to show a better fit compared to the one where academic self-efficacy mediates/ moderates the relationship between time-management skills and social integration.\n\nContrary, results of the meta-analysis by Robbins et al. (2004) indicate the direct \u201cmoderate\u201d relationship between time-management skills, academic self-efficacy and retention. Since no previous studies have been found to investigate the relationship between these variables and types of attrition intentions, we aim to investigate if the relationship between time-management skills and attrition intentions would be mediated by self-efficacy (Model 2). Consequently, a set of alternative models would be tested. The main difference is the outcome variable (drop-out, transfer out intentions). The fit of the models would be compared to the fit of the models specifying indirect relationship between time-management skills, academic self-efficacy and attrition intentions (Model 1).\n\nAlternatively, if the mediation/moderation effect of academic self-efficacy is not indicated, we would test the direct relationship between time-management skills, academic self-efficacy, and the described variables.  \n\nThe relationship between procrastination and attrition intentions is assumed to be mediated/ moderated by time-to-degree (Bair &amp; Haworth, 2005: Muszynski &amp; Akamatsu, 1991; Wadkins, 1999). Contrary, procrastination is commonly associated with poor academic performance, time-management skills and self-efficacy (Klingsieck et al., 2013; Steel, 2007). Thus, academic integration and students\u2019 performance will be tested for potential mediation/ moderation effects. \n\nModel fit data will be examined using chi-square test, CFI, TLI, RMSEA, and SRMR. Standard fit cut-off values will be applied: CFI, TLI values greater than .95 (Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999), SRMR less than .08 (Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999), and RMSEA less than .05 (MacCallum, Browne, &amp; Sugawara, 1996). Values equal to or lesser/higher than cut-off values indicate good and close fit. Analyses will be performed with STATA or Mplus software. The method of model estimation (e.g., maximum likelihood, weighted least squares) will be determined based on the properties of the data collected (e.g., multivariate normality).

However, attrition across European universities is high (Vossensteyn et al., 2015). According to Aamodt and Hovdhaugen (2011), attrition rates among investigated cohorts of Norwegian students are stable and vary around 20%. The issue represents a social (e.g., ineffective use of governmental funding, financial loss for state universities) as well as individual loss (e.g., time spent unemployed). Attrition is a multifaceted phenomenon and can vary depending on the reasons and observed consequences of the behavior, e.g., drop-out, transfer out, stop-out, opt-out (Hoyt &amp; Winn, 2004). Few studies explicitly investigate differences in factors predicting these types of attrition. To our knowledge, only Hovdhaugen (2009) addressed this issue in the Norwegian context by comparing causes of drop-out and transfer out behaviors among university students. Consequently, a cross-cultural investigation of the phenomenon is required. Further, based on the Student Attrition Model by Bean (1982), and The Student Retention Integrated Model by Cabrera, Nora, and Castaneda (1993), students\u2019 intentions are significant determinants of future behavior. The assumption is in accordance with the Theory of Reasoned Action (Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1991). However, not every intention is realized (Bagozzi &amp; Yi, 1989). The solution has been proposed by Gollwitzer (1990) in the Mindset Theory of Action Phases, implementation intentions. The available evidence facilitates validity of the notion (Bagozzi &amp; Yi, 1989; Rise, Thompson, &amp; Verplanken, 2003). In the current study, we aim to investigate if two Tinto\u2019s (1975) most prominent constructs of academic and social integration would show the same pattern of relationship with drop-out and transfer out intentions/implementation intentions. The relationships between these two constructs and attrition intentions has been rarely investigated.

The time management subscale from ASSIST inventory will be used to measure study-related skills (Diseth, 2007). The items were chosen based on their internal reliability (Cronbach\u2019s Alpha .72; Diseth, 2001), possible data collection issues, and diversity of our sample (e.g., humanity, medicine, STEM students). Response options ranged from 1 = Totally agree to 5 = Totally disagree.

The measurement index is borrowed from a Danish study by Herrmann, Bager-Elsborg, and McCune (2017). Scale is based on MSLQ (Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire) by Pintrich et al. (1991). Self-efficacy, as it is used here, refers to the students\u2019 self-appraisal of their ability to master a task and includes judgment about their ability to accomplish a task as well as their confidence in their skills to perform that task (Pintrich et al. 1991). Three items were chosen based on the reported highest loadings (Hermann et al., 2017). Original Cronbach\u2019s alpha (five items) was .83. A subset of two items will be used in the second part of the questionnaire based on highest loadings (results of the first questionnaire).\n\nItems (English/ the Norwegian translation is used in the survey):: \n\no\tI am confident that I can acquire the skills necessary to excel within my field of study / Jeg er trygg p\u00e5 at jeg kan tilegne meg ferdighetene som er n\u00f8dvendige for \u00e5 utmerke meg innen mitt studiefelt.\no\tI believe I will do well in my studies, as long as I make an effort / Jeg har tro p\u00e5 at jeg skal gj\u00f8re det bra i studiet, s\u00e5 lenge jeg gj\u00f8r en innsats.\no\tI expect to do well in my studies / Jeg forventer at jeg skal gj\u00f8re det godt i studiet.\n\nPerformance. Respondents\u2019 achievement is measured by self-reported grade that they usually receive: \u201cWhat is your typical grade at university?\u201d. Response options ranged from A to F, which is a standardized grading system applied across Norwegian universities. Respondents are also asked to report their school grade average (1 = Lowest; 6 = Highest). \n\nAcademic and social integration. The academic and intellectual development subscale from the Institutional Integration Scale is chosen as a measure of academic integration (Pascarella &amp; Terenzini, 1980). Response alternatives were: 1 = Not true of me; 5 = Totally true of me. Original Cronbach\u2019s Alpha (seven items) was .74. Three items from Peer-group interaction subscale are borrowed from the same measurement index (Pascarella &amp; Terenzini, 1980). Original Cronbach\u2019s Alpha (Seven Items) .84.\n\n\nItems (Academic Integration; English/ the Norwegian translation is used in the survey): \n\no\tI am satisfied with the extent of my intellectual development since enrolling in this university / Jeg er forn\u00f8yd med hvor mye jeg har utviklet meg intellektuelt siden jeg startet p\u00e5 universitetet.\no\tMy academic experience has had a positive influence on my intellectual growth and interest in ideas / Mine akademiske erfaringer fra universitetet har hatt positiv innflytelse p\u00e5 min intellektuelle utvikling og faglige interesser.\no\tMy interest in ideas and intellectual matters has increased since coming to this university / Min interesse for ideer og intellektuelle sp\u00f8rsm\u00e5l har \u00f8kt siden jeg begynte p\u00e5 universitetet.\n\nItems (Social Integration; English/ the Norwegian translation is used in the survey):\no\tSince coming to this university I have developed close personal relationships with other students / Jeg har utviklet n\u00e6re personlige relasjoner med andre medstudenter etter at jeg kom til dette universitetet.\no\tThe student friendships I have developed at this university have been personally satisfying / De vennskapene jeg har utviklet med andre medstudenter p\u00e5 dette universitetet har v\u00e6rt personlig tilfredsstillende.\no\tIt has been difficult for me to meet and make friends with other students / Det har v\u00e6rt vanskelig for meg \u00e5 m\u00f8te og bli venner med andre studenters\n\nDrop-out intentions. Two items are taken from the study by Hardre and Reeve (2003): \u201cI sometimes consider dropping out of university before graduation\u201d, \u201cI intend to drop out of school before graduation\u201d. Original Cronbach\u2019s Alpha (three items) .79. The third item was excluded due to complexity and unclear logic for inclusion in the original study (\u201cI sometimes feel unsure about continuing my studies year after year\u201d). Based on the Mindset theory of Action Phases (Gollwitzer, 1990), two additional items were designed for this study which intend to measure predesisional and preactional intentions.\n\nItems (English/ the Norwegian translation is used in the survey):\n\no\tI sometimes consider dropping out of university before graduation / Av og til vurderer jeg \u00e5 slutte studiene f\u00f8r jeg er ferdig med planlagt studiel\u00f8p (eksamen, grad).\no\tI intend to drop out of university before graduation / Jeg kommer til \u00e5 slutte \u00e5 studere f\u00f8r jeg er ferdig med planlagt studiel\u00f8p (eksamen, grad).\no\tI sometimes think that other job opportunities suit me better than those I can get with my current education / Av og til tenker jeg at andre jobbmuligheter enn de studiene gir, passer bedre for meg.\no\tI know what I am going to do if I withdraw from my studies / Jeg vet hva blir mitt neste steg hvis jeg avbryter studiene.\n\nTransfer-out intentions. Two items are taken from the same study by Hardre and Reeve (2003) but rephrased with a focus on transfer-out intentions (e.g., consider changing university, intend to change university). Transfer-out intentions were divided into intentions to change university and study field and were asked separately. Similar to the drop-out intentions\u2019 measure, two items were devised based on the Mindset Theory of Action Phases (Gollwitzer, 1990).\n\nItems (University; English/ the Norwegian translation is used in the survey):\n\no\tI sometimes consider changing university before graduation / Av og til vurderer jeg \u00e5 slutte studiene f\u00f8r jeg er ferdig med planlagt studiel\u00f8p (eksamen, grad).\no\tI intend to change university before graduation / Jeg kommer til \u00e5 slutte \u00e5 studere f\u00f8r jeg er ferdig med planlagt studiel\u00f8p (eksamen, grad).\no\tI sometimes think about how my life would be if I change my studyplace/ Av og til tenker jeg at andre jobbmuligheter enn de studiene gir, passer bedre for meg.\no\tI know what I am going to do if I withdraw from my studies / Jeg vet hva blir mitt neste steg hvis jeg avbryter studiene.\n\nItems (Study Field; English/ the Norwegian translation is used in the survey):\n\no\tI sometimes consider changing stuy field before graduation / Av og til vurderer jeg \u00e5 endre studieretning f\u00f8r jeg er ferdig med planlagt studiel\u00f8p (eksamen, grad).\no\tI intend to change study field before graduation / Jeg kommer til \u00e5 endre studieretning f\u00f8r jeg er ferdig med planlagt studiel\u00f8p (eksamen, grad).\no\tI sometimes think about advantages and disadvantages of changing study field/ Av og til vurderer jeg fordeler og ulemper ved \u00e5 endre studieretning.\no\tI am waiting for possibility to change my study field / Jeg venter p\u00e5 en mulighet for \u00e5 endre studieretning.\n\nTime-to-degree. The time students would spend on degree completion was a self-reported measure borrowed from Gillingham, Seneca, and Taussig (1991). Two questions are asked: \u201cHow long time have you spent studying at this program\u201d, \u201cHow long do you expect it would take to finish your education\u201d. Time-to-degree is a sum score of the time already spent in the program and self-reported expected remaining time. \n\nProcrastination. A subset of two items from the Academic Procrastination Scale (APS; Mccloskey &amp; Scielzo, 2015; Yockey, 2016) will be used in the first part of the survey as an index of academic procrastination (e.g., When given an assignment, I usually put it away and forget about it until it is almost due\u201d; \u201cCramming\u201d and last minute studying is the best way that I study for a big test). Only two items were chosen due to the length of the questionnaire and served as an approximation of procrastination tendencies. Two items were chosen based on their high factor loadings. The items were translated to Norwegian with backward translations and discussion/correction (Kent Norby, unpublished). Cronbach alpha for 25 items is .94 (Mccloskey &amp; Scielzo, 2015). In the second part of the questionnaire, the seven items from APS will be acquired. \n\nItems (English/ the Norwegian translation is used in the survey):\n\no\tMy attention span for schoolwork is very short / Mitt oppmerksomhetsspenn for skolearbeid er veldig kort.\no\tI know I should work on school work, but I just don\u2019t do it / Jeg vet jeg burde jobbe med skolearbeid, men jeg gj\u00f8r det ikke.\no\tI get distracted by other, more fun, things when I am supposed to work on schoolwork / Jeg blir distrahert av andre, mer morsomme ting, n\u00e5r jeg skulle jobbe med skolearbeid.\no\t\u201cCramming\u201d and last minute studying is the best way that I study for a big test / \u00abSkippertak\u00bb og jobb i siste liten er m\u00e5ten jeg best forbereder meg til store pr\u00f8ver\no\tWhen given an assignment, I usually put it away and forget about it until it is almost due / N\u00e5r jeg f\u00e5r utdelt en oppgave, legger jeg den vanligvis til side helt til tidsfristen nesten er g\u00e5tt ut\no\tFriends usually distract me from schoolwork / Venner distraherer meg vanligvis fra skolearbeid.\no\tI don\u2019t spend much time studying school material until the end of the semester / Jeg bruker ikke mye tid p\u00e5 \u00e5 studere pensum f\u00f8r slutten av semesteret.\n\n\nOur main outcome variables are students\u2019 drop-out intentions, university transfer out intentions, study field transfer out intentions. Covariates included in the model: age, gender, parents\u2019 education level, school performance, field of study, and transfer-out history (if a student have changed his field of study).  \n\nLatent variables (factors) include: time-management skills, academic self-efficacy, academic integration, social integration, drop-out intentions, drop-out implementation intentions, university transfer out intentions, university transfer out implementation intentions, study field transfer out intentions, study field transfer out implementation intentions, and procrastination.\n", "q17.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e0e0977db73290016bfef70", "file_name": "Preregistration (02.01.20).docx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/98knj/files/osfstorage/5e0e0977db73290016bfef70", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e0e0977db73290016bfef70"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "725b9a286cf9b12d2bdbc81e6cfbfec94749960fd67f741f9382d0793f541d10"}}], "q18.question": "Time-to-degree: Sum of two items (see Variables section).

The difference between the Model 1 and Model 2 is the relationship between time-management skills, academic self-efficacy and attrition intentions. According to Bean and Eaton (2001), the variables predict students\u2019 integration leading to intentions to persist or withdraw. Further, Elliot (2010) indicated that relationship between academic self-efficacy and social integration was insignificant. The opposite was found concerning the relationship between academic self-efficacy and academic integration. Thus, we expect that academic self-efficacy would not mediate the relationship between time-management skills and social integration. In sum, we aim to test two alternative models. The one depicted in the Figure one (Model 1) is expected to show a better fit compared to the one where academic self-efficacy mediates/ moderates the relationship between time-management skills and social integration.\n\nContrary, results of the meta-analysis by Robbins et al. (2004) indicate the direct \u201cmoderate\u201d relationship between time-management skills, academic self-efficacy and retention. Since no previous studies have been found to investigate the relationship between these variables and types of attrition intentions, we aim to investigate if the relationship between time-management skills and attrition intentions would be mediated by self-efficacy (Model 2). Consequently, a set of alternative models would be tested. The main difference is the outcome variable (drop-out, transfer out intentions). The fit of the models would be compared to the fit of the models specifying indirect relationship between time-management skills, academic self-efficacy and attrition intentions (Model 1).\n\nAlternatively, if the mediation/moderation effect of academic self-efficacy is not indicated, we would test the direct relationship between time-management skills, academic self-efficacy, and the described variables.  \n\nThe relationship between procrastination and attrition intentions is assumed to be mediated/ moderated by time-to-degree (Bair &amp; Haworth, 2005: Muszynski &amp; Akamatsu, 1991; Wadkins, 1999). Contrary, procrastination is commonly associated with poor academic performance, time-management skills and self-efficacy (Klingsieck et al., 2013; Steel, 2007). Thus, academic integration and students\u2019 performance will be tested for potential mediation/ moderation effects. \n\nModel fit data will be examined using chi-square test, CFI, TLI, RMSEA, and SRMR. Standard fit cut-off values will be applied: CFI, TLI values greater than .95 (Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999), SRMR less than .08 (Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999), and RMSEA less than .05 (MacCallum, Browne, &amp; Sugawara, 1996). Values equal to or lesser/higher than cut-off values indicate good and close fit. Analyses will be performed with STATA or Mplus software.

After giving consent, participants will be asked to read and evaluate a magazine review about race-relations in America. This will manipulate the extent to which White-Americans can be highly trusted (high investment) or lowly trusted (low investment), adopting methods from previous research regarding intergroup trust (Dovidio et al, 2008; Noor et al., 2008): \nIntergroup Trust Manipulation. I will randomly assign participants to either the high intergroup trust condition or low intergroup trust condition. In the high intergroup trust condition, participants will read a news article titled \u201cImproving Intergroup Trust in America\u201d with the statistics that suggesting that the majority of White Americans (82%) agree with the following statement: \u201cWe should not forget the oppression and suffering of Black-Americans throughout the history of this country,\u201d and 76% of White-Americans agree that \u201cthey are psychologically invested in the issues the plight the Black community.\u201d The article will discuss how the majority of White Americans value cooperative solutions to race related problems, and are working hard for peaceful race relations. In the low intergroup trust condition, participants will read a news article titled \u201cWaning Intergroup Trust in America\u201d with the statistics that suggest only 30% of White Americans agree with the statement \u201cWe should not forget the oppression and suffering of Black-Americans throughout the history of this country.\u201d The article will discuss how the majority of White Americans are not working hard enough on finding cooperative solutions to race-related problems. Participants will read a second, ostensibly unrelated magazine article, which will discuss the details of an up and coming hair salon, as well as information about the owner. The information will be consistent throughout the conditions, except for the manipulation of out-group culture use:\nOut Group Culture Use Manipulation. I will randomly assign participants to either the out-group culture use condition, or the no out-group culture use condition. In the out-group culture use condition, participants will read about a White-American hairstylist/salon owner advertising Black-American hairstyles (e.g. Dreadlocked Hair Weaves) on White models. In the no out-group culture use condition, participants will read about a White-American hairstylist/salon owner advertising White-American hairstyles (e.g. Blonde Straight Hair Extensions) on White models. This procedure is adapted from previous research manipulating out-group culture use via hairstyle (Studies 1-4; Mosley &amp; Biernat, accepted pending revision, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology).\nManipulation check of out-group culture use.  Pilot data was collected using a sample of Mturk participants (N = 60) to test the effectiveness of the out-group culture manipulation. Preliminary results revealed that participants were more likely to categorize White-American hairstyles (e.g., Blonde Straight Hair Extensions) as \u201cattributed to White (vs. Black)-American culture),\u201d and more likely to categorize the Black-American hairstyles e.g. Dreadlocked Hair Weaves as \u201cattributed to Black (vs. White)-American culture\u201d (ps &lt;.05). This preliminary finding demonstrates a successful manipulation of out-group culture use designed for the proposed studies.\nManipulation check of psychological investment. Pilot data was collected using a sample of Mturk participants (N = 60) to test the effectiveness of the psychological investment manipulation. Preliminary results revealed that participants in the high intergroup condition reported that White-Americans \u201ccare more,\u201d are more empathetic towards issues of the Black community\u201d than those in the low intergroup trust condition (p &lt; .05). This preliminary finding demonstrates a successful, but varied, manipulation of psychological investment designed for the proposed studies. \nParticipants then will complete dependent measures:\nDependent Measures: Participants will complete the same measures of perceptions of cultural appropriation and perceptions of cultural appreciation as in Study 1 (1= Strongly Disagree, 7 = Strongly Agree). Intergroup attitudes will be assessed using measures of a) implicit race bias, b) out-group empathy, c) intergroup threat, and d) willingness for intergroup contact. To assess participants implicit race bias, participants will first be asked to complete the race implicit association test (IAT), which assesses the speed of positive and negative associations between racial categories (Black and White) (Greenwald et al., 1998). Participants will also indicate their agreement with the following self-report measures (1= Strongly Disagree, 7 = Strongly Agree): out-group empathy, (adapted from Noor et al., 2008; 6 items: \u201cWhen I think about Black -Americans, I feel empathy/ compassion/ sympathy/ understanding\u201d), intergroup threat (Stephan &amp; Stephan, 2013; 12 items: \u201cI feel anxious when I think about Black-Americans\u201d), and willingness for future intergroup contact (Esses &amp; Dovidio, 2000; 11 items, e.g., \u201cHow willing would you be to engage in the following behaviors if given the opportunity: confide in a Black person?\u201d). To assess moderation, will also complete the same measure of intergroup contact as in Studies 1 and 2. Participants will complete demographics and will be fully debriefed. \n\nStudy 4 Procedures. As a cover story, participants will be told that we will be studying the effects of reading comprehension on social interactions. Participants be told that they will interact with a student in a different room, but will first read a brief article to assess their reading comprehension abilities. After giving consent, participants will be asked to read and evaluate a magazine review of a local hair salon. The magazine review will discuss the details of an up and coming hair salon, as well as information about the owner. The information in the magazine review will be consistent throughout the conditions, except for the manipulations of out-group culture use and psychological investment: \nOut-Group Culture Use Manipulation. As in Study 3. the magazine review will manipulate the extent to which that target is engaged in the use of an out-group cultural product (out-group culture use condition vs. the no out-group culture use condition) using the same procedures. \nIntergroup Trust Manipulation. In addition, the magazine review will manipulate the extent to which there is a sense of high (vs. low) intergroup trust between the in-group (White-Americans) and the out-group (Black-Americans), using the manipulation in Study 3. Participants will complete measures:\nDependent Measures:  Using the same measures in Study 3, we will assess participants\u2019 perceptions of cultural appropriation and appreciation, out-group empathy, intergroup threat, willingness for future intergroup contact, implicit biases, and their past intergroup contact, After completing these measures, participants will be escorted to a different room by the experimenter. In this room, there will be two chairs, and sitting in the chair, there will be a confederate of Black-American ethnicity playing the role of a student with a video camera in the middle of the room. Participants will then be asked to engage in an interaction with a gender-matched ostensible student (actually a confederate of the lab). Four confederates will be trained to engage in a structured discussion (2 males, 2 females). For generalizability, multiple confederates will be used to be sure that score differences are specifically due to race, and not to idiosyncratic confederate effects. The participant and the confederate will be instructed to have a brief three-minute interaction where they introduce themselves, discuss their backgrounds, majors, and any other information about themselves they would like to share. The procedures of this interaction will be adapted from previous research examining expressions of discrimination (Dovidio, Kawakami, Johnson, Johnson &amp; Howard,1997; Goff, Steele, &amp; Davies, 2008). Interactions will be videotaped to allow for future coding of nonverbal expressions of discrimination throughout the interaction. Four trained research assistants will later code the videos for nonverbal indicators of intergroup bias (Dovidio, et al.,1997; Goff, Steele, &amp; Davies, 2008): including less time spent engaging in eye contact (in seconds), greater frequency of speech error (number of times the participant stumbles on their words), greater frequency in fidgeting (how many times the participant displays an uncomfortable use of the hands), and displaying a rigid body posture (0-leaned back, 1 \u2013 supine position, 2 \u2013 leaned forward in interest). Participants will complete demographic measures and will be debriefed.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": " I will recruit 217 adults for each study.

", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Study 3 Procedures. After giving consent, participants will be asked to read and evaluate a magazine review about race-relations in America. This will manipulate the extent to which White-Americans can be highly trusted (high investment) or lowly trusted (low investment), adopting methods from previous research regarding intergroup trust (Dovidio et al, 2008; Noor et al., 2008): \nIntergroup Trust Manipulation. I will randomly assign participants to either the high intergroup trust condition or low intergroup trust condition. In the high intergroup trust condition, participants will read a news article titled \u201cImproving Intergroup Trust in America\u201d with the statistics that suggesting that the majority of White Americans (82%) agree with the following statement: \u201cWe should not forget the oppression and suffering of Black-Americans throughout the history of this country,\u201d and 76% of White-Americans agree that \u201cthey are psychologically invested in the issues the plight the Black community.\u201d The article will discuss how the majority of White Americans value cooperative solutions to race related problems, and are working hard for peaceful race relations. In the low intergroup trust condition, participants will read a news article titled \u201cWaning Intergroup Trust in America\u201d with the statistics that suggest only 30% of White Americans agree with the statement \u201cWe should not forget the oppression and suffering of Black-Americans throughout the history of this country.\u201d The article will discuss how the majority of White Americans are not working hard enough on finding cooperative solutions to race-related problems. Participants will read a second, ostensibly unrelated magazine article, which will discuss the details of an up and coming hair salon, as well as information about the owner. The information will be consistent throughout the conditions, except for the manipulation of out-group culture use:\nOut Group Culture Use Manipulation. I will randomly assign participants to either the out-group culture use condition, or the no out-group culture use condition. In the out-group culture use condition, participants will read about a White-American hairstylist/salon owner advertising Black-American hairstyles (e.g. Dreadlocked Hair Weaves) on White models. In the no out-group culture use condition, participants will read about a White-American hairstylist/salon owner advertising White-American hairstyles (e.g. Blonde Straight Hair Extensions) on White models. This procedure is adapted from previous research manipulating out-group culture use via hairstyle (Studies 1-4; Mosley &amp; Biernat, accepted pending revision, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology).\nManipulation check of out-group culture use.  Pilot data was collected using a sample of Mturk participants (N = 60) to test the effectiveness of the out-group culture manipulation. Preliminary results revealed that participants were more likely to categorize White-American hairstyles (e.g., Blonde Straight Hair Extensions) as \u201cattributed to White (vs. Black)-American culture),\u201d and more likely to categorize the Black-American hairstyles e.g. Dreadlocked Hair Weaves as \u201cattributed to Black (vs. White)-American culture\u201d (ps &lt;.05). This preliminary finding demonstrates a successful manipulation of out-group culture use designed for the proposed studies.\nManipulation check of psychological investment. Pilot data was collected using a sample of Mturk participants (N = 60) to test the effectiveness of the psychological investment manipulation. Preliminary results revealed that participants in the high intergroup condition reported that White-Americans \u201ccare more,\u201d are more empathetic towards issues of the Black community\u201d than those in the low intergroup trust condition (p &lt; .05). This preliminary finding demonstrates a successful, but varied, manipulation of psychological investment designed for the proposed studies. \nParticipants then will complete dependent measures:\nDependent Measures: Participants will complete the same measures of perceptions of cultural appropriation and perceptions of cultural appreciation as in Study 1 (1= Strongly Disagree, 7 = Strongly Agree). Intergroup attitudes will be assessed using measures of a) implicit race bias, b) out-group empathy, c) intergroup threat, and d) willingness for intergroup contact. To assess participants implicit race bias, participants will first be asked to complete the race implicit association test (IAT), which assesses the speed of positive and negative associations between racial categories (Black and White) (Greenwald et al., 1998). Participants will also indicate their agreement with the following self-report measures (1= Strongly Disagree, 7 = Strongly Agree): out-group empathy, (adapted from Noor et al., 2008; 6 items: \u201cWhen I think about Black -Americans, I feel empathy/ compassion/ sympathy/ understanding\u201d), intergroup threat (Stephan &amp; Stephan, 2013; 12 items: \u201cI feel anxious when I think about Black-Americans\u201d), and willingness for future intergroup contact (Esses &amp; Dovidio, 2000; 11 items, e.g., \u201cHow willing would you be to engage in the following behaviors if given the opportunity: confide in a Black person?\u201d). To assess moderation, will also complete the same measure of intergroup contact as in Studies 1 and 2. Participants will complete demographics and will be fully debriefed. \n\nStudy 4 Procedures. As a cover story, participants will be told that we will be studying the effects of reading comprehension on social interactions. Participants be told that they will interact with a student in a different room, but will first read a brief article to assess their reading comprehension abilities. After giving consent, participants will be asked to read and evaluate a magazine review of a local hair salon. The magazine review will discuss the details of an up and coming hair salon, as well as information about the owner. The information in the magazine review will be consistent throughout the conditions, except for the manipulations of out-group culture use and psychological investment: \nOut-Group Culture Use Manipulation. As in Study 3. the magazine review will manipulate the extent to which that target is engaged in the use of an out-group cultural product (out-group culture use condition vs. the no out-group culture use condition) using the same procedures. \nIntergroup Trust Manipulation. In addition, the magazine review will manipulate the extent to which there is a sense of high (vs. low) intergroup trust between the in-group (White-Americans) and the out-group (Black-Americans), using the manipulation in Study 3. Participants will complete measures:\nDependent Measures:  Using the same measures in Study 3, we will assess participants\u2019 perceptions of cultural appropriation and appreciation, out-group empathy, intergroup threat, willingness for future intergroup contact, implicit biases, and their past intergroup contact, After completing these measures, participants will be escorted to a different room by the experimenter. In this room, there will be two chairs, and sitting in the chair, there will be a confederate of Black-American ethnicity playing the role of a student with a video camera in the middle of the room. Participants will then be asked to engage in an interaction with a gender-matched ostensible student (actually a confederate of the lab). Four confederates will be trained to engage in a structured discussion (2 males, 2 females). For generalizability, multiple confederates will be used to be sure that score differences are specifically due to race, and not to idiosyncratic confederate effects. The participant and the confederate will be instructed to have a brief three-minute interaction where they introduce themselves, discuss their backgrounds, majors, and any other information about themselves they would like to share. The procedures of this interaction will be adapted from previous research examining expressions of discrimination (Dovidio, Kawakami, Johnson, Johnson &amp; Howard,1997; Goff, Steele, &amp; Davies, 2008). Interactions will be videotaped to allow for future coding of nonverbal expressions of discrimination throughout the interaction. Four trained research assistants will later code the videos for nonverbal indicators of intergroup bias (Dovidio, et al.,1997; Goff, Steele, &amp; Davies, 2008): including less time spent engaging in eye contact (in seconds), greater frequency of speech error (number of times the participant stumbles on their words), greater frequency in fidgeting (how many times the participant displays an uncomfortable use of the hands), and displaying a rigid body posture (0-leaned back, 1 \u2013 supine position, 2 \u2013 leaned forward in interest). Participants will complete demographic measures and will be debriefed.\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "1) Out Group Culture Use: Out-Group Culture Use vs. No Out-Group Culture Use) \n\n2) Intergroup Trust: High Trust vs. Low Trust", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Study 3 Dependent Measures: Participants will complete the same measures of perceptions of cultural appropriation and perceptions of cultural appreciation as in Study 1 (1= Strongly Disagree, 7 = Strongly Agree).
