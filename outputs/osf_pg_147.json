Because of concerns of carry-over effects, those in the early choice and early choice removal conditions will make judgments for only one of the two domains (assigned randomly) and those in the late choice and control condition will make judgments about both of the domains. Participants will be asked to judge the appeal of 20 different attributes for each domain. The attributes that the participants will be judging will be quantitative and diagnostic in nature (e.g., highway MPG, apartment square footage). Each pair will focus on one attribute and highlight how the two apartments or cars differ in that attribute. For example, participants might see a pair of attributes that states that Car A gets 42 highway miles per gallons and Car B gets 38 highway miles per gallon. The survey itself will be run on Qualtrics and will use Ohio State University\u2019s psychology participation pool. The order is random within each block of the 20 attributes is randomly determined (based on block), and both domains assigned, and domain order are also randomly assigned. \nThere are two blocks. Each block contains 10 sets of attributes. The order of the attributes is randomly shown within each block. For subjects who only see one domain, they will be randomly assigned to either cars or apartments. For those who see both domains, the order in which they evaluate cars vs apartments will be randomized.  \nParticipants will be assigned to one of six conditions (described above in the planned sample size section). For those in the control condition, participants will be asked to judge the appeal of 20 different attributes for two different alternatives per domain. On each page, there will be one attribute per alternative, and each of the 20 sets of attributes will be displayed on separate pages. They will be told that they are not being asked to make a choice, and to evaluate the attributes based solely on their appeal. In order to ensure that tentative preferences cannot bias evaluations, for each attribute, the two alternative will be anonymous, such that the identity of the two alternatives will change for each attribute evaluated (e.g., attribute one will display information about Option A and Option B, and another attribute will display information about Option C and Option D). After participants judge the appeal of the 20 sets of attributes for the first domain, they will do the same thing for the second domain. They will then be debriefed, answer a few demographic questions, and thanked for their participation. \nFor those assigned to one of the three choice conditions (i.e., early choice, early choice removed, and late choice), they will be asked to make a choice between two alternatives. For those in the early choice condition, they will be asked to judge the appeal of 20 sets of attributes for the two alternatives. For each attribute, participants will be asked two questions. First, they will be asked how appealing or unappealing this specific feature of the apartment or car is for each of the different options. They will respond to these questions on a 9-point scale from very unappealing to very appealing. Next, they will be asked to use the information they have seen up to that point to indicate how much they are leaning towards one apartment/car or the other, using a 10-point scale from strongly leaning towards one option to strongly leaning towards the other option. \nThe early choice condition: After they have evaluated 10 attributes, they will be asked to make a choice between the two alternatives. After they have indicated their choice, they will then continue to evaluate the remaining 10 attributes. After they have finished evaluating all 20 sets of attributes, they will be asked to make a final choice, based on all of the attributes they have seen. They will then be asked a few demographic questions, be debriefed, and thanked for their participation. Because of potential carry-over effects, those assigned to this condition will only evaluate attribute for one of the two domains (i.e., either apartments or cars).\nThe early choice removed condition will be identical to the early choice condition, except for one important feature. For those in the early choice removed condition, after they have rated the 10 attributes, they will be told that one of the alternatives is no longer available (which of the two alternatives removed is determined randomly). For example, if the participant was making judgments about the two apartments, halfway through the procedure they would be told that one of the apartments has been leased, therefore they have been assigned to lease the remaining apartment. After this choice removal halfway, they will continue evaluating the remaining 10 attributes in the same way that they evaluated the first 10. In other words, even though the participant has now been assigned one of the alternatives, they will continue to evaluate information for both of the alternatives. At the end of the procedure, they will be asked to make a choice between the two alternatives as if both were still available. Because of potential carry-over effects, those assigned to this condition will only evaluate attribute for one of the two domains (i.e., either apartments or cars).\nThe late choice condition will also be very similar to the early choice and early choice removed condition. For instance, they will be asked to evaluate the 20 sets of attributes for the two alternatives, and then asked to make a choice at the end. The most important difference for this condition is that there is no halfway choice or choice removal. Those in this condition will rate each of the 20 attributes, uninterrupted, and then make a final choice between the two alternatives at the end of the study. Because there is no \u201csurprise\u201d choice or choice removal, those assigned to this condition will make judgments for both of the domains.\nAll will end with demographic questions, will be asked about their ideas about a potential hypothesis of the study, and be debriefed.\n"}}}, "planned-sample": {"value": {"question4b": {"extra": [], "value": "Those enrolled in an introductory psychology course at Ohio State University."}, "question5b": {"extra": [], "value": "Student participant pool of psychology students from Ohio State University."}, "question6b": {"extra": [], "value": "The planned sample size is ~450.

This preference shifts their evaluation of new information (DeKay, Miller, Schley, &amp; Erford, 2014). The evaluation of the new information tends to be in favor of the preferred alternative (pro-leader distortion) and against the non-preferred alternative (antitrailer distortion). This in turn causes a cycle where biased evaluation of new information maintains or strengthens the preference which leads to further biased evaluation of new information. This is referred to as predecisional information distortion (Russo, Medvec, &amp; Meloy, 1996; Russo, Meloy, &amp; Medvec, 1998). Information distortion can happen even in the absence of a previous preference (i.e., the preference can form spontaneously during the task) and tends to shrink by about half after a decision has been made (Russo et al., 1996). Predecisional distortion can happen in a variety of contexts, including real-estate decisions (DeKay et al., 2014; DeKay, 2015), medical decisions (Kostopoulou, Russo, Keenan, Delaney, Douiri, 2012; Levy &amp; Hershey, 2006), and consumer decisions (Bond, Carlson, Russo, &amp; Tanner, 2007; Carlson et al., 2006; Russo et al., 1996, 1998; Russo, Carlson, Meloy, &amp; Yong, 2008). Distortion can happen with or without incentives (Meloy, Russo, &amp; Miller, 2006), when preference is experimentally manipulated (Russo et al., 1996, 1998), and when the information about the alternatives is non-diagnostic (Russo et al., 1996, 1998). Importantly, distortion has also been shown to predict final choice (DeKay et al., 2014). Predecisional information distortion was discovered as a byproduct of Festinger\u2019s 1957 work on cognitive dissonance. At the time, the lack of strong evidence for predecisional distortion led Festinger to focus solely on postdecisional distortion. However, since then, researchers have strived to investigate why information distortion occurs. In a group of studies, researchers found that certain primes affected the degree of information distortion (Russo, Carlson, Meloy, Margaret &amp; Yong, 2008). Specifically, they found that when participants were primed with consistency and coherence, this led to the greatest degree of predecisional information distortion, as compared to primes relating to reducing cognitive effort, separating alternatives. In other words, it is theorized that the reason information distortion occurs is because people have a need to create and maintain consistency in their preferences and judgments. In turn, when a tentative preference is formed, the combination of that tentative preference with the desire for coherence allows the person to distort information in favor of the leading alternative, while discounting information about the trialing alternative. A consistent factor in all information distortion research is that the participant has a choice between alternatives. Sometimes the timing of the choice is at their discretion (Russo et al., 1998), and sometimes the choice is at the end of the task (DeKay et al., 2014), but throughout all work in this paradigm, there have yet to be experimental manipulations where the participant is not given a choice between the two alternatives. More importantly, there has yet to be research investigating information distortion when the choice is removed from the participant. Because distortion research makes no claims about behavior when choice is removed, I discuss research in other similar domains that may shed light on people\u2019s potential behavior. \nCoping and Rationalization: \nResearch has shown that people consistently avoid feeling the negative feelings of a situation that they know is immutable. For instance, prizes are evaluated as less desirable if they are not won (Kahneman, Knetch, &amp; Thaler, 1990, 1991), high school students judge colleges more negatively after rejection (Lyubomirsky &amp; Ross, 1999), voters judge the winner of an election more favorably even if they were originally opposed (Gilbert et at., 1998), and smokers say a smoking ban will affect them less when surveyed after it takes effect (Laurin, 2018). Overall, evaluation of a negative event improves after it happens. This happens only in events that can\u2019t be changed. This is thought to occur because it puts people in a more \u201cemotion-focused coping\u201d versus a \u201cproblem-focused coping\u201d frame of mind. In summary, information-distortion theory doesn\u2019t make any claims about what happens when the participant isn\u2019t given a choice. Coping research could potentially claim that people\u2019s evaluation of the information about the forced alternative that they are given would improve once the other alternative is removed.  However, rationalization and coping theory appear to address only general attitudes and evaluations and do not speak to the specific process by which people form positive evaluations. Information distortion may be a mechanism that explains such favorable evaluations. \n"}, "question6a": {"extra": [], "value": "The consistency account for information distortion (Russo et al., 2008) is silent about what would happen if there is no choice because an option is externally imposed. Ultimately, it depends on what was the preferred option before the choice removal, the goal of the participant, and whether or not that goal has been satisfied. For instance, if the participant\u2019s goal is to remain consistent with their early tentative preference, then removing one of the alternatives (thereby making the choice for the participant) should have no effect because they would wish to continue distorting towards the leading alternative. However, if the participant\u2019s goal is to reduce the negative feelings associated with not getting the preferred alternative, then the participant may start to distort information in favor of the alternative that was chosen for them. If in the choice removal condition the participant got the option they were already leaning towards, then no special predictions are made about their distortion after this point. However, if the participant was given the option they were not leaning towards, then it could depend on the overall goal of the participant to either bolster their leading alternative prior to removal, or reduce the negative feelings of being given the non-preferred option. This study will explore all of these combinations. Depending on the results of this first study, it may be useful to understand the mechanism behind distortion when the choice is made for the participant to determine if Russo\u2019s consistency explanation is a valid explanation in this context.

(1998). In order to compute this score, we subtract Option B\u2019s appeal rating from Option A\u2019s appeal rating (this is done for each attribute for each participant). This gives us an indication of how much more appealing Option B was compared to Option A. In order to assess distortion, we average the control group\u2019s B-A difference scores (because the options were anonymous and therefore unbiased and can be used as a baseline). We subtract those baseline difference scores from the experimental participants\u2019 B-A difference scores. We do this for each attribute for each participant. Higher scores indicate favoring Option B, and lower scores indicate favoring Option A. We then determine which option was leading at the previously evaluated alternative. If the participant was leaning towards Option B, then the score is left alone. If the participant was leaning towards Option A, then the sign of the score is flipped. The result of this is that positive scores favor what was leading, and negative scores favor what was trailing. This gives us a distortion score for each attribute for each participant. We then average across the attributes for each participant, by block. This gives us an average amount of distortion before the halfway point and an average amount of distortion after the halfway point. \nChoice-signed distortion: This distortion score will be calculated much like leader-signed distortion. The only difference is instead of flipping the sign of the distortion in favor of the leading alternative, we use what choice the participant made at the halfway point as an indicator. \nChoice removal-signed distortion will use the option that was chosen for them as an indicator. \n4.\tFor the first half of the experiment, we will use the leader-signed distortion calculation to determine if distortion is positive (which would indicate that people distort information towards their leading alternative).

We predict that there will be a post choice decrease in information distortion for those in the early choice condition.

In other words, it is theorized that the reason information distortion occurs is because people have a need to create and maintain consistency in their preferences and judgments. In turn, when a tentative preference is formed, the combination of that tentative preference with the desire for coherence allows the person to distort information in favor of the leading alternative, while discounting information about the trialing alternative. A consistent factor in all information distortion research is that the participant has a choice between alternatives. Sometimes the timing of the choice is at their discretion (Russo et al., 1998), and sometimes the choice is at the end of the task (DeKay et al., 2014), but throughout all work in this paradigm, there have yet to be experimental manipulations where the participant is not given a choice between the two alternatives. More importantly, there has yet to be research investigating information distortion when the choice is removed from the participant. Because distortion research makes no claims about behavior when choice is removed, I discuss research in other similar domains that may shed light on people\u2019s potential behavior. \nCoping and Rationalization: \nResearch has shown that people consistently avoid feeling the negative feelings of a situation that they know is immutable. For instance, prizes are evaluated as less desirable if they are not won (Kahneman, Knetch, &amp; Thaler, 1990, 1991), high school students judge colleges more negatively after rejection (Lyubomirsky &amp; Ross, 1999), voters judge the winner of an election more favorably even if they were originally opposed (Gilbert et at., 1998), and smokers say a smoking ban will affect them less when surveyed after it takes effect (Laurin, 2018). Overall, evaluation of a negative event improves after it happens. This happens only in events that can\u2019t be changed. This is thought to occur because it puts people in a more \u201cemotion-focused coping\u201d versus a \u201cproblem-focused coping\u201d frame of mind. In summary, information-distortion theory doesn\u2019t make any claims about what happens when the participant isn\u2019t given a choice. Coping research could potentially claim that people\u2019s evaluation of the information about the forced alternative that they are given would improve once the other alternative is removed.  However, rationalization and coping theory appear to address only general attitudes and evaluations and do not speak to the specific process by which people form positive evaluations. Information distortion may be a mechanism that explains such favorable evaluations. \n", "recommended-hypothesis.question6a": "The consistency account for information distortion (Russo et al., 2008) is silent about what would happen if there is no choice because an option is externally imposed. Ultimately, it depends on what was the preferred option before the choice removal, the goal of the participant, and whether or not that goal has been satisfied. For instance, if the participant\u2019s goal is to remain consistent with their early tentative preference, then removing one of the alternatives (thereby making the choice for the participant) should have no effect because they would wish to continue distorting towards the leading alternative. However, if the participant\u2019s goal is to reduce the negative feelings associated with not getting the preferred alternative, then the participant may start to distort information in favor of the alternative that was chosen for them. If in the choice removal condition the participant got the option they were already leaning towards, then no special predictions are made about their distortion after this point. However, if the participant was given the option they were not leaning towards, then it could depend on the overall goal of the participant to either bolster their leading alternative prior to removal, or reduce the negative feelings of being given the non-preferred option. This study will explore all of these combinations. Depending on the results of this first study, it may be useful to understand the mechanism behind distortion when the choice is made for the participant to determine if Russo\u2019s consistency explanation is a valid explanation in this context. ", "description-methods.design.question2a": "Between subjects: There are three experimental choice conditions and a control condition. The three experimental choice conditions include an early choice condition, an early choice removed condition, and a late choice condition. \nWithin Subjects: Choice domain (apartments and cars), order of attributes (random within each half of the experimental conditions), order of choice domain (e.g., apartments first).\nBecause we were concerned with carry-over effects from the choice being removed from certain participants, the early choice and early choice removed conditions only contain one of the domains.

In addition, we will also use two choice domains (i.e., apartment and cars). Because of concerns of carry-over effects, those in the early choice and early choice removal conditions will make judgments for only one of the two domains (assigned randomly) and those in the late choice and control condition will make judgments about both of the domains. Participants will be asked to judge the appeal of 20 different attributes for each domain. The attributes that the participants will be judging will be quantitative and diagnostic in nature (e.g., highway MPG, apartment square footage). Each pair will focus on one attribute and highlight how the two apartments or cars differ in that attribute. For example, participants might see a pair of attributes that states that Car A gets 42 highway miles per gallons and Car B gets 38 highway miles per gallon. The survey itself will be run on Qualtrics and will use Ohio State University\u2019s psychology participation pool. The order is random within each block of the 20 attributes is randomly determined (based on block), and both domains assigned, and domain order are also randomly assigned. \nThere are two blocks. Each block contains 10 sets of attributes. The order of the attributes is randomly shown within each block. For subjects who only see one domain, they will be randomly assigned to either cars or apartments. For those who see both domains, the order in which they evaluate cars vs apartments will be randomized.  \nParticipants will be assigned to one of six conditions (described above in the planned sample size section). For those in the control condition, participants will be asked to judge the appeal of 20 different attributes for two different alternatives per domain. On each page, there will be one attribute per alternative, and each of the 20 sets of attributes will be displayed on separate pages. They will be told that they are not being asked to make a choice, and to evaluate the attributes based solely on their appeal. In order to ensure that tentative preferences cannot bias evaluations, for each attribute, the two alternative will be anonymous, such that the identity of the two alternatives will change for each attribute evaluated (e.g., attribute one will display information about Option A and Option B, and another attribute will display information about Option C and Option D). After participants judge the appeal of the 20 sets of attributes for the first domain, they will do the same thing for the second domain. They will then be debriefed, answer a few demographic questions, and thanked for their participation. \nFor those assigned to one of the three choice conditions (i.e., early choice, early choice removed, and late choice), they will be asked to make a choice between two alternatives. For those in the early choice condition, they will be asked to judge the appeal of 20 sets of attributes for the two alternatives. For each attribute, participants will be asked two questions. First, they will be asked how appealing or unappealing this specific feature of the apartment or car is for each of the different options. They will respond to these questions on a 9-point scale from very unappealing to very appealing. Next, they will be asked to use the information they have seen up to that point to indicate how much they are leaning towards one apartment/car or the other, using a 10-point scale from strongly leaning towards one option to strongly leaning towards the other option. \nThe early choice condition: After they have evaluated 10 attributes, they will be asked to make a choice between the two alternatives. After they have indicated their choice, they will then continue to evaluate the remaining 10 attributes. After they have finished evaluating all 20 sets of attributes, they will be asked to make a final choice, based on all of the attributes they have seen. They will then be asked a few demographic questions, be debriefed, and thanked for their participation. Because of potential carry-over effects, those assigned to this condition will only evaluate attribute for one of the two domains (i.e., either apartments or cars).\nThe early choice removed condition will be identical to the early choice condition, except for one important feature. For those in the early choice removed condition, after they have rated the 10 attributes, they will be told that one of the alternatives is no longer available (which of the two alternatives removed is determined randomly). For example, if the participant was making judgments about the two apartments, halfway through the procedure they would be told that one of the apartments has been leased, therefore they have been assigned to lease the remaining apartment. After this choice removal halfway, they will continue evaluating the remaining 10 attributes in the same way that they evaluated the first 10. In other words, even though the participant has now been assigned one of the alternatives, they will continue to evaluate information for both of the alternatives. At the end of the procedure, they will be asked to make a choice between the two alternatives as if both were still available. Because of potential carry-over effects, those assigned to this condition will only evaluate attribute for one of the two domains (i.e., either apartments or cars).\nThe late choice condition will also be very similar to the early choice and early choice removed condition. For instance, they will be asked to evaluate the 20 sets of attributes for the two alternatives, and then asked to make a choice at the end. The most important difference for this condition is that there is no halfway choice or choice removal. Those in this condition will rate each of the 20 attributes, uninterrupted, and then make a final choice between the two alternatives at the end of the study. Because there is no \u201csurprise\u201d choice or choice removal, those assigned to this condition will make judgments for both of the domains.\nAll will end with demographic questions, will be asked about their ideas about a potential hypothesis of the study, and be debriefed.\n", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question1c": "In order to test our hypotheses, there are three metrics that will be calculated: leader-signed distortion, choice-signed distortion, and choice removed-signed distortion.\nLeader-signed distortion: We will use the metric outlined in Russo et al. (1998). In order to compute this score, we subtract Option B\u2019s appeal rating from Option A\u2019s appeal rating (this is done for each attribute for each participant). This gives us an indication of how much more appealing Option B was compared to Option A. In order to assess distortion, we average the control group\u2019s B-A difference scores (because the options were anonymous and therefore unbiased and can be used as a baseline). We subtract those baseline difference scores from the experimental participants\u2019 B-A difference scores. We do this for each attribute for each participant. Higher scores indicate favoring Option B, and lower scores indicate favoring Option A. We then determine which option was leading at the previously evaluated alternative. If the participant was leaning towards Option B, then the score is left alone. If the participant was leaning towards Option A, then the sign of the score is flipped. The result of this is that positive scores favor what was leading, and negative scores favor what was trailing. This gives us a distortion score for each attribute for each participant. We then average across the attributes for each participant, by block. This gives us an average amount of distortion before the halfway point and an average amount of distortion after the halfway point. \nChoice-signed distortion: This distortion score will be calculated much like leader-signed distortion. The only difference is instead of flipping the sign of the distortion in favor of the leading alternative, we use what choice the participant made at the halfway point as an indicator. \nChoice removal-signed distortion will use the option that was chosen for them as an indicator. \n4.\tFor the first half of the experiment, we will use the leader-signed distortion calculation to determine if distortion is positive (which would indicate that people distort information towards their leading alternative). We do not expect any differences between the choice conditions in the first half of the experiment. \n5.\tFor the second half of the experiment, we will calculate distortion three different ways. For all of the three choice conditions, distortion will be calculated based on the currently leading alternative. For the early choice condition, we will also calculate distortion based on the choice made at the halfway point. For the early choice removed condition, we will also calculate distortion based on the alternative that was chosen for them, as well as the alternative that was preferred before the halfway point. \n6.\tBecause we do not predict any differences in distortion in the first half of the experiment (i.e., where all participants are essentially doing the same thing) the remainder of these analyses refer to the second block of the experiment, and are thus interactions with the block condition. \n7.\tWe want to compare the early choice condition to the late choice condition. We predict that there will be a post choice decrease in information distortion for those in the early choice condition. We will calculate this difference using the standard leader-signed distortion metric. In other words, the late choice condition will have roughly equal amounts of distortion before and after the halfway point, and the early choice condition will have less distortion after the halfway point (compared to both the late choice second block distortion and the early choice first block distortion).\n8.\tFor the second half of the experiment,\na.\tThose in the late choice condition will distort in favor of the currently leading alternative (calculated using the leader-signed distortion metric).\nb.\tThose in the early choice condition will distort in favor of the choice that was made at the halfway point (calculated using the choice-signed distortion metric).\nc.\tThose in the early choice removed condition will distort in favor of the choice that was made for them (calculated using the choice removed-signed distortion metric). For those in this condition, we understand that in some cases the participant was given what they wanted, and in some cases, they were not given what they wanted. We will explore distortion for both the choice that was made for them as well as distortion in favor of what was leading before the choice was made for them. However, we do not have predictions for how participants in this condition will differ.\n9.\tWe will compare amount of distortion in the first and second half for those in the late choice condition, to determine if distortion increases or decreases over time, but we do not have predictions for this analysis.\nOnce we have an overall average distortion score for each individual, we can then conduct the tests to investigate the hypotheses stated above. We plan on using mixed linear regression with an individual\u2019s aggregated distortion score as the dependent variable, and choice condition, block, domain, and domain order as the main predictor variables. We also plan to use paired samples t-tests to compare distortion for each participant before and after the halfway point.\n", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question2c": "Mixed Linear Regression.", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question3c": "IV: choice condition.\nDV: information distortion.\nModerator: block.\n", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question4c": "No covariates used.", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question5c": "N/A", "confirmatory-analyses-third.third.question1c": "", "confirmatory-analyses-third.third.question2c": "", "confirmatory-analyses-third.third.question3c": "", "confirmatory-analyses-third.third.question4c": "", "confirmatory-analyses-third.third.question5c": "", "description-methods.planned-sample.question4b": "Those enrolled in an introductory psychology course at Ohio State University.", "description-methods.planned-sample.question5b": "Student participant pool of psychology students from Ohio State University.", "description-methods.planned-sample.question6b": "The planned sample size is ~450.
