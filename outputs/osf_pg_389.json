different types of equity on the willingness of individuals within groups to behave cooperatively is not well-understood. In most social settings, the members of groups experience a variety of inequities which may or may not affect their willingness to accept social outcomes and/or cooperate to produce collective goods. This study investigates the relative strength of two particular forms of inequity on the acceptance of group outcomes and social cooperation: process equity and outcome equity. Process equity is obtained when all members of a group perceive that the process leading to social outcomes \u2014 however inequitable those outcomes might be \u2014 does not disadvantage any member of the process. More formally, a process is equitable if the expected value (this might be money, or something more amorphous like \u201cutility\u201d) of being part of the process is equal for all actors inside that process. Less formally, a process is equitable if everyone who is part of a given process has a \u201cfair shot\u201d at deriving value from the outcomes produced by the process. Outcome equity is obtained when all members of a group obtain the same outcomes or outcomes of equivalent value in more complex settings (again, this might be money or utility), regardless of the process that leads to those outcomes. More formally, the realized values that actors obtain from a process after its implementation are equal, whether or not expected values inside the process are equal. While previous studies have shown that both types of equity influence individual and group behavior, the relative strength of these forms of equity or inequity on social behavior and their interaction is difficult to investigate for a simple reason: equitable processes are likely to lead to more equitable outcomes, which makes it difficult to disentangle the relative importance of process versus outcomes for cooperation and the acceptance of group outcomes. This laboratory experiment parses the relative importance of process equity and outcome equity. It addresses whether an equitable process increases acceptance of inequitable outcomes and whether an inequitable process only impedes social cooperation to the extent that it produces inequitable outcomes. Our experiment aims to uncover when the promotion of process equity will be most important for ensuring acceptance of social outcomes and social cooperation. For this study, subjects will be randomly assigned into one of two simple lotteries, one with higher expected value than the other; a simulated opponent will automatically be placed into the other. Some subjects will be assigned to the better lottery based on a coin flip (equitable process) while others will be assigned based on a dice roll (inequitable process: 1 in 6 chance of being placed into the better lottery). Outcome equity will be observed as the relative earnings of the subject vs the opponent. Acceptance of outcomes will be tested by allowing the subjects to propose a redistribution of the total winnings between themselves and their opponents. After the lottery has played out, subjects will participate in a brief Prisoner's Dilemma game to assess how the lottery process and outcome affect their likelihood of social cooperation."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Redistribution hypotheses: Redistribution proposed by winners in an equitable process will be greater than that proposed by winners in an inequitable process.

(both of these will be tested separately) Difference in proposed redistribution between losing and tied participant in an inequitable process will be greater than that for participants in an equitable process. Social cooperation hypotheses: Cooperation rates will be greater for winners than for losers, regardless of process Cooperation rates will be greater for participants in an equitable process than for participants in an inequitable processes, regardless of outcome.

In most social settings, the members of groups experience a variety of inequities which may or may not affect their willingness to accept social outcomes and/or cooperate to produce collective goods. This study investigates the relative strength of two particular forms of inequity on the acceptance of group outcomes and social cooperation: process equity and outcome equity. Process equity is obtained when all members of a group perceive that the process leading to social outcomes \u2014 however inequitable those outcomes might be \u2014 does not disadvantage any member of the process. More formally, a process is equitable if the expected value (this might be money, or something more amorphous like \u201cutility\u201d) of being part of the process is equal for all actors inside that process. Less formally, a process is equitable if everyone who is part of a given process has a \u201cfair shot\u201d at deriving value from the outcomes produced by the process. Outcome equity is obtained when all members of a group obtain the same outcomes or outcomes of equivalent value in more complex settings (again, this might be money or utility), regardless of the process that leads to those outcomes. More formally, the realized values that actors obtain from a process after its implementation are equal, whether or not expected values inside the process are equal. While previous studies have shown that both types of equity influence individual and group behavior, the relative strength of these forms of equity or inequity on social behavior and their interaction is difficult to investigate for a simple reason: equitable processes are likely to lead to more equitable outcomes, which makes it difficult to disentangle the relative importance of process versus outcomes for cooperation and the acceptance of group outcomes. This laboratory experiment parses the relative importance of process equity and outcome equity. It addresses whether an equitable process increases acceptance of inequitable outcomes and whether an inequitable process only impedes social cooperation to the extent that it produces inequitable outcomes. Our experiment aims to uncover when the promotion of process equity will be most important for ensuring acceptance of social outcomes and social cooperation. For this study, subjects will be randomly assigned into one of two simple lotteries, one with higher expected value than the other; a simulated opponent will automatically be placed into the other. Some subjects will be assigned to the better lottery based on a coin flip (equitable process) while others will be assigned based on a dice roll (inequitable process: 1 in 6 chance of being placed into the better lottery). Outcome equity will be observed as the relative earnings of the subject vs the opponent. Acceptance of outcomes will be tested by allowing the subjects to propose a redistribution of the total winnings between themselves and their opponents. After the lottery has played out, subjects will participate in a brief Prisoner's Dilemma game to assess how the lottery process and outcome affect their likelihood of social cooperation.", "q16": "Redistribution hypotheses: Redistribution proposed by winners in an equitable process will be greater than that proposed by winners in an inequitable process.

partisan cues. Specifically, we investigate two issues where campaign statements by President Trump endorsed policies that were in contravention of existing U.S. international obligations: the use of torture in interrogation, and nationality-based restrictions on refugee admission. While existing studies have shown that messages highlighting that a policy violates international law tend to reduce support for that policy, they have typically considered international law cues in a vacuum. However, in the real world, individuals receive a variety of political cues from a wide array of sources. Particularly in the highly polarized context of U.S. politics, individual political attitudes are driven by partisanship and messages from party elites, and these cues often drown out any additional types of cues. We want to know whether international law cues become largely irrelevant when paired with partisan cues, or whether even co-partisans are hesitant to endorse policies that party leaders advocate when they know that these policies violate U.S. obligations."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "For both the torture and refugee policy topics, we plan to carry out a 2 x 2 experiment with four possible treatment conditions: exposure to no messages, exposure to a message highlighting the international law consequences of the policy, a message highlighting President Trump's campaign positions on the policy, or both messages. We have two hypotheses about main effects, one interaction hypotheses and one set of hypotheses about likely effect modifiers. First, we hypothesize that, on average, respondents exposed to the law treatment exclusively will be less likely to state that the U.S. should [use severe forms of detainee abuse in interrogation/limit the entry of refugees from certain countries] compared to those exposed to neither treatment. Second, we hypothesize that, on average, respondents exposed to the Trump treatment exclusively will be more likely to state that the U.S. should [use severe forms of detainee abuse in interrogation/limit the entry of refugees from certain countries] compared to those exposed to neither treatment. Third, we hypothesize that the effect of the Trump treatment alone relative to no treatment exposure will be greater than the joint effect of the Trump treatment relative to the law treatment exclusively -- that is, additional exposure to the law treatment moderates the Trump effect.

The hypotheses all correspond to differences in average potential outcomes, for which randomization yields unbiased and consistent estimators using sample averages among units assigned to the relevant treatment condition. To improve power, we block randomized treatment on pre-treatment strata defined by party ID, political ideology, and education. We use a stratified estimator for the treatment effect, first estimating the ATE within each stratum, and calculating the full sample ATE by taking a weighted average of these effects weighted by stratum sizes.

Specifically, we investigate two issues where campaign statements by President Trump endorsed policies that were in contravention of existing U.S. international obligations: the use of torture in interrogation, and nationality-based restrictions on refugee admission. While existing studies have shown that messages highlighting that a policy violates international law tend to reduce support for that policy, they have typically considered international law cues in a vacuum. However, in the real world, individuals receive a variety of political cues from a wide array of sources. Particularly in the highly polarized context of U.S. politics, individual political attitudes are driven by partisanship and messages from party elites, and these cues often drown out any additional types of cues. We want to know whether international law cues become largely irrelevant when paired with partisan cues, or whether even co-partisans are hesitant to endorse policies that party leaders advocate when they know that these policies violate U.S. obligations.", "q16": "For both the torture and refugee policy topics, we plan to carry out a 2 x 2 experiment with four possible treatment conditions: exposure to no messages, exposure to a message highlighting the international law consequences of the policy, a message highlighting President Trump's campaign positions on the policy, or both messages. We have two hypotheses about main effects, one interaction hypotheses and one set of hypotheses about likely effect modifiers. First, we hypothesize that, on average, respondents exposed to the law treatment exclusively will be less likely to state that the U.S. should [use severe forms of detainee abuse in interrogation/limit the entry of refugees from certain countries] compared to those exposed to neither treatment. Second, we hypothesize that, on average, respondents exposed to the Trump treatment exclusively will be more likely to state that the U.S. should [use severe forms of detainee abuse in interrogation/limit the entry of refugees from certain countries] compared to those exposed to neither treatment. Third, we hypothesize that the effect of the Trump treatment alone relative to no treatment exposure will be greater than the joint effect of the Trump treatment relative to the law treatment exclusively -- that is, additional exposure to the law treatment moderates the Trump effect. Finally, we hypothesize that the marginal Trump effect from hypothesis two, and the size of the interaction in the third hypothesis will be larger for Republicans than for Democrats -- that is, we predict effect modification on the baseline covariate of party ID.", "q17": "We will test each hypothesis by estimating the corresponding sample average treatment effects or differences in sample average treatment effects (formally defined in the pre-analysis plan), constructing 95% confidence intervals, and conducting two-sided hypothesis tests for the null of no effect/no difference at alpha = .05. The hypotheses all correspond to differences in average potential outcomes, for which randomization yields unbiased and consistent estimators using sample averages among units assigned to the relevant treatment condition. To improve power, we block randomized treatment on pre-treatment strata defined by party ID, political ideology, and education. We use a stratified estimator for the treatment effect, first estimating the ATE within each stratum, and calculating the full sample ATE by taking a weighted average of these effects weighted by stratum sizes. Likewise, we use a stratified estimator for the sampling variance as our block randomization approach likely reduces the sampling variance of the estimator compared to complete randomization due to

or obese (Le Nguyen, 2013). One important contributor is the lag in health-related knowledge and perceptions among the general population, compared with the speed of change in social and economic condition. The rise in the number of overweight children is disturbing because it causes health problems associated with obesity, which become obvious in adulthood. There is evidence in some developing countries that there is a perception in which being \u2018big\u2019 is seen as a sign of prosperity and good health (Poobalan & Aucott, 2016; Hoang et al., 2014; Rachmi et al., 2017; Esenay et al., 2010). The cultural perception that \u201cfat is prosperity\u201d is believed in because it would show your wealth through the fact that you have a lot to eat. (Hoang et al., 2014). This notion is said to be persisting in the Vietnamese culture for years as well (Do et al., 2016). Vietnamese mothers believe that a chubby child is a lovely and healthy child. While secondly, it make parents feel more secure when they have a chubby child. Vietnam underwent in the past long periods of war and famine, and most people, especially children, suffered from a lack of food resulting in high prevalence\u2019s of underweight in children over long periods of time, thinness therefore is still in many families, avoided. Diet is a major factor in the development of childhood overweight and obesity and children consumption depends strongly on the parent\u2019s knowledge and attitudes. The pursuit of a healthy diet for adults are associated with perception regarding food consumption, dieting behaviors, and preferred body size of most others. Despite its obvious significance, the number of study examine the severity of the epidemic is limited. Empirical evidence relating social norms on child's body size is scarce, especially within our population, relatively few studies have examined the association of this social norm with food choice, and findings are conflicting. Ultimately, to reduce problems with overweight and obesity, behavior changes need to be made, thereby altering the cultural perception that \u201cfat is prosperity\u201d is essential for curbing the rise in overweight and obesity. Investigating positive and negative influences regarding food choice stemming from the social environment is necessary, as it can provide a key to accelerate behavior changes by developing of culturally sensitive intervention projects designed to assist in weight reduction or the prevention of obesity in a setting in which this is a new and emerging problem.

One important contributor is the lag in health-related knowledge and perceptions among the general population, compared with the speed of change in social and economic condition. The rise in the number of overweight children is disturbing because it causes health problems associated with obesity, which become obvious in adulthood. There is evidence in some developing countries that there is a perception in which being \u2018big\u2019 is seen as a sign of prosperity and good health (Poobalan & Aucott, 2016; Hoang et al., 2014; Rachmi et al., 2017; Esenay et al., 2010). The cultural perception that \u201cfat is prosperity\u201d is believed in because it would show your wealth through the fact that you have a lot to eat. (Hoang et al., 2014). This notion is said to be persisting in the Vietnamese culture for years as well (Do et al., 2016). Vietnamese mothers believe that a chubby child is a lovely and healthy child. While secondly, it make parents feel more secure when they have a chubby child. Vietnam underwent in the past long periods of war and famine, and most people, especially children, suffered from a lack of food resulting in high prevalence\u2019s of underweight in children over long periods of time, thinness therefore is still in many families, avoided. Diet is a major factor in the development of childhood overweight and obesity and children consumption depends strongly on the parent\u2019s knowledge and attitudes. The pursuit of a healthy diet for adults are associated with perception regarding food consumption, dieting behaviors, and preferred body size of most others. Despite its obvious significance, the number of study examine the severity of the epidemic is limited. Empirical evidence relating social norms on child's body size is scarce, especially within our population, relatively few studies have examined the association of this social norm with food choice, and findings are conflicting. Ultimately, to reduce problems with overweight and obesity, behavior changes need to be made, thereby altering the cultural perception that \u201cfat is prosperity\u201d is essential for curbing the rise in overweight and obesity. Investigating positive and negative influences regarding food choice stemming from the social environment is necessary, as it can provide a key to accelerate behavior changes by developing of culturally sensitive intervention projects designed to assist in weight reduction or the prevention of obesity in a setting in which this is a new and emerging problem.

Unauthorized immigrants should be granted an opportunity to stay in the country. (R) Muslim Affect A 100-point feeling thermometer measuring negative affect toward Muslims. (R) Muslim Policy Attitudes Scale 1. The United States government should institute a ban on Muslims entering the country. 2. The United States government should take a more active role in protecting Muslims from discrimination. (R) 3. United States government officials should be more vocal in condemning anti-Muslim hate crimes and violence. (R) Black Affect A 100-point feeling thermometer measuring negative affect toward blacks. (reversed) Essay Correction Binary outcome variable measuring whether the subject actually changed the text of their essay following the correction. Statistical Analyses (H1) Corrections will have an effect on attitudes toward target groups. For those who receive a language correction in the immigration essay: Immigration Policy Attitudes = b0 + b1 Correction Immigrant Affect = b0 + b1 Correction For those who receive a language correction in the terrorism essay: Muslim Policy Attitudes = b0 + b1 Correction Muslim Affect = b0 + b1 Correction For all subjects: Black Affect = b0 + b1 Correction There is not enough research on language corrections to specify a direction, therefore two-tailed tests will be used. I do not expect the effect of the corrections to transfer onto non-target groups, therefore b0 should zero in the Black Affect model. (H2) The effects of corrections will be strengthened by strong encouragements to use new political terms. For those who receive a language correction in the immigration essay: Immigration Policy Attitudes = b0 + b1 Correction + b2 Encouragement + b3 Correction x Encouragement Immigrant Affect = b0 + b1 Correction + b2 Encouragement + b3 Correction x Encouragement For those who receive a language correction in the terrorism essay: Muslim Attitudes = b0 + b1 Correction + b2 Encouragement + b3 Correction x Encouragement Muslim Affect = b0 + b1 Correction + b2 Encouragement + b3 Correction x Encouragement For all subjects: Black Affect = b0 + b1 Correction + b2 Encouragement + b3 Correction x Encouragement There is not enough research on language corrections to specify a direction, therefore two-tailed tests will be used. I do not expect the effect of the corrections and encouragement to alter text to transfer onto non-target groups, therefore b0 should zero in the Black Affect model. (H3) If corrections are ideologically consistent, subjects will change the terms they use. Otherwise, corrections will have no effect. Ideology will be measured using a seven-point scale ranging from Extremely Liberal to Extremely Conservative. For those who receive a language correction in the immigration essay: Immigration Attitudes = b0 + b1 Correction + b2 Ideology + b3 Correction x Ideology Immigrant Affect = b0 + b1 Correction + b2 Ideology + b3 Correction x Ideology Given that liberals tend to hold more positive attitudes toward immigration, I expect b3 < 0. For those who receive a language correction in the terrorism essay: Muslim Attitudes = b0 + b1 Correction+ b2 Ideology + b3 Correction x Ideology Muslim Affect = b0 + b1 Correction+ b2 Ideology + b3 Correction x Ideology Given that conservatives tend to hold more negative attitudes toward Muslims, I expect b3 < 0. Notes: All models will be estimated using OLS regression. Robustness checks using the binning estimator proposed by Hainmueller, Mummolo, and Xu (2016) will also be conducted. Additional analyses might examine effects among different sub-groups (e.g. race).
