"registration_supplement": "Open-Ended Registration", "registered_meta": {"summary": {"extra": [], "value": "# Main questions\n\n\nThis experiment follows Experiment 1 that tested proportions and visual distinctness. The present experiment aims to test semantic relevance (and direction), as well as a repeated testing of visual distinctness.\n\nThe semantic relevance of fillers will be tested by switching the required response keys for familiar- vs. unfamiliar fillers. That is, one condition will be as usual (familiar fillers categorized together with targets, unfamiliar opposite), but in another condition the familiar fillers will have to be categorized together with the probe and irrelevant items, while unfamiliar fillers have to be categorized together with the target. We assume that switching the response keys will substantially decrease probe-minus-irrelevant differences. This would prove that (a) the familiarity-related meaning of fillers matters, since otherwise the direction could not matter, and (b) that direction matters, too (since, otherwise, one may argue that the mere presence of familiarity-relatedness has an effect).\n\nThe visual distinctness was tested in Experiment 1, and here we test it further in a slightly different way: In Experiment 1, the fillers changed between uppercase and lowercase, while here the main items (probe, irrelevant, target) will change between uppercase and lowercase. Furthermore, to further increase visual distinctness, fillers will be either underlined or not underlined, in different blocks. (These factors will all be tested within-subject, without changing filler proportion as in Experiment 1, where the (carry-over) effects may have to some extent interfered with this factor.)\n\nImportantly, we are not interested in the interaction between these two factors, the experiment includes both factors at the same time simply to be economical. Since one factor is within-subject, and the other is between-subjects, they will not interfere with each other.\n\n# Experimental design\n\nSame as in Experiment 1, only Knowledgeable conditions will be run (i.e., the probes are known to all participants, simulating guilt). \n\nThere will be one between-subjects factor of \u201cfiller direction\u201d: fillers in \u201cnormal direction\u201d (familiar filler together with target) vs. filler in \u201creverse direction\u201d, that is, with reversed response keys (familiar opposite to target). In both conditions, the ratio will be kept the same (three fillers together with target, six fillers opposite to target). (There will be a fix group of six words for familiar and unfamiliar fillers. When six is needed \u2013 categorized opposite of target \u2013 all six used are from either category. When only three is needed \u2013 categorized together with target \u2013 the three will always be randomly chosen from the given group of six words.) \n\nFurthermore, there will be two within-subject factors, both regarding visual distinctness, each with two levels: Lettercase (lowercase vs. uppercase main items) and Underlining (underlined vs. not underlined fillers). Each participant will be tested in four blocks (always with country of origin as probe): The first two blocks will both have either underlined or not underlined fillers; whereas the last two blocks will both have the reverse proportion. The main item lettercase will alternate per each block: e.g., first lowercase, then uppercase, then again lowercase, then again uppercase \u2013 otherwise the reverse (first uppercase, then lowercase, etc.). The orders (for either factor) are assigned randomly.\n\n# Participants\n\nData will be collected online: First, 120 slots will be opened on the Figure Eight platform. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups.\n\nIf the Bayes factor for the test between \u201cnormal direction\u201d and \u201creverse direction\u201d conditions for reaction time (RT) mean probe-irrelevant differences (see below) does not reach a minimum of 5 in either direction (i.e., technically below at least 1/5 when supporting null hypothesis), 60 additional slots will be opened (allowing participants in both conditions). The addition will be repeated until all likelihood ratios reach at least 5 or until a maximum of 120 valid (i.e., not excluded, see below) completed tests are reached or passed for each of the two conditions.\n\nOtherwise, if the Bayes factor for either of the two Visual Distinctness main effects (Lettercase or Underlining) in the related analysis of variance (ANOVA) for RT mean probe-irrelevant differences (see below) does not reach a minimum of 5 in either direction (i.e., technically below at least 1/5 when supporting null hypothesis), 30 additional slots will be opened in the \u201cnormal direction\u201d condition only.

The present experiment aims to test semantic relevance (and direction), as well as a repeated testing of visual distinctness.\n\nThe semantic relevance of fillers will be tested by switching the required response keys for familiar- vs. unfamiliar fillers. That is, one condition will be as usual (familiar fillers categorized together with targets, unfamiliar opposite), but in another condition the familiar fillers will have to be categorized together with the probe and irrelevant items, while unfamiliar fillers have to be categorized together with the target. We assume that switching the response keys will substantially decrease probe-minus-irrelevant differences. This would prove that (a) the familiarity-related meaning of fillers matters, since otherwise the direction could not matter, and (b) that direction matters, too (since, otherwise, one may argue that the mere presence of familiarity-relatedness has an effect).\n\nThe visual distinctness was tested in Experiment 1, and here we test it further in a slightly different way: In Experiment 1, the fillers changed between uppercase and lowercase, while here the main items (probe, irrelevant, target) will change between uppercase and lowercase. Furthermore, to further increase visual distinctness, fillers will be either underlined or not underlined, in different blocks. (These factors will all be tested within-subject, without changing filler proportion as in Experiment 1, where the (carry-over) effects may have to some extent interfered with this factor.)\n\nImportantly, we are not interested in the interaction between these two factors, the experiment includes both factors at the same time simply to be economical. Since one factor is within-subject, and the other is between-subjects, they will not interfere with each other.\n\n# Experimental design\n\nSame as in Experiment 1, only Knowledgeable conditions will be run (i.e., the probes are known to all participants, simulating guilt). \n\nThere will be one between-subjects factor of \u201cfiller direction\u201d: fillers in \u201cnormal direction\u201d (familiar filler together with target) vs. filler in \u201creverse direction\u201d, that is, with reversed response keys (familiar opposite to target). In both conditions, the ratio will be kept the same (three fillers together with target, six fillers opposite to target). (There will be a fix group of six words for familiar and unfamiliar fillers. When six is needed \u2013 categorized opposite of target \u2013 all six used are from either category. When only three is needed \u2013 categorized together with target \u2013 the three will always be randomly chosen from the given group of six words.) \n\nFurthermore, there will be two within-subject factors, both regarding visual distinctness, each with two levels: Lettercase (lowercase vs. uppercase main items) and Underlining (underlined vs. not underlined fillers). Each participant will be tested in four blocks (always with country of origin as probe): The first two blocks will both have either underlined or not underlined fillers; whereas the last two blocks will both have the reverse proportion. The main item lettercase will alternate per each block: e.g., first lowercase, then uppercase, then again lowercase, then again uppercase \u2013 otherwise the reverse (first uppercase, then lowercase, etc.). The orders (for either factor) are assigned randomly.\n\n# Participants\n\nData will be collected online: First, 120 slots will be opened on the Figure Eight platform. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups.\n\nIf the Bayes factor for the test between \u201cnormal direction\u201d and \u201creverse direction\u201d conditions for reaction time (RT) mean probe-irrelevant differences (see below) does not reach a minimum of 5 in either direction (i.e., technically below at least 1/5 when supporting null hypothesis), 60 additional slots will be opened (allowing participants in both conditions). The addition will be repeated until all likelihood ratios reach at least 5 or until a maximum of 120 valid (i.e., not excluded, see below) completed tests are reached or passed for each of the two conditions.\n\nOtherwise, if the Bayes factor for either of the two Visual Distinctness main effects (Lettercase or Underlining) in the related analysis of variance (ANOVA) for RT mean probe-irrelevant differences (see below) does not reach a minimum of 5 in either direction (i.e., technically below at least 1/5 when supporting null hypothesis), 30 additional slots will be opened in the \u201cnormal direction\u201d condition only. The addition will be repeated until all likelihood ratios reach at least 5 or until a maximum of 120 valid (i.e., not excluded, see below) completed tests are reached or passed for this condition.\n\n# Exclusions\n\nThose participants who do not select their true country of origin correctly in a final check at the end of the RT-Concealed Information Test (CIT) will be excluded. (In the actual task, a second attempt for correct selection is allowed for exploratory purposes, but failure for the first time already means exclusion in the present analysis.)

and an SD derived from the real data (from each condition) as real_SD * 0.5 + 7 (ms).\n", "uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href":

unfamiliar-referring filler items (i.e., more familiar-referring vs. more unfamiliar-referring) in the RT-CIT influence the outcome (probe-irrelevant differences). The smaller proportion (3:6) of familiar- relative to unfamiliar-referring items in the original task (Luk\u00e1cs, Kleinberg, &amp; Verschuere, 2017) was intended to keep to \u201ctarget-side\u201d items (i.e., the target and items to be categorized with the same key as the target) less frequent than the rest of the items, hence, keeping the uniqueness of the target (or all target-side items). This uniqueness (or \u201cpop-out\u201d) of target-referring items is assumed to be a factor in eliciting response conflict in case of, in this respect similar, probes among the irrelevant items (Luk\u00e1cs &amp; Ansorge, 2019, ACP), thereby, contributing to larger probe-irrelevant differences. Nonetheless, it is also theoretically possible that these familiarity-related fillers play no role in the subjective \u201ctarget-nontarget\u201d categorization of examinees, but instead play a separate role in the \u201cfamiliar-unfamiliar\u201d dimension only. We therefore compare the original, 3:6 familiar:unfamiliar version with a version with a reverse proportion (larger, 6:3, proportion of familiar- to unfamiliar-referring items) to the original version.\n\nRelatedly, we also examine whether visually more distinct fillers (lowercase as opposed to uppercase main [probe, target, irrelevant] items) influence the outcome (see Luk\u00e1cs et al. 2019; APB). Firstly, if the visual distinction separates the two tasks from the participants\u2019 perspective, it could replace other, more semantic distinctions and the proportion should matter less: that is, a Distinctness x Proportion interaction would be found with smaller difference between different proportions (more familiar or less familiar fillers) when the fillers are visually distinct (i.e., presented in lowercase). Secondly, the larger visual distinction between the two item categories may lead to more distinct attention to each of these two separate (though alternating) tasks (target-nontarget main items, and familiar-unfamiliar fillers), and thereby increase probe versus irrelevant effect sizes (as well as, incidentally, familiar versus unfamiliar filler effect sizes).\n\n# Experimental design\n\nIn this experiment, only Knowledgeable conditions will be run (i.e., the probes are known to all participants, simulating guilt). There will be two within-subject factors, each with two levels: Proportion (less familiar-referring fillers versus more familiar-referring fillers) and Distinctness (lowercase fillers versus uppercase fillers; while main items are always uppercase as it is conventional). Each participant will be tested in four blocks (always with country of origin as probe): The first two blocks will both have either larger proportion or smaller proportion of familiar-referring fillers; whereas the last two blocks will both have the reverse proportion. The filler lettercase will alternate per each block: e.g., first lowercase, then uppercase, then again lowercase, then again uppercase \u2013 otherwise the reverse (first uppercase, then lowercase, etc.). The orders (for either factor) are assigned randomly.\n\n# Participants\n\nData will be collected online: first, 60 slots will be opened on the Figure Eight platform. \nIf the Bayes factor for any of the effects (either of two main effects or the interaction) in the main ANOVA for RT mean probe-irrelevant differences (see below) does not reach a minimum of 5 in either direction (i.e., technically below at least 1/5 when supporting null hypothesis), 30 additional slots will be opened. This addition will be repeated until all likelihood ratios reach at least 5 or until a maximum of 120 valid completed tests are reached or passed.\n\n# Exclusions\n\nThose participants who do not select their true country of origin correctly in a final check at the end of the RT-CIT will be excluded. (In the actual task a second attempt for correct selection is allowed for exploratory purposes, but failure for the first time already means exclusion in the present analysis.) Similarly as in our most recent studies: We will exclude all participants with accuracy rate for the main items (probes and irrelevants merged) not higher than 75%, and with accuracy rate not higher than 50% for any of the following item types: (1) target items, (2) self-referring fillers, (3) other-referring fillers.\n\nFor all further analysis, responses below 150 ms will be excluded. For RT analysis, only correctly responded to trials will be used (i.e., we exclude all trials with incorrect or too slow responses). For keypress duration analysis only, keypress durations longer than 200 ms will be excluded.\n\n# Main analysis\n\nThe main test will be a 2 by 2 ANOVA for the probe-irrelevant response time (RT) mean differences (mean probe RT minus mean irrelevant RT; using all valid, correct trials), with appropriate follow-up t-tests. We report Bayes factors for the ANOVA (inclusion BF based on matched models) as well as the t-tests (with the default r-scale of 0.707).\n\n# Secondary analysis\n\nSame as for RTs, we also perform the ANOVA for probe-irrelevant differences in accuracy rate (ratio of correct responses to correct, incorrect, and too slow responses), and for keypress durations.\n\nTo calculate illustrative areas under curves (AUCs) for probe-irrelevant mean RT differences as predictors, we will simulate control groups, for the real RT data from each of the four possible conditions, using 1,000 near-perfectly distributed values with a mean of zero and an SD derived from the real data (from each condition) as real_SD * 0.5 + 7 (ms).\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"summary": "# Main questions\n\nThis experiment tests whether different proportions of familiar- and unfamiliar-referring filler items (i.e., more familiar-referring vs. more unfamiliar-referring) in the RT-CIT influence the outcome (probe-irrelevant differences).

broadly.  One issue within this line of research that has received little attention, however, is the heterogeneity in researchers\u2019 conceptualizations of mind wandering. Many researchers differ in their definitions of mind wandering and, naturally, construct thought sampling probes aimed at measuring rates of mind wandering according to their held definitions. In spite of this, researchers tend to cite findings from studies on mind wandering assuming they all refer to the same phenomenon. The present study aims to test this assumption. In this study, participants completed a SART containing thought probes taken from three of the most commonly cited papers on mind wandering.
