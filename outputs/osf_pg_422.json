The education metrics are school pass rates from standardized test scores. We model our experiments for negativity bias and leftmost-digit bias on the work of Olsen (2015 and 2013, respectively). In our tests of historical and social comparisons, every respondent sees the same pass rate (the rates are different for English and Math) but is then randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups for each exam. In the case of the historical comparison respondents see that the test score increased or decreased from the year before. For the social comparisons they see that their score is either above or below the median for comparable schools. We base our overconfidence tests on Merkle and Weber (2011).

H2a: The leftmost-digit bias of performance assessments will be more pronounced for public sector employees when asked to assess their own performance compared to when they are asked to assess the performance of the organization in which they work. Overconfidence \u2013 overestimation H3: When asked to provide performance assessments, public sector employees will overestimate performance as the values of the metrics used to make that assessment increase.

H4a: When asked to indicate their confidence with a performance assessment they previously gave, public sector employees will be overly precise in that confidence as the values of their assessment increase. H4b: When asked to indicate their confidence with a performance assessment they previously gave, the overprecision bias will be more pronounced among public sector employees in their assessments of themselves than in the assessments of the organization for which they work. Overconfidence \u2013 Above average effect (organizations) H5: When asked to compare the organization for which they work to similar organizations, public sector employees will evidence an above-average-effect. H5a: When comparing the organization for which they work to similar organizations, the overconfidence bias will be more pronounced as the values of the metrics used to make a performance assessment increase. H5b: When comparing the organization for which they work to similar organizations, the overconfidence bias will be more pronounced as the values of their performance assessments increase. Overconfidence \u2013 Above average effect (self) H6: When asked to compare their own performance to workers in similar positions, public sector employees will evidence an above-average-effect. H6a: When asked to compare their own performance to workers in similar positions, the overconfidence bias will be more pronounced as the values of the metrics used to make a performance assessment increase. H6b: When asked to compare their own performance to workers in similar positions, the overconfidence bias will be more pronounced as the values of their performance assessments increase. H7: When provided qualitatively similar performance information, the overconfidence effect will be more pronounced in public sector employees when asked to assess their own performance than when asked to assess the performance of the organization for which they work. Comparison: Historical comparisons \u2013 H8: When asked to assess performance information, public sector employees will provide higher (lower) performance assessments when told that relevant performance metrics increased (decreased) over the last year. Social comparisons - H9: When asked to assess performance information, public sector employees will provide higher (lower) performance assessments when shown that relevant performance metrics were above (below) the median of comparable organizations. H10: The social comparison bias will be more pronounced than the historical comparison bias.", "q17": "In this study we use survey experiments to test a number of hypotheses that come out of the behavioral perspective: negativity bias; leftmost-digit bias; historical and social comparisons; and three types of overconfidence: overestimation, overprecision, and above-average-effect. Our experiments use readily identifiable performance metrics that come from city management and education. The city management metrics come from the KCStat Dashboard (https://kcstat.kcmo.org/). The education metrics are school pass rates from standardized test scores. We model our experiments for negativity bias and leftmost-digit bias on the work of Olsen (2015 and 2013, respectively). In our tests of historical and social comparisons, every respondent sees the same pass rate (the rates are different for English and Math) but is then randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups for each exam. In the case of the historical comparison respondents see that the test score increased or decreased from the year before. For the social comparisons they see that their score is either above or below the median for comparable schools. We base our overconfidence tests on Merkle and Weber (2011). The population of interest is public managers. We are also generally interested in public sector employees. We will run at least one pilot study using public sector employees (but not necessarily managers) as respondents through Turk Prime.

Whether this sorting is the consequence of history or individual choice, this perspective assumes that population density is simply correlated with features of both people and place that meaningfully inform political attitudes. However, this account neglects a perhaps more fundamental story about the role of context: do liberals and conservatives differ in their preferences for density itself? Drawing on psychological models of conservatism, I suggest that individuals differ in their preference for and tolerance of population density -- defined as the rate of contact with strangers \u2013 and that these differences vary meaningfully with political orientation. Research on context suggest that individuals are sensitive to the distribution of other people in space (Enos, 2017) and that this is consequential to social and political attitudes. Cities, as complex environments, may be perceived as threatening due to high rates of contact with strangers and features of urban spaces (Milgram, 1970). This is consistent with findings that social and political conservatism is associated with greater need for order and lower tolerance for ambiguity (Jost et al., 2003), preserving social and cultural norms and maintaining the status quo (Schwartz, 1992), and preference for in-group members (Enke, 2018). In this study, I will explore whether a \u201cpure\u201d effect of density can be identified, specifically the extent to which liberals and conservatives differ in their response to density itself rather than correlated characteristics of spatial context."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "I will if whether liberals and conservatives respond differently to exposure to density. Specifically, I hypothesize that conservatives will exhibit greater anxiety under high-density than low-density relative to political liberals, and will be less likely to contribute to a common pool relative to liberals, after exposure to density."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "I will test this hypothesis with a \u201clab-in-the-field\u201d design, taking advantage of natural variation in density that occurs with the arrival of a subway train. Subjects will be recruited via Craigslist and Facebook ads targeted to the general Boston metro area and surrounding communities. Participants will be assigned to study sessions in pairs of liberals and conservatives, matched on where they live and individual covariates. A pair of subjects will be randomly assigned to a 20-minute block of time within the hour period they are assigned. For each study session, participants will meet a research assistant at a designated MBTA station, where they will complete a pre-treatment survey and the research assistant will attach a physiological sensor to their fingers and wrist, to record skin conductance and heart rate. Participants will be brought into the station mezzanine where they will stand for ten minutes. During that ten minutes, another research assistant will be recording the number of people who pass the research subjects at each moment in time. Treatment is defined by the arrival of a subway train, and the subsequent change in density (or rate of strangers) as people exit through the station mezzanine. This is a within-subjects design, and physiological responses will be compared under low-density and high-density conditions for each subject. Treatment periods will be defined by the change in density that occurs with the arrival of an outbound train. The timing of this treatment during the measurement period (the arrival of a train) is assumed to be `\u201das-if\" random -- for a given ten-minute period, there is relatively equal probability of a train arriving during any minute of a given ten-minute period, and the timing of a train's arrival is unlikely to be correlated with any characteristics of the subject. There are two primary dependent measures: First, skin conductance and heart rate will be measured continuously throughout the measurement period. Skin conductance is perhaps the most frequently used physiological measure across social science studies, to measure anxiety and other emotional responses (Figner and Murphy, 2011; Boucsein, 2012), and will be the primary focus on my analysis, but collecting two physiological measures is standard practice in studies that use these types of measures. Second, I will measure how pro-sociality changes in response to density, conditional on political ideology. All participants will complete an allocation task in which they are given the choice of how to distribute $7 between themselves and a common pool, which will be double and evenly divided among all participants. They will complete this task at two points in time: upon recruitment and after they have been exposed to density inside the station, at the conclusion of the experiment. The quantity of interest is the change in how much each participant gives to the common pool between pre- and post-treatment. All quantities of interest are the interaction between density and political ideology, or the conditional average treatment effect of density among conservatives. All test are within-subjects: I will calculate a change score for each individual from low-density to high-density or between pre- and post-treatment, and take the mean difference between liberals and conservatives to derive the CATE for conservatives. I will conduct hypothesis tests using permutation inference to determine whether the difference in CATEs for liberals and conservatives could have occurred by chance. I will also use pre-treatment covariates in regression-based estimates and subset by the density level of participants' home communities to see if these results hold for different groups."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "United States"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "12/20/18"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e38683bfa39b701761dd399", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/xjrd5/providers/osfstorage/5e38683bfa39b701761dd399", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/xjrd5/providers/osfstorage/5e38683bfa39b701761dd399", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/xjrd5/providers/osfstorage/5e38683bfa39b701761dd399?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/xjrd5/providers/osfstorage/5e38683bfa39b701761dd399"}, "attributes": {"etag": "2fc017d8ac2805c2113a4200939bd92477d7bc4f6107b8ca66ca1e1838fac41b", "kind": "file", "name": "20190304AA_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e38683bfa39b701761dd399", "size": 835437, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "c6a0ee02c4283b2788e54445de502067", "sha256": "ce861f2a43da37ab7f49f46e24a39019393e408bb69213e106d410c74fe6d538"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 835437, "modified": "2020-02-03T18:36:43.337037+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "xjrd5", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20190304AA_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T18:36:43+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "xjrd5", "sha256": "ce861f2a43da37ab7f49f46e24a39019393e408bb69213e106d410c74fe6d538", "viewUrl": "/project/tyc92/files/osfstorage/5e38684357427b01830c56df/", "selectedFileName": "20190304AA_PAP.pdf"}, {"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e38683f57427b01770c4ae3", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/xjrd5/providers/osfstorage/5e38683f57427b01770c4ae3", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/xjrd5/providers/osfstorage/5e38683f57427b01770c4ae3", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/xjrd5/providers/osfstorage/5e38683f57427b01770c4ae3?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/xjrd5/providers/osfstorage/5e38683f57427b01770c4ae3"}, "attributes": {"etag": "c389f24ace2a81b75e520faf76014ec8086c3f5270b2f892301a8fa1bad5062f", "kind": "file", "name": "20190304AA_survey.pdf", "path": "/5e38683f57427b01770c4ae3", "size": 270723, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "2f7af2242fd9d594f31be314e33d19d9", "sha256": "616672009310d9a43224f12bca1af190b363b021028c22580c24533893fbe861"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 270723, "modified": "2020-02-03T18:36:47.769956+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "xjrd5", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20190304AA_survey.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T18:36:47+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "xjrd5", "sha256": "616672009310d9a43224f12bca1af190b363b021028c22580c24533893fbe861", "viewUrl": "/project/tyc92/files/osfstorage/5e38684357427b01830c56dd/", "selectedFileName": "20190304AA_survey.pdf"}], "value": "20190304AA_PAP.pdf, 20190304AA_survey.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Does density matter to selection?
