This lack of knowledge can affect the average citizen's ability to position herself in relation to questions that affect her and are debated in everyday politics. Another consequence of this lack of information is that voters are, in general, ambivalent about various matters and have opinions that are inconsistent over time (Zaller & Feldman, 1992). As a result, the concepts of \"right\" and \"left\" seem to make little sense for the vast majority of citizens (Converse, 1964; Oliveira & Turgeon, 2015). Some authors argue that political knowledge contributes to the structure and organization of individuals' preferences (Converse, 1964). In other words, people who are more informed about politics tend to have preferences that are more consistent with ideologies in that their attitudes about different topics are correlated with one another. Intelligence and motivation are also determinants of ideology (Luskin, 1990), as well as signals sent by political elites to voters (Layman et al., 2006). In the Brazilian case, studying the political knowledge of citizens and their ideological positioning has become more important recently because of the current political crisis. Some authors (Couto, 2014; Cavalcante, 2015) argue that Brazil has been going through a process of political radicalization, with the rise to prominence of a new right that is more conservative and radical. The intensity of partisan conflict in the streets and in Congress has particularly given rise to a perception in the media that Brazilian politics is becoming more polarized; the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, the conviction of ex-President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and the campaign to impeach Rousseff's successor as president, Michel Temer, have all seen the widespread mobilization of protests in the streets. However, other authors have pointed out evidence that the large majority of Brazilian voters, especially those who make up the \"new middle class,\" have remained moderate and indifferent about many political issues (Borges & Vidigal, 2016; Renn\u00f3 & Turgeon, 2016). Given these two competing backgrounds, we aim to determine how extensive polarization really is in Brazil, and what seems to be causing it. Is Brazil seeing a true ideological polarization, a deeper polarization of values (see Jacoby 2013), or simply the intensification of an affective polarization that is unrelated to other, deeper issues?"}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "We aim to test the hypothesis that the primary reason for the appearance of polarization in contemporary Brazil is affective, primarily a lack of trust between opposing camps. We first aim to determine, with survey data, if the ideological consistency of the Brazilian electorate has increased over the past 14 years. Have opposing camps become more radical--less centrist--in terms of ideological beliefs? We expect to find that they have not. We then aim to determine if the polarization is affective. Do opposing camps simply mistrust others, even in situations completely devoid of political ideology, if they know they support the other side? We test this with a novel experimental idea. We expect to find that this indeed is the case."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "Our first hypothesis--that perceptions of increasing polarization are unrelated to ideological radicalization--through a statistical analysis of survey data between 2002 and 2016. We will look to determine whether positions on key ideological issues--accounting for control variables--are indeed becoming further apart and more consistent among supporters of the two main political parties in Brazil, the PT and the PSDB. Our second hypothesis will be tested with an experiment using a commercially-available board game titled The Resistance: Avalon. Players are randomly (and secretly) divided into two camps in Avalon: agents of Good and Evil. Players on the side of Good must complete tasks by assembling task forces that only include players from their side. Players on the side of Evil must find a way to infiltrate these task forces by winning the trust of other players and convincing them that they are on the side of Good. The side of Good wins if they successfully complete their tasks 3 out of 5 times, while the side of Evil wins if they do not. We test our hypothesis that trust is low between PT and PSDB supporters, independent of ideology, by having subjects play this trust-based board game. Subjects will be groups composed entirely of self-identified PT supporters or self-identified PSDB supporters. Control groups play this game normally, while treatment groups will have a confederate dressed in clothing that identifies herself as being a supporter of the opposite group (PSDB for groups of PT supporters, and PT for groups of PSDB supporters). This person will undertake no other action out of the ordinary for a player of the game, and will play it normally. We will measure the number of times the confederate is included in the task forces in a given game, with the hypothesis that she will be included in significantly fewer in treatment groups than in control groups. Given that the treatment is naturally randomized in the game, the only factor affecting the inclusion of the player in the task force should be the treatment: identifying with a different political party than the other players."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Brazil"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design", "Lab Experiments", "Mixed Method"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Conflict and Violence", "Development", "Elections"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "\"Seu petralha!

This lack of knowledge can affect the average citizen's ability to position herself in relation to questions that affect her and are debated in everyday politics. Another consequence of this lack of information is that voters are, in general, ambivalent about various matters and have opinions that are inconsistent over time (Zaller & Feldman, 1992). As a result, the concepts of \"right\" and \"left\" seem to make little sense for the vast majority of citizens (Converse, 1964; Oliveira & Turgeon, 2015). Some authors argue that political knowledge contributes to the structure and organization of individuals' preferences (Converse, 1964). In other words, people who are more informed about politics tend to have preferences that are more consistent with ideologies in that their attitudes about different topics are correlated with one another. Intelligence and motivation are also determinants of ideology (Luskin, 1990), as well as signals sent by political elites to voters (Layman et al., 2006). In the Brazilian case, studying the political knowledge of citizens and their ideological positioning has become more important recently because of the current political crisis. Some authors (Couto, 2014; Cavalcante, 2015) argue that Brazil has been going through a process of political radicalization, with the rise to prominence of a new right that is more conservative and radical. The intensity of partisan conflict in the streets and in Congress has particularly given rise to a perception in the media that Brazilian politics is becoming more polarized; the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, the conviction of ex-President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and the campaign to impeach Rousseff's successor as president, Michel Temer, have all seen the widespread mobilization of protests in the streets. However, other authors have pointed out evidence that the large majority of Brazilian voters, especially those who make up the \"new middle class,\" have remained moderate and indifferent about many political issues (Borges & Vidigal, 2016; Renn\u00f3 & Turgeon, 2016). Given these two competing backgrounds, we aim to determine how extensive polarization really is in Brazil, and what seems to be causing it. Is Brazil seeing a true ideological polarization, a deeper polarization of values (see Jacoby 2013), or simply the intensification of an affective polarization that is unrelated to other, deeper issues?", "q16": "We aim to test the hypothesis that the primary reason for the appearance of polarization in contemporary Brazil is affective, primarily a lack of trust between opposing camps. We first aim to determine, with survey data, if the ideological consistency of the Brazilian electorate has increased over the past 14 years. Have opposing camps become more radical--less centrist--in terms of ideological beliefs? We expect to find that they have not. We then aim to determine if the polarization is affective. Do opposing camps simply mistrust others, even in situations completely devoid of political ideology, if they know they support the other side? We test this with a novel experimental idea. We expect to find that this indeed is the case.", "q17": "Our first hypothesis--that perceptions of increasing polarization are unrelated to ideological radicalization--through a statistical analysis of survey data between 2002 and 2016.

Media coverage in the U.S. is at best loosely related to local crime conditions (Graber, 1980; Lowry, Nio and Leitner, 2003) and often reinforces stereotypes of black criminality (Gilliam et al., 1996; Grabe and Bucy, 2009). Yet the growing availability of video footage of citizens interactions with the police, recorded by both individuals and police departments, may fundamentally change this process. By providing a more direct account of what happened, these videos may lead citizen to rely less their on preconceived notions of race and crime and make them more likely to agree on what happened and what \ufb02aws exist in the current system. In this study, we explore the consequences of viewing instances of police brutality on citizens attitudes about crime, justice, and politics more generally, in two ways. First, we explore the extent to which evaluations of the same unedited police body-worn camera footage of tra\ufb03c stop that resulted in a citizen\u2019s complaint can be in\ufb02uenced by changing the justi\ufb01cation and result of the release of that footage.

We do so by manipulating the text of three written news articles, and the video of a local broadcast news clip of the event. Additionally, a \ufb01nal pure control group of participants read a non-political news article about severe weather in the Midwest to allow us to assess the e\ufb00ects of viewing this footage on broader attitudes about the criminal justice system"}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "This study examines three main questions. First, are interpretations of the direct footage of a citizen-police encounter provided by a body worn camera in\ufb02uenced by the justi\ufb01cation for the release of the footage\u2013speci\ufb01cally whether the footage is said to con\ufb01rm, refute or provide no information to charge of o\ufb03cer behavior.

Generally speaking, the treatments consist of both raw body camera footage and slightly altered news coverage (both televison and newspaper) of a traffic stop in Memphis, TN. We use these treatments to test the following hypotheses: Hypothesis 0. Interpretations independent of justi\ufb01cation for release of body camera footage Hypothesis 1. Interpretation consistent with justi\ufb01cation for release of body camera footage Hypothesis 2. Interpretation consistent with justi\ufb01cation for release of body camera footage conditional on prior beliefs Hypothesis 3. Interpretation counter to justi\ufb01cation for release of body camera footage conditional on prior beliefs Our general expectations with regard to these hypotheses are as follows. If police body camera footage provides a purely objective view of an interaction, than it is possible that respondents will be unmoved by the manipulation of the justi\ufb01cation for the footage of the release or by the format in which this footage is presented (H0). We think this is unlikely and instead expect interpretation in the con\ufb01rmation and refutation treatments to di\ufb00er from condition in which no justi\ufb01cation is given. As for the direction of those di\ufb00erences, we believe this pattern of response further depends on the format of the footage and the beliefs of those viewing it. We suspect that the \u201cobjective\u201d nature of the unedited body camera footage will make evidence of interpretations consistent with the framing (H1, H2) more likely than interpretations counter to the framing (H3). Further it seems likely that magnitude of these e\ufb00ects will be concentrated among respondents for whom the footage would seem to provide new information (H2). In contrast, we suspect that when this footage is presented as part of a news segment that may format activate familiar scripts about race and crime making a pattern of response of counter arguing the justi\ufb01cation more likely (H3). We believe prior beliefs will shape the interpretation of this footage. Such beliefs are likely intertwined with the race of our respondents. We will conduct our tests separately for groups that objective indicators such as rates of incarceration suggest are relatively advantaged (Whites and Asians) and disadvantaged (Blacks and Latinos) within the current criminal justice system. In this analysis we expect that that the relative e\ufb00ectiveness of the justi\ufb01cation framing may di\ufb00er by group and prior beliefs. Thus, Blacks and Latinos, who are more likely to hold negative beliefs about the general fairness of the police, may be more more response responsive to the con\ufb01rmation framing (H1, H2) and more likely to counter argue the refutation framing (H3). In contrasts, Whites and Asians may be more likely to counter argue the con\ufb01rmation framing (H3) and more likely to accept the refutation framing (H1,H2)."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "United States of America"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "1400"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "1707001854"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "8/8/17"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Ethnic Politics"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e38526057427b01770c2ff4", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/x94rn/providers/osfstorage/5e38526057427b01770c2ff4", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/x94rn/providers/osfstorage/5e38526057427b01770c2ff4", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/x94rn/providers/osfstorage/5e38526057427b01770c2ff4?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/x94rn/providers/osfstorage/5e38526057427b01770c2ff4"}, "attributes": {"etag": "e6b076a23b5917855a442463700bd357d58353b847a9ed1bb4cbf4b40e48abd9", "kind": "file", "name": "20170819AA_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e38526057427b01770c2ff4", "size": 233081, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "29732a761e3b6525ddb6e193509f0bdc", "sha256": "019ac8780b6e30d5fc3b6e90be1eff23401acf17a5faa6559a47e5345ca6ebec"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 233081, "modified": "2020-02-03T17:03:28.523505+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "x94rn", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20170819AA_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T17:03:28+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "x94rn", "sha256": "019ac8780b6e30d5fc3b6e90be1eff23401acf17a5faa6559a47e5345ca6ebec", "viewUrl": "/project/z3anf/files/osfstorage/5e385264fa39b701741dbc7b/", "selectedFileName": "20170819AA_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20170819AA_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Seeing is Believing: How Video of Police Action A\ufb00ects Criminal Justice Beliefs", "q2": "Bryce J.

We also examine a set of secondary outcomes capturing speci\ufb01c emotional responses to the treatment as well as potential e\ufb00ects on more general beliefs.", "q17": "In this study, we randomly assign several text and video treatments to subjects on Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Generally speaking, the treatments consist of both raw body camera footage and slightly altered news coverage (both televison and newspaper) of a traffic stop in Memphis, TN. We use these treatments to test the following hypotheses: Hypothesis 0. Interpretations independent of justi\ufb01cation for release of body camera footage Hypothesis 1. Interpretation consistent with justi\ufb01cation for release of body camera footage Hypothesis 2. Interpretation consistent with justi\ufb01cation for release of body camera footage conditional on prior beliefs Hypothesis 3. Interpretation counter to justi\ufb01cation for release of body camera footage conditional on prior beliefs Our general expectations with regard to these hypotheses are as follows. If police body camera footage provides a purely objective view of an interaction, than it is possible that respondents will be unmoved by the manipulation of the justi\ufb01cation for the footage of the release or by the format in which this footage is presented (H0). We think this is unlikely and instead expect interpretation in the con\ufb01rmation and refutation treatments to di\ufb00er from condition in which no justi\ufb01cation is given. As for the direction of those di\ufb00erences, we believe this pattern of response further depends on the format of the footage and the beliefs of those viewing it. We suspect that the \u201cobjective\u201d nature of the unedited body camera footage will make evidence of interpretations consistent with the framing (H1, H2) more likely than interpretations counter to the framing (H3). Further it seems likely that magnitude of these e\ufb00ects will be concentrated among respondents for whom the footage would seem to provide new information (H2). In contrast, we suspect that when this footage is presented as part of a news segment that may format activate familiar scripts about race and crime making a pattern of response of counter arguing the justi\ufb01cation more likely (H3). We believe prior beliefs will shape the interpretation of this footage. Such beliefs are likely intertwined with the race of our respondents. We will conduct our tests separately for groups that objective indicators such as rates of incarceration suggest are relatively advantaged (Whites and Asians) and disadvantaged (Blacks and Latinos) within the current criminal justice system. In this analysis we expect that that the relative e\ufb00ectiveness of the justi\ufb01cation framing may di\ufb00er by group and prior beliefs. Thus, Blacks and Latinos, who are more likely to hold negative beliefs about the general fairness of the police, may be more more response responsive to the con\ufb01rmation framing (H1, H2) and more likely to counter argue the refutation framing (H3). In contrasts, Whites and Asians may be more likely to counter argue the con\ufb01rmation framing (H3) and more likely to accept the refutation framing (H1,H2).", "q18": "United States of America",

Specifically, respondents read one of three randomly assigned primes that feature a hypothetical country \u201cEsor,\u201d which is accused of harboring terrorists. The government of Esor is described as unwilling to interfere with the terrorists\u2019 activities.

H4: Respondents prefer attacks on military targets to attacks on political targets. H5a: Respondents prefer attacks in which the expected civilian casualties contribute more to Esor\u2019s war. H5b: The effect hypothesized in H5a depends on whether a war pursues a just aim. It should therefore only obtain for respondents that received the \u201cimminent threat\u201d treatment. H6: Respondents prefer attacks with lower numbers of expected civilian casualties. H7: The negative effect of the expected number of civilian casualties is stronger the lower the contribution of the attack to victory. H8a: The negative effect of the expected number of civilian casualties is stronger the less civilians contribute to the war. H8b: The effect hypothesized in H8a depends on whether a war pursues a just aim. It should hence only obtain for respondents that received the \u201cimminent threat\u201d treatment and who thus face an unjust opponent. H9: Respondents prefer attacks with a higher contribution to victory. H10: The type of target should have a larger effect than the other presented attributes H11a: The liability of the civilians (expressed here in terms of a contribution to the war) should have a larger effect than the other presented attributes. H11b: The effect hypothesized in H11a depends on whether a war pursues a just aim. It should hence only obtain for respondents that received the \u201cimminent threat\u201d treatment and who thus face an unjust opponent. H12: The contribution of an attack to victory should have a larger effect than the other presented attributes. H13a: Subjects that receive the \u201cimminent threat\u201d treatment are more supportive of strategies for fighting the war (rating outcome) than subjects in the control group that do not receive that treatment. H13b: Subjects that receive the \u201cno imminent threat\u201d treatment are less supportive of strategies for fighting the war (rating outcome) than subjects in the control group that do not receive that treatment. H14a: Respondents prefer strategies with lower numbers of projected casualties among civilians. H14b: The effect described in H14a is weaker for subjects that receive the \u201cimminent threat\u201d treatment than for subjects in the control group. H14c: The effect described in H14a is stronger for subjects that receive the \u201cno imminent threat\u201d treatment than for subjects in the control group. H15: Respondents prefer strategies with a higher chance of victory. H16: Respondents prefer strategies with lower monetary costs. H17: Respondents prefer strategies with lower numbers of projected casualties among U.S. troops. H18: Civilian casualties have a stronger negative effect on war support than other attributes. H19: The projected likelihood of success has a stronger positive effect on war support than other attributes H20: U.S. casualties have a stronger negative effect on war support than other attributes. H21: The effect described in H20 might be weaker the higher the likelihood of success of a war.", "q17": "Hypotheses on the effects of individual attack/strategy attributes are tested by estimating the \"average marginal component effect\" (AMCE), i.e., the marginal effect of each attribute averaged over the joint distribution of the other attributes (Hainmueller et al. 2014). Hypotheses that imply that an effect varies between different prime groups, and/or that the effect of particular strategy/attack attributes depends on values of other attributes, are tested with interactions. The possibility of heterogeneous treatment effects with respect to respondents' background characteristics is explored with interactions as well. We estimate the distinct interaction quantities proposed by Egami and Imai (2016+) and Hainmueller et al.

Declaring that election irregularities violated Kenya\u2019s Constitution, the Court directed the country\u2019s electoral authority to hold a new election within 60 days. In a country without a history of robust judicial power or strong democratic norms (Mueller 2008; Mutua 2001), this episode presents a crucial test of the Kenyan Supreme Court\u2019s legitimacy, or rightful authority to render declarative rulings for the polity (e.g., Gibson and Nelson 2014; Tyler 2006a). Scholars and experts believe that granting high courts robust constitutional authority is necessary for enforcing the rule of law, maintaining judicial independence, and ensuring democratic governance (e.g., Baird 2001; Gibson, Caldeira, and Baird 1998; Ginsburg 2003; Widner 2001). A strong high court depends on widespread subscription to judicial supremacy\u2014the principle that the court has the final word on constitutional meaning for everyone in the country (Friedman 1998; Friedman and Delaney 2011; Whittington 2007). Because high courts possess \u201cneither the purse nor the sword,\u201d their legitimacy\u2014rooted in judicial supremacy\u2014serves as an important mechanism for enforcing their rulings. Thus, how the public and elites respond to landmark assertions of judicial power is important for the rule of law and democratic governance. This project asks three questions: (1) How do Kenyan citizens evaluate their Supreme Court, in terms of the legitimacy of the Court and its ruling, its authority vis-a-vis the other branches and the public, and whether it is perceived as impartial and legalistic versus politicized and biased? (2) Which theoretical model\u2014a procedural fairness model versus an \u201cethnopartisan bias\u201d model\u2014best explains how citizens grant legitimacy to the Court in response to this monumental ruling? (3) How do attitudes about judicial legitimacy change over time as the consequences of court decisions are revealed, in this case, after the new election?"}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypotheses for Question 1 will be tested observationally.

China has often used economic inducements in an effort to influence the policies of target countries, but this has had varying degrees of success. What characteristics of economic statecraft strategies allow or impede political effectiveness? Specifically, what kind of effects do economic inducements have on public opinion in the target country? Conducting a survey experiment in the Philippines, I investigate how different types of economic inducements from China influence public opinion.

I investigate whether Chinese inducement strategies that are more conditional or that benefit a small group of political and business elites are more likely to produce public backlash.

However, both large-N analyses and case studies have produced conflicting conclusions on whether economic statecraft is effective. China has often used economic inducements in an effort to influence the policies of target countries, but this has had varying degrees of success. What characteristics of economic statecraft strategies allow or impede political effectiveness? Specifically, what kind of effects do economic inducements have on public opinion in the target country? Conducting a survey experiment in the Philippines, I investigate how different types of economic inducements from China influence public opinion. Based on my previous fieldwork and case study research, I categorize variation in inducement strategies along two main dimensions: (i) conditionality \u2013 whether the provided inducements are linked to certain political demands from China; and (ii) beneficiaries \u2013 whether the inducement benefits are targeted to a small group of political and business elites, or to the broader population. I investigate whether Chinese inducement strategies that are more conditional or that benefit a small group of political and business elites are more likely to produce public backlash. This backlash could manifest in one or both of two ways: public attitudes toward China and Chinese policies; and public attitudes toward the target country government. This backfiring effect reduces the political effectiveness of China\u2019s economic inducements.", "q16": "I test two sets of hypotheses on when economic inducements create a backfire effect: (H1a) Imposing conditionality on economic inducements worsens public attitudes toward China. (H1b) Imposing conditionality on economic inducements decreases approval ratings of the target government and makes voters more likely to vote against political incumbents. (H2a) Targeting the economic benefits of inducements to a small group of political and business elites worsens public attitudes toward China. (H2b) Targeting the economic benefits of inducements to a small group of political and business elites decreases approval ratings of the target government and makes voters more likely to vote against political incumbents.", "q17": "I test my hypotheses in the Philippines, which is an important case study. The Philippines is an active dispute claimant against China in the South China Sea.

experiment for WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and Twitter users to determine who is most vulnerable to misinformation/fake news circulated on these social media platforms and whether (and how) corrections to misinformation influence political preferences in Brazil. Specifically, we look at the nature of fake news by focusing on whether or not the false information it conveys directly threatens one\u2019s own self-interest. In other words, if someone is exposed to false information that could potentially put her self-interest (such as her income or property) at risk, will that person be more likely to change her political preferences? Past research on political attitudes show that self-interest matters when the gains or losses in a policy are clear and tangible and when respondents are primed to think about the potential gains or losses of the policy in question (Chong et al. 2001). Furthermore, we want to see if a correction undo fake news\u2019 effect, even among those whose self-interest is most threatened by the misinformation. We also will evaluate if anxiety and fear are triggered by interest-threatening misinformation and if they mediate the misinformation\u2019s effect on political preferences. Finally, we want to see if these effects are moderated by other individual-level characteristics, such as political sophistication, capability of reflection, and predisposition to engage in activities that require higher-level thinking. Our main outcome is support for pension reform, as measured in a survey. We have two different types of interventions. One is the provision of false information (presumably circulating on social media platforms) about possible consequences if pension reform fails. The second intervention is identical to the first one, but with a correction stating that the information is not true. These two interventions are implemented as text embedded in a survey question. Our design proposes three such consequences for a total of six treatment groups (one for each of the three possible consequences both with and without the correction) and one control group, all randomly assigned. The consequences are designed to threaten the self-interest of specific groups of the Brazilian population."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "We specify the following confirmatory hypotheses: H1: False information increases support for pension reform among treatment respondents whose interests are most at stake should pension reform fail (as primed by the false information presumably circulating on social media platforms), as compared to control group subjects who share the same interests but that have not received the false information threatening their self-interest. H2: False information, even when corrected, increases support for pension reform among treatment respondents whose interests are most at stake should pension reform fail (as primed by the false information presumably circulating on social media platforms), as compared to control group subjects who share the same interests but that have not received the false information threatening their self-interest. H3: The effect of false information on support for pension reform among treatment respondents whose interests are most at stake in the event should pension reform fail (as primed by the false information presumably circulating on social media platforms) is strongest among subjects high in need for cognition. H4: The effect of false information in increasing support for pension reform among treatment respondents whose interests are most at stake should pension reform fail (as primed by the false information presumably circulating on social media platforms) is strongest among subjects with high capabilities of reflection. H5: The effect of false information in increasing support for pension reform among treatment respondents whose interests are most at stake should pension reform fail (as primed by the false information presumably circulating on social media platforms) is strongest among politically sophisticated subjects.

RQ2: Are subjects whose self-interest is most threatened by the false information more likely to share the (false) information? RQ3: Does false information (presumably circulating on social media platforms) increase anxiety among subjects whose self-interest is most threatened? RQ4: Does false information (presumably circulating on social media platforms) increase fear among subjects whose self-interest is most threatened? RQ5: Does need for cognition, capability of reflection, or knowledge of politics matter most for explaining people\u2019s resistance to false information?

The possible consequences are: 1) a decrease in the benefits paid to Bolsa Familia (a social welfare program) recipients; 2) an increase in income taxes (for those who pay income taxes); and, 3) an increase in the tax on gasoline. 2) some respondents will be randomly assigned to receive the same three possible (false) consequences, but, followed with a correction indicating that the information has been checked and declared false. Some respondents will also be randomly assigned to a control group where they will only receive the outcome variable question, as presented above. The complete wording of the six treatment groups can be found in the attached document, together with the questions asking whether treatment group respondents believe that the (false) information presumably circulating on social media platforms is true, how likely they would be to circulate the (false) information were they to receive it, and how much the (false) information makes them anxious and scared. Respondents will also be asked about whether they (or someone in their family) were a recipient of Bolsa Familia, pay income taxes, and own a car or motorcycle. These variables will be used to indicate if the respondent\u2019s self-interest is at stake. We will also administer three batteries of five questions to measure need for cognition, capabilities of reflection (as measured by RCT), and political sophistication. The items from each battery will be summed and rescaled to range from 0 to 1. The hypotheses and exploratory research questions will be evaluated using a series of difference-of-means tests and regression analyses (OLS) with and without interaction variables to account for the treatments\u2019 main effects, as well as the moderating effects of need for cognition, capability of reflection, and political sophistication.

Specifically, we look at the nature of fake news by focusing on whether or not the false information it conveys directly threatens one\u2019s own self-interest. In other words, if someone is exposed to false information that could potentially put her self-interest (such as her income or property) at risk, will that person be more likely to change her political preferences? Past research on political attitudes show that self-interest matters when the gains or losses in a policy are clear and tangible and when respondents are primed to think about the potential gains or losses of the policy in question (Chong et al. 2001). Furthermore, we want to see if a correction undo fake news\u2019 effect, even among those whose self-interest is most threatened by the misinformation. We also will evaluate if anxiety and fear are triggered by interest-threatening misinformation and if they mediate the misinformation\u2019s effect on political preferences. Finally, we want to see if these effects are moderated by other individual-level characteristics, such as political sophistication, capability of reflection, and predisposition to engage in activities that require higher-level thinking. Our main outcome is support for pension reform, as measured in a survey. We have two different types of interventions. One is the provision of false information (presumably circulating on social media platforms) about possible consequences if pension reform fails. The second intervention is identical to the first one, but with a correction stating that the information is not true. These two interventions are implemented as text embedded in a survey question. Our design proposes three such consequences for a total of six treatment groups (one for each of the three possible consequences both with and without the correction) and one control group, all randomly assigned. The consequences are designed to threaten the self-interest of specific groups of the Brazilian population.", "q16": "We specify the following confirmatory hypotheses: H1: False information increases support for pension reform among treatment respondents whose interests are most at stake should pension reform fail (as primed by the false information presumably circulating on social media platforms), as compared to control group subjects who share the same interests but that have not received the false information threatening their self-interest. H2: False information, even when corrected, increases support for pension reform among treatment respondents whose interests are most at stake should pension reform fail (as primed by the false information presumably circulating on social media platforms), as compared to control group subjects who share the same interests but that have not received the false information threatening their self-interest. H3: The effect of false information on support for pension reform among treatment respondents whose interests are most at stake in the event should pension reform fail (as primed by the false information presumably circulating on social media platforms) is strongest among subjects high in need for cognition. H4: The effect of false information in increasing support for pension reform among treatment respondents whose interests are most at stake should pension reform fail (as primed by the false information presumably circulating on social media platforms) is strongest among subjects with high capabilities of reflection. H5: The effect of false information in increasing support for pension reform among treatment respondents whose interests are most at stake should pension reform fail (as primed by the false information presumably circulating on social media platforms) is strongest among politically sophisticated subjects. H6: The effect of false information, when corrected, in increasing support for pension reform among treatment respondents whose interests are most at stake should pension reform fail (as primed by the false information presumably circulating on social media platforms) is weakest among subjects high in need for cognition. H7: The effect of false information, when corrected, in increasing support for pension reform among treatment respondents whose interests are most at stake should pension reform fail (as primed by the false information presumably circulating on social media platforms) is weakest among subjects with high capabilities of reflection.

In addition to the eight confirmatory hypotheses listed above, we will conduct some exploratory analyses. Specifically, we look to explore the following exploratory research questions (RQs): RQ1: Are subjects whose self-interest is most threatened by the false information more likely to believe that the (false) information is true? RQ2: Are subjects whose self-interest is most threatened by the false information more likely to share the (false) information? RQ3: Does false information (presumably circulating on social media platforms) increase anxiety among subjects whose self-interest is most threatened? RQ4: Does false information (presumably circulating on social media platforms) increase fear among subjects whose self-interest is most threatened? RQ5: Does need for cognition, capability of reflection, or knowledge of politics matter most for explaining people\u2019s resistance to false information? RQ6: Does need for cognition, capability of reflection, or knowledge of politics matter most for explaining people\u2019s acceptance of corrections of false information?", "q17": "We will conduct a randomized survey experiment to evaluate the hypotheses and exploratory research questions presented above.
