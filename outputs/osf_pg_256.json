we reported that we planned three experiments (one in L1 Dutch, one in L1 English, and one in L2 English). in which we would test the role of quantifier-specific lexical information in the construction of logical representations in language comprehension. Please see this original registration plan for a description of the background, the methodology and predictions of our initial planned experiments. \n\nWe first conducted the Dutch experiment. We started with this experiment, rather than the English experiment, for practical reasons. We can recruit Dutch-speaking participants easily among the first-year psychology students at Ghent University, who can receive course credit for their participation.

Finally, we did not predict priming from \u2018alle\u2026een\u2019 onto \u2018elke\u2026een\u2019, as \u2018alle\u2019 and \u2018elke\u2019 differ in their inherent combinatorial properties. \n\nHowever, we observed priming of logical representations from \u2018elke\u2026een\u2019 sentences onto \u2018elke\u2026een\u2019 sentences and from \u2018alle\u2026een\u2019 sentences onto \u2018elke\u2026een\u2019 sentences. Moreover, we did not observe priming of logical representations from \u2018iedere\u2026een\u2019 sentences onto \u2018elke\u2026een\u2019 sentences.

These results are thus not accordance with our predictions. \n\nOur results show strong individual differences between participants across all conditions. Again, this observation is described in more detail in the attached file. The presence of this much individual difference between participants across all conditions raises the question of whether the observed pattern of priming in these groups are an accurate estimation of priming effects in the population, or whether the results are distorted by random variation between participants. In order to test whether the unexpected results observed in our Dutch experiment is really due to Prime Quantifier Condition, or due to individual variance across the participants, we are going to replicate this experiment with a full within-subject design. This experiment is similar to the one we conducted, and thus still has a 2 X 3 design (Prime Condition X Prime Quantifier), but now both variables will be manipulated within subjects (whereas Prime Quantifier was manipulated between subjects in the previous experiment).

established for the feature critical to identifying a target, and when an irrelevant stimulus is presented (i.e. not the target) that contains the target feature, attention is involuntarily captured, but if the stimulus does not contain the target feature, attention is not captured. The purpose of this study is to investigate the difference in neural response to irrelevant stimuli that do compared to stimuli that do not contain the target feature, by measuring event related potentials (ERP) from electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings. Participants will be presented with a distractor followed by a target display, where they need to identify the target (either by the colour red or by abrupt onset) as either \u201cX\u201d or \u201c=\u201d. The distractor display will contain a red feature for one group of participants, and will be an abrupt onset distractor for the other, however all participants will be presented with a red target ACS block of trials, and an abrupt onset target ACS block of trials. ERP patterns following the distractors will be compared based on what the target ACS feature was, meaning whether the distractor matched or did not match the ACS. \n\n4.\tHypotheses (required)\n\nIn response to distractor stimuli containing the target feature, we hypothesize the P1 and N1 peak amplitudes will be greater when the distractor feature matches the ACS compared to when it does not. P1 and N1 components can be representative of the strength of perception, and we hypothesize that these components will indicate that the distractor is not perceived as strongly when it does not contain the target feature.

The outcome variables will consist of RT and ER, which will be entered into a 2x2x2 repeated measures ANOVA with factors being distractor feature (colour/onset), target feature (colour/onset) and spatial cueing (cued/uncued). Cued spatial location indicates the distractor and target appear in the same box within a trial, while uncued spatial location indicates the distractor and target appear in different boxes within a trial.

These measures will be recorded by the opensesame program and EEG apparatus.\n\nAnalysis Plan\n\n14.\tStatistical models (required)\nThe predictor variables will be the distractor features and location compared to the target feature and location, and whether they are the same of different. The outcome variables will consist of RT and ER, which will be entered into a 2x2x2 repeated measures ANOVA with factors being distractor feature (colour/onset), target feature (colour/onset) and spatial cueing (cued/uncued). Cued spatial location indicates the distractor and target appear in the same box within a trial, while uncued spatial location indicates the distractor and target appear in different boxes within a trial. The significance level will be p=.05, to maintain consistency with a previously study conducted. \nThe electrophysiological outcome variable will consist of ERP activity up to 1000 ms after presentation of the distractor. ERP activity from electrodes PO7/PO8 will be used to compare the timing and amplitude of the P1 and N1 ERP components of trials where the distractor contained the target feature compared to trials where the distractor did not contain the target feature, using a paired sample t-test with a significance level of 0.05. \n\n15.\tData exclusion (optional)\nRT analysis will only include correct target identification trials, ER and ERP data analysis will include data from participants with 60% trial accuracy or greater. \n\n\n", "uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children":

Accordingly, this study is exploratory and does not aim to answer concrete expectations.

Therefore, we propose that, in general, disclosures to humanoid social robots are genuine. Disclosures to humanoid social robots will be richer in information and will be perceived by people as such, compared to disembodied agents who lack in human-like embodiment and gestures. Nevertheless, it is proposed that disclosures to humans can elicit more information than disclosures to robots and agents considering their natural human embodiment while being perceived as such. However, we consider that disclosures to humanoid social robots can overcome some of the natural limitations of self-disclosure. \n\nAccordingly, we aim to explore how these disclosures differ between the three agents through speech.

In a randomized order, all of the participants will interact with three agents: (1) a humanoid social robot (NAO, SoftBank Robotics), (2) a human agent (the corresponding experimenter), or (3) a disembodied agent (voice assistant \u2013 Google Home Mini).\n\n In a randomized order and allocation to an agent treatment, all of the participants will be asked about three topics: (1) work and life balance (one question about one\u2019s financial situation, and one question about spare time and hobbies), (2) relationships and society (one question about one\u2019s closest relationships, and one question about socializing habits), (3) physical and mental health (one question about habits of sustaining physical health, and one question about habits of sustaining/treating mental health). The questions within each topic will be randomly ordered and will be communicated by the agent treatment that will be randomly assigned to the topic treatment. The interactions between the participants and the agents (humanoid social robot /human /disembodied agent) will be recorded for analysis purposes, extracting content and acoustic features from the audio files.  These will be anonymized and encrypted. \n\nAll the questions are the same across the agent treatments (see Variables section), whereas agents differ following their level of embodiment and the demonstrated gestures that correspond with their embodiment (see Variables section).\nThe experiment will be administered using a \u201cformR\u201d application (the experiment sheet will be uploaded to the project page on OSF) that randomized the treatments automatically. After each interaction participants will be requested to evaluate the agent in terms of experience (the ability to sense and feel) and agency (the ability to plan and act) after being introduced to these terms. Moreover, after each interaction participants will evaluate their subjective disclosure to each of the agents via an adjusted version of the sub-scale of work and studies disclosure in Jourard's Self-Disclosure Questionnaire (Jourard, 1971). Finally, after all of the interactions participants will be requested to complete a short questionnaire, reporting demographic parameters (including their age, biological sex, gender, level of education, nationality, previous experience with robots, and if English is their native language), their periodic stress on the perceived stress scale (Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983), and will be asked to rank their extraversion score on 8 extraversion items of the Mini-Markers Big Five personality scale (Saucier, 1994). \nData collection is planned to take place at the Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology of the University of Glasgow, from Tuesday, 25/02/20, testing 10 participants each day between 09:00 to 17:00.

The order of the treatments was randomized across the participants.\n\nHumanoid Social Robot: This treatment was manipulated using the robot NAO (Softbank Robotics), a human-like robot who can communicate with humans via speech but can also demonstrate several cognitive-like cues using motion, gaze, and body gestures. NAO communicated with participants in this study via the Wizard of Oz (WoZ) technique controlled by the experimenter on a PC laptop. When a participant is answering to NAO\u2019s questions, NAO will be directing gaze to the participant, nodding with his head every few seconds, and the breathing functionality will be activated to reduce the variance in the embodiment between the conditions of the humanoid social robot and the human agent. These animations were made before conducting the experiment using SoftBank Robotics\u2019 Choreograph software. When NAO was speaking to participants his movements were self-initiated based on NAO\u2019s demo software.\n\nHuman-Agent: This treatment consists of the experimenter as an elicitor. This treatment was manipulated by the natural agent\u2019s looks, voice, and gestures (e.g., nodding). The human gestures were not planned and followed his natural embodiment. However, the human agent was instructed not to speak when participants were answering questions.\nDisembodied Agent: This treatment is manipulated using the \u201cGoogle home mini\u201d. A voice assistant is a software in a speaker, and as such it has a minimal physical presence and it is disembodied \u2013 not demonstrating any sort of visual cues and it\u2019s verbal cues are limited to clear manifest ones (\u201cI understand\u201d, \u201cOkay, I see\u201d) rather than natural implicit ones (e.g., \u201cahh\u201d, \u201camm\u201d).

These are general, every day topics that were chosen to elicit disclosure among the participants. The order of the topics and their allocation to an agent will be randomized. The order of the questions within each topic of conversation will also be randomized. The questions were face validated with a native (British) English speaker to make sure that they correspond to the informal nature of a chat. \n\nWork and life balance: One question about one\u2019s financial situation, and question about spare time and hobbies.\n\nRelationships and society: One question about one\u2019s closest relationships, and one question about socializing habits\n\nPhysical and mental health: One question about habits of sustaining physical health, and one question about habits of sustaining/treating mental health.", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Measurements were collected using self-reported questionnaires that were operated on a \u201cformR\u201d application (the sheet will be uploaded to OSF), were extracted from the audio recordings using different computational methods that were performed using Python (Python notebook with the scripts will be uploaded to OSF), and were manually coded by the researchers. \n\nSelf-reported:\n\nAgency and Experience: After each interaction participants will be requested to evaluate the agent in terms of experience (the ability to sense and feel) and agency (the ability to plan and act) after being introduced to these terms. Each of the concepts will be evaluated by the participants using a 0 to 100 rating bar. \n\nPerceived Self Disclosure: After each interaction, participants will be requested to report their level of perceived self-disclosure via the sub-scale of work and studies disclosure in Jourard's Self-Disclosure Questionnaire (1971). This questionnaire was adapted and adjusted for the context of the study, addressing the statements to the topics of the interactions. The measurement included ten self-reported items in which participants reported the extent to which they disclosed information to one of the agents on a scale of one (not at all) to seven (to a great extent). \n\nDemographics: After all of the interactions participants will be requested to complete a short questionnaire, reporting demographic parameters including their age, biological sex, gender, level of education, nationality, job, previous experience with robots, and if English is their native language. \n\nPerceived stress scale: Then, participants will be requested to report their periodic stress on ten statement items of the perceived stress scale (Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983), evaluating these on a scale of 1 (never) to five (very often). \n\nExtraversion: Participants will be asked to rank their extraversion score on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (very applicable) on the 8 extraversion items of the Mini-Markers Big Five personality scale (Saucier, 1994).\n\nExtracted from the recordings:\n\nSome of the measurements that will be extracted from the recordings are text-based and others are audio-based.

Sensitive information is defined according to the European Commission\u2019s GDPR statement: \u201cpersonal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs; trade-union membership; genetic data, biometric data processed solely to identify a human being; health-related data; data concerning a person\u2019s sex life or sexual orientation\u201d (https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations/legal-grounds-processing-data/sensitive-data/what-personal-data-considered-sensitive_en).\nIn a broader context, the researchers will pay attention to code disclosures as sensitive if those include any extent of information that describes an event or situation that is described as personal, intimate, uncomfortable, or private.\n\nAsking for response: The researchers will manually code if during a disclosure a participant verbally approach the agent for a response or for his attention (1 for a disclosure that includes an ask for a response, 0 for not).
