While much of Carol Dweck's mindsets literature has focused on how mindsets predict objective indicators of performance, such as GPA, there are several other important academic outcomes that are more subjective, such as academic adjustment and academic identity development, that have been shown to be critical for optimal student success and development, especially during college. Additionally, there has been increasing attention to the impact of socioeconomic status on college student adjustment and identity development. In this project, we seek to examine how mindsets predict academic adjustment  and academic identity over time in the first two years of college, along with whether SES relates to mindsets and whether SES moderates the relationship between mindsets and academic adjustment and academic identity. We take a narrative approach to identity, focusing on how students make meaning from academic high points and low points narrated at the end of the first and second year of college.

Tucker, Jonathan Nagler, Richard Bonneau, William Godel, Nate Persily"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "This individual study is a part of a larger study that is motivated by two very closely related research questions.\n\nFirst, recent literature on fake news identifies some types of individuals most likely to spread fake news across social media platforms. However, previous research has much less to say about who possesses the ability to discern fake from genuine news and, therefore, who is most vulnerable to believing fake news to be true, or, conversely, believing true news to be false.\n\nWhile we seek to test these hypotheses in order to advance scientific understanding of the determinants of susceptibility to believing fake news to be true (or true news to be false), we are also motivated by two pragmatic questions. First, is it possible to \"crowd-source\" fact checking in a way that allows us to come reasonably close to matching the performance of professional fact checkers?  Second, what is the trade-off between making our crowd representative of the general population -- which may be desirable for normative or political reasons -- and the average level of the crowd's accuracy?  In answering this second question, we draw upon the empirical findings from our first set of individual-level hypotheses that are laid out in a previous pre-registration (https://osf.io/dp8ze/?view_only=4c3c24c0cb9f4625ba2574c7bd5aac9f). In this study we will test a series of hypotheses about individual-level characteristics and article evaluation task-flows associated with correctly discerning fake news from true news. We will introduce an intervention that asks respondents to evaluate articles given in three distinct forms: (1) just the headline and lede of the article in standardized text format, (2) A screenshot of just the headline and lede of the article taken directly from the website, (3) the full text of an article in standardized text format. We will also use these results to help us evaluate what might impact the trade off between representative and accuracy of the crowd if this intervention were introduced.\n\nIn the current study, we plan to run a ten day survey in which individuals evaluate fake and true news stories within 24 hours of their publication online. For the purpose of this study, we will ascertain whether each article is true, false/misleading, or whether the veracity of the story is unclear by having a team of professional fact-checkers label the story along these lines. Respondents in our survey will be required to complete the survey within 24 hours of when the survey is open for responses. Therefore, respondents will evaluate these articles within the first 48 hours after they are published online. The survey will be run for ten days (due to difficulties with recruitment on Fridays, the survey will only be open on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays). The survey will start on a Wednesday.\n\nEach day a new group of 5 articles will be selected for evaluation. These articles will be sent to be evaluated by 150 unique respondents in all four groups (600 respondents total). Each respondent will be randomly given three of the five articles to evaluate in a randomized order. Over the course of two and a half weeks (the survey will be sent out on ten days throughout this period) we will recruit 600 unique individuals per day to take our survey. The control group (150 respondents per day) is asked to evaluate articles for veracity and is given the whole article to evaluate on their website. The 1st treatment group (150 respondents per day) is given the whole article in standardized text to evaluate. The 2nd treatment group (150 respondents per day) is given the headline and lede of the article in standardized text to evaluate. The 3rd treatment group (150 respondents per day) is given the headline and lede of the article as a screenshot from its website to evaluate.\n\nTo track the information individuals engage with if they choose to search for evidence to evaluate the news article, we run google searches using the headline of the article hourly and scrape the top eleven search results during the 24-hour period in which the survey is open. We collect the URL, headline shown in each google search result, text below the headline shown in each google search result, and the full text from each article that is in the top eleven search results.\n\nAs explained in much greater detail below, we will test how the intervention of only evaluating the headline and lede or only viewing the text in a standardized format has different effects on how individuals are able to identify fake news and true news."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "1. The  first  set  of  hypotheses  pose  the  question  of  how  more  text  from  an  article  effects  how  respondents evaluate the veracity of an article.  We believe that if respondents are given more information respondents are more likely to match fact-checkers.\n\n(1.a)  Respondents who are only given the headline and lede in standardized text of an article to evaluate are less likely to match the assessment of fact-checkers than those who are given the whole article in standardized text to evaluate.  We believe that more text helps respondents evaluate articles, but  this  may  depend  on  the  complexity  of  text.   If  an  article  is  more  difficult  to  comprehend,more text may actually obscure respondents from matching fact-checkers.  To be clear, this is not a hypothesis we are positing here, but it is something we plan to explore after the experiment.\n\n(1.b)  Respondents  who  are  only  given  the  headline  and  lede  of  an  article  to  evaluate  (with  source information) are less likely to match the assessment of fact-checkers than those who are given the whole article to evaluate (with source information).  We believe that more text helps respondents evaluate articles, but this may depend on the complexity of text.  If an article is more difficult to comprehend, more text may actually obscure respondents from matching fact-checkers.  To be clear, this is not a hypothesis we are positing here, but it is something we plan to explore after the experiment.\n\n2.  The second set of hypotheses pose the question of how more information about the source of the article impacts how respondents rate the veracity of articles.  This applies to respondents who are given the full  text  and  the  headline  and  lede  of  the  article  to  evaluate.   We  believe  that  being  given  source information from a mainstream news article and a fake news source has different effects.  Being given information that the article is from a mainstream source increases the likelihood a respondent believes it is true.  Whereas, being given information that the article is from a source known for publishing fake news increases the likelihood a respondent believes it is misleading/false.\n\n(2.a)  Respondents who evaluate the full standardized text from articles known for publishing fake news will be more likely to rate this story as true than respondents who evaluate the full article from their website (with the source information).\n\n(2.b)  Respondents who evaluate the full standardized text of an mainstream news article will be less likely to rate this story as true than respondents who evaluate the full article from their website(with the source information).\n\n(2.c)  Respondents who evaluate the headline and lede in standardized text from an article known for publishing fake news will be more likely to rate this story as true than respondents who evaluate the headline and lede from their website (with the source information).\n\n(2.d)  Respondents who evaluate the headline and lede in standardized text from an mainstream news article will be less likely to rate this story as true than respondents who evaluate the headline and lede from their website (with the source information).\n\n3.  The third set of hypotheses pose the question of how more information about the source of an article impacts how respondents evaluate articles that are congruent or incongruent to their political ideology.Individuals are more likely to believe a source if it is congruent to their political ideology.  They are less likely if it is incongruent.\n\n(3.a)  When evaluating the whole text of an article from a source congruent to their political ideology,respondents are more likely to rate a story as true when evaluating the article from its website(given source information) than when given in standardized text (without source information).\n\n(3.b)  When evaluating the whole text of an article from a source incongruent to their political ideology,respondents  are  less  likely  to  rate  a  story  as  true  when  evaluating  the  article  from  its  website(given source information) than when given in standardized text (without source information).\n\n(3.c)  When  evaluating  the  headline  and  lede  of  an  article  from  a  source  congruent  to  their  political ideology,  respondents are more likely to rate a story as true when evaluating the headline and lede from its website (given source information) than when given in standardized text (without source information).\n\n(3.d)  When evaluating the headline and lede of an article from a source incongruent to their political ideology, respondents are less likely to rate a story as true when evaluating the headline and lede from its website (given source information) than when given in standardized text (without source information)."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Tucker, Jonathan Nagler, Richard Bonneau, William Godel, Nate Persily", "q3": "This individual study is a part of a larger study that is motivated by two very closely related research questions.\n\nFirst, recent literature on fake news identifies some types of individuals most likely to spread fake news across social media platforms. However, previous research has much less to say about who possesses the ability to discern fake from genuine news and, therefore, who is most vulnerable to believing fake news to be true, or, conversely, believing true news to be false.\n\nWhile we seek to test these hypotheses in order to advance scientific understanding of the determinants of susceptibility to believing fake news to be true (or true news to be false), we are also motivated by two pragmatic questions. First, is it possible to \"crowd-source\" fact checking in a way that allows us to come reasonably close to matching the performance of professional fact checkers?  Second, what is the trade-off between making our crowd representative of the general population -- which may be desirable for normative or political reasons -- and the average level of the crowd's accuracy?  In answering this second question, we draw upon the empirical findings from our first set of individual-level hypotheses that are laid out in a previous pre-registration (https://osf.io/dp8ze/?view_only=4c3c24c0cb9f4625ba2574c7bd5aac9f). In this study we will test a series of hypotheses about individual-level characteristics and article evaluation task-flows associated with correctly discerning fake news from true news. We will introduce an intervention that asks respondents to evaluate articles given in three distinct forms: (1) just the headline and lede of the article in standardized text format, (2) A screenshot of just the headline and lede of the article taken directly from the website, (3) the full text of an article in standardized text format. We will also use these results to help us evaluate what might impact the trade off between representative and accuracy of the crowd if this intervention were introduced.\n\nIn the current study, we plan to run a ten day survey in which individuals evaluate fake and true news stories within 24 hours of their publication online. For the purpose of this study, we will ascertain whether each article is true, false/misleading, or whether the veracity of the story is unclear by having a team of professional fact-checkers label the story along these lines. Respondents in our survey will be required to complete the survey within 24 hours of when the survey is open for responses. Therefore, respondents will evaluate these articles within the first 48 hours after they are published online. The survey will be run for ten days (due to difficulties with recruitment on Fridays, the survey will only be open on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays). The survey will start on a Wednesday.\n\nEach day a new group of 5 articles will be selected for evaluation. These articles will be sent to be evaluated by 150 unique respondents in all four groups (600 respondents total). Each respondent will be randomly given three of the five articles to evaluate in a randomized order. Over the course of two and a half weeks (the survey will be sent out on ten days throughout this period) we will recruit 600 unique individuals per day to take our survey. The control group (150 respondents per day) is asked to evaluate articles for veracity and is given the whole article to evaluate on their website. The 1st treatment group (150 respondents per day) is given the whole article in standardized text to evaluate. The 2nd treatment group (150 respondents per day) is given the headline and lede of the article in standardized text to evaluate. The 3rd treatment group (150 respondents per day) is given the headline and lede of the article as a screenshot from its website to evaluate.\n\nTo track the information individuals engage with if they choose to search for evidence to evaluate the news article, we run google searches using the headline of the article hourly and scrape the top eleven search results during the 24-hour period in which the survey is open. We collect the URL, headline shown in each google search result, text below the headline shown in each google search result, and the full text from each article that is in the top eleven search results.\n\nAs explained in much greater detail below, we will test how the intervention of only evaluating the headline and lede or only viewing the text in a standardized format has different effects on how individuals are able to identify fake news and true news.", "q4": "1. The  first  set  of  hypotheses  pose  the  question  of  how  more  text  from  an  article  effects  how  respondents evaluate the veracity of an article.  We believe that if respondents are given more information respondents are more likely to match fact-checkers.\n\n(1.a)  Respondents who are only given the headline and lede in standardized text of an article to evaluate are less likely to match the assessment of fact-checkers than those who are given the whole article in standardized text to evaluate.  We believe that more text helps respondents evaluate articles, but  this  may  depend  on  the  complexity  of  text.   If  an  article  is  more  difficult  to  comprehend,more text may actually obscure respondents from matching fact-checkers.  To be clear, this is not a hypothesis we are positing here, but it is something we plan to explore after the experiment.\n\n(1.b)  Respondents  who  are  only  given  the  headline  and  lede  of  an  article  to  evaluate  (with  source information) are less likely to match the assessment of fact-checkers than those who are given the whole article to evaluate (with source information).  We believe that more text helps respondents evaluate articles, but this may depend on the complexity of text.  If an article is more difficult to comprehend, more text may actually obscure respondents from matching fact-checkers.  To be clear, this is not a hypothesis we are positing here, but it is something we plan to explore after the experiment.\n\n2.  The second set of hypotheses pose the question of how more information about the source of the article impacts how respondents rate the veracity of articles.  This applies to respondents who are given the full  text  and  the  headline  and  lede  of  the  article  to  evaluate.   We  believe  that  being  given  source information from a mainstream news article and a fake news source has different effects.  Being given information that the article is from a mainstream source increases the likelihood a respondent believes it is true.  Whereas, being given information that the article is from a source known for publishing fake news increases the likelihood a respondent believes it is misleading/false.\n\n(2.a)  Respondents who evaluate the full standardized text from articles known for publishing fake news will be more likely to rate this story as true than respondents who evaluate the full article from their website (with the source information).\n\n(2.b)  Respondents who evaluate the full standardized text of an mainstream news article will be less likely to rate this story as true than respondents who evaluate the full article from their website(with the source information).\n\n(2.c)  Respondents who evaluate the headline and lede in standardized text from an article known for publishing fake news will be more likely to rate this story as true than respondents who evaluate the headline and lede from their website (with the source information).\n\n(2.d)  Respondents who evaluate the headline and lede in standardized text from an mainstream news article will be less likely to rate this story as true than respondents who evaluate the headline and lede from their website (with the source information).\n\n3.  The third set of hypotheses pose the question of how more information about the source of an article impacts how respondents evaluate articles that are congruent or incongruent to their political ideology.Individuals are more likely to believe a source if it is congruent to their political ideology.  They are less likely if it is incongruent.\n\n(3.a)  When evaluating the whole text of an article from a source congruent to their political ideology,respondents are more likely to rate a story as true when evaluating the article from its website(given source information) than when given in standardized text (without source information).\n\n(3.b)  When evaluating the whole text of an article from a source incongruent to their political ideology,respondents  are  less  likely  to  rate  a  story  as  true  when  evaluating  the  article  from  its  website(given source information) than when given in standardized text (without source information).\n\n(3.c)  When  evaluating  the  headline  and  lede  of  an  article  from  a  source  congruent  to  their  political ideology,  respondents are more likely to rate a story as true when evaluating the headline and lede from its website (given source information) than when given in standardized text (without source information).\n\n(3.d)  When evaluating the headline and lede of an article from a source incongruent to their political ideology, respondents are less likely to rate a story as true when evaluating the headline and lede from its website (given source information) than when given in standardized text (without source information).", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.
