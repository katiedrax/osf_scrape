Instead, they may (falsely) deny that abuse occurred to cope with the trauma they experienced. Victims might also be threatened by the perpetrator not to disclose abuse experiences or decide not to disclose because they feel ashamed (Lyon, 2007; McElvaney, 2015). A growing body of research has shown that the mere act of falsely denying might influence memory and lead to forgetting of the abusive events and the investigations during which the denial took place. This forgetting effect was first found in a study by Vieira and Lane (2013) and later replicated and dubbed the \u2018denial-induced forgetting effect\u2019 by Otgaar, Howe, Memon, and Wang (2014). In Vieira and Lane\u2019s (2013) study, participants viewed pictures. Then, they were instructed to tell the truth or lie about several objects, some of which were new, and some were already presented. Two days later, participants received a source memory test. Vieira and Lane (2013) showed that memory was worse for previously presented objects whose presence had been falsely denied. In another study, Otgaar and colleagues (2014) found that participants who had falsely denied details of a witnessed video crime remembered fewer details regarding what they had discussed in the investigative interview in which they had denied the events. Thus, falsely denying that an event took place seems to decrease memory for the remembered event and the investigation, although research findings are not always consistent about both (i.e. while the memory effect for the interview has been replicated with a medium effect size quite consistently since it was first found, memory for the details of the crime or initial stimulus is not always found to be impaired.). The negative impacts of false denials on memory ability are problematic, since they indicate that victims of abuse who falsely deny their abuse might not remember the details of the events or the interview correctly, and may contradict what they said in prior police investigations. Such inconsistencies might lead the police to disregard the witness as unreliable (Brewer, Potter, Fisher, Bond, &amp; Luszcz, 1999; Fischer, Vrij, &amp; Leins, 2013). This can further lead to injustices and could have tremendous emotional effects for the victims. Thus, it is important that we fully understand how false denials may influence the denier\u2019s memory and reliability of their statements. To fully understand the impact that false denials have memory and reliability, both negative and possible positive (mnemonic) effects of false denials need to be investigated. Yet, to date mostly negative mnemonic effects of false denials \u2013being that false denials can negatively impact retention of details of the crime and the investigation - have been studied (see also Otgaar, Howe, Smeets, &amp; Wang, 2016; Otgaar, Romeo, Ramakers, &amp; Howe, 2018). However, false denials might also have protective effects for memory. Lying about your experiences by denying that certain details happened might be \u2018better\u2019 for memory retention than not talking about the experiences at all; McWilliams, Goodman, Lyons, Newton, and Avila-Mora (2014) found that while lying (by leaving out details or confabulating details) impaired memory, untruthful rehearsal still resulted in better memory than no rehearsal. Thus, falsely denying abuse might preserve memory better than not talking at all in a first investigative interview. Furthermore, new research points towards potential protective mnemonic effects of false denials; False denials had a protective effect against the formation of false memories in a Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm in two studies by Otgaar, Howe, Mangiulli, and B\u00fccken (in revision). In both experiments, the initial stimuli were Deese-Roediger-McDermott word lists. These are commonly used to generate false memories. They consist of one critical lure and twelve other words that are semantically linked to the lure. The latter is not presented to participants. After exposure to these word-lists, participants were allocated either to the false denial (where they were instructed to falsely deny in response to each question) or control group. In a later memory task, memory for the denial interview, the DRM lists, and false memory for the critical lures were assessed. The denial-induced forgetting effect was replicated. Also, participants in the false denial group developed significantly fewer false memories for the word lists compared to honest controls. Looking at theories of false memory formation further sheds light on the idea that (false) denials may prevent or reduce the formation of false memories. Associative-activation theory (AAT), for instance, poses that spreading activation through a highly interconnected system of memory nodes in a network leads not only to retrieval of memory but also to the creation of false memory (Howe, Wimmer, Gagnon, &amp; Plumpton, 2009; Roediger Balota, &amp; Watson, 2001). The latter would occur when a memory is retrieved and a related node that is semantically connected but not actually relevant to the retrieved memory is activated. False denial of a memory might lead to inhibitory effects at retrieval (Otgaar, Howe, Mangiulli, &amp; B\u00fccken, in revision). AAT would then predict that such an inhibition of a memory node might prevent the retrieval of semantically related information (such as critical lures). The following implications could be drawn from mnemonic effects of false denials presented above; someone who initially falsely denied abuse might be inconsistent in their accounts since their memory for prior interviews is impaired. However, they might be less likely to have adopted wrong information and formed false memories of the experienced events during the investigation process. This is an important implication, since police often uses suggestive questions by, for instance, asking for whether specific details or events took place that might fit with a schema or script the police has of the type of event that was disclosed by the victim (Goodman-Brown, Edelstein, Goodman, Jones, &amp; Gordon, 2003; Lamb et al., 2002). Such questioning may lead to the creation of false memories or beliefs about the experienced event(s) when interviewing suspected victims of abuse. According to the results presented above then, false denials might protect the victim from forming these false memories. Thereby, the information regarding the experienced events might be more reliable than one might think in cases in which the victim initially denied that certain events occurred to them. This is in line with the finding that false denials sometimes only reduce memory for the denial interview, but not for the experienced event (e.g. Otgaar, Howe, Memon, &amp; Wang, 2014). The problem with inferring and generalizing from the research presented above is twofold. First, the positive mnemonic effect of false denials on false memory formation has only been shown in two studies thus far, and thus requires further replication across different studies and paradigms. This is of high importance, especially looking at the replication crisis that the field of psychology is faced with (Stevens, 2017). Second, the initial stimuli used in the two studies\u2013 word lists - are not very ecologically valid. Words are very different from autobiographical memories. To understand the impact of false denials on memory and the reliability of statements given by someone who falsely denied the occurrence of certain events in an investigative interview, it is therefore necessary to replicate the results reported above using more ecologically valid stimuli. Therefore, this study will attempt to replicate the denial-induced-forgetting effect and the inhibition of false memory formation after false denial of events using the same paradigm as the studies presented above by Otgaar, Howe, Mangiulli, and B\u00fccken (in revision), but using DRM videos instead of DRM word lists. Videos are arguably much more similar to autobiographical memories than written words are. Therefore, these stimuli will show greater ecological validity. Moreover, previous studies on the denial-induced forgetting effect have successfully found the effect by using videos as the initial stimuli (see for instance Otgaar, Howe, Smeets, &amp; Wang, 2016). While these were not DRM videos, it is likely that the denial induced forgetting effect can be replicated using such videos. Thereby, the current study will examine both positive and negative effects of false denials on memory and ultimately memory/ testimony reliability after an act of false denial. If replication is possible with DRM videos, future studies might attempt to replicate the effect with even more ecologically valid stimuli to assess the robustness of the effect. To maximize ecological validity the research paradigm could, for instance, utilize a mock-crime and a misinformation paradigm to mimic the investigative process when interviewing alleged victims of abuse; in such interviews, police might provide suggestive (mis)information to learn more about the events that happened and to get the victim to talk about the events (Lamb et al., 2002). Therefore, future studies should look at misinformation paradigms as well. However, it is important to first replicate the results using the same paradigm with more ecologically valid stimuli before other false memory paradigms are tested.

Until now, consciousness studies have studied for adults using psychophysical and neuroscience techniques (e.g., Del Cul et al., 2007; Derda et al., 2019). The visual backward masking task is a widely used measure in consciousness research. Previous studies have shown that the relationship between the subjective visibility and the stimulus intensity (the stimulus presented duration) was fitted a non-linear model (Sandberg et al., 2011; Winder et al., 2013). Furthermore, the threshold of subjective visibility is longer than that of objective performance (Sandberg et al., 2011; Winder et al., 2013).\nFor a better understanding of consciousness, it is necessary to consider not only adults' developed consciousness but also developing consciousness since human birth.

identity.\n\nTherefore, we will measure how participants react to social media posts containing emoji of different skin tones, in terms of judgements they make about the author of the text.

The presence of these indicators (but not specific identification of them, e.g. syntactic or lexical features) has been confirmed through pre-testing of the texts in a norming study.\n\n\nOur hypotheses  (H1, H2) are motivated by findings of previous work claiming a connection between emoji and expression of identity, and by popular claims made in the media (H3).\n\nH1: Readers of a neutral text containing a light- or dark-skinned emoji will be more likely to attribute authorship to someone whose skin tone matches that of the emoji.\n\tH1 is motivated by findings in sociolinguistics, that people use multiple cues to reach conclusions about a person's identity. Testing this hypothesis will tell us whether emoji are in fact such a cue. \n\nH2: Readers with darker skin will be more likely than lighter-skinned readers to attribute authorship to someone whose skin tone matches that of the emoji, given a neutral text.\n\n\tH2 is motivated by findings in previous studies, that people of colour produce more skin-toned emoji in their social media messages. We expect that greater experience of expressing identity through emoji will make such users more attuned to perceiving such emoji use by others as an explicit act of self-representation.\n\nH3: Black readers will be more likely to attribute the default yellow emoji to a White than a Black identity, given a neutral text.\n\n\tThere have been untested claims in the media that the yellow emoji is neutral, with regards to skin colour identity, and therefore represents everyone. This claim has been used to support arguments that the addition of skin-toned emoji to the Unicode Standard was unnecessary. However, our own previous work has shown that Black users are more likely to have used skin-toned emoji than White users, suggesting that yellow may not in fact be perceived as neutral. H3 tests that hypothesis. White users, who we found are less likely to have used skin-toned emoji, may therefore see Yellow as either Neutral or White. White readers in our experiment should therefore also select White more often than Black, but perhaps to a lesser extent than Black readers.\n\nAlongside our hypotheses, we have open-ended research questions where we are unable to make any principled predictions.

Or is there no effect when compared to just the text alone?

In a no effect outcome, participant judgements will be similar to those for the biased text alone. In a boosting effect outcome, the rating of the biased text will be even more in favour of the particular bias.\n\nRQ2: What effect is observed when adding an incongruent emoji to a text, creating a signal conflict? Do readers use the text or the emoji to come to a conclusion? Or is there confusion?\n\n\tIn RQ2, participants must resolve a conflict between the signals given by the text and the emoji, such as a text with a Black linguistic bias containing a white emoji or vice versa. If participants rate these stimuli as 50:50, this suggests there is an unresolved confusion about which signal to use - some participants will use the text to decide, some the emoji, others will guess at random. If the ratio is in favour of the identity reflected by either text or emoji, this suggests that one signal dominates and is used to resolve the conflict.\n\nRQ3: How do individual differences in linguistic/emoji knowledge affect how signal conflict is resolved?\n\n\tWe might expect individual differences to come into play here, as participants may not be equally familiar with the linguistic characteristics of \"black\" or \"white\" text -- particularly \"black\" text, which is less standard and therefore fewer White participants are exposed to it regularly.

defined as a part of cognitions, seems to be a promising approach differentiating people with a mental illness and people mentally healthy. Rief and Joormann (2019) established a new cognitive model including expectations as a core part of depression. Accordingly, to change one\u2019s negative expectations, they must be violated, i.e. by positive experiences. However, these negative expectations seem to persist, even after an expectation violation. This lack of adjustment might be due to cognitive immunization, defined as post hoc reappraisal of positive experiences (Rief &amp; Glombiewski, 2016). Based on this theoretical background, cognitive behavioral therapy should include the work on dysfunctional expectations (expectation focused psychological interventions, EFPI) to stimulate the flexible and functional adaptation of expectations to experienced situations (e.g. Rief &amp; Glombiewski, 2016; Doering, Glombiewski &amp; Rief, 2018). \n\nAnother concept focusing on psychological flexibility is Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). As a part of the third wave of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), ACT tries to enhance the cognitive flexibility by stimulating the acceptance of the present moment with the aim of reducing experiential avoidance and promoting committed action towards proper values in life (Hayes, Strosahl &amp; Wilson, 2016). In contrast to EFPI, which is a totally new approach and efficacy studies are still lacking, ACT is already well established in practice, even if further methodologically high quality randomized clinical trials are needed to state it as an evidence-based treatment (\u00d6st, 2014). \n\nThe two approaches seem to have some common points, for instance the importance of the flexible use of cognition and expectations. The questions arise: Do short interventions of EFPI and psychological flexibility focused interventions (PFFI; derived from ACT) enhance behavioral change and if yes, do they differ regarding their mechanisms? The aim of this study is to analyze the influence of these therapeutic concepts on behavior (measured in this study with the help of the prisoner\u00b4s dilemma).

Rief and Joormann (2019) established a new cognitive model including expectations as a core part of depression. Accordingly, to change one\u2019s negative expectations, they must be violated, i.e. by positive experiences. However, these negative expectations seem to persist, even after an expectation violation. This lack of adjustment might be due to cognitive immunization, defined as post hoc reappraisal of positive experiences (Rief &amp; Glombiewski, 2016). Based on this theoretical background, cognitive behavioral therapy should include the work on dysfunctional expectations (expectation focused psychological interventions, EFPI) to stimulate the flexible and functional adaptation of expectations to experienced situations (e.g. Rief &amp; Glombiewski, 2016; Doering, Glombiewski &amp; Rief, 2018). \n\nAnother concept focusing on psychological flexibility is Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). As a part of the third wave of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), ACT tries to enhance the cognitive flexibility by stimulating the acceptance of the present moment with the aim of reducing experiential avoidance and promoting committed action towards proper values in life (Hayes, Strosahl &amp; Wilson, 2016). In contrast to EFPI, which is a totally new approach and efficacy studies are still lacking, ACT is already well established in practice, even if further methodologically high quality randomized clinical trials are needed to state it as an evidence-based treatment (\u00d6st, 2014). \n\nThe two approaches seem to have some common points, for instance the importance of the flexible use of cognition and expectations. The questions arise: Do short interventions of EFPI and psychological flexibility focused interventions (PFFI; derived from ACT) enhance behavioral change and if yes, do they differ regarding their mechanisms? The aim of this study is to analyze the influence of these therapeutic concepts on behavior (measured in this study with the help of the prisoner\u00b4s dilemma). While PFFI should reduce the link between expectations and consequent behavior by enhancing committed action towards values independently of negative expectations, EFPI is expected to decrease cognitive immunization by making expectations and their violations conscious, giving the opportunity to flexibly adapt expectations and their consequent behavior. \n", "q4": "1.

Attention is compared to a spotlight, attention selectivity (selective and shared attention) and attention intensity (Alertness, Vigilance) will be compared. Information procession and attention theories are compared (filter model of attention, Broadbent, 1958; Attenuation theory, Treisman 1964; late selection model of selective attention, Deutsch &amp; Deutsch, 1963). At the end an interactive distraction task will be done by the participant (look-point-name). The active control group is comparable in length (+/- 20 minutes), complexity and structure (explanation of the mechanism of attention with the help of graphs, personal involvement through the look-point-name distraction task and a take home message). \n", "q16.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e5cc807ef5d89022f06a787", "file_name": "Used Material in brief Interventions.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/47cgy/files/osfstorage/5e5cc807ef5d89022f06a787", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e5cc807ef5d89022f06a787"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "615d245c2bd32d1f79697f3982a86542067425ebc259a347ce7d9dfed55277ba"}}], "q17.question": "Psychopathology: \nBeck Depression Inventory BDI-II (Hautziger, Keller &amp; K\u00fchner, 2009); specific depressive expectations: Depressive expectation scale DES \u2013 german version (Kube et al., 2016)\n\nInterpersonal Problems: \nInventory of interpersonal problems \u2013 German Version (IIP-D; Horowitz et al., 2016) \n\nPersonality: \nBig Five Inventory (BFI-10; Rammstedt et al., 2013)\n\nAffect: \nPositive and Negative Affect Schedule PANAS \u2013 German Version (Breyer &amp; Bluemke, 2016)\n\nLocus of control (internal vs. external): \nLocus of Control Scale \u2013 German Version (IE-4; Kovaleva, Beierlein, Kemper &amp; Rammstedt, 2012)\n\nWell-being: \nSatisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS; Janke &amp; Gl\u00f6ckner-Rist, 2014) \n\nPsychological Flexibility: \nGerman translation of the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire AAQ-II (Fragebogen zur Akzeptanz und Handeln FAH-II;  Hoyer &amp; Gloster, 2013); PsyFlex (in submission, Firsching et al. \u2013 Validation Study)\n\nValues: \nList of possible life values (adapted from Harris, 2010) &amp; Triple dominance measure of social value orientation (Van Lange et al., 1997; Murphy &amp; Ackermann, 2014).\n\nSelf-formulated items: \nGlobal expectation of ability to cooperate (scale 0-10, 0=not at all, 10 = extremely) \nEstimated trustworthiness (scale 0-10, 0=not at all, 10 = extremely)\nSpecific expectation of cooperation in the next trial (probability to cooperate: 0-100%) \nImportance of winning (scale 0-10, 0=not at all, 10 = extremely)\nSatisfaction with winning (scale 0-10, 0=not at all, 10 = extremely)\nSpecific Locus of control referred to the game prisoner`s dilemma (feeling of being able to influence the playing behavior of the other person scale 0-10, 0=not at all, 10 = extremely)\nOpen question about used strategies in the play of the prisoner`s dilemma (differentiating dominant, cooperative and individual strategy)\n\nPlay behavior: \ncooperation vs. defection in the prisoner\u2019s dilemma (coding: \u201cC\u201d, \u201cD\u201d) \n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "ANOVA with repeated measures, within-between interaction is planned to be calculated.
