To assess heterogeneity in the meta-analyses, we will compute the tau-squared (\u252c2) and the ratio of true heterogeneity to total variation in observed effect (I2).\nData analysis: Meta-analysis of prevalence and correlation coefficients using RevMan 5.3 and MedCalc respectively will be undertaken.  For each, the Cochrane\u2019s Q statistics, I2 and funnel plot will be generated to assess heterogeneity and publication bias across the included studies. \u03b1 will be set at 0.05.\nResult and Discussion: The result of the study promises to provide policy makers and other relevant stakeholders of maternal and child health circle in the region with reliable facts and figures, which will be instrumental to immediate clinical management of PPD as well as strategic planning towards early detection and prevention of PPD in the region, in the coming days.\n\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "The prevalence and correlates of PPD vary significantly from country to country within the sub-Saharan Africa"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies."}, "q6": {"extra": [], "value": ["No blinding is involved in this study."]}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q8": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Meta-analysis"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q10": {"extra": [], "value": "Registration prior to creation of data"}, "q11": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q12": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Data Item\nData will be collected from variables including authors\u2019 references, participants\u2019 characteristics, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, study sample size (also the sample size of groups, where available), method  of assessment, instrument used, the assessor\u2019s occupation, qualification and experience, results, conclusions and funding sources (where applicable).\nQuality appraisal and risk of bias assessment \nQuality appraisal will be executed with the aid of the Downs and Black checklist (Downs and Black, 1998).

First, a PubMed pilot search was conducted to establish a face sensitivity of the search strategy. PubMed pilot search involved search using various MeSH terms and keywords/free text terms generated from articles that are key to the research question. The primary reviewer undertook the pilot search using several combinations of the search terms. The most sensitive and specific terms were chosen and reported in appendix 1. The Terms will be adapted to the syntax and subject headings of the remaining databases. Finally, searches will be undertaken of the following databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, AJOL, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL and PsycINFO. Further search for relevant studies in the references of identified observational and review articles will be performed. Search will be undertaken by the primary reviewer who is a clinical trialist and methodologist. \n\nStudy records and data management\nResult of literature search will be exported into EndNote 8, to check for duplication of studies. Bibliographic records will be exported from EndNote 8 into Microsoft Excel version 10 to facilitate data management and selection of articles for inclusion. Eligibility questions and forms for screening of the studies to be included will be developed, piloted and refined.\n\nSelection process\nInitial screening will be conducted simultaneously on the title and abstract by two independent reviewers (reviewers 1 and 2). Areas of conflict will be resolved in consultation with a third reviewer author. Critical crosschecking of results of the initial screening, reading through the full text of the selected studies for further screening using the prior outlined eligibility criteria will also be done by the primary reviewer.

Measure of heterogeneity, the Cochrane\u2019s Q statistics, I2 will be computed in line with Higgins and Thompson (2002). I2 values will be interpreted in line with Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention as follows: 0-40% might indicate low heterogeneity, 30-60% may represent moderate heterogeneity, 50-90% may represent substantial heterogeneity, and 75-100% may indicate considerable heterogeneity (Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. http://www.cochrane-handbook.org).\n\n"}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Prevalence and Correlates of Postpartum Depression in sub-Saharan Africa: A Meta-analysis ", "q2": "Martins C Nweke, Elizabeth Nseka, Ada C Adiuku-Brown", "q3": "Postpartum depression (PPD) constitutes a public health problem in resource-constrained sub-Saharan Africa.

Further search of references lists of relevant articles will be undertaken to identify articles for inclusion in the review. \nData synthesis and assessment of heterogeneity: First, in attempt to answer the questions, \u201cwhat is the prevalence of PPD in sub-Saharan Africa?\u201d and \u201cwhat are the correlates of PPD in sub-Saharan Africa?\u201d, we will employ narrative synthesis in which all the articles will be presented, compared and pooled in an evidence table. Furthermore, random-effect model will be fitted to estimate the overall/pooled prevalence and correlates of PPD in sub-Saharan Africa. To assess heterogeneity in the meta-analyses, we will compute the tau-squared (\u252c2) and the ratio of true heterogeneity to total variation in observed effect (I2).\nData analysis: Meta-analysis of prevalence and correlation coefficients using RevMan 5.3 and MedCalc respectively will be undertaken.  For each, the Cochrane\u2019s Q statistics, I2 and funnel plot will be generated to assess heterogeneity and publication bias across the included studies. \u03b1 will be set at 0.05.\nResult and Discussion: The result of the study promises to provide policy makers and other relevant stakeholders of maternal and child health circle in the region with reliable facts and figures, which will be instrumental to immediate clinical management of PPD as well as strategic planning towards early detection and prevention of PPD in the region, in the coming days.\n\n", "q4": "The prevalence and correlates of PPD vary significantly from country to country within the sub-Saharan Africa", "q5": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies.", "q6": ["No blinding is involved in this study."], "q7": "", "q9": "", "q10": "Registration prior to creation of data", "q11": "", "q13": "As many articles as meet the stipulated eligibility criteria", "q14": "", "q15": "", "q20": "", "q21": "", "q22": "", "q23": "", "q24": "", "q25": "Information sources and search strategy\nSearches will be undertaken using several combinations of search terms from medical subject headings (MeSH), and keywords in the title, abstract and/or text of the articles. First, a PubMed pilot search was conducted to establish a face sensitivity of the search strategy. PubMed pilot search involved search using various MeSH terms and keywords/free text terms generated from articles that are key to the research question. The primary reviewer undertook the pilot search using several combinations of the search terms. The most sensitive and specific terms were chosen and reported in appendix 1. The Terms will be adapted to the syntax and subject headings of the remaining databases. Finally, searches will be undertaken of the following databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, AJOL, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL and PsycINFO. Further search for relevant studies in the references of identified observational and review articles will be performed. Search will be undertaken by the primary reviewer who is a clinical trialist and methodologist. \n\nStudy records and data management\nResult of literature search will be exported into EndNote 8, to check for duplication of studies. Bibliographic records will be exported from EndNote 8 into Microsoft Excel version 10 to facilitate data management and selection of articles for inclusion. Eligibility questions and forms for screening of the studies to be included will be developed, piloted and refined.\n\nSelection process\nInitial screening will be conducted simultaneously on the title and abstract by two independent reviewers (reviewers 1 and 2). Areas of conflict will be resolved in consultation with a third reviewer author. Critical crosschecking of results of the initial screening, reading through the full text of the selected studies for further screening using the prior outlined eligibility criteria will also be done by the primary reviewer. Authors of selected study will be contacted via mail to clarify issues on selection of any study when decision is difficult to make based on available information. Non-response from any author will result in exclusion of such study and reason for exclusion will be recorded. Details of the flow of studies throughout the selection process will be presented along the reason for exclusion using PRISMA diagram.\n\nData synthesis and assessment of heterogeneity\nThe question of what is the prevalence and correlates of PPD in Sub-Saharan Africa will be answered by narrative using an evidence table. Random-effect model of meta-analysis will be employed to estimate the pooled prevalence (DerSimonian and Laird, 1986; Wang and Liu, 2016). Narrative display of measures of heterogeneity i.e. study characteristics will be sorted by year of publication, and presented in an evidence table. This will provide information on author\u2019s references, sample size, study design, setting, outcome, outcome measure and assessors. Again, we will fit a random effect model to synthesize the correlation coefficients. Measure of heterogeneity, the Cochrane\u2019s Q statistics, I2 will be computed in line with Higgins and Thompson (2002). I2 values will be interpreted in line with Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention as follows: 0-40% might indicate low heterogeneity, 30-60% may represent moderate heterogeneity, 50-90% may represent substantial heterogeneity, and 75-100% may indicate considerable heterogeneity (Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. http://www.cochrane-handbook.org).\n\n", "q8.question": "Meta-analysis", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Data Item\nData will be collected from variables including authors\u2019 references, participants\u2019 characteristics, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, study sample size (also the sample size of groups, where available), method  of assessment, instrument used, the assessor\u2019s occupation, qualification and experience, results, conclusions and funding sources (where applicable).\nQuality appraisal and risk of bias assessment \nQuality appraisal will be executed with the aid of the Downs and Black checklist (Downs and Black, 1998). It examines the appropriateness and adequacy methodology, study design, participant recruitment, data collection, data analysis and presentation of findings. It is suitable for appraising most study designs. The tool contains 28 items/questions with a summary score. Ten items focus on the overall quality of the study, 3 items examine the external validity of the study, 7 items concern study bias, six items focus on confounding and selection bias while one item addresses power of the study. Overall, studies will be rated on a four-point Likert scale as follows: excellent (26-28); good (20-25); fair (15-19); and poor (less than or equal to 14) (Hooper et al. 2008). Studies will be judged unclear where information is inadequate to inform judgment regarding risk of bias.

While substantial investments have been made in satellite monitoring to detect de- forestation events in the region, much of this data remains inaccessible to \u201cfirst responders,\u201d namely communities in the Amazon and, to a lesser extent, the officials tasked with prosecuting these crimes. To what extent does providing this information to the communities most threatened by deforestation allow them to respond to such threats and combat continued deforestation? Further, does facilitating contact between affected communities and government authorities promote increased legal action against offenders? The present field experiment in the Peruvian Amazon will provide indigenous communities with training, technology, and eventually weekly updated data detected by satellite monitoring on threats to their land. A second treatment arm provides resources for these communities to send a representative to share concerns and information with state environmental prosecutors. We measure a rich set of outcomes using satellite data, an original endline survey, and administrative data on cases prosecuted to assess the impacts of the community monitoring program. This study is poised to make important contributions to both theoretical and policy literature on the governance of common pool resources. First, monitoring of common pool resources by stakeholders has long been considered an important factor in improving governance outcomes (Ostrom 1990). Specifically in the case of forest preservation, the involvement of local communities in the administration and monitoring of forest resources has been widely debated. However, despite increased attention to and funding of community led projects through international aid and REDD+ grants, existing studies on relative effectiveness of community participation are severely limited by observational methodology that cannot measure an unbiased causal effect (Macura, Secco, and Pullin, 2015). This will be one of the first studies with a randomized treatment assignment that can obtain unbiased measurement of community monitoring in the Amazon region of South America, one of the largest and most important forest resources for mitigating global climate change and preserving biodiversity. Secondly, we hope to contribute to existing literature by providing evidence on diverse causal mechanisms that could allow communities to better manage forest resources through monitoring, either through increased organizational capacity, reinforcing of prescriptive norms, or intervention by national authorities."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Main Hypotheses, Satellite Data Hypothesis 1. Main Effect of Monitoring: Relative to the control group, community monitoring (both treatment arms) reduces deforestation events and area. This negative effect of community monitoring (both arms) should present heterogeneity due to seasonality, and thus during the dry season (approximately November- April) marginal effects will be greater than during the rainy season (approximately May-October). Hypothesis 2. Marginal Effect of State Engagement: Relative to community monitoring only, the combination of community monitoring and information sharing with national authorities reduces deforestation events and area. Hypothesized Spillovers, Satellite Data Hypothesis 3. Displacement of Deforestation: Relative to the control group, community monitoring (both arms) increases deforestation events and area within a buffer zone outside the monitored communities.

The monitoring program itself provides communities with monitoring technology (GPS smartphones), organizational support, and using weekly updated satellite imagery. Communities will then use the program to identify threats to community forests and take action to prevent or mitigate deforestation through community government or by informing national officials. This intervention is an extension of a preexisting program that has already been successfully implemented in several indigenous communities in the Ucayali Department. This study will also implement a secondary intervention in half of the treated communities. This alternative treatment arm will include an offer of funds to a community to bring leaders and the monitoring team to the department capital (Iquitos). There, community representatives will advocate for state intervention before the regional office of the national environmental prosecutor (Fiscal\u00eda Nacional del Medio Ambiente). This intervention will also include an offer of funds to the environmental prosecutor office to travel to the community and collect evidence. The primary outcome indicator for this study will be the relative rate of deforestation in indigenous community territory. We will measure this outcome through Landsat satellite data provided by the University of Maryland Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) lab, and processed through the Alertas Tempranas (early warnings) system managed by Geobosques, a department within the Peruvian Ministry of the Environment.

While substantial investments have been made in satellite monitoring to detect de- forestation events in the region, much of this data remains inaccessible to \u201cfirst responders,\u201d namely communities in the Amazon and, to a lesser extent, the officials tasked with prosecuting these crimes. To what extent does providing this information to the communities most threatened by deforestation allow them to respond to such threats and combat continued deforestation? Further, does facilitating contact between affected communities and government authorities promote increased legal action against offenders? The present field experiment in the Peruvian Amazon will provide indigenous communities with training, technology, and eventually weekly updated data detected by satellite monitoring on threats to their land. A second treatment arm provides resources for these communities to send a representative to share concerns and information with state environmental prosecutors. We measure a rich set of outcomes using satellite data, an original endline survey, and administrative data on cases prosecuted to assess the impacts of the community monitoring program. This study is poised to make important contributions to both theoretical and policy literature on the governance of common pool resources. First, monitoring of common pool resources by stakeholders has long been considered an important factor in improving governance outcomes (Ostrom 1990). Specifically in the case of forest preservation, the involvement of local communities in the administration and monitoring of forest resources has been widely debated. However, despite increased attention to and funding of community led projects through international aid and REDD+ grants, existing studies on relative effectiveness of community participation are severely limited by observational methodology that cannot measure an unbiased causal effect (Macura, Secco, and Pullin, 2015). This will be one of the first studies with a randomized treatment assignment that can obtain unbiased measurement of community monitoring in the Amazon region of South America, one of the largest and most important forest resources for mitigating global climate change and preserving biodiversity. Secondly, we hope to contribute to existing literature by providing evidence on diverse causal mechanisms that could allow communities to better manage forest resources through monitoring, either through increased organizational capacity, reinforcing of prescriptive norms, or intervention by national authorities.", "q16": "Main Hypotheses, Satellite Data Hypothesis 1. Main Effect of Monitoring: Relative to the control group, community monitoring (both treatment arms) reduces deforestation events and area. This negative effect of community monitoring (both arms) should present heterogeneity due to seasonality, and thus during the dry season (approximately November- April) marginal effects will be greater than during the rainy season (approximately May-October). Hypothesis 2. Marginal Effect of State Engagement: Relative to community monitoring only, the combination of community monitoring and information sharing with national authorities reduces deforestation events and area. Hypothesized Spillovers, Satellite Data Hypothesis 3. Displacement of Deforestation: Relative to the control group, community monitoring (both arms) increases deforestation events and area within a buffer zone outside the monitored communities. Main Hypotheses, Administrative Data Outcomes Hypothesis 4. Community Governance: Relative to members of control group communities, members of monitoring (both arms) community records will reflect more frequent meetings and higher attendance at meetings of the community council and the community assembly. Endline Survey Outcomes: Mechanisms Hypothesis 5. Awareness of Deforestation: Relative to members of control group communities, members of monitoring (both arms) communities manifest greater awareness of the incidence of deforestation in communal lands. Hypothesis 6. Satisfaction with Forest Conservation and Community Governance: Relative to members of control group communities, members of monitoring (both arms) communities report greater satisfaction with the current state of communal forest resources and the performance of community government. Hypothesis 7. Norm Diffusion: Relative to members of monitoring-only communities, members of monitoring and state engagement communities report higher conformity of prescriptive norms to preserve communal forest resources and cooperation norms manifested in higher levels of coordination in a set of lab games.", "q17": "Our primary intervention is an offer for a community to participate in a monitoring program of the community\u2019s collective forests. The monitoring program itself provides communities with monitoring technology (GPS smartphones), organizational support, and using weekly updated satellite imagery. Communities will then use the program to identify threats to community forests and take action to prevent or mitigate deforestation through community government or by informing national officials. This intervention is an extension of a preexisting program that has already been successfully implemented in several indigenous communities in the Ucayali Department. This study will also implement a secondary intervention in half of the treated communities. This alternative treatment arm will include an offer of funds to a community to bring leaders and the monitoring team to the department capital (Iquitos). There, community representatives will advocate for state intervention before the regional office of the national environmental prosecutor (Fiscal\u00eda Nacional del Medio Ambiente). This intervention will also include an offer of funds to the environmental prosecutor office to travel to the community and collect evidence. The primary outcome indicator for this study will be the relative rate of deforestation in indigenous community territory. We will measure this outcome through Landsat satellite data provided by the University of Maryland Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) lab, and processed through the Alertas Tempranas (early warnings) system managed by Geobosques, a department within the Peruvian Ministry of the Environment. This study will also measure the impact of the intervention on community government and perceptions of community members through an endline survey and by accessing community government records.",
