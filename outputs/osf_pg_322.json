It explores the possibility of a \u2018Like Me\u2019 hierarchy that goes beyond a most animate &gt; least animate hierarchical word ordering, whereby speakers ascribe the position of first-mention to the figure that is most like themselves in identity over someone less similar, when describing an interaction between two figures.\n\nIn this study, participants will describe photographs of two actors interacting, who will differ in either gender (\u2018gender trials\u2019 show man/woman dyads) or race (\u2018race trials\u2019 show black/white dyads). Participants will be either black or white men and women, and will describe these scenes using so-called symmetrical predicates (Gleitman, Gleitman, Miller, &amp; Ostrin, 1996). These are verbs that imply a symmetry of action between the two figures (e.g. arguing, kissing, touching), but when used in a sentence they require the speaker to make a decision as to which figure should be mentioned first, which may be potentially conditioned on a factor such as animacy.\n\nParticipants will form either transitive (e.g. \u201cJane is arguing with Fred\u201d) or conjoined sentences (e.g. \u201cJane and Fred are arguing with each other\u201d) to describe the events, which they will type into a text box. We will measure if participants routinely take the perspective of one actor over another, i.e. by mentioning them first in their event descriptions, and we will assess how this varies based on the identity of the actor and the identity of the participant.\n\nResults from the original study supported a \u2018Like Me\u2019 explanation for word order choices to an extent, with participants tending to mention the figure of their own gender or race first. However, there were cases where speakers demonstrated a bias in the opposite direction. For example, black and white women were more likely to mention the black woman first and black man second on black gender trials, as predicted, but black women were proportionally more likely to mention the white man first and white woman second on white gender trials, contrary to our predictions, and white women showed no significant bias in either direction.\n\nWe must therefore also consider that there are aspects of how particular social groups are perceived which might influence the types of people we consider to be appropriate \u201cagents\u201d and \u201cpatients\u201d of events. To understand the decisions a speaker might make about these thematic roles, we will address research from social psychology on biased attitudes and stereotyping. For example, we will consider gendered notions of leadership that favour men over women (Koenig, Eagly, Mitchell, &amp; Ristikari, 2011) and white people over racial minorities as appropriate leaders (Rosette, Leonardelli, &amp; Phillips, 2008), and how individual differences in attitudes towards social groups may influence such biases (Hoyt &amp; Simon, 2016). We will question if biased notions of what makes a prototypical leader or who is perceived as dominant will translate into who speakers perceive as agents in our scenes. For example, research that has taken an intersectional perspective suggests that non-black people perceive dominant behaviours of black women differently to that of white women or black men, but similarly to that of white men (Livingston, Rosette, &amp; Washington, 2012).\n\nAs well as differences in the higher order factors that determine how different social groups perceive these same events, another possible reason for the discrepancies in our original findings could be subtle differences in the stimuli (such as the salience of different figures) that could have impacted how attention was allocated when processing the events. A methodological concern of the original study is the quality of the stimuli; on many trials, the two figures differed notably in height (with most men taller than most women) and brightness of clothing (e.g. one figure wearing black while the other was wearing white). In order to discount visual salience as influencing our results, we are running the replication study with a new stimuli set, with figures close in height and wearing coloured clothing of a similar brightness."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "First, we hypothesise that there will be effects of race identity and gender identity on perspective-taking. We will measure perspective-taking by recording who participants mention first in their descriptions. We hypothesise that participants will demonstrate a tendency to mention the figure most like themselves first, i.e. the figure who shares either the same racial or gender identity as the participant. For example, we predict that men will mention the man figure before the woman figure on gender trials (those depicting man/woman dyads), and white participants will mention the white figure before the black figure on the race trials (those depicting black/white dyads). As this study is a replication, these predictions are responses to the original experiment, which found significant Like Me bias effects on both gender and race trials. \n\nSecond, we hypothesise that there will be an effect of syntax on mention order. Half of the descriptions participants will produce will involve them constructing either transitive sentences, in which one participant is the agent and one the patient (e.g. Person A is marrying Person B), or conjoined sentences, in which both participants are agents (e.g. Person A and Person B are marrying each other. The addition of \u201ceach other\u201d on conjoined sentences is for the purpose of creating the perception of a more symmetrical event than those described with transitive sentences (Gleitman et al., 1996). We predict that participants will be more likely to demonstrate a \u2018Like Me\u2019 bias on transitive sentences than on conjoined sentences, as one figure is given greater agenthood than the other and the speaker is required to make judgements of grammatical function (Branigan, Pickering, &amp; Tanaka, 2008).\n\nIn the original study, we found a significant main effect of syntax on gender trials (p &lt; .05) with a stronger Like Me Gender bias appearing on transitive trials, but not on race trials.\nWe will explore the interaction between race and gender on first mention. For instance, we will investigate if participants will be more likely to mention the figure matching their own gender first if that figure is also of the same race as themselves, and are more likely to mention the figure matching their own race if that figure is also the same gender as the participant.\n\nWe will also consider how event type might influence mention order, by looking at the valence of the events. Dancing, flirting, kissing, marrying will initially be considered intimate events, arguing, shouting and fighting will be considered negative events, and playing, talking and touching will be coded as casual events. We will measure if patterns of first mention differ between valence conditions (intimate, negative and casual); e.g. we will ask if participants are more likely to demonstrate word order biases on one valence condition than the others.\n\nWe will run a factor analysis post-hoc on one participant demographic group (e.g. white men) to determine if our event classifications are appropriate. We will see, based on responses to each event, if the interactions in our three assumed valence groups should in fact be classed with each other (i.e. playing, talking and touching as casual events) due to participants responding similarly to them and differently to the others. \n\nOn gender trials, based on the results of the original study, we predict that participants will mention the man figure first more consistently on intimate events than on casual or negative events, and that when the woman figure is mentioned first this will occur more often on negative events than on casual or intimate events. We will also determine if the effect of trial type replicates; that the Like Me Gender bias was strongest in female participants when they were describing trials depicting black dyads in negative events, and was strongest in male participants when they were describing trials depicting white dyads in intimate events.\n\nOn race trials, again referring to the results of the original study, we predict that black participants will show a tendency to mention the black figure first most often on positive events, and that white participants will show a tendency to mention the white participant first most often on negative events.\n\nWe will also measure if the Like Me Gender/Like Me Race biases manifest when analysing each valence condition independently.\n\nWe consider how the nature of these events may elicit different responses in participants due to attitudes towards particular social groups. Specifically, responses to intimate events between people of the same gender, and between people of different races, might be influenced by the speaker\u2019s attitudes toward homosexuality and interracial relationships respectively. To explore this possibility, we are including a post-study questionnaire to address attitudes towards these two social factors and will use logistic regressions to determine if they had an influence on perceptions of agency on race trials. We predict deviations from predictable patterns of behaviour (i.e. showing a Like Me Race bias) will most likely occur on trials that contradict the speaker\u2019s expectations and accepted world view (e.g. two men shown \u201cmarrying\u201d, described by a participant with negative attitudes towards homosexuality)."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

The photographs are of similar size and the actors wear clothes of a similar brightness, to control for visual salience. We will ask participants to memorise the names and portraits. Next, they will complete a memory task, in which they will have to match the portrait with the correct name. Participants repeat this memory task until they score 100% correct, whereupon they begin the language task. Additionally, to ensure participants remain accurate at naming the photographs, the same memory task will repeat after every 20 trials of the language task, and participants will again have to score 100% correct to continue the language task.\n\nOn each critical trial of the language task, participants will view an image of two of the photographed people interacting in a symmetrical event (e.g., touching each other, shouting at each other, hugging each other, etc). They are then shown a sentence fragment (e.g., \u201cis touching\u201d), and they complete the sentence (e.g., writing \u201cJane is touching Fred\u201d).  The images are formatted as graphics interchange format (GIF) animations, such that the image switches with its Left-Right mirror image twice per second. This is done to ensure that the two photographed people each appear on the left-hand-side and right-hand-side twice, so as to account for English speakers\u2019 tendency to mention the figure who appears on the left first. This is considered to be a reading effect; many adults demonstrate the tendency to look in the order they are used to reading in. This scanning habit is then reflected in the speaker\u2019s subject-verb-object structure (Maass &amp; Russo, 2003). Our prior data suggests that using mirror-reversing images helps participants to avoid a significant orientation bias, either towards the figure who appears on the left-hand-side first or on the left-hand-side last, using this method.\n\nThe design of this study is mixed, involving a within-subjects design in which all participants view the same trial type conditions and receive the same syntax manipulation, and a between-subject factor of identity (whether the participant matches the figure in race or gender). We aim to investigate the extent to which mention order, when describing an interaction between two people, is influenced by relative similarity between the depicted figures and the speaker (i.e. if the figure is in the speaker\u2019s in-group they are more similar, if they are in the out-group they are less similar). To do so, we will show people images on \u2018gender trials\u2019 in which one figure is always in the participants gender in-group and the other is in their gender out-group, and images on \u2018race trials\u2019 in which one figure is always in the participant\u2019s racial in-group and the other is in their racial out-group.\n\nOn gender trials, dyads will be a man and a woman of the same race. Half of these trials will depict white man/woman dyads (\u2018White Trials\u2019) and half will depict black man/woman dyads (\u2018Black Trials\u2019). On race trials, dyads will be a white person and a black person of the same gender. Half will depict white woman/black woman dyads (\u2018Woman Trials\u2019) and half will depict white man/black man dyads (\u2018Man Trials\u2019). Participants will see 40 gender trials and 40 race trials in total.\n\nWe will cross the identity condition with a manipulation of sentence structure. In the transitive condition, participants will be instructed to produce active present progressive transitive sentences with an \u2018is\u2019 auxiliary (e.g., they will be told to use \u201cis marrying\u201d to describe a situation in which Jane and Fred are marrying each other, so they can either choose the form Jane is marrying Fred or Fred is marrying Jane) and in the conjoined condition, they will produce sentences with a conjoined subject and \u2018are\u2019 auxiliary (e.g. Jane and Fred are marrying each other or Fred and Jane are marrying each other). The transitive and intransitive conditions comprise of 40 trials respectively."}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "argue1.gif"}, "nodeId": "jb24n", "sha256": "ae2e0e16578dc11c6d2d561dc17a08e4d112526261ce80ae1fd30de6d8cfbf46", "viewUrl": "/project/t928m/files/osfstorage/5e41649df1369e030e8ab937/", "selectedFileName": "argue1.gif"}, {"data": {"name": "dance3.gif"}, "nodeId": "jb24n", "sha256": "a2f2b88c0ddf555f92e38e77de5bc1a377d30d078451a1e2e9fdd30df0462f54", "viewUrl": "/project/t928m/files/osfstorage/5e41649df1369e030e8ab934/", "selectedFileName": "dance3.gif"}, {"data": {"name": "fight5.gif"}, "nodeId": "jb24n", "sha256": "c343c23ee3f4de1a9c164106aaea9cdc7efbb541adbecb2cf2846176f61a8825", "viewUrl": "/project/t928m/files/osfstorage/5e41649df1369e030e8ab932/", "selectedFileName": "fight5.gif"}, {"data": {"name": "flirt8.gif"}, "nodeId": "jb24n", "sha256": "8f6b4560ed6a5847d7280eb3d844fc9df4b3ce6282f866cb59a4c47ffabef1c8", "viewUrl": "/project/t928m/files/osfstorage/5e41649df1369e030e8ab930/", "selectedFileName": "flirt8.gif"}], "value": ""}}}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": "We are randomising the order of trials in the memory task and language task.

We will code the dependent variable in two different ways; the proportion of trials on which participants mentioned the more socially dominant group first (man first and woman second on gender trials, white person first and black person second on race trials), and the proportion of trials on which speakers took the perspective of the person most like themselves. For this latter dependent variable, we will measure a \u2018Like Me\u2019 bias by taking the proportion of gender trials on which participants mentioned the figure of their own gender first (a Like Me Gender bias), and the proportion of race trials on which participants mentioned the figure of their own race first (a Like Me Race bias).\n\nSome of our stimuli depict interactions that may challenge expectations \u2013 e.g., intimate events on race trials which all depict same-gender interracial couples. We will take this into consideration when analysing the data, asking if response habits differ for these scenes. To explore this further, we will conduct a post-study questionnaire looking at attitudes towards these social groups. We will measure attitudes toward homosexuality using items obtained from the the European Social Survey (2002 \u2013 2010) and the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Watt &amp; Elliot, 2019) and attitudes toward interracial relationships between black and white people have been adapted from the Cross-Group Relationship Scale (Field, Kimuna &amp; Straus, 2013).

For example, if when describing race trials they habitually mention their own race first on negative and casual race trials, but do not demonstrate the same bias on intimate race trials. \n\nTo determine the extent of an orientation bias, we will measure the proportion of responses on which speakers first mentioned the figure who appeared on the left-hand-side first, or the figure who appeared on the right-hand side first.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q19": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Primary Analyses\n\nAnalysis 1 looks at the proportion mentioning the dominant group first, and whether this varies by participant gender, participant race and stimulus type. We will take an iterative approach to model building, starting by looking at participant race and participant gender as predictors of mentioning the man first or the white figure first. This mixed effects model will have a 2 * 2 design with the maximal random effects structure for model convergence:\n\nMan First/White First ~ Participant Gender * Participant Race + (1 | Subject) + (1 + Participant Gender + Participant Race | Event).\n\nFollowing this, we will add trial type as a predictor of first mention:\n\nMan First/White First ~ Participant Gender * Participant Race * [Gender Trial Type or Race Trial Type] + (1 + [Gender Trial Type or Race Trial Type] | Subject) + (1 + Participant Gender + Participant Race | Event).\n\nLastly, we will add syntax condition as a predictor:\n\nMan First/White First ~ Participant Gender * Participant Race * [Gender Trial Type or Race Trial Type] * Syntax + (1 + [Gender Trial Type or Race Trial Type] + Syntax | Subject) + (1 + Participant Gender + Participant Race | Event).\n\nIf any of the models do not converge, we will iteratively remove random effects that account for the least variance.\n\nData visualizations will be used to identify the direction of significant effects. For the \u2018man first\u2019 analysis, we expect that participant gender will be a significant predictor of mentioning the man first, with male participants more likely than chance to mention the man before the woman, while female participants will be significantly less likely to mention the man first. Following results from the original study which showed a significant effect of gender trial type, we predict that the man will be mentioned first more often on white trials than on black trials.\n\nIn our original study, the \u2018white first\u2019 analysis showed a significant main effect of participant race. We will test if this effect replicates, predicting that white participants will be more likely to mention the white figure before the black figure, while black participants will be significantly less likely to mention the white figure first. Results from the original study also showed a significant main effect of race trial type; participants mentioned the white figure first more often on man trials than on women trials, and so we will test if this effect replicates with these new stimuli.\n\nAnalysis 2 focus on the \u201cLike Me\u201d analysis, and looks at the proportion of trials on which participants mention the figure most like them first, and the extent to which this varies by participant gender, participant race, stimulus type and sentence type. As above, we will take an iterative approach to model building, starting by looking at participant gender and participant race as predictors of a Like Me Gender or Like Me Race bias: This is a 2 * 2 design, analysed using a mixed effects model with the maximal random effects structure for model convergence, e.g:\n\nLike Me Gender/Race ~ Participant Gender * Participant Race + (1 | Subject) + (1 + Participant Gender + Participant Race | Event).\n\nFollowing this, we will add trial type as a fixed effect:\n\nLike Me Gender/Race ~ Participant Gender * Participant Race * [Gender Trial Type or Race Trial Type] + (1 + [Gender Trial Type or Race Trial Type] | Subject) + (1 + Participant Gender + Participant Race | Event).\n\nAnd lastly, we will add syntax condition as a forth predictor of a Like Me Gender/Race bias:\n\nLike Me Gender/Race ~ Participant Gender * Participant Race * [Gender Trial Type or Race Trial Type] * Syntax + (1 + [Gender Trial Type or Race Trial Type] + Syntax | Subject) + (1 + Participant Gender + Participant Race | Event).\n\nWe will follow the same method of model simplification as above. The purpose of this analysis is to determine if all four demographic groups, trial types and syntax conditions are just as likely to demonstrate a Like Me Gender/Race bias or if there are differences between the groups, and if it is more likely to occur on some stimuli or sentence types over others (comparing black/white gender trials, man/woman race trials, and transitive/conjoined sentences).\n\nIf our Like Me hypothesis is supported in this replication study, participants will be more likely to firstly mention the character that matches their gender/race, as indicated by a significant intercept in the regression (e.g. a \u2018Like Me Gender\u2019 bias would be demonstrated by a woman participant mentioning the woman first on gender trials, and a \u2018Like Me Race\u2019 bias would be demonstrated by a black participant mentioning the black figure first on race trials).\n\nFor the Like Me Gender analysis in our original study, we found a significant intercept, significant main effects of syntax and participant gender, and a significant interaction between participant gender and gender trial type. For the Like Me Race analysis, we found a significant intercept and interaction between participant race and race trial type, but no main effect of participant race or gender, trial type or syntax. We will test if these results from the original study replicate. Again, data visualizations will be used to identify the direction of significant effects.\n\nTo determine if men and women both show a Like Me Gender bias, we will run two separate models for each participant gender. These models will include the fixed effects of participant race, trial type and syntax. Will we do a similar analysis for race trials, running two models for black and white participants individually to determine if they independently show a Like Me Race bias. These models will include the fixed effects of participant gender, trial type and syntax.\n\nWe are also interested in how event type influenced mention order biases, and will therefore run models with valence condition as a fixed effect, along participant gender, participant race, trial type and syntax, as predictors of the man first, white first, Like Me Gender and Like Me Race biases. We will see if the results from our original study replicate; that valence was a significant predictor of the man first bias. It did not have a significant main effect on the Like Me Gender bias, but did show a significant interaction with participant gender.\n\nWe will then run individual models for each of the valence conditions, to determine if a Like Me Gender/Race bias manifests on all three event types (intimate, negative and casual), as demonstrated by a significant intercept. We will predict the Like Me Gender/Race bias from the fixed effects of participant gender, participant race, trial type and syntax.\n\nLastly, we will run regressions to analyse the questionnaire data, by taking each participants\u2019 average score for their attitude towards homosexuality and interracial relationships independently and using these as predictors of demonstrating a Like Me Race bias overall and on each event type, with a particular interest in intimate events. Individual items will be excluded from the analysis if they demonstrate a very low item-total correlation, as determined by falling below 0.5 Cronbach's \u03b1. We will also take an iterative approach to model building here, beginning by looking at attitudes towards homosexuality and interracial relationships as predictors of a Like Me Race bias: \n\nLike Me Race ~ Scale(Homosexuality_Attitude) * Scale(Interracial_Attitude) + (1 | Subject) + (1 + Scale(Homosexuality_Attitude) + Scale(Interracial_Attitude) | Event).\n\nNext, we will add participant gender and participant race as predictors in the model:\n\nLike Me Race ~ Scale(Homosexuality_Attitude) * Scale(Interracial_Attitude) * Participant Gender * Participant Race + (1 | Subject) + (1 + Participant Gender + Participant Race + Scale(Homosexuality_Attitude) + Scale(Interracial_Attitude) | Event).\n\nThen we will add trial type as a predictor of demonstrating a Like Me Race bias:\n\nLike Me Race ~ Scale(Homosexuality_Attitude) * Scale(Interracial_Attitude) * Participant Gender * Participant Race * Race Trial Type + (1 + Race Trial Type | Subject) + (1 + Participant Gender + Participant Race + Scale(Homosexuality_Attitude) + Scale(Interracial_Attitude) | Event).\n\nAnd, finally, we will add syntax as a fixed effect in the model:\n\nLike Me Race ~ Scale(Homosexuality_Attitude) * Scale(Interracial_Attitude) * Participant Gender * Participant Race * Race Trial Type * Syntax + (1 + Race Trial Type + Syntax | Subject) + (1 + Participant Gender + Participant Race + Scale(Homosexuality_Attitude) + Scale(Interracial_Attitude) | Event).\n\nWe will iteratively remove random effects that account for the least variance on models that do not converge.\n\n\n\t\nSecondary Analyses\n\nWe will also repeat the secondary control analyses conducted in our first study. First, we will investigate the effects of participant age as a predictor of mention order (though we do not predict a significant effect of age, as in the original experiment), and a change in preferred mention order across the experiment timeline (i.e. does the strength of a mention order bias change between the start and the end of the experiment). We will test if our findings from the original study replicate; firstly that the bias towards mentioning men first decreases over the course of the experiment and the Like Me Gender bias increases, particularly for female participants. Secondly, that the Like Me Race bias decreases over the course of the experiment.\n\nA further control analysis examines participants\u2019 accuracy at remembering the names of the photographed figures. If participant groups systematically differ in their ability to remember the names of different figures (e.g., white men participants making fewer mistakes on white men\u2019s names), we would have to consider this as an explanation for potential differences in mention order. Therefore we will investigate the data collected during the first round of the memory task, to determine if participants showed a bias for remembering stimuli of particular demographics. Our measure of accuracy will be correct guesses on each trial. To analyse, we will run a model predicting accuracy by participant gender and race, and stimuli gender and race. Following the results from the original experiment, we do not expect to find either of these fixed effects to significantly predict accuracy.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q21": {"extra": [], "value": "We will use the standard p&lt;.05 criteria for determining if the regressions suggest that the results are significantly different from those expected if the null hypothesis were correct."}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Trials will be excluded where the participant does not use the correct syntax in their descriptions (e.g. they are given \u201cis hugging\u201d for a transitive description prompt and respond with an intransitive \u201cMike and Beth are hugging each other\u201d) or the correct names for the figures (e.g. they type \u201cFred and Beth\u201d instead of \u201cMike and Beth\u201d).

It explores the possibility of a \u2018Like Me\u2019 hierarchy that goes beyond a most animate &gt; least animate hierarchical word ordering, whereby speakers ascribe the position of first-mention to the figure that is most like themselves in identity over someone less similar, when describing an interaction between two figures.\n\nIn this study, participants will describe photographs of two actors interacting, who will differ in either gender (\u2018gender trials\u2019 show man/woman dyads) or race (\u2018race trials\u2019 show black/white dyads). Participants will be either black or white men and women, and will describe these scenes using so-called symmetrical predicates (Gleitman, Gleitman, Miller, &amp; Ostrin, 1996). These are verbs that imply a symmetry of action between the two figures (e.g. arguing, kissing, touching), but when used in a sentence they require the speaker to make a decision as to which figure should be mentioned first, which may be potentially conditioned on a factor such as animacy.\n\nParticipants will form either transitive (e.g. \u201cJane is arguing with Fred\u201d) or conjoined sentences (e.g. \u201cJane and Fred are arguing with each other\u201d) to describe the events, which they will type into a text box. We will measure if participants routinely take the perspective of one actor over another, i.e. by mentioning them first in their event descriptions, and we will assess how this varies based on the identity of the actor and the identity of the participant.\n\nResults from the original study supported a \u2018Like Me\u2019 explanation for word order choices to an extent, with participants tending to mention the figure of their own gender or race first. However, there were cases where speakers demonstrated a bias in the opposite direction. For example, black and white women were more likely to mention the black woman first and black man second on black gender trials, as predicted, but black women were proportionally more likely to mention the white man first and white woman second on white gender trials, contrary to our predictions, and white women showed no significant bias in either direction.\n\nWe must therefore also consider that there are aspects of how particular social groups are perceived which might influence the types of people we consider to be appropriate \u201cagents\u201d and \u201cpatients\u201d of events. To understand the decisions a speaker might make about these thematic roles, we will address research from social psychology on biased attitudes and stereotyping. For example, we will consider gendered notions of leadership that favour men over women (Koenig, Eagly, Mitchell, &amp; Ristikari, 2011) and white people over racial minorities as appropriate leaders (Rosette, Leonardelli, &amp; Phillips, 2008), and how individual differences in attitudes towards social groups may influence such biases (Hoyt &amp; Simon, 2016). We will question if biased notions of what makes a prototypical leader or who is perceived as dominant will translate into who speakers perceive as agents in our scenes. For example, research that has taken an intersectional perspective suggests that non-black people perceive dominant behaviours of black women differently to that of white women or black men, but similarly to that of white men (Livingston, Rosette, &amp; Washington, 2012).\n\nAs well as differences in the higher order factors that determine how different social groups perceive these same events, another possible reason for the discrepancies in our original findings could be subtle differences in the stimuli (such as the salience of different figures) that could have impacted how attention was allocated when processing the events. A methodological concern of the original study is the quality of the stimuli; on many trials, the two figures differed notably in height (with most men taller than most women) and brightness of clothing (e.g. one figure wearing black while the other was wearing white). In order to discount visual salience as influencing our results, we are running the replication study with a new stimuli set, with figures close in height and wearing coloured clothing of a similar brightness.", "q4": "First, we hypothesise that there will be effects of race identity and gender identity on perspective-taking. We will measure perspective-taking by recording who participants mention first in their descriptions. We hypothesise that participants will demonstrate a tendency to mention the figure most like themselves first, i.e. the figure who shares either the same racial or gender identity as the participant. For example, we predict that men will mention the man figure before the woman figure on gender trials (those depicting man/woman dyads), and white participants will mention the white figure before the black figure on the race trials (those depicting black/white dyads). As this study is a replication, these predictions are responses to the original experiment, which found significant Like Me bias effects on both gender and race trials. \n\nSecond, we hypothesise that there will be an effect of syntax on mention order. Half of the descriptions participants will produce will involve them constructing either transitive sentences, in which one participant is the agent and one the patient (e.g. Person A is marrying Person B), or conjoined sentences, in which both participants are agents (e.g. Person A and Person B are marrying each other. The addition of \u201ceach other\u201d on conjoined sentences is for the purpose of creating the perception of a more symmetrical event than those described with transitive sentences (Gleitman et al., 1996). We predict that participants will be more likely to demonstrate a \u2018Like Me\u2019 bias on transitive sentences than on conjoined sentences, as one figure is given greater agenthood than the other and the speaker is required to make judgements of grammatical function (Branigan, Pickering, &amp; Tanaka, 2008).\n\nIn the original study, we found a significant main effect of syntax on gender trials (p &lt; .05) with a stronger Like Me Gender bias appearing on transitive trials, but not on race trials.\nWe will explore the interaction between race and gender on first mention. For instance, we will investigate if participants will be more likely to mention the figure matching their own gender first if that figure is also of the same race as themselves, and are more likely to mention the figure matching their own race if that figure is also the same gender as the participant.\n\nWe will also consider how event type might influence mention order, by looking at the valence of the events. Dancing, flirting, kissing, marrying will initially be considered intimate events, arguing, shouting and fighting will be considered negative events, and playing, talking and touching will be coded as casual events. We will measure if patterns of first mention differ between valence conditions (intimate, negative and casual); e.g. we will ask if participants are more likely to demonstrate word order biases on one valence condition than the others.\n\nWe will run a factor analysis post-hoc on one participant demographic group (e.g. white men) to determine if our event classifications are appropriate. We will see, based on responses to each event, if the interactions in our three assumed valence groups should in fact be classed with each other (i.e. playing, talking and touching as casual events) due to participants responding similarly to them and differently to the others. \n\nOn gender trials, based on the results of the original study, we predict that participants will mention the man figure first more consistently on intimate events than on casual or negative events, and that when the woman figure is mentioned first this will occur more often on negative events than on casual or intimate events. We will also determine if the effect of trial type replicates; that the Like Me Gender bias was strongest in female participants when they were describing trials depicting black dyads in negative events, and was strongest in male participants when they were describing trials depicting white dyads in intimate events.\n\nOn race trials, again referring to the results of the original study, we predict that black participants will show a tendency to mention the black figure first most often on positive events, and that white participants will show a tendency to mention the white participant first most often on negative events.\n\nWe will also measure if the Like Me Gender/Like Me Race biases manifest when analysing each valence condition independently.\n\nWe consider how the nature of these events may elicit different responses in participants due to attitudes towards particular social groups. Specifically, responses to intimate events between people of the same gender, and between people of different races, might be influenced by the speaker\u2019s attitudes toward homosexuality and interracial relationships respectively. To explore this possibility, we are including a post-study questionnaire to address attitudes towards these two social factors and will use logistic regressions to determine if they had an influence on perceptions of agency on race trials. We predict deviations from predictable patterns of behaviour (i.e. showing a Like Me Race bias) will most likely occur on trials that contradict the speaker\u2019s expectations and accepted world view (e.g. two men shown \u201cmarrying\u201d, described by a participant with negative attitudes towards homosexuality).", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

The photographs are of similar size and the actors wear clothes of a similar brightness, to control for visual salience. We will ask participants to memorise the names and portraits. Next, they will complete a memory task, in which they will have to match the portrait with the correct name. Participants repeat this memory task until they score 100% correct, whereupon they begin the language task. Additionally, to ensure participants remain accurate at naming the photographs, the same memory task will repeat after every 20 trials of the language task, and participants will again have to score 100% correct to continue the language task.\n\nOn each critical trial of the language task, participants will view an image of two of the photographed people interacting in a symmetrical event (e.g., touching each other, shouting at each other, hugging each other, etc). They are then shown a sentence fragment (e.g., \u201cis touching\u201d), and they complete the sentence (e.g., writing \u201cJane is touching Fred\u201d).  The images are formatted as graphics interchange format (GIF) animations, such that the image switches with its Left-Right mirror image twice per second. This is done to ensure that the two photographed people each appear on the left-hand-side and right-hand-side twice, so as to account for English speakers\u2019 tendency to mention the figure who appears on the left first. This is considered to be a reading effect; many adults demonstrate the tendency to look in the order they are used to reading in. This scanning habit is then reflected in the speaker\u2019s subject-verb-object structure (Maass &amp; Russo, 2003). Our prior data suggests that using mirror-reversing images helps participants to avoid a significant orientation bias, either towards the figure who appears on the left-hand-side first or on the left-hand-side last, using this method.\n\nThe design of this study is mixed, involving a within-subjects design in which all participants view the same trial type conditions and receive the same syntax manipulation, and a between-subject factor of identity (whether the participant matches the figure in race or gender). We aim to investigate the extent to which mention order, when describing an interaction between two people, is influenced by relative similarity between the depicted figures and the speaker (i.e. if the figure is in the speaker\u2019s in-group they are more similar, if they are in the out-group they are less similar). To do so, we will show people images on \u2018gender trials\u2019 in which one figure is always in the participants gender in-group and the other is in their gender out-group, and images on \u2018race trials\u2019 in which one figure is always in the participant\u2019s racial in-group and the other is in their racial out-group.\n\nOn gender trials, dyads will be a man and a woman of the same race. Half of these trials will depict white man/woman dyads (\u2018White Trials\u2019) and half will depict black man/woman dyads (\u2018Black Trials\u2019). On race trials, dyads will be a white person and a black person of the same gender. Half will depict white woman/black woman dyads (\u2018Woman Trials\u2019) and half will depict white man/black man dyads (\u2018Man Trials\u2019). Participants will see 40 gender trials and 40 race trials in total.\n\nWe will cross the identity condition with a manipulation of sentence structure. In the transitive condition, participants will be instructed to produce active present progressive transitive sentences with an \u2018is\u2019 auxiliary (e.g., they will be told to use \u201cis marrying\u201d to describe a situation in which Jane and Fred are marrying each other, so they can either choose the form Jane is marrying Fred or Fred is marrying Jane) and in the conjoined condition, they will produce sentences with a conjoined subject and \u2018are\u2019 auxiliary (e.g. Jane and Fred are marrying each other or Fred and Jane are marrying each other). The transitive and intransitive conditions comprise of 40 trials respectively.", "q8.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e41649df1369e030e8ab937", "file_name": "argue1.gif", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/t928m/files/osfstorage/5e41649df1369e030e8ab937", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e41649df1369e030e8ab937"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "ae2e0e16578dc11c6d2d561dc17a08e4d112526261ce80ae1fd30de6d8cfbf46"}}, {"file_id": "5e41649df1369e030e8ab934", "file_name": "dance3.gif", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/t928m/files/osfstorage/5e41649df1369e030e8ab934", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e41649df1369e030e8ab934"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "a2f2b88c0ddf555f92e38e77de5bc1a377d30d078451a1e2e9fdd30df0462f54"}}, {"file_id": "5e41649df1369e030e8ab932", "file_name": "fight5.gif", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/t928m/files/osfstorage/5e41649df1369e030e8ab932", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e41649df1369e030e8ab932"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "c343c23ee3f4de1a9c164106aaea9cdc7efbb541adbecb2cf2846176f61a8825"}}, {"file_id": "5e41649df1369e030e8ab930", "file_name": "flirt8.gif", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/t928m/files/osfstorage/5e41649df1369e030e8ab930", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e41649df1369e030e8ab930"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "8f6b4560ed6a5847d7280eb3d844fc9df4b3ce6282f866cb59a4c47ffabef1c8"}}], "q12.question": "This study will be run online via the platform Prolific Academic.

We will code the dependent variable in two different ways; the proportion of trials on which participants mentioned the more socially dominant group first (man first and woman second on gender trials, white person first and black person second on race trials), and the proportion of trials on which speakers took the perspective of the person most like themselves. For this latter dependent variable, we will measure a \u2018Like Me\u2019 bias by taking the proportion of gender trials on which participants mentioned the figure of their own gender first (a Like Me Gender bias), and the proportion of race trials on which participants mentioned the figure of their own race first (a Like Me Race bias).\n\nSome of our stimuli depict interactions that may challenge expectations \u2013 e.g., intimate events on race trials which all depict same-gender interracial couples. We will take this into consideration when analysing the data, asking if response habits differ for these scenes. To explore this further, we will conduct a post-study questionnaire looking at attitudes towards these social groups. We will measure attitudes toward homosexuality using items obtained from the the European Social Survey (2002 \u2013 2010) and the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Watt &amp; Elliot, 2019) and attitudes toward interracial relationships between black and white people have been adapted from the Cross-Group Relationship Scale (Field, Kimuna &amp; Straus, 2013). Questions will be answered on a 5 Point Likert scale and respondents will also have a \u201cDo not want to say\u201d option to allow them to miss questions they do not wish to answer.\n\nWe will measure if scores relating to attitudes towards homosexuality or interracial relations act as predictors of the Like Me Race biases (e.g. if the likelihood of a participant demonstrating a Like Me Race bias decreases the more negatively the participant scores on the homosexuality attitudes scale). We will not do this for the Like Me Gender bias, as gender trials all depict different-gender and same-race pairs.\n\nWe will measure if participants who demonstrate notably negative attitudes regarding homosexuality or interracial relationships also demonstrate significant differences in responses to homosexual or interracial intimate scenes compared to heterosexual or same-race intimate scenes. For example, if when describing race trials they habitually mention their own race first on negative and casual race trials, but do not demonstrate the same bias on intimate race trials. \n\nTo determine the extent of an orientation bias, we will measure the proportion of responses on which speakers first mentioned the figure who appeared on the left-hand-side first, or the figure who appeared on the right-hand side first.\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Primary Analyses\n\nAnalysis 1 looks at the proportion mentioning the dominant group first, and whether this varies by participant gender, participant race and stimulus type. We will take an iterative approach to model building, starting by looking at participant race and participant gender as predictors of mentioning the man first or the white figure first. This mixed effects model will have a 2 * 2 design with the maximal random effects structure for model convergence:\n\nMan First/White First ~ Participant Gender * Participant Race + (1 | Subject) + (1 + Participant Gender + Participant Race | Event).\n\nFollowing this, we will add trial type as a predictor of first mention:\n\nMan First/White First ~ Participant Gender * Participant Race * [Gender Trial Type or Race Trial Type] + (1 + [Gender Trial Type or Race Trial Type] | Subject) + (1 + Participant Gender + Participant Race | Event).\n\nLastly, we will add syntax condition as a predictor:\n\nMan First/White First ~ Participant Gender * Participant Race * [Gender Trial Type or Race Trial Type] * Syntax + (1 + [Gender Trial Type or Race Trial Type] + Syntax | Subject) + (1 + Participant Gender + Participant Race | Event).\n\nIf any of the models do not converge, we will iteratively remove random effects that account for the least variance.\n\nData visualizations will be used to identify the direction of significant effects. For the \u2018man first\u2019 analysis, we expect that participant gender will be a significant predictor of mentioning the man first, with male participants more likely than chance to mention the man before the woman, while female participants will be significantly less likely to mention the man first. Following results from the original study which showed a significant effect of gender trial type, we predict that the man will be mentioned first more often on white trials than on black trials.\n\nIn our original study, the \u2018white first\u2019 analysis showed a significant main effect of participant race. We will test if this effect replicates, predicting that white participants will be more likely to mention the white figure before the black figure, while black participants will be significantly less likely to mention the white figure first. Results from the original study also showed a significant main effect of race trial type; participants mentioned the white figure first more often on man trials than on women trials, and so we will test if this effect replicates with these new stimuli.\n\nAnalysis 2 focus on the \u201cLike Me\u201d analysis, and looks at the proportion of trials on which participants mention the figure most like them first, and the extent to which this varies by participant gender, participant race, stimulus type and sentence type. As above, we will take an iterative approach to model building, starting by looking at participant gender and participant race as predictors of a Like Me Gender or Like Me Race bias: This is a 2 * 2 design, analysed using a mixed effects model with the maximal random effects structure for model convergence, e.g:\n\nLike Me Gender/Race ~ Participant Gender * Participant Race + (1 | Subject) + (1 + Participant Gender + Participant Race | Event).\n\nFollowing this, we will add trial type as a fixed effect:\n\nLike Me Gender/Race ~ Participant Gender * Participant Race * [Gender Trial Type or Race Trial Type] + (1 + [Gender Trial Type or Race Trial Type] | Subject) + (1 + Participant Gender + Participant Race | Event).\n\nAnd lastly, we will add syntax condition as a forth predictor of a Like Me Gender/Race bias:\n\nLike Me Gender/Race ~ Participant Gender * Participant Race * [Gender Trial Type or Race Trial Type] * Syntax + (1 + [Gender Trial Type or Race Trial Type] + Syntax | Subject) + (1 + Participant Gender + Participant Race | Event).\n\nWe will follow the same method of model simplification as above. The purpose of this analysis is to determine if all four demographic groups, trial types and syntax conditions are just as likely to demonstrate a Like Me Gender/Race bias or if there are differences between the groups, and if it is more likely to occur on some stimuli or sentence types over others (comparing black/white gender trials, man/woman race trials, and transitive/conjoined sentences).\n\nIf our Like Me hypothesis is supported in this replication study, participants will be more likely to firstly mention the character that matches their gender/race, as indicated by a significant intercept in the regression (e.g. a \u2018Like Me Gender\u2019 bias would be demonstrated by a woman participant mentioning the woman first on gender trials, and a \u2018Like Me Race\u2019 bias would be demonstrated by a black participant mentioning the black figure first on race trials).\n\nFor the Like Me Gender analysis in our original study, we found a significant intercept, significant main effects of syntax and participant gender, and a significant interaction between participant gender and gender trial type. For the Like Me Race analysis, we found a significant intercept and interaction between participant race and race trial type, but no main effect of participant race or gender, trial type or syntax. We will test if these results from the original study replicate. Again, data visualizations will be used to identify the direction of significant effects.\n\nTo determine if men and women both show a Like Me Gender bias, we will run two separate models for each participant gender. These models will include the fixed effects of participant race, trial type and syntax. Will we do a similar analysis for race trials, running two models for black and white participants individually to determine if they independently show a Like Me Race bias. These models will include the fixed effects of participant gender, trial type and syntax.\n\nWe are also interested in how event type influenced mention order biases, and will therefore run models with valence condition as a fixed effect, along participant gender, participant race, trial type and syntax, as predictors of the man first, white first, Like Me Gender and Like Me Race biases. We will see if the results from our original study replicate; that valence was a significant predictor of the man first bias. It did not have a significant main effect on the Like Me Gender bias, but did show a significant interaction with participant gender.\n\nWe will then run individual models for each of the valence conditions, to determine if a Like Me Gender/Race bias manifests on all three event types (intimate, negative and casual), as demonstrated by a significant intercept. We will predict the Like Me Gender/Race bias from the fixed effects of participant gender, participant race, trial type and syntax.\n\nLastly, we will run regressions to analyse the questionnaire data, by taking each participants\u2019 average score for their attitude towards homosexuality and interracial relationships independently and using these as predictors of demonstrating a Like Me Race bias overall and on each event type, with a particular interest in intimate events. Individual items will be excluded from the analysis if they demonstrate a very low item-total correlation, as determined by falling below 0.5 Cronbach's \u03b1. We will also take an iterative approach to model building here, beginning by looking at attitudes towards homosexuality and interracial relationships as predictors of a Like Me Race bias: \n\nLike Me Race ~ Scale(Homosexuality_Attitude) * Scale(Interracial_Attitude) + (1 | Subject) + (1 + Scale(Homosexuality_Attitude) + Scale(Interracial_Attitude) | Event).\n\nNext, we will add participant gender and participant race as predictors in the model:\n\nLike Me Race ~ Scale(Homosexuality_Attitude) * Scale(Interracial_Attitude) * Participant Gender * Participant Race + (1 | Subject) + (1 + Participant Gender + Participant Race + Scale(Homosexuality_Attitude) + Scale(Interracial_Attitude) | Event).\n\nThen we will add trial type as a predictor of demonstrating a Like Me Race bias:\n\nLike Me Race ~ Scale(Homosexuality_Attitude) * Scale(Interracial_Attitude) * Participant Gender * Participant Race * Race Trial Type + (1 + Race Trial Type | Subject) + (1 + Participant Gender + Participant Race + Scale(Homosexuality_Attitude) + Scale(Interracial_Attitude) | Event).\n\nAnd, finally, we will add syntax as a fixed effect in the model:\n\nLike Me Race ~ Scale(Homosexuality_Attitude) * Scale(Interracial_Attitude) * Participant Gender * Participant Race * Race Trial Type * Syntax + (1 + Race Trial Type + Syntax | Subject) + (1 + Participant Gender + Participant Race + Scale(Homosexuality_Attitude) + Scale(Interracial_Attitude) | Event).\n\nWe will iteratively remove random effects that account for the least variance on models that do not converge.\n\n\n\t\nSecondary Analyses\n\nWe will also repeat the secondary control analyses conducted in our first study. First, we will investigate the effects of participant age as a predictor of mention order (though we do not predict a significant effect of age, as in the original experiment), and a change in preferred mention order across the experiment timeline (i.e. does the strength of a mention order bias change between the start and the end of the experiment). We will test if our findings from the original study replicate; firstly that the bias towards mentioning men first decreases over the course of the experiment and the Like Me Gender bias increases, particularly for female participants. Secondly, that the Like Me Race bias decreases over the course of the experiment.\n\nA further control analysis examines participants\u2019 accuracy at remembering the names of the photographed figures. If participant groups systematically differ in their ability to remember the names of different figures (e.g., white men participants making fewer mistakes on white men\u2019s names), we would have to consider this as an explanation for potential differences in mention order. Therefore we will investigate the data collected during the first round of the memory task, to determine if participants showed a bias for remembering stimuli of particular demographics. Our measure of accuracy will be correct guesses on each trial. To analyse, we will run a model predicting accuracy by participant gender and race, and stimuli gender and race. Following the results from the original experiment, we do not expect to find either of these fixed effects to significantly predict accuracy.\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=t928m", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "t928m", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "t928m", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/z6r7f/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "z6r7f", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jb24n/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "jb24n", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/t928m/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/t928m/"}}, {"id": "b8vuw", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Protocol: Integrated Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Western Medicine Therapies for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis", "description": "This is a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Patients with acute lung injury (ALI) will be excluded from this review.\n\n7. Intervention(s), exposure(s): Patients with ARDS randomized to receive TCM adjuvant therapies combined with modern medicine therapies as exponential treatment versus control treatment (modern medicine therapies alone or TCM therapies alone or other therapies). \nTCM adjuvant therapies include such as acupoint application, TCM decoction, Chinese patent medicine, TCM injection, external application of TCM, TCM granule, TCM pellet and TCM electuary.

Six elements will be assessed: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, free of selective reporting, and other bias. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion with a third party.\n\n14. Strategy for data synthesis: Statistical analyses will be performed using RevMan 5.3 software (The Cochrane Collaboration).\n- Pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of dichotomous outcomes will be used to report effect estimate.\n- Continuous data will be presented as mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. If different measurement scales are used, standardized mean difference (SMD) will be performed to analyze continuous data.\nIf required data are not reported, we will try to obtain data from corresponding author.\nHeterogeneity will be assessed using both the \u03c7\u00b2 test and the I\u00b2 statistic, and we will consider an I\u00b2 value greater than 50% indicative of substantial heterogeneity.\n- For I\u00b2&lt;50%, a fixed-effect model is used.\n- For I\u00b2 &gt;=50%, a random-effect model is applied.\nIf data permit, we plan to exclude some trials that contribuite most to the heterogeneity to see whether the result change or not.\nWe will also use a summary of findings table to present the main findings using GRADEpro software (The Cochrane Collaboration). Funnel plots will be generated to detect publication bias if more than 10 trials are identified to report the same outcomes. If appropriate, we will use cumulative meta-analyses. Results of meta-analyses will be visualized by forest plots. In addition, we will conduct trial sequential analysis to evaluate the meta-analyses for primary outcomes, which can reveal the required information size and potentially false results in a meta-analysis. Intention-to-treat analysis will be applied for primary outcome, if missing data from the original trials are available.\n\n15. Analysis of subgroups or subsets: If data permitted, we plan to conduct subgroup analyses for different groups, including:\nDifferent age of patients\nDifferent severity of disease\nDifferent regimen applied\nDifferent treat time\nDifferent acupoints selected\nCombined with other interventions or not.\n\n16.

ARDS is one of the most common critical diseases in clinic. It has the characteristics of acute onset and high mortality. ARDS is also a serious and important clinical syndrome of SARS and the Wuhan coronavirus (CoV) [1]. It was reported that 12 of 41 first reported Wuhan coronavirus (CoV) patients were suffered from ARDS [1], and there have been reports of more than 7500 human infection with more than 130 death in 17 countries among Asia, Australia and North America till 30th Jan.\nAt present, modern medicine therapies for ARDS include treatment of primary diseases, respiratory support and drug treatment mainly. However, their safety and efficacy have yet to be further assessed, and some of them have significant adverse effects. An experiment show that high dose of glucocorticoid can increase the probability of nosocomial infection [2], and propositional ventilation can also increase the risk of pressure ulcers and airway obstruction [3]. A review also reveals that preserving the autonomic respiratory function of ARDS patients without NMBAs helps to reduce the imbalance of ventilation / blood flow and the acquired weakness of ICU [4].\nIn recent years, TCM therapies has shown great advantages in the treatment of ARDS.\n\n\n[1] Chaolin Huang, Yeming Wang, Xingwang Li, et al.

Condition or domain being studied: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a kind of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema caused by the injury of pulmonary capillary endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells under the condition of severe infection, shock and trauma, which leads to progressive hypoxemia and dyspnea. ARDS is one of the most common critical diseases in clinic. It has the characteristics of acute onset and high mortality. ARDS is also a serious and important clinical syndrome of SARS and the Wuhan coronavirus (CoV) [1]. It was reported that 12 of 41 first reported Wuhan coronavirus (CoV) patients were suffered from ARDS [1], and there have been reports of more than 7500 human infection with more than 130 death in 17 countries among Asia, Australia and North America till 30th Jan.\nAt present, modern medicine therapies for ARDS include treatment of primary diseases, respiratory support and drug treatment mainly. However, their safety and efficacy have yet to be further assessed, and some of them have significant adverse effects. An experiment show that high dose of glucocorticoid can increase the probability of nosocomial infection [2], and propositional ventilation can also increase the risk of pressure ulcers and airway obstruction [3]. A review also reveals that preserving the autonomic respiratory function of ARDS patients without NMBAs helps to reduce the imbalance of ventilation / blood flow and the acquired weakness of ICU [4].\nIn recent years, TCM therapies has shown great advantages in the treatment of ARDS.\n[1] Chaolin Huang, Yeming Wang, Xingwang Li, et al.

EMIS 2017 was a cross-sectional survey of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men in 50 countries between 18 October 2017 and 31 January 2018. The study was conducted by Sigma Research at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) in association with the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin. The EMIS 2017 study is described in detail here.  \n\nQ6: Specify whether this data is open or publicly available.\n\u2022\tThe data is not openly accessible. \n \nQ7: How can the data be accessed? Provide a persistent identifier or link if the data are available online, or give a description of how you obtained the dataset.\n\u2022\tEMIS data for scientific articles can only be requested by members of the EMIS network. This network includes people involved in the development and dissemination of EMIS 2017 or the preparation and oversight of the national reports. The authors of the current study were involved in the oversight of the national report on EMIS 2017 for Ireland.\n\n Q8: Specify the date of download and/or access.\n\u2022\tThe raw data has not been accessed yet. Permission to use this data was granted on November 29th 2019 but it will not be transferred until a data transfer agreement has been signed by a legal representative of NUI Galway and returned to SIGMA research. When this is signed and processed by SIGMA research, Dr. Chris Noone will be given access to the raw data. Summary data for the Irish EMIS 2017 dataset was published on October 3rd 2017 and is available in the national report here: http://sigmaresearch.org.uk/files/local/EMIS-2017_National-Report_IE_Main.pdf\n\n Q9: If the data collection procedure is well documented, provide a link to that information. If the data collection procedure is not well documented, describe, to the best of your ability, how data were collected.\n\u2022\tParticipants in this survey were men who have sex with men who were over the age of sexual consent in their country. Convenience sampling was employed, and the survey was promoted through traditional media, social media, dating apps, and NGO websites. 2,083 men provided data for the Irish EMIS 2017 dataset.\n\u2022\tData collection for the full EMIS 2017 dataset is available in the overall report here: https://www.esticom.eu/Webs/ESTICOM/EN/emis-2017/survey-report/EMIS_2017_REPORT_ECDC.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1. Additional detail specific to Ireland is available here: http://sigmaresearch.org.uk/files/local/EMIS-2017_National-Report_IE_Main.pdf\n\nQ10: Some studies offer codebooks to describe their data. If such a codebook is publicly available, link to it here or upload the document. If not, provide other available documentation. Also provide guidance on what parts of the codebook or other documentation are most relevant.\n\u2022\tThe EMIS 2017 Variable Manual is available at http://sigmaresearch.org.uk/files/EMIS-2017-Variable-Manual.pdf\n\nPart 3: Variables\nQ11: If you are going to use any manipulated variables, identify them here. Describe the variables and the levels or treatment arms of each variable (note that this is not applicable for observational studies and meta-analyses). If you are collapsing groups across variables this should be explicitly stated, including the relevant formula.\n\u2022\tThis is an observational study. \n\nQ12: If you are going to use any measured variables, identify them here. Describe both outcome measures as well as predictors and covariates and label them accordingly. If you are using a scale (a set of items that have an underlying latent construct) or an index (a set of items that directly indicate a value or quantity), state the construct the scale/index represents, which items the scale/index will consist of, how these items will be aggregated, and whether this aggregation is based on a recommendation from the study codebook or validation research. If you are using any categorical variables, state how you will code them in the statistical analyses.\n\n\u2022\tDemographic Variables  \no\tAge (Q007): This is an interval level variable where values represent the number of years of age of the participant. This will be used as a covariate in models.\no\tEducation (Q400): This is an interval level variable where values represent the number of years spent in full-time education since the age of 16 by the participant. This will be used as a covariate in models. \no\tSettlement Size (Q011): This variable has 5 ordinal categories (1=A very big city or town (a million or more people), 2=A big city or town (500,000-999,999 people), 3=A medium-sized city or town (100,000-499,999 people), 4=A small city or town (10,000-99,999 people), 5=A village / the countryside (less than 10,000 people)). This will be recoded to a binary variable representing whether participants live in  very big city or town (1) or not (0). Since a very big city is defined as having a population of over one million, and Dublin is the only city of this size in Ireland, this will effectively represent whether participants are based in Dublin or not. This is important to include as a covariate in the model as the amount of sexual health services, social resources and gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men is greater in Dublin than in other parts of Ireland.\no\tEthnic Minority (Q403) &amp; Name of Ethnic Group (Q404+Q405): Participants indicate in Q403 whether they are a member of an ethnic minority group or not and then write their ethnicity in response to Q404 if they indicated being part of a majority group or to Q405 if they indicated being part of a minority group. These responses will be coded according to the broad categories used in the Irish census A. White (including Irish, Irish traveller and any other White background), B. Black or Black Irish (including African or any other Black background), C. Asian or Asian Irish and D. Other (including mixed and any other ethnicities). This will therefore be a nominal variable with four categories. This will then be recoded into dummy variables with A. White (including Irish, Irish traveller and any other White background) as the reference, given that it is the largest group.  The resulting three dummy variables will be included in models as covariates.\n\n\u2022\tSexual Identity and Attraction \no\tSexual Identity (Q029): Participants could identify as gay or homosexual (81%), bisexual (13%), and straight or heterosexual (1%). They could also indicate that they use a different term (&lt;1%) or that they don\u2019t use a term (5%). Since the vast majority identified as homosexual or bisexual, the analysis will focus exclusively on these participants. A new variable will be computed which will indicate whether participants identify as homosexual (0) or bisexual (1). This will be the independent variable in the model.\no\tOutness (Q030): This is an ordinal variable where values represent the estimated proportion of people who are aware of the participant\u2019s sexual identity (1=All or almost all, 2=More than half, 3=Less than half, 4=Few, 5=None).This will be used as a moderator variable in exploratory analyses.\n\n\u2022\tSexual Health\no\tSyphilis Last Diagnosis Recency (Q162+Q163): These variables reflect whether the participants has ever been diagnosed with syphilis (Q162) and how recently their last diagnosis was (Q163). These will be used to compute a binary variable representing whether participants have been diagnosed with syphilis in the last 12 months (1) or not (0). This is an outcome variable for H1A.\no\tGonorrhoea Last Diagnosis Recency (Q165+Q166): These variables reflect whether the participants have ever been diagnosed with gonorrhoea (Q165) and how recently their last diagnosis was (Q166). These will be used to compute a binary variable representing whether participants have been diagnosed with gonorrhoea in the last 12 months (1) or not (0). This is an outcome variable for H1B.\no\tChlamydia Last Diagnosis Recency (Q168+Q169): These variables reflect whether the participants have ever been diagnosed with chlamydia (Q168) and how recently their last diagnosis was (Q169). These will be used to compute a binary variable representing whether participants have been diagnosed with chlamydia in the last 12 months (1) or not (0). This is an outcome variable for H1C.\no\tHIV Diagnosis in Past Year (Q061): This variable reflects whether those living with HIV were diagnosed in the past year (1) or not (0).\n\n\u2022\tSexual Health Behaviour\no\tFrequency of Condom for Non-Steady Intercourse (Q186): This ordinal variable reflects the frequency with which participants used condoms in non-steady sexual encounters with men (1=Never, 2=Seldom, 3=Sometimes, 4=Mostly, 5=Always). This is an outcome variable for H2A. \no\tEver Taken Prep (Q114): This variable has 5 categories (1=No, 2=Yes on a daily basis and I\u2019m still taking it, 3=Yes on a daily basis but I\u2019m no longer taking it, 4=Yes when I have needed it but not daily, 5=I don\u2019t know). This will be recoded to a binary variable indicating whether participants are currently taking PrEP (1) or not (0). This is an outcome variable for H2B.\no\tAny STI Test Recency (Q149+Q150): These variables reflect whether the participants have ever been tested for STIs and how recent their last test was. These will be used to compute a binary variable representing whether participants have been tested in the last 12 months (1) or not (0). This is an outcome variable for H2C.\n\nQ13: Which units of analysis (respondents, cases, etc.) will be included or excluded in your study? Taking these inclusion/exclusion criteria into account, indicate the (expected) sample size of the data you\u2019ll be using for your statistical analyses (to the best of your knowledge). In the next few questions, you will be asked to refine this sample size estimation based on your judgments about missing data and outliers.\n\u2022\tThe unit of analysis is individual participants. 2,083 eligible participants based in Ireland took part in EMIS 2017. Only those who identify as homosexual (n = 1,689) or bisexual (n = 250) will be included in this study. 113 men who identified as heterosexual, as an unspecified other identity or who did not identify with any particular identify label will be excluded. Therefore, the sample size at this point is 1,939. This sample size will be used for testing hypotheses related to RQ2, except for H2B. For H2B, it does not make sense to include participants who are living with HIV (n = 142) so the sample size for this hypothesis is 1,797. For the examination of hypotheses related to RQ1, the sample size must be restricted to those who have tested for STIs in the past 12 months. Approximately 55% of participants did so, therefore we expect the sample size for these hypotheses to be close to 1,066. \n \nQ14: What do you know about missing data in the data set (e.g., overall missingness rate, information about differential dropout)? How will you deal with incomplete or missing data? Based on this information, provide a new expected sample size.\n\u2022\tFrom the summary report, it is apparent that between 0 and 2% of data is missing for the variables relevant to this study. In addition, some of the items were only presented to random sub-samples. Missing data will be handled using maximum likelihood estimation so the effective sample size will remain 1,939.\n\nQ15: How will you define what a statistical outlier is in your data and what will you do when you encounter them? If you plan to remove outliers, provide a new expected sample size. Note that this will be the definitive expected sample size for your study and you will use this number to do any power analyses.\n\u2022\tThe data has already been cleaned by SIGMA research. Other secondary analyses of EMIS data have not removed outliers beyond this. We will follow this practice for univariate outliers. For multivariate outliers, we will carry out a sensitivity analysis where these are removed. We will identify multivariate outliers using the Mahalanobis Distance method and this will be achieved using the check_outliers function from the performance R package (L\u00fcdecke, Makowski, &amp; Waggoner, 2019). We will use the default threshold of considering the 2.5% most extreme values as outliers.\n\nQ16: Are there sampling weights available with this data set? If so, are you using them and how?\n\u2022\tThere are no sampling weights for this dataset. We will not create sampling weights as there is currently no reliable information on the demographics of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men in Ireland.\n\nPart 4: Knowledge of data\nQ17: List the publications, conference presentations (papers, posters), and working papers (in prep, unpublished, preprints) you have worked on that are based on the data set. Describe which variables you have previously analyzed and which information you used in these analyses. Limit yourself to variables that are relevant to the current study. If the dataset is longitudinal, include information about what wave of data was previously analyzed.\n\tImportantly, some of your team members may have used this dataset and others may not have. It is therefore important to specify the relevant work from every co-author separately. If possible, mention other researchers\u2019 work with this dataset that is relevant to the current preregistration.\n\u2022\tDescriptive summaries of this data have been presented in a national report (Casey, O\u2019Donnell, Brady &amp; Igoe, 2019). Four other studies using the Irish EMIS 2017 data focusing on different topics (chemsex, PrEP, mental health and alcohol dependency) are currently being prepared.\n\nQ18: What prior knowledge do you have at the time of preregistration about trends in the data set you will be working with? For example, are you aware of summary statistics or the statistical distribution of variables, or do you know about correlations between variables? Your prior knowledge could stem from working with the data first-hand, from reading previously published research, or from codebooks. Also provide any relevant knowledge of different subsets of the data (e.g., a different wave than you will be using). Finally, provide information about your prior knowledge for every author separately.\n\u2022\tNone of the authors have had access to the raw data yet. The only summary data which the authors have had access to is that which has been published in the national report. This report only included descriptive and univariate analyses. The codebook does not provide information about trends in the data.\n\n Part 5: Analyses\nQ19: For each hypothesis, describe the statistical model you will use to test the hypothesis. Include the type of model (e.g., ANOVA, multiple regression, SEM) and the specification of the model (this includes each variable that will be included as predictor, outcome, or covariate). Specify any interactions and post-hoc analyses and remember that any test not included here must be noted as an exploratory test in the final article.\n\u2022\tThe data will first be described using means, standard deviations, proportions, cross-tabulation and correlation coefficients, where appropriate. The analyses will be conducted in R Studio using the psych package to describe the data and the BRMS package to carry out logistic regressions. The analyses will be visualised using Ggplot2. \n\u2022\tThe first research question will be answered by conducting a series of logistic regressions assessing the effect of bisexual attraction on sexual health morbidities in the past 12 months. Separate models will be run with diagnosis of syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and HIV in the past 12 months as outcome variables. All analyses of sexual health disparities will be restricted to participants that engaged in STI testing in the previous year. The focal independent variable, sexual attraction, will be recoded to a binary variable where the reference is exclusive attraction to men. This will be compared to attraction to men and people of other genders, in line with modern conceptualisations of bisexuality. Age (continuous), years of education since the age of 16 (continuous), settlement (recoded to inside or outside Dublin), ethnic minority (dummy coded to compare being of Asian origin, African origin, Latin American origin or mixed/other origin to being of White European origin) and outness will be included in the models as covariates.\n\u2022\tThe second research question will be answered by conducting a series of analyses assessing the effect of bisexual attraction on sexual health behaviours. The same independent variable and covariates will used as in the models previously described. The outcome variables used in these models will respectively be the frequency of condom use during sex with non-steady male partners, the use of PrEP (recoded to not currently using, using as needed, and using daily) and getting an STI test in the past year (recoded to yes or no). Ordinal regression will be used to model the frequency of condom use and the use of PrEP. Logistic regression will be used to model STI testing.\n\nQ20: If applicable, specify a predicted effect size or a minimum effect size of interest for all the effects tested in your statistical analyses.\n\u2022\tThere are few studies which can inform a predicted effect size in this specific sample. A previous exploratory analysis of MSM in the UK and Ireland found an association between identifying or not as exclusively gay and recent STI diagnosis (McAloney-Kocaman et al., 2016). This association had an Odds Ratio of 1.851 (1.109\u20133.087). Men identifying as homosexual were more likely to have received an STI diagnosis. We will take the lower bound of the 95% CI for this effect size as a minimum effect size of interest for hypotheses 1A to 1C \u2013 11% lower/higher odds. Though men who identified as homosexual were more likely to have received an STI test, the association between sexual identity and STI test recency was not significant in this study 0.936 (0.612\u20131.432). In other contexts, mixed evidence has been found regarding differences in condom use between homosexual and bisexual men (Feinstein et al., 2019). This study did find that bisexual participants were less likely to have used PrEP than homosexual participants (0.43 [0.20, 0.83]) but these were young men living in the US. Given this uncertainty regarding the potential effect sizes for outcomes related to hypotheses  2A to 2C, we have decided to use the same effect size interest as specified for hypotheses 1A to 1D.\n\nQ21: Present the statistical power available to detect the predicted effect size(s) or the smallest effect size(s) of interest. Use the sample size after updating for missing data and outliers. \n\u2022\tThe following R code was used to analyse the different sample sizes required to achieve 95% power to detect an Odds Ratio of 1.11 across variation in the event rate (p1) and variance inflation factor (np). As long as p1 is no smaller than .003 and np is no largger than 0.65, then there will be 95% power to detect the effect size of interest.\nlibrary(powerMediation)\n## sample size for simple logistic regression\np1 &lt;-  0.03          # the event rate at the mean of the predictor X\nOR &lt;- exp(1.11)   # expected odds ratio. log(OR) is the change in log odds \n# for an increase of one unit in X.\n# beta*=log(OR) is the effect size to be tested\nn1 &lt;-  SSizeLogisticCon(p1, OR, alpha = 0.001, power = 0.95)\n## sample size for multiple logistic regression\n## n_p = n_1 / (1-rho^2)\n## rho^2 = R^2, for X_1 ~ X_2 + ... + X_p\nr2 &lt;- 0.65  # R^2\nnp &lt;- n1 / (1-r2)\n## variance inflation for the multiple case\nssize.multi &lt;- function(p1, OR, r2, alpha=0.001, power=0.95) {\n  n1 &lt;- SSizeLogisticCon(p1, OR, alpha, power)\n  np &lt;- n1 / (1-r2)\n  return(np)\n}\n\nQ22: What criteria will you use to make inferences? Describe the information you will use (e.g. specify the p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, Bayes factors, specific model fit indices), as well as cut-off criteria, where appropriate. Will you be using one- or two-tailed tests for each of your analyses? If you are comparing multiple conditions or testing multiple hypotheses, will you account for this, and if so, how?\n\u2022\tTwo-tailed tests will be used to examine each hypothesis. To counter the number of hypothesis tests and the large sample size, alpha will be set at .001.\n\nQ23: What will you do should your data violate assumptions, your model not converge, or some other analytic problem arises?\n\u2022\tBased on the summary information available in the national EMIS report, we don\u2019t expect any ceiling or floor effects. There may be multivariate outliers and these will be detected and removed for a sensitivity analysis (see Q15 and Q24).\n\nQ24: Provide a series of decisions about evaluating the strength, reliability, or robustness of your focal hypothesis test. This may include within-study replication attempts, additional covariates, cross-validation efforts (out-of-sample replication, spilt/hold-out sample), applying weights, selectively applying constraints in an SEM context (e.g., comparing model fit statistics), overfitting adjustment techniques used (e.g., regularization approaches such as ridge regression), or some other simulation / sampling / bootstrapping method.\n\u2022\tWe will run a sensitivity analysis with multivariate outliers removed to see if the hypothesis tests are robust to their influence.\n \nQ25: If you plan to explore your data set to look for unexpected differences or relationships, you can describe those tests here, or add them to the final paper under a heading that clearly differentiates this exploratory part of your study from the confirmatory part.\n\u2022\tExploratory models will investigate the interaction between sexual identity and outness to investigate whether any moderation effects exist for the outcomes outlined above. Sensitivity analyses focusing on same-sex behaviour and attraction, rather than identity, will also be run."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"summary": "Secondary data analysis pre-registration template (van den Akker et al., 2019)\n\nPart 1: Study information\nQ1: Provide the working title of your study.\n\u2022\tAre there Sexual Health Disparities related to Bisexual Identity among Men who have Sex with Men in Ireland?\n\nQ2: Name the authors of this preregistration.\n\u2022\tChris Noone (National University of Ireland, Galway)\n\u2022\tKate O\u2019Donnell (Health Protection and Surveillance Centre)\n\u2022\tDerval Igoe (Health Protection and Surveillance Centre)\n\u2022\tPeter Barrett (University College Cork)\n\u2022\tMartin Davoren (Sexual Health Centre)\n\u2022\tBill Foley (Gay Health Network)\n\u2022\tFord Hickson (London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine)\n\u2022\tPeter Weatherburn (London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine)\n\nQ3: List each research question included in this study.\n\u2022\tRQ1: Are there differences in sexual health morbidities between exclusively homosexual men who have sex with men and those who are bisexual?\n\u2022\tRQ2: Are there differences in sexual health behaviours between exclusively homosexual men who have sex with men and those who are bisexual?\n\nQ4: For each of the research questions listed in the previous section, provide one or more specific and testable hypotheses, and make it clear whether the hypotheses are directional or non-directional.

This will be used as a covariate in models.\no\tEducation (Q400): This is an interval level variable where values represent the number of years spent in full-time education since the age of 16 by the participant. This will be used as a covariate in models. \no\tSettlement Size (Q011): This variable has 5 ordinal categories (1=A very big city or town (a million or more people), 2=A big city or town (500,000-999,999 people), 3=A medium-sized city or town (100,000-499,999 people), 4=A small city or town (10,000-99,999 people), 5=A village / the countryside (less than 10,000 people)). This will be recoded to a binary variable representing whether participants live in  very big city or town (1) or not (0). Since a very big city is defined as having a population of over one million, and Dublin is the only city of this size in Ireland, this will effectively represent whether participants are based in Dublin or not. This is important to include as a covariate in the model as the amount of sexual health services, social resources and gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men is greater in Dublin than in other parts of Ireland.\no\tEthnic Minority (Q403) &amp; Name of Ethnic Group (Q404+Q405): Participants indicate in Q403 whether they are a member of an ethnic minority group or not and then write their ethnicity in response to Q404 if they indicated being part of a majority group or to Q405 if they indicated being part of a minority group. These responses will be coded according to the broad categories used in the Irish census A. White (including Irish, Irish traveller and any other White background), B. Black or Black Irish (including African or any other Black background), C. Asian or Asian Irish and D. Other (including mixed and any other ethnicities). This will therefore be a nominal variable with four categories. This will then be recoded into dummy variables with A. White (including Irish, Irish traveller and any other White background) as the reference, given that it is the largest group.  The resulting three dummy variables will be included in models as covariates.\n\n\u2022\tSexual Identity and Attraction \no\tSexual Identity (Q029): Participants could identify as gay or homosexual (81%), bisexual (13%), and straight or heterosexual (1%). They could also indicate that they use a different term (&lt;1%) or that they don\u2019t use a term (5%). Since the vast majority identified as homosexual or bisexual, the analysis will focus exclusively on these participants. A new variable will be computed which will indicate whether participants identify as homosexual (0) or bisexual (1). This will be the independent variable in the model.\no\tOutness (Q030): This is an ordinal variable where values represent the estimated proportion of people who are aware of the participant\u2019s sexual identity (1=All or almost all, 2=More than half, 3=Less than half, 4=Few, 5=None).This will be used as a moderator variable in exploratory analyses.\n\n\u2022\tSexual Health\no\tSyphilis Last Diagnosis Recency (Q162+Q163): These variables reflect whether the participants has ever been diagnosed with syphilis (Q162) and how recently their last diagnosis was (Q163). These will be used to compute a binary variable representing whether participants have been diagnosed with syphilis in the last 12 months (1) or not (0). This is an outcome variable for H1A.\no\tGonorrhoea Last Diagnosis Recency (Q165+Q166): These variables reflect whether the participants have ever been diagnosed with gonorrhoea (Q165) and how recently their last diagnosis was (Q166). These will be used to compute a binary variable representing whether participants have been diagnosed with gonorrhoea in the last 12 months (1) or not (0). This is an outcome variable for H1B.\no\tChlamydia Last Diagnosis Recency (Q168+Q169): These variables reflect whether the participants have ever been diagnosed with chlamydia (Q168) and how recently their last diagnosis was (Q169). These will be used to compute a binary variable representing whether participants have been diagnosed with chlamydia in the last 12 months (1) or not (0). This is an outcome variable for H1C.\no\tHIV Diagnosis in Past Year (Q061): This variable reflects whether those living with HIV were diagnosed in the past year (1) or not (0).\n\n\u2022\tSexual Health Behaviour\no\tFrequency of Condom for Non-Steady Intercourse (Q186): This ordinal variable reflects the frequency with which participants used condoms in non-steady sexual encounters with men (1=Never, 2=Seldom, 3=Sometimes, 4=Mostly, 5=Always). This is an outcome variable for H2A. \no\tEver Taken Prep (Q114): This variable has 5 categories (1=No, 2=Yes on a daily basis and I\u2019m still taking it, 3=Yes on a daily basis but I\u2019m no longer taking it, 4=Yes when I have needed it but not daily, 5=I don\u2019t know). This will be recoded to a binary variable indicating whether participants are currently taking PrEP (1) or not (0). This is an outcome variable for H2B.\no\tAny STI Test Recency (Q149+Q150): These variables reflect whether the participants have ever been tested for STIs and how recent their last test was. These will be used to compute a binary variable representing whether participants have been tested in the last 12 months (1) or not (0). This is an outcome variable for H2C.\n\nQ13: Which units of analysis (respondents, cases, etc.) will be included or excluded in your study? Taking these inclusion/exclusion criteria into account, indicate the (expected) sample size of the data you\u2019ll be using for your statistical analyses (to the best of your knowledge). In the next few questions, you will be asked to refine this sample size estimation based on your judgments about missing data and outliers.\n\u2022\tThe unit of analysis is individual participants. 2,083 eligible participants based in Ireland took part in EMIS 2017. Only those who identify as homosexual (n = 1,689) or bisexual (n = 250) will be included in this study. 113 men who identified as heterosexual, as an unspecified other identity or who did not identify with any particular identify label will be excluded. Therefore, the sample size at this point is 1,939. This sample size will be used for testing hypotheses related to RQ2, except for H2B. For H2B, it does not make sense to include participants who are living with HIV (n = 142) so the sample size for this hypothesis is 1,797. For the examination of hypotheses related to RQ1, the sample size must be restricted to those who have tested for STIs in the past 12 months. Approximately 55% of participants did so, therefore we expect the sample size for these hypotheses to be close to 1,066. \n \nQ14: What do you know about missing data in the data set (e.g., overall missingness rate, information about differential dropout)? How will you deal with incomplete or missing data? Based on this information, provide a new expected sample size.\n\u2022\tFrom the summary report, it is apparent that between 0 and 2% of data is missing for the variables relevant to this study. In addition, some of the items were only presented to random sub-samples. Missing data will be handled using maximum likelihood estimation so the effective sample size will remain 1,939.\n\nQ15: How will you define what a statistical outlier is in your data and what will you do when you encounter them? If you plan to remove outliers, provide a new expected sample size. Note that this will be the definitive expected sample size for your study and you will use this number to do any power analyses.\n\u2022\tThe data has already been cleaned by SIGMA research. Other secondary analyses of EMIS data have not removed outliers beyond this. We will follow this practice for univariate outliers. For multivariate outliers, we will carry out a sensitivity analysis where these are removed. We will identify multivariate outliers using the Mahalanobis Distance method and this will be achieved using the check_outliers function from the performance R package (L\u00fcdecke, Makowski, &amp; Waggoner, 2019). We will use the default threshold of considering the 2.5% most extreme values as outliers.\n\nQ16: Are there sampling weights available with this data set? If so, are you using them and how?\n\u2022\tThere are no sampling weights for this dataset. We will not create sampling weights as there is currently no reliable information on the demographics of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men in Ireland.\n\nPart 4: Knowledge of data\nQ17: List the publications, conference presentations (papers, posters), and working papers (in prep, unpublished, preprints) you have worked on that are based on the data set. Describe which variables you have previously analyzed and which information you used in these analyses. Limit yourself to variables that are relevant to the current study. If the dataset is longitudinal, include information about what wave of data was previously analyzed.\n\tImportantly, some of your team members may have used this dataset and others may not have. It is therefore important to specify the relevant work from every co-author separately. If possible, mention other researchers\u2019 work with this dataset that is relevant to the current preregistration.\n\u2022\tDescriptive summaries of this data have been presented in a national report (Casey, O\u2019Donnell, Brady &amp; Igoe, 2019). Four other studies using the Irish EMIS 2017 data focusing on different topics (chemsex, PrEP, mental health and alcohol dependency) are currently being prepared.\n\nQ18: What prior knowledge do you have at the time of preregistration about trends in the data set you will be working with? For example, are you aware of summary statistics or the statistical distribution of variables, or do you know about correlations between variables? Your prior knowledge could stem from working with the data first-hand, from reading previously published research, or from codebooks. Also provide any relevant knowledge of different subsets of the data (e.g., a different wave than you will be using). Finally, provide information about your prior knowledge for every author separately.\n\u2022\tNone of the authors have had access to the raw data yet. The only summary data which the authors have had access to is that which has been published in the national report. This report only included descriptive and univariate analyses. The codebook does not provide information about trends in the data.\n\n Part 5: Analyses\nQ19: For each hypothesis, describe the statistical model you will use to test the hypothesis. Include the type of model (e.g., ANOVA, multiple regression, SEM) and the specification of the model (this includes each variable that will be included as predictor, outcome, or covariate). Specify any interactions and post-hoc analyses and remember that any test not included here must be noted as an exploratory test in the final article.\n\u2022\tThe data will first be described using means, standard deviations, proportions, cross-tabulation and correlation coefficients, where appropriate. The analyses will be conducted in R Studio using the psych package to describe the data and the BRMS package to carry out logistic regressions. The analyses will be visualised using Ggplot2. \n\u2022\tThe first research question will be answered by conducting a series of logistic regressions assessing the effect of bisexual attraction on sexual health morbidities in the past 12 months. Separate models will be run with diagnosis of syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and HIV in the past 12 months as outcome variables. All analyses of sexual health disparities will be restricted to participants that engaged in STI testing in the previous year. The focal independent variable, sexual attraction, will be recoded to a binary variable where the reference is exclusive attraction to men. This will be compared to attraction to men and people of other genders, in line with modern conceptualisations of bisexuality. Age (continuous), years of education since the age of 16 (continuous), settlement (recoded to inside or outside Dublin), ethnic minority (dummy coded to compare being of Asian origin, African origin, Latin American origin or mixed/other origin to being of White European origin) and outness will be included in the models as covariates.\n\u2022\tThe second research question will be answered by conducting a series of analyses assessing the effect of bisexual attraction on sexual health behaviours. The same independent variable and covariates will used as in the models previously described. The outcome variables used in these models will respectively be the frequency of condom use during sex with non-steady male partners, the use of PrEP (recoded to not currently using, using as needed, and using daily) and getting an STI test in the past year (recoded to yes or no). Ordinal regression will be used to model the frequency of condom use and the use of PrEP. Logistic regression will be used to model STI testing.\n\nQ20: If applicable, specify a predicted effect size or a minimum effect size of interest for all the effects tested in your statistical analyses.\n\u2022\tThere are few studies which can inform a predicted effect size in this specific sample. A previous exploratory analysis of MSM in the UK and Ireland found an association between identifying or not as exclusively gay and recent STI diagnosis (McAloney-Kocaman et al., 2016). This association had an Odds Ratio of 1.851 (1.109\u20133.087). Men identifying as homosexual were more likely to have received an STI diagnosis. We will take the lower bound of the 95% CI for this effect size as a minimum effect size of interest for hypotheses 1A to 1C \u2013 11% lower/higher odds. Though men who identified as homosexual were more likely to have received an STI test, the association between sexual identity and STI test recency was not significant in this study 0.936 (0.612\u20131.432). In other contexts, mixed evidence has been found regarding differences in condom use between homosexual and bisexual men (Feinstein et al., 2019). This study did find that bisexual participants were less likely to have used PrEP than homosexual participants (0.43 [0.20, 0.83]) but these were young men living in the US. Given this uncertainty regarding the potential effect sizes for outcomes related to hypotheses  2A to 2C, we have decided to use the same effect size interest as specified for hypotheses 1A to 1D.\n\nQ21: Present the statistical power available to detect the predicted effect size(s) or the smallest effect size(s) of interest. Use the sample size after updating for missing data and outliers. \n\u2022\tThe following R code was used to analyse the different sample sizes required to achieve 95% power to detect an Odds Ratio of 1.11 across variation in the event rate (p1) and variance inflation factor (np). As long as p1 is no smaller than .003 and np is no largger than 0.65, then there will be 95% power to detect the effect size of interest.\nlibrary(powerMediation)\n## sample size for simple logistic regression\np1 &lt;-  0.03          # the event rate at the mean of the predictor X\nOR &lt;- exp(1.11)   # expected odds ratio. log(OR) is the change in log odds \n# for an increase of one unit in X.\n# beta*=log(OR) is the effect size to be tested\nn1 &lt;-  SSizeLogisticCon(p1, OR, alpha = 0.001, power = 0.95)\n## sample size for multiple logistic regression\n## n_p = n_1 / (1-rho^2)\n## rho^2 = R^2, for X_1 ~ X_2 + ... + X_p\nr2 &lt;- 0.65  # R^2\nnp &lt;- n1 / (1-r2)\n## variance inflation for the multiple case\nssize.multi &lt;- function(p1, OR, r2, alpha=0.001, power=0.95) {\n  n1 &lt;- SSizeLogisticCon(p1, OR, alpha, power)\n  np &lt;- n1 / (1-r2)\n  return(np)\n}\n\nQ22: What criteria will you use to make inferences? Describe the information you will use (e.g. specify the p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, Bayes factors, specific model fit indices), as well as cut-off criteria, where appropriate. Will you be using one- or two-tailed tests for each of your analyses? If you are comparing multiple conditions or testing multiple hypotheses, will you account for this, and if so, how?\n\u2022\tTwo-tailed tests will be used to examine each hypothesis. To counter the number of hypothesis tests and the large sample size, alpha will be set at .001.\n\nQ23: What will you do should your data violate assumptions, your model not converge, or some other analytic problem arises?\n\u2022\tBased on the summary information available in the national EMIS report, we don\u2019t expect any ceiling or floor effects. There may be multivariate outliers and these will be detected and removed for a sensitivity analysis (see Q15 and Q24).\n\nQ24: Provide a series of decisions about evaluating the strength, reliability, or robustness of your focal hypothesis test. This may include within-study replication attempts, additional covariates, cross-validation efforts (out-of-sample replication, spilt/hold-out sample), applying weights, selectively applying constraints in an SEM context (e.g., comparing model fit statistics), overfitting adjustment techniques used (e.g., regularization approaches such as ridge regression), or some other simulation / sampling / bootstrapping method.\n\u2022\tWe will run a sensitivity analysis with multivariate outliers removed to see if the hypothesis tests are robust to their influence.\n \nQ25: If you plan to explore your data set to look for unexpected differences or relationships, you can describe those tests here, or add them to the final paper under a heading that clearly differentiates this exploratory part of your study from the confirmatory part.\n\u2022\tExploratory models will investigate the interaction between sexual identity and outness to investigate whether any moderation effects exist for the outcomes outlined above. Sensitivity analyses focusing on same-sex behaviour and attraction, rather than identity, will also be run.", "uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=ydju5", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/de-1/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "de-1", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "ydju5", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "ydju5", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/c8f7a/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "c8f7a", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/r36bn/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "r36bn", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/ydju5/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ydju5/"}}], "links": {"first": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json", "last": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "prev": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=321", "next": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=323", "meta": {"total": 5469, "per_page": 10}}}
