The ads were served on Facebook beginning on Monday, October 8, 2012 and ending Friday, October 12, 2012. Phone interviews with treatment and control subjects began on October 13 and ended October 15. This document was prepared prior to the launch of the survey. Subjects: Subjects are registered voters living in a state legislative district. The campaign first supplied us with a list of voters in its district. We then generated clusters of individuals with unique ages (in buckets of two years each; e.g., \u201830-31\u2019 years old, \u201832-33\u2019, etc. all the way to a final category of \u201865 and over\u2019), genders, and cities. At the campaign\u2019s request we removed individuals under the age of 30 and over the age of 75 from the study, leaving 32,029 voters assigned to 1,220 clusters across distinct combinations of 18 age ranges, 34 towns, and 2 genders. Some potential clusters are not represented because no individual on the voter file fell into all three categories. Assignment: We blocked clusters into groups of five based on cluster size (which ranged from one person to five hundred), then age range, then town, and finally gender. Within these groups of five clusters, we assigned two clusters to the control condition and one each to our three treatments: the name recognition appeal, the character appeal, and the policy appeal. Our procedure thus randomly assigned 32,029 identifiable individuals to online treatments (ads) within 1,220 clusters, each distinctly targetable via the Facebook ad interface. Because the 244 blocks contain similarly sized clusters, our analysis uses difference-in-means comparisons rather than difference-in-totals (Horvitz-Thompson estimation). Outcome measurement: The calling house that conducted the survey removed duplicate phone numbers from the list we supplied, which in effect targets one voter per household. In order to estimate the individual level ATE, we will weight by household size. We expect these weights to have negligible effects on the results, as less than 10% of the sample is affected. Analysis Weights. Because the blocked random assignment gives subjects somewhat different probabilities of being assigned to a treatment, we begin by calculating the probability of treatment assignment for each subject. Consistent estimates are obtained by weighting each observation by the inverse of its probability (IPW) of being assigned to its treatment condition. Standard errors will be generated using randomization inference assuming constant treatment effects; this procedure will take clustered assignment (as well as blocking) into account. These results should be closely approximated by analyses that use robust cluster standard errors and dummy variables for blocks; in order to save time, we plan to use the latter method when presenting preliminary results. Outcomes. We plan to recode the survey responses in the following way. 1. Recognition of the candidate vs. not. 2. Opinion of the candidate. Our hypothesis test will use multinomial logit predicting positive, negative, vs. never heard of candidate. 3. Relative opinion of the candidate vs. the opponent. Subtract candidate\u2019s score (+1 positive, 0 no opinion, -1 negative) from the score of the opponent. Ordered logit will be used to analyze the difference score. 4. Ballot heat: Ordered logit will predict preference for candidate, no preference, preference for opponent. 5. Ad recall: Recollection of seeing ads for the candidate online over the past week. Covariates. The voter file contains variables that we expect to be prognostic of outcomes: party registration, age, gender, and turnout in previous elections. In addition to presenting results without covariates, we will include these as covariates in order dampen sampling variability. Party registration, gender, and turnout will be coded as indicator variables. Age, age-squared, and an indicator for missing data will be used as regressors. Subgroups: We expect no treatment effect among those who report not using FB, although spillover effects from FB users are in principle possible. Our primary analysis will be restricted to respondents who report using FB, provided that the survey reveals similar proportions reporting FB use in treatment and control. If not, we will infer that FB reporting was primed by the preceding questions differently in treatment and control; in that case, we will estimate the CACE by dividing our ITT among all respondents by the proportion in the control group who report using FB. The candidate deploying the ads suggested to us that larger effects are expected among older FB users, who may be more responsive to the candidate\u2019s appeals and more likely to attend to FB ads in general. This is consistent with some findings in the literature on online advertising. We plan to test the interaction between the treatment and a dummy variable indicating whether a subject is 65+.\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "See above"}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "See above"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q27": {"extra": [], "value": "A candidate for state legislature"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q30": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e2b032e87a1d900ed1cda2c", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/a6v9t/providers/osfstorage/5e2b032e87a1d900ed1cda2c", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/a6v9t/providers/osfstorage/5e2b032e87a1d900ed1cda2c", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/a6v9t/providers/osfstorage/5e2b032e87a1d900ed1cda2c?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/a6v9t/providers/osfstorage/5e2b032e87a1d900ed1cda2c"}, "attributes": {"etag": "17121d9cf8a280b4304c140ec26761d16ffb3c51a8c4e8bdaf90e6239870ea2d", "kind": "file", "name": "20121012AA_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e2b032e87a1d900ed1cda2c", "size": 206494, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "ca162c078159b6b25b6fabcafff28c1f", "sha256": "c5b7d4d888500abe06add2360544e2b168e97f4718d9161a6fd2d9ce24e79d21"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 206494, "modified": "2020-01-24T14:46:06.347420+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "a6v9t", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20121012AA_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-01-24T14:46:06+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "a6v9t", "sha256": "c5b7d4d888500abe06add2360544e2b168e97f4718d9161a6fd2d9ce24e79d21", "viewUrl": "/project/mzqsx/files/osfstorage/5e2b0331c19c5d00f5edefdd/", "selectedFileName": "20121012AA_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20121012AA_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": {}, "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Do Advertisements Boost Political Candidates\u2019 Name Recognition and Favorability?

The ads were served on Facebook beginning on Monday, October 8, 2012 and ending Friday, October 12, 2012. Phone interviews with treatment and control subjects began on October 13 and ended October 15. This document was prepared prior to the launch of the survey. Subjects: Subjects are registered voters living in a state legislative district. The campaign first supplied us with a list of voters in its district. We then generated clusters of individuals with unique ages (in buckets of two years each; e.g., \u201830-31\u2019 years old, \u201832-33\u2019, etc. all the way to a final category of \u201865 and over\u2019), genders, and cities.

The current body of research lacks independent and scientific study of NGO behavior Though there are some examples, these outliers are rare and difficult to generalize (see Reinikka and Svensson 2001). As NGOs become more influential in development, a more scientific understanding of their behavior becomes critical (Aldashev and Verdier 2010; Doh and Teegen 2002). In order to increase the body of scientific knowledge concerning NGO behavior, we perform a randomized field experiment designed to measure the extent of NGO opportunism. Variation in NGO type and function increases the difficulty of generalizing about NGO behavior (hence the need for a randomized controlled experiment). For some time, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have played an important role in public good provision and development initiatives. Because most NGOs claim non-profit status, political neutrality, liberal ideology, and a normative agenda, NGOs are considered by many to be the ideal mechanism for success in these important assignments. In some cases, NGOs may be the only mechanism. Yet the term \u201cNGO\u201d can apply to wide range of organizations (Spar and Dail 2002). Indeed, the variation can be so great (and multi-dimensional) that two NGOs may have nothing in common besides their non-profit, non-government status. NGOs may be international or community-based, well-funded or non-funded, infrastructure-oriented or advocacy-oriented. In short, it is a mistake to treat NGOs as a black box. Furthermore, the nature of typical NGO projects does not lend itself easily to measurement and accountability. Traditional mechanisms of accountability employed in the for-profit sector are ineffective in the NGO-sector. NGOs may not be concerned with increasing revenue or maximizing profits. There are few established professional codes of conduct to compare across organizations. The outcome of NGO projects and initiatives are often non-quantifiable (Fowler 1996). As mentioned, this leads many to speculate about the effects of increased NGO population and competition for funding. Many are hopeful, assuming NGOs will cooperate, coordinate and be unaffected in pursuit of their organizational missions (Matthews 1997; Simmons 1998; Price 1998). Others are less optimistic, claiming that NGOs will behave opportunistically in order to survive in an uncertain environment (Cooley and Ron 2002; Aldashev and Verdier 2010). Many point to growing principal-agent problems between donors, NGOs, and constituents (Brown and Moore 2001; Doh and Teegen 2002). It is important to note that none of this necessarily suggests that NGOs are becoming inherently corrupt and dishonest, or that their altruistic missions have changed. It does suggest that as competition for donor funds increases and as NGOs become more populous, NGOs may need to behave selfishly or opportunistically in some domains for their own preservation. At times, self-interested NGO priorities may not agree with those of their donors or their constituents (Cooley and Ron 2002). The current study seeks to assess whether NGOs behave opportunistically in the context of establishing a partnership with a research institution for future projects and funding. We randomly assign five conditions across a large sample of NGOs (n > 10,000). In each condition, NGOs are informed (via email) about the possibility of a future partnership with the Political Economy and Development Lab (PEDL). At the end of the email, each NGO is asked to reply with the estimated reimbursement cost for the use of their staff members in the future partnership. Each treatment condition receives a different level of additional information about PEDL in the text of the email. We analyze the effect of this additional information on the estimated reimbursement cost. The extent to which the estimated reimbursement cost varies relative to the control condition is our measure of opportunistic behavior. \""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"This experiment yields itself to four specific hypotheses. (I) When an audit is promised to evaluate an eventual partnership between PEDL and an NGO, estimated reimbursement costs will increase as NGOs are more careful to account for even minor expenses related to the project. (II) Implied project competition will increase reimbursement cost as NGOs may not respond to market competition incentives, but instead may be motivated to signal credibility through higher costs. (III) Information revealing PEDL\u2019s familiarity with NGO partnerships\u2014suggesting minimal information asymmetry\u2014should decrease estimated reimbursement cost. (IV) NGOs\u2019 estimated reimbursement costs will increase when given information suggesting wealthy donors and abundant resources. Treatment 1, the Audit Condition, receives the following additional language: \u201cBut please be aware that all PEDL projects are subject to thorough audits, so any expenses in future partnerships will be carefully scrutinized.\u201d This additional information should prompt NGOs to be more careful when they respond with their reimbursement cost per staff member per day. A prima facie expectation might be that NGOs will lower their estimates in wariness of being revealed to have submitted inflated bids. Alternatively, as NGOs are more careful in the calculation of their reimbursement cost, we might also expect that they will factor more expenses into their estimates. Thus, despite the logic behind the avoidance of being caught inflating bids, we expect estimates to increase in response to the Audit Condition. Additionally, because of the added accountability, we expect this treatment will also decrease response rates. Some NGOs may be discouraged from responding because they are unaccustomed to rigorous audits or lack the organization to handle them. Treatment 2, the Competition Condition, is designed to signal to the recipient NGOs that PEDL is considering the reimbursement cost estimates of multiple NGOs. The treatment implies that PEDL is most likely to partner with the NGO that provides the most competitive estimate. The additional language added to this e-mail is found here: \u201cAlso, please be aware that we are sending a similar email to many NGOs, so there may be competition for future partnerships.\u201d Microeconomic theory suggests that competition should induce lower prices. Therefore, NGOs should submit lower bids in this condition. However, while NGOs have strong incentives to contract with PEDL for future partnerships, we suspect that NGOs operate with the understanding that credibility may be more important than cost in the non-profit sector. Furthermore, NGOs may operate with the understanding that higher reimbursement cost is a signal of credibility and competence. Based on these assumptions and against microeconomic expectations, we expect that NGOs will increase their reimbursement estimates in response to the Competition Condition. Treatment 3, the Prior Knowledge Condition, is designed to suggest minimal information asymmetry between the donor/partner and the local NGO. Often miscommunication and confusion results from information asymmetry, which leads to increased financial cost and inefficiency in development work. Implying that PEDL has partnered with NGOs before and is familiar with typical reimbursement costs should reduce confusion and push NGOs to be more careful calculating their estimates. The additional language for this treatment is as follows: \u201cAlso, please be aware that we have worked with NGOs in multiple countries, so we have become familiar with average personnel costs.\u201c We expect this additional information will prompt NGOs to lower their reimbursement estimates compared to the control group. Lastly, Treatment 4, the Big Money Condition, contains the following additional language: \u201cAlso, please be aware that past projects have been supported by more than $3 million in grants and contracts from donors including the Gates Foundation, the Hewlett Foundation, the World Bank, and the African Development Bank, so PEDL typically brings significant resources to partnerships.\u201d This treatment suggests that PEDL is well funded and endowed with abundant resources. This provides an incentive for NGOs to inflate their reimbursement estimates because there are no institutional constraints or traditional ranges for reimbursement costs in development work. We expect that NGOs will behave opportunistically by increasing their reimbursement estimates in response to this treatment. We also suspect that response rates will increase due to this treatment. Because the information suggests there is significant money and resources available, we expect NGOs will be more confident in their chances of establishing a partnership. \""}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "\"PROTOCOL 1.

Conducting a field experiment in a relatively corrupt country, we signal different levels of status to subjects with words and dress. Then, we measure their behavior in response to the confederate\u2019s request for a favor that involves purchasing cellphone airtime with the confederate\u2019s money. Specifically, we investigate whether people are more likely to comply with a request for assistance from people they perceive to have higher levels of socio-economic status.

We hypothesize that subjects will comply at higher rates to cues of higher socio-economic status, and at lower rates to cues of lower socio-economic status. H2: (Gender Hypothesis) We expect subjects to assist men more frequently than women. H3: (Theft Hypothesis) We expect subjects to steal most often from the researcher signaling white, foreign, male businessperson or aid worker, and steal least often from the researcher signaling Ugandan, local, female student. We expect relatively frequent thefts. H4: (Embeddedness Hypothesis) Because of the level of embeddedness of Ugandans with fellow Ugandans, Ugandan subjects should be less likely to assist American researchers and more likely to assist Ugandan researchers.

Within each area are either three or four locations where the confederate and the recorder are positioned to approach subjects, according to the protocol detailed below. On a particular day, the area of research is chosen based on convenience; however, treatments are assigned to specific locations randomly. On each day of research at midday, researchers rotate locations based on the randomization scheme. Treatments In this study, there are three treatments and two main subcategories across all of the treatments. The treatments are businessperson, aid worker, and student signaling different levels of socio-economic status. These treatments are signaled to subjects verbally and through appearance. For each of the treatments there is a corresponding line in the script used to signal that the confederate represents one of the treatment conditions (see script below). Confederates are also dressed in the clothes that are commonly associated with each of the treatments: dress clothes (i.e. suits) for the businessperson treatment, business casual for the aid worker treatment, and casual clothes for the student treatment. Each treatment is also divided into subcategories that are shared across the treatments. The subcategories are female and male, and local and foreigner. Local Ugandan citizens of both genders are hired to be confederates and recorders along with American researchers of both genders. Treatment subcategories are designated on a particular day by convenience but assigned randomly to given locations. We will gather data for each combination of treatment and subcategory so we will be able to employ a full factorial design. This will allow us to compare each treatment and subcategory combination to all of the other treatment and subcategory combinations in our analysis. Randomization Scheme In areas throughout downtown Kampala, locations are determined and numbered in advance. During the location scouting, locations are numbered based on the order in which they were found. The three treatments then are randomly assigned to the predetermined locations (i.e. the businessperson treatment is randomly assigned to location 2 of a particular area on a particular day). Thus, while the area of work is determined by convenience on a particular day, the treatments are randomly assigned to the research locations within an area. We maintain that this process of approaching people on the street at various locations within various areas at time intervals determined in the protocol is a particularly random method of sampling. This, coupled with the random assignment of treatment type to the research location, allows each subject to have an equal chance of being assigned any of the experimental conditions. Protocol 1. Researcher stands in location and the recorder takes his/her position. 2. Recorder measures 2 minutes and at the end of that period the researcher contacts the closest person (to the researcher\u2019s right, if there is more than one person). a. The researcher approaches a subject: i. recorder begins timing the encounter, ii. the subject asks a question or objects (ex. \u201cNo, I cannot, please\u201d or \u201cNo, I do not want to, please\u201d), 1. see response scenarios below; b. The subject goes to buy airtime: i. recorder begins timing the subject, ii. recorder records the amount of time elapsed in the encounter, iii. after 8 minutes, the encounter is recorded as \u201ctheft\u201d if the subject has not returned; c. The subject refuses to buy airtime: i. the response is coded appropriately, ii. the recorder begins the stopwatch and the researcher initiates another encounter after 2 minutes has passed. If the interaction with the subject deviates substantially from the above situations, i.e. the subject persists in asking questions which researchers cannot answer without violating the protocol, i.e., he or she offers to give researcher a ride, acts erratically, etc., the researchers tells the subject \u201cnever mind,\u201d ends the interaction, and the observation is coded as a \u201cdrop.\u201d Drops are later checked to verify that they are randomly distributed and not sensitive to treatments.

Data Analysis Plan The primary test for experiments is a simple difference-of-means test, comparing the outcome of interest in the treatment group to the control group. Because we employ a full factorial design, we are able to compare a single treatment and subcategory combination (Aid Worker, Female, Ugandan) or a single treatment (Businessperson or not) to all of the other treatment and subcategory combinations pooled; this makes the difference-of-means test especially useful. In addition to this testing, we will also check for heterogeneous treatment effects in the areas listed in the fourth hypothesis.

Then, we measure their behavior in response to the confederate\u2019s request for a favor that involves purchasing cellphone airtime with the confederate\u2019s money. Specifically, we investigate whether people are more likely to comply with a request for assistance from people they perceive to have higher levels of socio-economic status.
