Also, adults learn 2:1 word-referent mapping, where two words co-occur with the same referent (Bilingual CSSL; Benitez et al., 2016; Poepsel &amp; Weiss, 2016; Chan &amp; Monaghan, 2019). \nBilinguals encounter translation equivalents daily, where the two words mapped onto the same object are linguistically distinctive. However, to present, bilingual CSSL studies have not fully investigated the linguistic difference between the two words mapped on to the same referent. Therefore, this study intends to answer two questions: a. Does adult bilingual CSSL differ when the two words mapped onto the same object are differentiated by a linguistic cue than when they are not? and b. How does language experience interact with the presence of a linguistic cue during bilingual CSSL?\nTo answer these questions, adults will be presented with a bilingual CSSL task where word-object pairings are ambiguous in each individual trial, but learnable across trials by tracking word-object co-occurrences. Specifically, each object will co-occur most often with two words. Two conditions will manipulate if the two words sharing a referent are differentiated. In the Cued Condition, each of two words mapped onto the same object are distinctive in pitch contours\u2014one without pitch variation (flat tone), the other with pitch contour either of Tone2-Tone4 or Tone4-Tone2 in Mandarin tones.

Two groups differentiated in language-specific experiences will be recruited\u2014English speakers, who are unfamiliar with tonal variation at the syllabic level, and Mandarin-English speakers, who are familiar with tonal variation. In order to control the difference between the two selected groups, participants\u2019 spatial working memory (Symmetry Span Task) and phonological working memory (L1 Digit Span task) will be collected as covariates for data analysis.

It is also possible that a linguistic cue does not affect learning, in which case we should see no difference between the Cued and Uncued conditions. Finally, language experience may interact with the effects of the linguistic cue. Specifically, if the linguistic cue has a general effect on learning, then both tonal (Mandarin-English speakers) and non-tonal speakers (English speakers) will perform equally on the Cued condition compared to the Uncued condition.

Word learning tasks. In the word learning task, each participant will complete two versions of the task: the Cued condition and the Uncued condition (order will be counterbalanced across participants). For each condition, participants will be presented with 16 word-object pairings to learn, with each of 8 objects linked with two words (W1 and W2). In the Cued Condition, W1 and W2 are linguistically different; W1 will contain Mandarin lexical tone information either in Tone2-Tone4 pattern (T2-T4), or Tone4-Tone2 pattern (T4-T2) (e.g. g\u00f9b\u00ed, T4-T2); W2 will have no information of lexical tone (e.g. batu, non-tone). In the Uncued Condition, W1 and W2 will be equivalent in having no information of lexical tone (e.g. migu and gadi, non-tone). Both words for an object will always be presented across trials (never on the same trial) but intermixed during training. For each condition, participants will complete a training followed by immediate testing. \nDuring training, adults will be presented auditorily with two words and see two objects at a time on a computer screen; the order of the words and the location of the objects are randomized so that word-object pairings will be ambiguous within a trial. Across trials, however, each word will occur 6 times and most often with its referent object (each object will occur 12 times, 6 times with one word and 6 times with the other).

Adults will be instructed to select the target object using the mouse. Each word will be tested once for a total of 16 test trials. The word learning tasks will last around 20 minutes.\n\n2. Spatial memory task. After the word learning tasks, participants will complete an adaptive symmetry span task to measure spatial working memory skills. In the task, adults will be asked to recall the location and sequence of a number of flashing squares on the computer screen, at the same time making an irrelevant judgement about whether a picture is symmetric or not. The symmetry span task will last around 10 minutes.\n\n3. Phonological memory task. Adults will be instructed to complete a digit span task in their native language (either English or Mandrain) to measure phonological working memory skills. Participants will hear a sequence of auditory numbers in their first language at the rate of one digit per second. Later on, they will be asked to recall the sequence of the heard digits in order. The L1 digit span task will last around 12 minutes.\n\n4. Questionnaires. Last, a language background questionnaire will be distributed to record participants\u2019 language use, e.g. experiences with other languages, L2 age of acquisition and L2 fluency. A music background questionnaire will ask questions about musical training experience, which is shown to mutually influence lexical tonal knowledge.

Each word will be tested once for a total of 16 test trials. Accuracy will be measured as the mean accuracy for W1 and W2. The chance performance will be 0.25 (1 out of 4). \nOther dependent variables as co-variants:\n2. Spatial working memory: participants\u2019 mean accuracy on the symmetry span task.\n3. Phonological working memory: participants\u2019 mean accuracy on L1 digit span task (accumulated recalled digits).\n4.

Spatial working memory scores, phonological working memory scores, and musical training experience will be included as covariates.\nFollow up analyses examining pairwise comparisons will be conducted to interpret any significant interactions found. P-values for these analyses will be corrected according to the Holm-Bonferroni method.

These participants will be recruited through word-of-mouth, and will likely consist mostly of friends and family of the students conducting the project.\n\nFor exploratory purposes, we have also added some demographic questions at the end of the procedure.", "datacompletion": "No, data collection has not begun"}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=x2uad", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "parent": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vhy8z/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "vhy8z", "type": "registrations"}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vhy8z/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "vhy8z", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "x2uad", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/2wpb5/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "2wpb5", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ykspe/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "ykspe", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/564d31db8c5e4a7c9694b2c0/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "564d31db8c5e4a7c9694b2c0", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/x2uad/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x2uad/"}}], "links": {"first": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json", "last": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "prev": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=217", "next": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=219", "meta": {"total": 5469, "per_page": 10}}}
