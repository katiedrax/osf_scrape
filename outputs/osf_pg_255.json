These so-called 'pre-stimulus subsequent memory effects' - differences in neural activity preceded subsequently remembered and forgotten items - are thought to reflect proactive processes that benefit memory encoding and, specifically, mnemonic processes supporting recollection. However, it is unclear if the cognitive processes indexed in neuroimaging studies of pre-stimulus subsequent memory effects have corresponding behavioral correlates. The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether how pre-stimulus cues during memory encoding enhance subsequent memory performance. \n\nIn a previous preregistered study (see https://osf.io/4whsm/) of this issue we did not find evidence supporting our hypothesis that informative pre-stimulus cues during memory encoding benefit subsequent memory performance. Participants in this first experiment incidentally encoded words for a later recognition memory test. Words at encoding were preceded by either informative or uninformative cues. Informative cues signaled which semantic judgment participants were to perform on the next word. Uninformative cues signaled an upcoming trial, but the semantic judgment to be made was only presented when the word appeared. The color of the cue or word dictate the semantic judgment (red: shoebox, blue: manmade). Relative to uninformative cues, pre-stimulus cues had no appreciable affect on overall memory performance (measured hits minus false alarm rates) nor on estimates of recollection and familiarity derived from fitting receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with the dual-process signal detection model. Do note that there was a significant effect of cue type on familiarity (p=0.048). However, a Bayesian paired t-test suggested that there was equivocal evidence for the null and alternative models (BF10=0.916). Thus, we believe this effect on familiarity was likely a false positive finding.\n\nHowever, our previous study had a few limitations that may explain the lack of evidence for informative cues enhancing memory. For example, participants had to use different hands (i.e., right hand for manmade, left hand for shoebox) for the semantic judgments, which may have increased the demand on cognitive resources during the pre-stimulus interval. Increased demand on cognitive resources for processing pre-stimulus cues has been shown to eliminate ERP pre-stimulus subsequent memory effects (Galli et al., 2013, Cortex). It is quite possible that pre-stimulus cues simply recruit general attentional resources that are beneficial to memory encoding, and our inclusion of cues that are uninformative might not have been the appropriate control condition. Another possibility is that we did not use the appropriate measure of memory to elucidate pre-stimulus memory effects. Pre-stimulus memory effects are thought to reflect engagement of task-sets in line with upcoming cognitive goals. If this is the case, pre-stimulus cues might benefit subsequent memory performance for details consistent with the task set engaged. This might manifest as improved contextual memory for which of the two semantic judgments (shoebox vs. manmade) was performed at study. However, our first study used a subjective measure of memory that is essentially provides a \u2018catch-all\u2019 measure of recollection. Thus, this measure might not be able to capture recollection for experimentally defined contextual details that are affected by the inclusion of pre-stimulus encoding cues. \n\nThis study was designed to address the above limitations from our first study and, we believe, to maximize the possibility that we observe pre-stimulus encoding cues affect subsequent recognition memory. As with the first study, participants will incidentally encode a list of words for a subsequent memory test. Participants make one of two semantic judgments (shoebox or manmade) for each word during the encoding phase. There are two different types of encoding blocks: cued and uncued. Words in cued blocks will be preceded by red or blue circle, with the color of the circle indicating which semantic judgment to make on the following word. In uncued blocks, no pre-stimulus cues will be presented. Instead, participants will be cued as to which semantic judgment to make by the color of a box the contains the to-be-judged word. At test, participants will make memory decisions using a 6-point confidence scale. For words attracting an 'old' response, participants will be asked to recall which semantic judgment they made about the word during the study phase. We will construct recognition memory receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with the confidence ratings at test, and subsequently estimate the contribution of recollection and familiarity with the dual-process signal detection (DPSD) model. The main dependent variables include study reaction times and measures of recognition memory accuracy at test (corrected hit rates, recollection and familiarity, source memory accuracy). \n\nAdditionally, there is evidence that pre-retrieval processes, which are thought to behave similarly to processes elicited by pre-stimulus cues at encoding, vary with an individual's working memory capacity. The influence of working memory capacity on pre-stimulus memory effects has, to our knowledge, not been investigated. Thus, an additional exploratory aim of this study is to examine whether working memory capacity is associated with individual differences in benefits (or detriments) associated with pre-stimulus cues during memory encoding.

The hit rate is the proportion of studied items receiving an 'old' response (i.e., a 4, 5, or 6 confidence response) and will be computed separately for cued and uncued condition. The false alarm rate is the proportion of new items at test receiving an 'old' response. The false alarm rate will be subtracted from both measures. (Note that for assessments of memory performance to meet inclusion criteria, this measure will also be calculated collapsed across cued and uncued trials).\n\n(3 and 4) Estimates recollection (Ro) and familiarity (F) will be derived from the confidence data for each participant individually. Ro is measured as a probability ranging from 0 to 1, and F is measured as the discrimination index (d'). Note that F will be constrained to be positive (i.e., &gt; 0). These measures will be derived by fitting the dual-process signal detection (DPSD) model to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves formed by confidence rating data. This will be done for cued and uncued trials. The procedure for estimating these measures will follow the protocol outline in the ROC Toolbox for Matlab (https://github.com/jdkoen/roc_toolbox). Note that the DPSD model includes response criteria variables that will not be analyzed. Given the nature of the experimental design (e.g., two study item types, one new item type) the Ro and F parameters will be derived from a model that places an equality constraint on the response criteria parameters (i.e., c(i)) across the cued and uncued conditions.\n\n(5) Source memory performance will be measured for each participant using a single high threshold model (Snodgrass and Corwin, 1988) taking into account the \"guess\" rate. Source memory will be measured from studied words attracting an 'old' response. This will be separately measured for words in the cued and uncued conditions. This source pR measure is calculated using the formula [pHit - .5*(1-pDK)]/[1 - .5*(1-pDK)], where pHit corresponds to the proportion of correctly identified old words attracting a correct source memory judgment and pDK reflects the proportion of correctly identified old words given a don't know response. \n\nThree additional dependent variables will be measured for exploratory analyses. These include:\n\n(6 and 7) Working memory capacity will be measured with operation-span and symmetry span tasks. Operation and symmetry span scores will be computed using a partial score (i.e., summing the proportion of items recalled in a given set, regardless if the entire set was recalled) which is a common method for scoring operation and symmetry span tasks (Conway et al., 2005; Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review). An example of partial credit scoring from Conway et al., (2005): (1 + .5 + 1+ 1 + 1 + 1+ .75 + .5 + .75 + .8 + .8 + .8) = 9.9/12 (83). Each number represents the proportion of correct responses within a span (e.g., recalling 2 elements from a 4 element item would count the same as recalling 3 elements from a 6 element item, or .50). Thus, the partial score is an average of these proportions. The span tasks will be administered using tatool (http://www.cognitivetools.uk/cognition/) that also includes a data analysis (R software) script for computing the partial scores. \n\n(8) A single composite score will then be created by averaging two operation and spatial spans (see Indices section below).\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Reaction times for the informed and non-informed trials will be further divided by subsequent memory (source hit, source miss, and forget).

First, participants will be excluded from the analysis if their overall memory performance is below a value of 0.10. This will be quantified using the proportion of hits minus the proportion of false alarms (both collapsed across confidence bins and study item condition) and source memory accuracy (i.e., source pR) below .05 (collapsed across study item condition). Second, participants who have more than 20% of the study trials excluded due to a failure to respond or entering multiple responses will be excluded from the analysis. Third, participants will be excluded if fewer than 10% of the confidence responses comprised the 2-5 response bins across all the valid test trials (i.e., old trials with a valid study response and all new trials). This criteria is meant to facilitate estimation of ROC parameters. Any participant excluded for one of the above reasons will be replaced until the final sample size is achieved. \n\nParticipants will also be excluded due to low performance on the working memory tasks.  Specifically, participants may be excluded if they have below 80% accuracy on the processing task which is similar to prior work (Conway et al., 2005, Unsworth et al., 2005).  Accuracy for the processing task will be assessed by collapsing across the set sizes and span task (i.e., combining operation and symmetry span performance collapsed across set sizes).

", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "There are 5 dependent variables that will be measured an analyzed for the critical hypotheses. \n\n(1) We will measure reaction times for both semantic judgments at study as a function of trial type (cued versus uncued) and subsequent memory (source hit, source miss, item miss).\n\n(2) Overall recognition accuracy will be measured for each participant using corrected hit rates. The hit rate is the proportion of studied items receiving an 'old' response (i.e., a 4, 5, or 6 confidence response) and will be computed separately for cued and uncued condition. The false alarm rate is the proportion of new items at test receiving an 'old' response. The false alarm rate will be subtracted from both measures. (Note that for assessments of memory performance to meet inclusion criteria, this measure will also be calculated collapsed across cued and uncued trials).\n\n(3 and 4) Estimates recollection (Ro) and familiarity (F) will be derived from the confidence data for each participant individually. Ro is measured as a probability ranging from 0 to 1, and F is measured as the discrimination index (d'). Note that F will be constrained to be positive (i.e., &gt; 0). These measures will be derived by fitting the dual-process signal detection (DPSD) model to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves formed by confidence rating data. This will be done for cued and uncued trials. The procedure for estimating these measures will follow the protocol outline in the ROC Toolbox for Matlab (https://github.com/jdkoen/roc_toolbox). Note that the DPSD model includes response criteria variables that will not be analyzed. Given the nature of the experimental design (e.g., two study item types, one new item type) the Ro and F parameters will be derived from a model that places an equality constraint on the response criteria parameters (i.e., c(i)) across the cued and uncued conditions.\n\n(5) Source memory performance will be measured for each participant using a single high threshold model (Snodgrass and Corwin, 1988) taking into account the \"guess\" rate. Source memory will be measured from studied words attracting an 'old' response. This will be separately measured for words in the cued and uncued conditions. This source pR measure is calculated using the formula [pHit - .5*(1-pDK)]/[1 - .5*(1-pDK)], where pHit corresponds to the proportion of correctly identified old words attracting a correct source memory judgment and pDK reflects the proportion of correctly identified old words given a don't know response. \n\nThree additional dependent variables will be measured for exploratory analyses. These include:\n\n(6 and 7) Working memory capacity will be measured with operation-span and symmetry span tasks. Operation and symmetry span scores will be computed using a partial score (i.e., summing the proportion of items recalled in a given set, regardless if the entire set was recalled) which is a common method for scoring operation and symmetry span tasks (Conway et al., 2005; Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review). An example of partial credit scoring from Conway et al., (2005): (1 + .5 + 1+ 1 + 1 + 1+ .75 + .5 + .75 + .8 + .8 + .8) = 9.9/12 (83). Each number represents the proportion of correct responses within a span (e.g., recalling 2 elements from a 4 element item would count the same as recalling 3 elements from a 6 element item, or .50). Thus, the partial score is an average of these proportions. The span tasks will be administered using tatool (http://www.cognitivetools.uk/cognition/) that also includes a data analysis (R software) script for computing the partial scores. \n\n(8) A single composite score will then be created by averaging two operation and spatial spans (see Indices section below).\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "Reaction times for the informed and non-informed trials will be further divided by subsequent memory (source hit, source miss, and forget). Trials that subsequently attract an subsequent 'old' response (a 4, 5, or 6 confidence response) and an accurate source memory judgment (recalling the correct semantic judgement made during the study phase) will comprise the 'source hit' level, whereas trials that attract a subsequent 'old' response but receive an inaccurate or don't know source memory judgment will comprise the 'source miss' level. Trials attracting a subsequent 'new' response (a 1, 2, or 3 confidence response) will comprise the 'forget' level. Within each cell formed by the trial type and memory factors, the median reaction time (RT) across trials will be used as a summary measure for each participant. \n\nA composite working memory performance score will be calculated from the operation and symmetry span tasks. Working memory scores (i.e., partial scores) from both span tasks will be calculated and then z-score transformed and averaged together to create a single working memory composite score as previous work has done (Conway et al., 2005; Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 2005, Gonthier, Thomassin, &amp; Jean-Luc Roulin, 2015; Behavior Research methods, Ortells et al., 2016; Frontiers in Psychology).

In this project, we examine misperceptions about presidential power. Citizens and journalists alike often credit or blame the president for many outcomes over which she has little to no control. In particular, presidents\u2019 failure to overcome institutional obstacles such as partisan opposition in Congress is often attributed to their personal characteristics (e.g., the claim that Donald Trump failed to win over Republicans because he is unpersuasive). These misperceptions may be encouraged by media focus on personality narratives, politicians\u2019 incentives to make grandiose promises on the campaign trail, and psychological tendencies to attribute behavior to internal dispositions rather than situational constraints (the \u201cfundamental attribution error\u201d -- see Jones and Nisbett 1971, Nisbett, Caputo, Legant, & Marecek 1973; but see Malle 2006). As a result, some people may have a stable tendency to attribute vast powers to the president consistent with the cultural mythology of presidential influence (Healy 2008) and to downplay institutional limitations on presidential power or control over events (e.g., Edwards 2003, 2012). However, beliefs about presidential power may interact with partisan motivated reasoning. Partisan supporters are motivated to believe that their candidates are responsible for good events, encouraging attributions of individual control, and not responsible for bad events, encouraging situational (or institutional) attributions of control. Partisan opponents, of course, are motivated to believe the opposite. As a result, beliefs about presidential power may shift in response to changes in the political environment, such as the partisanship of the president. To test these hypotheses, we conduct a survey experiment embedded in a panel study. The experiment focuses on a recent presidential policy failure and randomizes whether the failure is attributed to institutional constraints or the president\u2019s personal qualities (or no attribution). This design allows us to test whether beliefs about presidential power shift in response to policy failures and media frames about the causes of the failure. Additionally, the design allows us to test whether these effects are moderated by prior beliefs about presidential power and by prior attitudes towards the president (both measured in prior waves). (In previous exploratory research, we contrasted data from a multi-wave panel survey with a survey of scholarly experts recruited from the APSA Presidency & Executive Politics section to measure the prevalence of misperceptions about presidential power and control over political and economic outcomes.)"}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: Respondents who perceive high levels of presidential power will rate personal barriers to Donald Trump achieving his goals as greater and institutional barriers as weaker than those who perceive low levels of presidential power.

We will invite all participants who completed three previous survey waves that measured their demographic characteristics; political beliefs, attitudes, and knowledge; and beliefs about presidential control (878 individuals completed all three surveys). Prior to beginning the experiment, participants will be provided with a description of the study and reminded that participation is voluntary and that they are free to withdraw at any time. Participants will then be asked to indicate whether they agree to participate in the study. Respondents will receive a full debriefing at the conclusion of the study. Amazon does not provide any identifiable information to the investigators about the study participants, nor will we ask about any identifying information. The nature of data to be obtained: We will collect individual-level survey data, including questions about demographic/political characteristics and people\u2019s political beliefs and opinions. Randomization approach Participants in this wave of our panel will be randomly assigned with 1/3 probability to a control condition, to a condition attributing Donald Trump\u2019s failures to his personal behavior and characteristics, or to a condition attributing Donald Trump\u2019s failures to opposition from Congress. This randomization will be carried out in the Qualtrics survey platform. Data collection and blinding All data will be collected online on the Qualtrics survey platform. Primary and secondary outcome measures Before measuring our primary outcome variables (see below), we will re-measure respondents\u2019 beliefs about presidential power and presidential control over various outcomes, which were asked previously in waves 2 and 3. We ask these questions again here to assess the extent of stability in perceptions about presidential power and control across changes in the political environment. Presidential control over outcomes on a five-point scale where 5=total control: -The price of gasoline -The inflation rate -The level of civility in Washington, DC -The amount of gridlock in Congress Statements about presidential power where 4=very accurate for non-starred items and 4=not at all accurate for starred items: -There are no limits to what a president can achieve if he or she uses the powers of his/her office effectively. -Members of Congress can easily resist pressure from the president and vote how they choose.* -Partisanship makes it difficult for any president to achieve consensus on a controversial policy issue.* -Without large partisan majorities in Congress, most presidents will struggle to pass their agenda.* -Gridlock in Congress is typically the result of a failure of presidential leadership. -If a president doesn\u2019t follow through on a campaign promise, it\u2019s probably because they didn\u2019t really want it to happen. These scales have been previously tested so we will take the mean of each after reverse-coding (four-point scale for power, five-point for control). After a distracter task, respondents will answer our primary outcome measures, which focus on attributions for Donald Trump\u2019s failure on health care policy. These questions ask respondents to indicate the perceived accuracy of the following statements on a four-point accuracy scale from very accurate to not at all accurate. The first battery focuses on institutional barriers to Trump\u2019s health care bill while the second focuses on personality or tactical barriers. The order in which respondents answer each battery -- and the order of statements within each battery -- will be randomized. The divisions in Congress would have made it nearly impossible for any president to pass a health care bill. As president, Trump has relatively little leverage over Congress, making it difficult to pass his health care bill. Public opinion was a major obstacle to passing the health care bill Trump supported. Opposition from outside groups helped kill the health care bill Trump supported. The balance of power in Washington made it extremely difficult for Trump to enact the health care bill. Trump could have overcome opposition to his health care bill in Congress if he had made a stronger and more persuasive case. If Trump were a true leader, he would have convinced Congress to support his health care bill. The public could have been convinced to support the health care bill if Trump had more effectively shaped the debate over the issue. If Trump tried harder, he would have been be able to pass his health care bill. Trump\u2019s personality is preventing him from leading more effectively in the debate over his health care bill. The four items that make internal attributions will be coded so that 1=not at all accurate and 4=very accurate, while the external attributions will be coded so that 1=very accurate and 4=not at all accurate. The outcome measures will thus take higher values when respondents make internal attributions and lower values when they make external ones. We will take the mean of these ten outcome measures. If the items used for this measure scale together using principal component analysis, we will create a composite measure of Trump attributions and use it as our primary outcome measure. If the two subscales each scale together rather than as a single scale, we will consider Trump external attributions and internal attributions as separate outcome measures instead. If none of the items scale together well, we will analyze responses to each question separately. We will also exclude items that do not clearly load on a single scale. (Note: Though we will analyze the component questions of our primary outcome measure using principal component analysis, we will construct any combined outcome measure as means for ease of interpretation.) We will also consider the following secondary outcome measures. We will measure perceptions of Trump\u2019s traits (ratings on a 1-5 scale where 5=extremely well and 1=not at all well), job approval (on a 1-4 scale where 4=strongly approve), favorable ratings (on a 1-5 scale where 5=very favorable), and perceived ideology (on a 1-7 scale where 1=extremely liberal and 7=extremely conservative). We will consider each separately. Another set of questions will consider agreement with a series of statements that attribute political problems and outcomes to the types of people in office or the institutions and political context in which they serve (1-4 scale where 1=not at all accurate and 4=very accurate). The dysfunction in Washington could be solved if we had the right people in office. The average American could do a better job than most politicians. Any president will struggle when their party does not control Congress. No president can end gridlock or break polarization. If the items used for this measure scale together using principal component analysis, we will create a composite measure of attributions about political dysfunction using a simple mean after reverse-coding. We will exclude items that do not clearly load on the scale. If none of the items scale together well, we will analyze responses to each item separately. Finally, we include a binary measure that captures respondents\u2019 perceptions of the relative importance of personal versus institutional factors in determining Trump\u2019s ability to carry out his campaign promises. If you had to pick one, what do you think is the biggest barrier to Donald Trump successfully carrying out his campaign promises? -His behavior and personal characteristics -Opposition in Congress Statistical analyses All results will be estimated using OLS with robust standard errors and verified for robustness using appropriate GLM estimators (see below). We exclude control variables in our experimental analyses (see below). Finally, we split Trump supporters from opponents using a binary indicator for support reflecting job approval in the top two categories on a four-point approval scale (opponents are the omitted category). Several of the models we estimate will use measures of perceptions of presidential power constructed from the following items that were asked on wave 3 of the study (we also separately consider answers to these items on wave 4 as an outcome variable): Presidential control over outcomes on a five-point scale where 5=total control -The price of gasoline -The inflation rate -The level of civility in Washington, DC -The amount of gridlock in Congress Statements about presidential power where 4=very accurate for non-starred items and 4=not at all accurate for starred items: -There are no limits to what a president can achieve if he or she uses the powers of his/her office effectively. -Members of Congress can easily resist pressure from the president and vote how they choose.* -Partisanship makes it difficult for any president to achieve consensus on a controversial policy issue.* -Without large partisan majorities in Congress, most presidents will struggle to pass their agenda.* -Gridlock in Congress is typically the result of a failure of presidential leadership. -If a president doesn\u2019t follow through on a campaign promise, it\u2019s probably because they didn\u2019t really want it to happen. If the items used for this measure scale together using principal components factor analysis, we will create a composite measure of presidential attributions as a factor score and use it as our primary outcome measure. If the two subscales each scale together, we will consider presidential control and presidential power as separate independent variables, estimate factor scores for each, and run separate models for each in the analyses specified below. We will exclude items that do not clearly load on a single scale. We will estimate models of the following form (using pseudo Stata code): H1: Respondents who perceive high levels of presidential power will rate personal barriers to Donald Trump achieving his goals as greater and institutional barriers as weaker than those who perceive low levels of presidential power. reg Y pres_att female agegroup2 agegroup3 agegroup4 agegroup5 agegroup6 agegroup7 nonwhite political_knowledge college if control==1, robust where Y = the primary outcome measure(s) of Trump attributions described above, pres_att = the scale(s) described above measuring perceptions of presidential power/control in wave 3, and political_knowledge = the number of questions respondents answered correctly on a standard knowledge scale in a prior wave of the panel. Because this is an observational analysis estimated only within the control group, we include controls for gender, age, race, and education. H2: Following a policy failure, perceptions of presidential power will decline more among respondents who support Trump than among respondents who oppose Trump. reg Y pres_att support pres_att*support female agegroup2 agegroup3 agegroup4 agegroup5 agegroup6 agegroup7 nonwhite political_knowledge college, robust Where Y = the scale(s) described above measuring perceptions of presidential power/control at wave 4, pres_att = the same scale(s) measured at wave 3, support = dichotomous indicator for Trump support measured at wave 3 (1=support, 0 otherwise). Because this is an observational analysis, we include controls for gender, age, race, and education. H3a: Exposure to a frame attributing Trump's failures to his personal characteristics and behavior will increase the perceived importance of personal factors in determining the success of a president and decrease the perceived importance of institutional factors (relative to a baseline condition in which no explanation is provided). H4a: Exposure to a frame attributing Trump's failures to institutional constraints will decrease the perceived importance of personal factors in determining the success of a president and increase the perceived importance of institutional factors (relative to a baseline condition in which no explanation is provided). reg Y personal institutional, robust Where Y = perceived importance of personal (or institutional) factors, personal = binary indicator for assignment to personality frame, institutional = binary indicator for assignment to institutional frame. H3b: These effects (personal frame) will be larger among Trump opponents than among Trump supporters. H4b: These effects (institutional frame) will be larger among Trump supporters than among Trump opponents. reg Y personal institutional support personal*support institutional*support, robust H3c: Among respondents who perceive high levels of presidential power, these effects (personal) will be larger among Trump opponents than among Trump supporters. H4c: Among respondents who perceive low levels of presidential power, these effects (institutional) will be larger among Trump supporters than among Trump opponents. reg Y personal##support##pres_att institutional##support##pres_att, robust (As noted below, we may conduct a binary split on pres_att and report it in the main text for ease of interpretation and then report the interaction with the continuous variable in the appendix. We will also test the linearity assumption per Hainmueller et al. and substitute a median split if it is not satisfied given the sample size constraints we face.) We also consider the following research questions where we have weaker theoretical priors. RQ1: Among Trump supporters, we will examine whether exposure to a frame attributing Trump's failures to his personal characteristics and behavior increases the perceived importance of personal factors in determining the success of a president and decreases the perceived importance of institutional factors more (relative to a baseline condition in which no explanation is provided) among those who perceive high levels of presidential power than those who perceive low levels of presidential power. RQ2: Among Trump opponents, we will examine whether exposure to a frame attributing Trump's failures to institutional constraints decreases the perceived importance of personal factors in determining the success of a president and increases the perceived importance of institutional factors more (relative to a baseline condition in which no explanation is provided) among those who perceive low levels of presidential power than those who perceive high levels of presidential power. We will test RQ1 and RQ2 using the output of the model above, computing appropriate marginal effects per Brambor et al. if the interaction model satisfies the linearity assumption. Otherwise we will compute marginal effects for high and low perceptions of presidential power using a median split per above. RQ3: We will consider whether exposure to the personal and institutional attribution frames affects perceptions of Trump\u2019s traits, job approval, favorable ratings, and perceived ideology (relative to a baseline condition in which no explanation is provided). We will estimate a model of the following form for each of the trait dependent variables, job approval, favorability rating, and perceived ideology: reg Y personal institutional, robust RQ4: We will consider whether the frames affect attributions of political conflict and dysfunction to the kinds of people who serve versus the configuration of institutions and political context in which they serve. reg Y personal institutional, robust where Y is the scale described above. Notes: -For interaction terms, scales, and moderators, if results are consistent using a median/tercile split or indicators rather than a continuous scale, we may present the latter in the main text for ease of exposition and include the continuous scale results in an appendix. We will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from the models described below. We will also use tercile indicators to test whether the linearity assumption holds for interactions per Hainmueller et al (N.d.) and replace the continuous interactions in our models with them if it does not. -We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models, including treatment effects by subgroup and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. -We will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from any interaction models. In some cases, we may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity. If so, we will verify that we can reject the null of no difference in treatment effects in a more complex interactive model reported in an appendix when possible. -We will also compute and report summary statistics for our samples. We will also collect and may report response timing data as a proxy for respondent attention. -The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity. -Where applicable, regression results for binary dependent variables will be verified for robustness using probit. Regression results for individual ordered dependent variables will be verified for robustness using ordered probit. -We may estimate the experimental models described above with a standard set of covariates (indicators for gender, age groups, race, a four-year college degree, and their score on a standard political knowledge scale) if including those has a substantively important effect on the precision of our treatment effect estimates.

In this project, we examine misperceptions about presidential power. Citizens and journalists alike often credit or blame the president for many outcomes over which she has little to no control. In particular, presidents\u2019 failure to overcome institutional obstacles such as partisan opposition in Congress is often attributed to their personal characteristics (e.g., the claim that Donald Trump failed to win over Republicans because he is unpersuasive). These misperceptions may be encouraged by media focus on personality narratives, politicians\u2019 incentives to make grandiose promises on the campaign trail, and psychological tendencies to attribute behavior to internal dispositions rather than situational constraints (the \u201cfundamental attribution error\u201d -- see Jones and Nisbett 1971, Nisbett, Caputo, Legant, & Marecek 1973; but see Malle 2006). As a result, some people may have a stable tendency to attribute vast powers to the president consistent with the cultural mythology of presidential influence (Healy 2008) and to downplay institutional limitations on presidential power or control over events (e.g., Edwards 2003, 2012). However, beliefs about presidential power may interact with partisan motivated reasoning. Partisan supporters are motivated to believe that their candidates are responsible for good events, encouraging attributions of individual control, and not responsible for bad events, encouraging situational (or institutional) attributions of control. Partisan opponents, of course, are motivated to believe the opposite. As a result, beliefs about presidential power may shift in response to changes in the political environment, such as the partisanship of the president. To test these hypotheses, we conduct a survey experiment embedded in a panel study. The experiment focuses on a recent presidential policy failure and randomizes whether the failure is attributed to institutional constraints or the president\u2019s personal qualities (or no attribution). This design allows us to test whether beliefs about presidential power shift in response to policy failures and media frames about the causes of the failure. Additionally, the design allows us to test whether these effects are moderated by prior beliefs about presidential power and by prior attitudes towards the president (both measured in prior waves). (In previous exploratory research, we contrasted data from a multi-wave panel survey with a survey of scholarly experts recruited from the APSA Presidency & Executive Politics section to measure the prevalence of misperceptions about presidential power and control over political and economic outcomes.)", "q16": "H1: Respondents who perceive high levels of presidential power will rate personal barriers to Donald Trump achieving his goals as greater and institutional barriers as weaker than those who perceive low levels of presidential power.

We will invite all participants who completed three previous survey waves that measured their demographic characteristics; political beliefs, attitudes, and knowledge; and beliefs about presidential control (878 individuals completed all three surveys). Prior to beginning the experiment, participants will be provided with a description of the study and reminded that participation is voluntary and that they are free to withdraw at any time. Participants will then be asked to indicate whether they agree to participate in the study. Respondents will receive a full debriefing at the conclusion of the study. Amazon does not provide any identifiable information to the investigators about the study participants, nor will we ask about any identifying information. The nature of data to be obtained: We will collect individual-level survey data, including questions about demographic/political characteristics and people\u2019s political beliefs and opinions. Randomization approach Participants in this wave of our panel will be randomly assigned with 1/3 probability to a control condition, to a condition attributing Donald Trump\u2019s failures to his personal behavior and characteristics, or to a condition attributing Donald Trump\u2019s failures to opposition from Congress. This randomization will be carried out in the Qualtrics survey platform. Data collection and blinding All data will be collected online on the Qualtrics survey platform. Primary and secondary outcome measures Before measuring our primary outcome variables (see below), we will re-measure respondents\u2019 beliefs about presidential power and presidential control over various outcomes, which were asked previously in waves 2 and 3. We ask these questions again here to assess the extent of stability in perceptions about presidential power and control across changes in the political environment. Presidential control over outcomes on a five-point scale where 5=total control: -The price of gasoline -The inflation rate -The level of civility in Washington, DC -The amount of gridlock in Congress Statements about presidential power where 4=very accurate for non-starred items and 4=not at all accurate for starred items: -There are no limits to what a president can achieve if he or she uses the powers of his/her office effectively. -Members of Congress can easily resist pressure from the president and vote how they choose.* -Partisanship makes it difficult for any president to achieve consensus on a controversial policy issue.* -Without large partisan majorities in Congress, most presidents will struggle to pass their agenda.* -Gridlock in Congress is typically the result of a failure of presidential leadership. -If a president doesn\u2019t follow through on a campaign promise, it\u2019s probably because they didn\u2019t really want it to happen. These scales have been previously tested so we will take the mean of each after reverse-coding (four-point scale for power, five-point for control). After a distracter task, respondents will answer our primary outcome measures, which focus on attributions for Donald Trump\u2019s failure on health care policy. These questions ask respondents to indicate the perceived accuracy of the following statements on a four-point accuracy scale from very accurate to not at all accurate. The first battery focuses on institutional barriers to Trump\u2019s health care bill while the second focuses on personality or tactical barriers. The order in which respondents answer each battery -- and the order of statements within each battery -- will be randomized. The divisions in Congress would have made it nearly impossible for any president to pass a health care bill. As president, Trump has relatively little leverage over Congress, making it difficult to pass his health care bill. Public opinion was a major obstacle to passing the health care bill Trump supported. Opposition from outside groups helped kill the health care bill Trump supported. The balance of power in Washington made it extremely difficult for Trump to enact the health care bill. Trump could have overcome opposition to his health care bill in Congress if he had made a stronger and more persuasive case. If Trump were a true leader, he would have convinced Congress to support his health care bill. The public could have been convinced to support the health care bill if Trump had more effectively shaped the debate over the issue. If Trump tried harder, he would have been be able to pass his health care bill. Trump\u2019s personality is preventing him from leading more effectively in the debate over his health care bill. The four items that make internal attributions will be coded so that 1=not at all accurate and 4=very accurate, while the external attributions will be coded so that 1=very accurate and 4=not at all accurate. The outcome measures will thus take higher values when respondents make internal attributions and lower values when they make external ones. We will take the mean of these ten outcome measures. If the items used for this measure scale together using principal component analysis, we will create a composite measure of Trump attributions and use it as our primary outcome measure. If the two subscales each scale together rather than as a single scale, we will consider Trump external attributions and internal attributions as separate outcome measures instead. If none of the items scale together well, we will analyze responses to each question separately. We will also exclude items that do not clearly load on a single scale. (Note: Though we will analyze the component questions of our primary outcome measure using principal component analysis, we will construct any combined outcome measure as means for ease of interpretation.) We will also consider the following secondary outcome measures. We will measure perceptions of Trump\u2019s traits (ratings on a 1-5 scale where 5=extremely well and 1=not at all well), job approval (on a 1-4 scale where 4=strongly approve), favorable ratings (on a 1-5 scale where 5=very favorable), and perceived ideology (on a 1-7 scale where 1=extremely liberal and 7=extremely conservative). We will consider each separately. Another set of questions will consider agreement with a series of statements that attribute political problems and outcomes to the types of people in office or the institutions and political context in which they serve (1-4 scale where 1=not at all accurate and 4=very accurate). The dysfunction in Washington could be solved if we had the right people in office. The average American could do a better job than most politicians. Any president will struggle when their party does not control Congress. No president can end gridlock or break polarization. If the items used for this measure scale together using principal component analysis, we will create a composite measure of attributions about political dysfunction using a simple mean after reverse-coding. We will exclude items that do not clearly load on the scale. If none of the items scale together well, we will analyze responses to each item separately. Finally, we include a binary measure that captures respondents\u2019 perceptions of the relative importance of personal versus institutional factors in determining Trump\u2019s ability to carry out his campaign promises. If you had to pick one, what do you think is the biggest barrier to Donald Trump successfully carrying out his campaign promises? -His behavior and personal characteristics -Opposition in Congress Statistical analyses All results will be estimated using OLS with robust standard errors and verified for robustness using appropriate GLM estimators (see below). We exclude control variables in our experimental analyses (see below). Finally, we split Trump supporters from opponents using a binary indicator for support reflecting job approval in the top two categories on a four-point approval scale (opponents are the omitted category). Several of the models we estimate will use measures of perceptions of presidential power constructed from the following items that were asked on wave 3 of the study (we also separately consider answers to these items on wave 4 as an outcome variable): Presidential control over outcomes on a five-point scale where 5=total control -The price of gasoline -The inflation rate -The level of civility in Washington, DC -The amount of gridlock in Congress Statements about presidential power where 4=very accurate for non-starred items and 4=not at all accurate for starred items: -There are no limits to what a president can achieve if he or she uses the powers of his/her office effectively. -Members of Congress can easily resist pressure from the president and vote how they choose.* -Partisanship makes it difficult for any president to achieve consensus on a controversial policy issue.* -Without large partisan majorities in Congress, most presidents will struggle to pass their agenda.* -Gridlock in Congress is typically the result of a failure of presidential leadership. -If a president doesn\u2019t follow through on a campaign promise, it\u2019s probably because they didn\u2019t really want it to happen. If the items used for this measure scale together using principal components factor analysis, we will create a composite measure of presidential attributions as a factor score and use it as our primary outcome measure. If the two subscales each scale together, we will consider presidential control and presidential power as separate independent variables, estimate factor scores for each, and run separate models for each in the analyses specified below. We will exclude items that do not clearly load on a single scale. We will estimate models of the following form (using pseudo Stata code): H1: Respondents who perceive high levels of presidential power will rate personal barriers to Donald Trump achieving his goals as greater and institutional barriers as weaker than those who perceive low levels of presidential power. reg Y pres_att female agegroup2 agegroup3 agegroup4 agegroup5 agegroup6 agegroup7 nonwhite political_knowledge college if control==1, robust where Y = the primary outcome measure(s) of Trump attributions described above, pres_att = the scale(s) described above measuring perceptions of presidential power/control in wave 3, and political_knowledge = the number of questions respondents answered correctly on a standard knowledge scale in a prior wave of the panel.

Because this is an observational analysis, we include controls for gender, age, race, and education.

We will test RQ1 and RQ2 using the output of the model above, computing appropriate marginal effects per Brambor et al. if the interaction model satisfies the linearity assumption. Otherwise we will compute marginal effects for high and low perceptions of presidential power using a median split per above. RQ3: We will consider whether exposure to the personal and institutional attribution frames affects perceptions of Trump\u2019s traits, job approval, favorable ratings, and perceived ideology (relative to a baseline condition in which no explanation is provided).

Regression results for individual ordered dependent variables will be verified for robustness using ordered probit. -We may estimate the experimental models described above with a standard set of covariates (indicators for gender, age groups, race, a four-year college degree, and their score on a standard political knowledge scale) if including those has a substantively important effect on the precision of our treatment effect estimates.
