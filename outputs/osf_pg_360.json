This contributes to political economy puzzle: why do incumbents invest substantial funds in projects that do not help them to secure their office, but will most likely pay off when their successor is in power, given their budget constraint.

Contrary to this argument, I expect that pro-R&D policies do not benefit politicians\u2019 popularity. In order to test these hypotheses, I conduct survey experiment in Russia and USA, where I present respondents with random vignettes stating that an incumbent invested heavily in R&D, education, and infrastructure, and short-term innovation.

(2018), which focuses on using the random forest algorithm (Friedman et al., 2009) consisting of a large number of Classificaiton and Regression Trees (CART) (Breiman et al., 1984) to estimate features of the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) rather than the CATE itself because it relaxes many of the required assumptions. We focus specifically on estimating the individual-specific conditional average treatment effects, grouping those individuals into quintiles based on their predicted conditional average treatment effect, and then taking the difference in means of the included covariates between those in the highest and lowest quintile of predicted conditional average treatment effects. Under our hypotheses, we would expect the difference in means of covariates that are associated with social and economic uncertainty to be statistically significant from zero between those in the highest and lowest quintiles.", "q18": "", "q19": "45,979 respondents", "q20": "", "q21": "", "q22": "", "q23": "", "q24": "N/A", "q25": "N/A", "q26": "", "q27": "", "q28": "", "q29": "", "q30": "",

"Empirical deliberative democracy experiments have amply demonstrated that deliberation can increase political knowledge (Fishkin and Luskin, 2005; List et al, 2003) and political sophistication (Gastil and Dillard, 1999; Druckman and Nelson, 2003), but they have not causally identified deliberation itself as the causal mechanism. This is largely due to control groups that insufficiently control for all the characteristics of a deliberative body that might plausibly affect experimental subjects, such as audience monitoring, sunk costs, listening to and being heard by others, etc. But there is good reason to think that even if these deliberative components are present in a control group that the effects of the deliberation would still obtain relative to that group. Claus Scharmer theorizes that conversations come in two general forms: explicit knowledge conversations where participants ask and answer questions and aggregate their knowledge, and implicit knowledge conversations where participants deliberate and brainstorm and generate new knowledge (Scharmer, 2001). Scharmer's theory suggests that implicit knowledge conversations are more sophisticated than explicit knowledge conversations, and further that the more sophisticated the form of communication, the more sophisticated the participants become. As such, I propose a novel control group for a deliberative conversation: a question and answer (Q&A) session. A Q&A session can control for the aforementioned components of deliberation while still varying on what should theoretically matter as deliberation relates to political sophistication: the form of conversation itself. This study will thus measure the empirical effects of deliberation against both an information packet (which is a standard practice) as well as a Q&A session to discover whether conversation sophistication itself matters, or whether it's some other component of the deliberative process.

This is largely due to control groups that insufficiently control for all the characteristics of a deliberative body that might plausibly affect experimental subjects, such as audience monitoring, sunk costs, listening to and being heard by others, etc. But there is good reason to think that even if these deliberative components are present in a control group that the effects of the deliberation would still obtain relative to that group. Claus Scharmer theorizes that conversations come in two general forms: explicit knowledge conversations where participants ask and answer questions and aggregate their knowledge, and implicit knowledge conversations where participants deliberate and brainstorm and generate new knowledge (Scharmer, 2001). Scharmer's theory suggests that implicit knowledge conversations are more sophisticated than explicit knowledge conversations, and further that the more sophisticated the form of communication, the more sophisticated the participants become. As such, I propose a novel control group for a deliberative conversation: a question and answer (Q&A) session. A Q&A session can control for the aforementioned components of deliberation while still varying on what should theoretically matter as deliberation relates to political sophistication: the form of conversation itself. This study will thus measure the empirical effects of deliberation against both an information packet (which is a standard practice) as well as a Q&A session to discover whether conversation sophistication itself matters, or whether it's some other component of the deliberative process.
