Studies in English and Chinese will be included. are eligible for inclusion.\n\n7. Intervention(s), exposure(s): Treatment of Schuell language training combined with head acupuncture alone, including ordinary acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, needle, fire needle and plum blossom needle.\n\n8. Comparator(s)/control: Including language rehabilitation alone, head acupuncture alone, western medicine alone, or sham acupuncture, blank control, placebo control and other interventions. Interventions in the experimental group were not included.\n\n9. Types of study to be included: We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published and unpublished, in English and Chinese.\n\n10. Main outcome(s): Main outcomes include the Boston diagnostic aphasia (BDAE), Aphasia quotient (AQ), Chinese Functional Communication Profile (CFCP), Communicative Abilities of Daily Living (CADL), and total effective rate, which is the sum of \"effective rate\" and \" markedly effective rate\".\n\n11.

Data extraction (selection and coding): Three reviewers (Qinwei Fu, Jing Feng and Lanzhi Zhang) searched the online databases listed above and recorded the titles and abstracts of all the articles. Three evaluators (Xinyun Hu, Lixin Yang and Yunxiang Zhao) assessed the eligibility of these articles and made decisions on every research (inclusion or exclusion) independently. If they did not reach the same decision, the concerned articles were discussed with a fourth reviewer (Qinxiu Zhang). Three reviewers (Jing Feng, Yunxiang Zhao, and Hui Yang) extracted data independently from each study. Differences of extracted data were solved after discussion with a fourth reviewer (Qinwei Fu).\n\n13.Risk of bias (quality) assessment: Three authors of our review team will independently assess the methodological quality of included trials, and consensus will be reached by discussion with a third party in case of discrepancy.\nThe methodological quality of RCTs will be assessed according to the risk of bias tool described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [Higgins JPT 2009]. Six elements will be assessed: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, free of selective reporting, and other bias. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion with a third party.\n\n14. Strategy for data synthesis: Statistical analyses will be performed using RevMan 5.3 software (The Cochrane Collaboration).\n- Pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of dichotomous outcomes will be used to report effect estimate.\n- Continuous data will be presented as mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. If different measurement scales are used, standardized mean difference (SMD) will be performed to analyze continuous data.\nIf required data are not reported, we will try to obtain data from corresponding author.\nHeterogeneity will be assessed using both the \u03c7\u00b2 test and the I\u00b2 statistic, and we will consider an I\u00b2 value greater than 50% indicative of substantial heterogeneity.\n- For I\u00b2&lt;50%, a fixed-effect model is used.\n- For I\u00b2 &gt;=50%, a random-effect model is applied.\nIf data permit, we plan to exclude some trials that contribuite most to the heterogeneity to see whether the result change or not.\nWe will also use a summary of findings table to present the main findings using GRADEpro software (The Cochrane Collaboration). Funnel plots will be generated to detect publication bias if more than 10 trials are identified to report the same outcomes. If appropriate, we will use cumulative meta-analyses. Results of meta-analyses will be visualized by forest plots. In addition, we will conduct trial sequential analysis to evaluate the meta-analyses for primary outcomes, which can reveal the required information size and potentially false results in a meta-analysis. Intention-to-treat analysis will be applied for primary outcome, if missing data from the original trials are available.\n\n15. Analysis of subgroups or subsets: If data permitted, we plan to conduct subgroup analyses for different groups, including:\nDifferent age of patients\nDifferent severity of disease\nDifferent regimen applied\nDifferent treat time\nDifferent acupoints selected\nCombined with other interventions or not.\n\n16.
