(4) Reported mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE) for at least one parameter [fasting blood glucose (FBG), homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), insulin] in both the control and treatment groups at baseline and at the end of trial. (5) Use of probiotics in any formulations or in dairy products and any species/strains/treatment/dose of live probiotics or synbiotics. The following exclusion criteria will be also applied: (1) non-randomized clinical trials; (2) uncontrolled studies (lack of a placebo control); (3) reported duplicate data; or (4) reviews, letters or case reports.  \n\nData Sources and Searches\nThis meta-analysis will be conducted and reported in accordance with the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook and the relevant criteria from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement . The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cochranelibrary/search; to 1 December 2019), Medline (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed; 1945 to 1 December 2019), Web of Science (http://isiknowledge.com; 1900 to 1 December 2019), and Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/; to 1 December 2019) were subjected to a systematic search of the published literature. The strategy presented in Supplementary Table 1 to identify RCTs. The search will be not language restricted. The final search will be conducted on December 1, 2019. \n\nData Extraction and Quality Assessment\nY.Y.S., and F.W.T. independently will extract the following data from the 15 studies deem eligible for inclusion: study design, first author\u2019s name, publication year, mean age and BMI of the participants, number of participants, sample size, duration of intervention, general details of the intervention (type, form, dose of probiotics), details of both the experimental intervention (type of oral supplementation, dosage, number of species) and the control and outcomes (FBG, insulin, QUICKI, HOMA-IR).\n\nThe overall certainty of the evidence will be evaluated using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach , where evidence will be graded as very low, low, moderate, or high-certainty quality. Evidence obtained from RCTs receives an initial grade of high. Scores can be downgraded based on study limitations (assessed by the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool), inconsistency (substantial unexplained heterogeneity, I2 &gt; 50%, P &lt; 0.05), indirectness (presence of factors that limit the generalizability of the results), imprecision (95% CI for the pooled effect estimates that are wide or overlap minimally important differences for benefit or harm), and publication bias (significant evidence of small-study effects). The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias of each individual study via a domain-based evaluation. The following criteria will be assessed by the two authors: random sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias), blinding of the outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (due to the amount, nature or handling of incomplete outcome data), selective reporting (reporting bias) and other bias. Disagreements will be resolved by a third adjudicator.    \n                        \nData Synthesis and Analysis \nThe meta-analysis will be conducted using RevMan version 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 2.0 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA). For all PCOS symptoms, mean differences (MDs) in the outcome data will be used in the meta-analysis if they will be reported by at least three studies. For outcomes that could be measured using different units, the reported effects will be presented as standardized mean differences (SMD). The meta-analysis also implemented a random-effect model based on the detected heterogeneity among studies . The effect sizes are presented as mean differences with 95% confidence intervals, and P values &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Heterogeneity will be explored quantitatively using Cochran's Q-test [26] and I-square statistics (I2) . Here, I2 values of &lt;25%, 25% to &lt;75% and &gt;75% will be considered to indicate low, moderate and high heterogeneity, respectively. When the I2 value wwill be \u226525%, the possible reasons for heterogeneity were investigated using the following methods: (1) subgroup analysis (according to the number of bacterial species and source of strain isolation); (2) sensitivity analysis, to identify which trial caused the heterogeneity and how each trial contribute to the overall analysis; and (3) random effect meta-regression, to identify which trials caused heterogeneity and how the trials contribute to the overall analysis. The mean change and SD for each index will be used to evaluate the effect size of the intervention. For studies that do not report the index, the SD of the mean difference will be calculated using the following formula: SD2 = [(SD baseline2 + SD final2) - (2\u00d7R\u00d7SD baseline\u00d7SD final)], where the correlation coefficient (R) will be set at 0.5. Begg\u2019s rank correlation test and Egger\u2019s regression intercept test will be applied to each included trial to evaluate publication bias .
