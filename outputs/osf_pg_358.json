Research has demonstrated the cable channel has conservatizing effects on both the mass public and elites (e.g. DellaVigna and Kaplan 2007; Enamorado and Clinton 2012; Martin and Yurukoglu 2014). Our study extends this work, attempting to provide more credible measures of the Fox News Effect, to identify more precisely the relationship between the amount of exposure to Fox News programming and any resulting attitudinal change, and to identify who is most susceptible to partisan media effects. Our approach is distinguished by its avoidance of the pitfalls that confront many studies of media effects. Rather than rely on stylized lab settings or as-if experimental designs, we administer a cost-efficient field experiment on the media in question. Specifically, we focus on the \u201cdosage effects\u201d of Fox News. Does Fox New programming have a conservatizing effect? How much exposure to Fox News opinion programming does it take to change political beliefs and attitudes? The most recent research indicates that the answer may be stunningly small. According to Martin and Yurukoglu (2017), among those who were randomly exposed to watching only an additional 2.5 minutes of Fox News per week, Republican vote share increased by 0.3%. If only 2.5 minutes of random exposure can have an identifiable effect on outcomes, what about random exposure to larger amounts of time viewing Fox News programming? Thus our study seeks to answer the following questions: Does exposure to Fox News influence evaluations of parties and political leaders? Will individuals begin to adopt the frames utilized by the network in its coverage of policies and issues? Will they be persuaded to move in a conservative direction on those issues highlighted in the content viewed? Does more exposure in fact produce larger effects? Who is most influenced? Or do we actually uncover little evidence for persuasive effects of partisan news programming? To answer these questions, we will implement an encouragement design, whereby participants are randomly encouraged and incentivized to watch 30 minutes of the Fox News Channel program \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d for one night or three nights or to watch a Food Network for 30 minutes one night. [fn] Encouragement designs are used frequently in medical research or research in which it is unfeasible or unethical to deny or force access to treatment. (For a review, consult Sovey and Green 2011.) In our case, while we cannot force people in the real world to watch Fox News, we can encourage them to, and we can offer them compensation for doing so. This approach allows us to avoid the identification problems related to self-selection into partisan media that come with observational designs. With random assignment we can study partisan media while overcoming people\u2019s propensity to self-select into ideologically consistent media. At the same time, we are ensuring that individuals are exposed to media content under realistic conditions, an improvement over the external validity issues raised by laboratory experiments of media effects. [/fn] A growing literature has focused on the effects of partisan news, a literature that is embedded in the more general literature on media effects. That wider literature suggests that significant persuasive media effects may be small to non-existent. Other work argues that with the rise of partisan media and selective exposure media effects may be substantial but self-canceling in the aggregate. Partisan media, of the sort embodied by Fox News and MSNBC, may play an especially large role in canceling out media effects (Bennett and Iyengar 2008). If each side has its own praise chorus, and citizens only acquire information from their co-partisan sources, then overall media effects will hardly be discernible. There is reason to expect partisan media does matter and that the effects may depend on initial partisan perspectives. In a series of lab experiments, Levendusky (2013) finds partisan media to have polarizing effects, with partisans becoming more entrenched in their beliefs. He also finds that these polarizing effects survive for several days after initial exposure. With survey evidence from 2008, Dilliplane (2014) shows that partisan media can affect vote choice as well; by her account, partisan media exposure reinforces party vote choice. However, Arceneaux and Johnson (2013) suggest that partisan media effects are limited by self-selection and media choice. Given a choice, most individuals prefer entertainment and other programming to partisan media with those most likely to be influenced more likely to avoid news generally and partisan news in particular. They also find that when forced to watch cross partisan channels individuals are not persuaded but rather dig in on their initial views. Consistent with motivated reasoning, their work suggests that those exposed to partisan content consistent with their predispositions will be reinforced in their perspectives but those exposed to a counter-partisan channel may discount that framing (Arceneaux and Johnson, 2013). This and other research (Zaller, 1992) would lead us to expect that those who are less informed and weaker partisan should be more susceptible to partisan media effects. Other prior work (Gross, Porter, Wood 2016) has uncovered effects of partisan news (Fox News Channel and MSNBC) post-debate spin on evaluations of Clinton and Trump debate performance following the first presidential debate of the 2016 election. Those who watched post-debate coverage on Fox were more positively disposed toward Trump and less positively disposed toward Clinton. One week later, they uncover effects among moderate partisans with negative effects on Clinton evaluations among weak Democrats who watched the Fox commentary and positive effects on Clinton evaluations among weak Republicans who watched the MSNBC commentary. Prior research into Fox News has claimed that the network, with its demonstrated partisan leanings, is capable of generating substantively large political effects. DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007) exploit the gradual dissemination of Fox News across the United States between 1996 and 2000 to find that the channel resulted in a 0.7% surge in support for the Republican Party in the 2000 presidential election, compared to 1996, in towns that were airing Fox News by the later date. More recently, Martin and Yurukoglu (2017) have leveraged the random placement of Fox News on the proverbial cable dial to find that a miniscule amount of random additional exposure to the network increases Republican vote share by 0.3%. While both estimates are credible and well-identified, they are nonetheless limited, in that they are built on statistical assumptions that may not be true. For example, there is reason to doubt that the placement of Fox News on the cable dial is as random as Martin and Yurukoglu claim. Both studies were designed to mimic the robustness of an experiment, without actually implementing one. In contrast, our study would constitute an actual field experiment about Fox News, focused on how Americans change their views in real time because of exposure to the network. We expect to find effects of Fox News on evaluations of Trump and the political parties. We also expect Fox New will have a conservatizing effect on opinion on those issues highlighted in their programming. If our expectations are not met, and exposure does not change minds to the degree we anticipate, this would suggest that prior research has relied on faulty assumptions that have exaggerated the impact of the network. On the other hand, if indeed we do detect what we expect--that Fox News can change minds--we will be able to show how much Fox News viewers must watch before their minds are changed. Either way, we believe that this project would mark a significant advancement in the study of Fox News specifically and media effects more broadly."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Our initial recruitment will be done through a short survey on Mechanical Turk that will be used to identify individuals who have access to cable and to gather relevant demographic and background data on subjects. From this, we will randomly assign subjects to one of three conditions. In the Maximum Dosage condition, subjects will be encouraged to watch the Fox News Program Tucker Carlson Tonight for thirty minutes for three separate weekday nights. In the Minimal Dosage condition, subjects will be encouraged to watch Tucker Carlson Tonight for thirty minutes for one night. There will also be a control group that will watch a Food Network program airing at the same time as Tucker Carlson for thirty minutes for one night. Our main dependent variables are measured with a survey on day three for the maximum dosage condition which coincides with the day that the minimum dosage condition and control group are assigned to watch. Prior work shows Fox News to generally provide a conservative slant (Martin and Yurukoglu, 2017; Aday, 2010). Thus, we expect the effect of exposure to Fox News opinion programing will be to move individuals in a conservative direction in terms of their attitudes and opinions. Because the nature and size of effects would likely depend on the specific content that airs during the nights we field the study, our study will include careful analysis of each nights broadcast to measure political context. Our observation of Tucker Carlson Tonight suggests that the show includes content that regularly critiques democrats, generally offers support for republicans and the administration, and offers conservative perspectives on policy including consistent support for restrictive immigration policy. HYPOTHESES H1 Fox News Conservatizing Effects on Attitudes and Opinions While we anticipate heterogeneous effects as noted below, we expect overall main effects of Fox News based on the prior work demonstrating effects of Fox News on republican vote. Specifically because of the conservative nature of commentary on Fox News\u2019 opinion programming like Tucker Carlson Tonight which fairly consistently critiques Democrats, supports Republicans and the administration, and offers conservative perspectives on policies like immigration we hypothesize that: H1A. Exposure to Fox News will influence evaluations of leaders and parties We expect that exposure to Fox News programming will lead individuals to feel more positively disposed toward Donald Trump and the Republican Party and more negatively disposed toward the Democratic Party. H1B. Exposure to Fox News will cause individuals to bring their policy views closer in line with those espoused on the programs they view. We expect that exposure to Fox News programming will lead individuals to express move conservative views toward the policies that are a focus of the programming watched (e.g. more support for restrictive immigration policy, more skepticism toward the Mueller investigation if those topics are a focus of the program on night of study). H1C. Exposure to Fox News will make individuals say the scope of government should be restricted. Given the general conservative slant of Carlson\u2019s program, we expect exposure to Fox News programming will lead individuals to be more likely to say the scope of government should be restricted. H2. Dosage Effects We expect Fox News effects will be larger for those assigned to watch more Fox programming compared to those assigned to watch less Fox programming. H3. Heterogeneous Effects To understand who is effected by Fox News exposure, we also examine our effects separately by strength of partisanship and racial resentment. We have some expectation of differential influence based on how the content interacts with an individual\u2019s prior views. Specifically, we expect stronger partisans will either be encountering information consistent with their perspectives and thus it is merely reinforcing or encountering counter-partisan information which motivated reasoning may lead them to reject. This will limit effects among strong partisans. Thus we expect it is those with weak partisan attachments and independents who are most influenced. H3A. Fox News Effects will be strongest among those with weak partisan attachments. Based on our own prior work and Zaller, we expect that those with weaker partisan attachments and independents will be more open to persuasion. Thus we expect Fox News Effects to be stronger among those with weak partisan attachments. H3B. Fox News Effects will be stronger among those high on racial resentment. The implicit racialized rhetoric that often see on Carlson\u2019s program should be more persuasive among those high on racial resentment. We would particularly expect this if immigration is a key issue in the content during our study."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "Participants in our study will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Maximum Dosage Fox News Condition where watch Tucker Carlson Tonight for 30 minutes each night for three nights in a row; Minimum Dosage Fox News Condition where watch Tucker Carlson Tonight for 30 minutes one night and a Control Group where watch the Food Network Program Chopped for 30 minutes one night. Those in the Minimum Dosage and Control groups watch on what will be evening three for the Maximum Dosage condition. All groups then get the survey measuring our key outcome variables shortly after treatment that evening. To assess effects, our survey will ask participants their feelings about President Trump, the Republican and Democratic Parties, and their positions on a variety of policy issues (gun control, immigration, taxes, trade, and healthcare). We will include additional specific questions on issues that are the focus on the news cycle at the time of our study (specific questions decided on the day of the treatment to take advantage of the issues covered by the program in the week/on the day we administer the study). In addition, we will evaluate compliance with the treatment including questions on whether they watched on their assigned channel and a comprehension question about content that aired in the last five minutes of the programming they watched. [fn] Those in the maximum dosage condition will be sent a survey each night of the study. On nights 1 and 2 they will get only a very short survey focused on compliance evaluation.[/fn] By comparing responses of those assigned to watch more Fox News with those assigned to watch less Fox News, and by comparing responses of those assigned to watch any Fox News with those not assigned to watch any Fox, we will have estimates of the Fox News Effect in general, and the extent to which the effect is moderated by dosage amount. Our expectations, based on prior work, are that any exposure to Fox News will cause subjects to feel more positively disposed toward Donald Trump and the Republican Party, more negatively disposed toward the Democratic Party and will bring their policy views closer in line with those espoused by the network. We expect that the effects will be larger for those assigned to watch more Fox News, compared to those assigned to watch less. We also examine heterogeneous effects based on strength of partisanship and racial resentment. We expect stronger effects among weak partisans and independents and among those higher in racial resentment. We will measure effects both in an Intent-to-Treat framework, whereby we do not account for compliance, and as a function of compliance, where we focus only on those we believe successfully complied with their assignment. The size of the effects will likely depend on the content that airs the nights we field the study, which of course we cannot control. To account for this we will have a larger battery of policy questions related to the issues featured that evening added once we know the content of the program.

Our study extends this work, attempting to provide more credible measures of the Fox News Effect, to identify more precisely the relationship between the amount of exposure to Fox News programming and any resulting attitudinal change, and to identify who is most susceptible to partisan media effects. Our approach is distinguished by its avoidance of the pitfalls that confront many studies of media effects. Rather than rely on stylized lab settings or as-if experimental designs, we administer a cost-efficient field experiment on the media in question.

Furthermore, the results of these studies indicate anxiety can often be beneficial for the anxious, leading individuals to engage in normatively positive behaviors they might not otherwise engage in absent their anxiety. But anxiety is not always normatively warranted or personally beneficial. Consider African Americans living in urban areas and welfare (food stamp and Medicaid) recipients. Government policy (or politics more generally) can be at the root of or cause much of their anxiety.
