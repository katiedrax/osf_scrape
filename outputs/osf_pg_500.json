Participants\u2019 scores on the questionnaire measuring their attitude towards various environmental issues (see \"Other\" for details) will be included as covariates in the analysis, as we expect the effect of the intervention to differ depending on participants\u2019 attitudes. \n\nTo test our hypothesis, we will inspect the time of measurement x group interaction using the standard alpha &lt; .05 criterion: The decrease in the dependent variable should be stronger in the group that worked on implementation intentions compared to the group that worked on goal intentions. In case of a significant interaction between the two factors, we will inspect the direction of the effect graphically. In addition, we will conduct two paired t-tests analyzing the change between pre and post-measurement in the experimental group and the control group separately, using a Bonferroni-corrected significance level of alpha &lt; .025.Thereby, we will determine whether the effect is limited to one group or whether there is a significant change in both groups. \n\nIn addition, we will test for differences in social desirability between the two groups (measured on two dimensions, see \"Other\" for details) using t-tests. In case that one or both variables differ between the groups, they will be included as covariates in our main analysis. All covariates will be z-standardized. ", "outliers": "Exclusion of participants: \nWe will only include participants who completed the whole study during the course of two weeks: The participants will receive an invitation to participate in part two exactly one week after completing part one. We will only include subjects in the sample if they participate in part two not later than one week after receiving the invitation (i.e., two weeks after part one). \nFurthermore, we will only include participants who state that they used at least one disposable cup during the last week in the pre-measurement: At the beginning of the experiment, participants will be asked whether they use disposable cups at all and if they do, whether they want to reduce their use. For participants who answer negatively to either of these questions, the experiment ends and naturally, they will not be included in the sample. Since implementation intentions aim to help people to translate their goals into behavior, the intervention is pointless for participants who do not intend to change their behavior. In addition, participants who do not type anything or only something completely unrelated to the topic during the intervention will be excluded from the sample. Finally, we will exclude participants who state that their data should not be used in the final questionnaire. \n", "dependent": "Our main-dependent variable is participants\u2019 self-reported number of disposable cups, bought during the course of the last week (i.e., pre-measurement: The week before the intervention; post-measurement: the week before completing the second part of the questionnaire, i.e., 1-2 weeks later). We will ask participants to retrospectively estimate the absolute number of disposable cups they bought during the course of the last seven days. ", "conditions": "The participants will be randomly assigned to either the control condition (working on goal intentions) or the experimental condition (working on implementation intentions).\n\nThe experimental group will formulate implementation intentions on five different scenarios: They will be presented with five different problems that could prevent them from using fewer disposable cups: \nProblem 1: I forgot my reusable cup at home. \nProblem 2: I don\u2019t own a reusable cup. \nProblem 3: I don\u2019t have time to stay in and have a hot drink sitting in a caf\u00e9. \nProblem 4: I doubt that avoiding disposable cups does something good for the environment. \nProblem 5: I am in a group of people, who are all buying a hot drink to take away in a disposable cup and now I would like to buy a hot drink, too. \n\nIn addition, participants get the opportunity to add up to five more problems with regard to this topic. Then, they will formulate implementation intentions (see Gollwitzer, 1999, for an introduction) on how to deal with these problematic situations. \n\nThe control group will work on goal intentions instead. They will be asked to type the goal (\u201cI want to use fewer disposable cups\u201d ) into a given textbox five times. Then, they will get the opportunity to type it again up to another five times. ", "hypothesis": "In previous studies, implementation intentions, plans formulated in an if-then format, have been used to change people\u2019s behavior in various domains (e.g., Gollwitzer, 1993, 1999, 2006; Tolli, Web, &amp; Hardy, 2016; see Gollwitzer &amp; Sheeran, 2006, for a meta-analysis and review). Notably, implementation intentions have also been used to promote environmentally-friendly behaviors (e.g., Holland, Aarts, &amp; Langendam, 2006). \n\nThe present study aims at reducing people\u2019s use of disposable cups through an intervention where participants formulate implementation intentions regarding this behavior. In an online experiment, participants will be randomly assigned to two different conditions (experimental condition: implementation intentions; control condition: goal intentions) both working on the topic of disposable cups. Both groups will be presented with an informational text concerning the average use of disposable cups in Germany and the resulting environmental consequences. Next, participants in the experimental condition will formulate implementation intentions regarding their use of disposable cups (see Gollwitzer, 1999, for an introduction). Participants in the control condition will work on goal intentions regarding the same topic (see \"Conditions\" for details on both conditions).\n\nWe will measure participants\u2019 use of disposable cups (self-report) before and after the intervention: Participants will be asked to estimate their use of disposable cups during the past week right before the intervention and in a short follow-up questionnaire they will receive one week after the intervention. \n\nHypothesis: Participants in the implementation intention condition show greater reduction in their use of disposable cups compared to participants in the goal intention condition.

When the film has concluded, participants will be interviewed about what they have seen. The interview will start with an open free recall task (e.g. \u201cwhat did you see?\u201d), followed by open directed questions (e.g. \u201chow was the perpetrator dressed?\u201d). As the participant responds to the questions, the interviewer will write down the memories on a numbered sheet. Following the interview, the memories that the participant provides will be read aloud by the experiment leader and the participant will then rate his/her confidence for each memory on a scale from 0% to 100% with integers of 20. A short survey assessing demographic question will then be filled out. When the testing is finished, a date will be set for the next interview to be held two weeks later. Participants will then randomly be assigned to either experiment condition (\"repetition\") or control condition. Participants in the experiment condition will be instructed to fill out a survey online that requests the participant write down everything he/she remembers from the event as detailed as possible. This is done in order to strengthen the partipants\u2019 memories about the event. This survey will be answered four times during the two week-long interval between interview one and two, with intervals ranging between 2-3 days per survey. Participants in the control condition will receive no such instructions. The second session will be carried out identically to the first session, with the exception that no film will be shown this time. Before the second interview starts, participants will also first answer questions about how much they have recalled the events in the video during the two-week interval. The interviews will be videotaped and transcribed verbatim. From this material, statements will be picked out by independent coders, blind to the purpose of the study. Statements will be chosen on the basis of being objectively possible to confirm/reject. For example, the statement \u201che had a green coat\u201d is an example of such an objectively verifiable statement, whereas \u201che was feeling cold\u201d is not. Memory accuracy will be coded as correct or incorrect by evaluating the statements; partly correct and partly incorrect answers will be excluded. Effort cues will be coded by following the proceedings by Gustafsson et al. (2019): 1) Delays \u2013 a pause longer than two seconds before or during a response; 2) Non-word fillers \u2013 interjections and sounds like \u201chm \u201c, \u201cuh\u201d, etc.; 3) Word fillers \u2013 \u201cmeaningless\u201d words like \u201cyou know \u201c , \u201cwell\u201d, etc. This category also includes self-talk \u201cLet\u2019s see...\u201d; 4) Hedges \u2013 word forms that reduce the force of an assertion, allow for exceptions, or avoid commitment, such as  \u201dI think\u201d, \u201dmaybe\u201d. Additionally, we will code two new variables, inspired from psycholinguistic research (e.g. Clark &amp; Fox Tree, 2002, Fox Tree &amp; Clark, 1997): 5) False starts \u2013 initiated expressions that are stopped and then started anew; 6) Prolongations \u2013 prolonged pronunciations of a word. Interrater reliability will be calculated with Pearson\u2019s correlation as well as percentages of exact overlap.

However, research has demonstrated that people have great difficulty in judging the accuracy of others\u2019 memories (Lindholm, 2005; 2008a; 2008b). While lying is one issue in eyewitness testimonies (see DePaulo et al., 2003; Vrij, Fischer &amp; Blank, 2017; Sporer &amp; Schwandt, 2006), another major source of eyewitness errors is when a witness gives an honest report but remember things incorrectly. For example, there are now many reports on eyewitnesses who honestly, but mistakenly, have identified innocent people as crime culprits, sending them to long prison sentences and sometimes to death row (Garret, 2011; \u201cInnocence project\u201d, 2018). Despite the relevance of obtaining a method to differentiate between sincere correct and incorrect eyewitness memories, relatively little research has touched upon the subject of evaluating sincere eyewitness recall, and there is currently no satisfying model serving this purpose. Recently however, Lindholm, J\u00f6nsson &amp; Tullio-Liuzza (2018) proposed a new strategy in which memory accuracy was found to be related to signs of retrieval effort in witnesses\u2019 responses. The results were replicated in a later study (Gustafsson, Lindholm &amp; J\u00f6nsson, 2019). The current study aims to replicate these previous results. Furthermore, this study will investigate the effects of time and repetition on memory retrieval effort. The purpose is to continue the evaluation of the use of effort cues to predict memory accuracy and to further our understanding about judgments of our memories.\n\nThere are two major reasons for examining the effects of time and repetition on memory retrieval effort. The first reason is because time and repetition can have detrimental effects on eyewitness reports and subsequent evaluations of them. It is not uncommon for witnesses to be interviewed several times, with days or weeks passing between interviews, which can lead to changed statements (i.e. memory distortions), and increased confidence in details of witnessed events (see Garret, 2011; Schmolck, Buffalo &amp; Squire, 2000). These changes impair the accuracy of evaluations of eyewitness reports. The increased confidence is problematic as it is seldom accompanied by an increase in accuracy. That is, participants tend to get more confident in their memories over time, regardless of whether the memory is correct or wrong (Odinot, Wolters, &amp; van Koppen, 2009; Shaw, 1996; Shaw &amp; McClure, 1996; Wixted, Mickes, Clark, Gronlund &amp; Roediger, 2015). A likely explanation for this phenomenon is an increased ease in retrieving memories, as the memories will be strengthened by repeated retrieval over time (see Odinot et al., 2009). As a result, confidence becomes an unreliable method for eyewitness evaluation in these situations. It is noteworthy, as confidence judgments are used in courts to judge eyewitness memory accuracy (Boyce, Beaudry &amp; Lindsay, 2007, see also Wixted &amp; Wells, 2017).\n\nThe second reason for examining the effect of time and repetition on retrieval effort is due to the intricate relationship between memory accuracy, retrieval effort and confidence judgments. According to the theory of cue-utilization (Koriat, 1997; 2006), metacognitive judgments such as confidence are based on implicit inferences from processing cues that arise when a memory is produced. For example, previous studies have shown that retrieval ease, is negatively correlated with memory accuracy. That is, quick responses are more often correct than slower responses (e.g. Ackerman &amp; Koriat, 2011; Brewer, Caon, Todd &amp; Weber, 2006; Koriat &amp; Ackerman, 2010; Weidemann &amp; Kahana, 2016; for a review, see Brewer &amp; Weber, 2008). Additionally, people are more confident in answers that quickly come to mind. For example, Kelley &amp; Lindsay (1993) showed that manipulating retrieval ease affects confidence regardless of accuracy, indicating that the ease with which a memory is retrieved serves as a basis for judging its accuracy. \n\nRecently, Lindholm et al (2019) identified additional cues of retrieval ease (or rather, retrieval effort), such as use of fillers (\u201ceh\u201d, \u201cuhm\u201d), which were also related to memory accuracy and confidence. They also found that the retrieval effort cues better predicted accuracy compared to confidence. These results were later replicated by Gustafsson et al., (2019).  Furthermore, both studies found mediating effects of effort cues between memory accuracy and confidence. As the investigation of effort cues is a recent endeavor, it is still unknown how these effort cues relate to accuracy and confidence over time, and to what extent repeated memory retrieval affects these relations. Such an examination is valuable as it will further illuminate the extent of which people rely on retrieval cues in making metacognitive judgments (such as a judgment of confidence). Additionally, it will also serve to elucidate the relationship between memory retrieval effort and memory accuracy.\n\nThe hypotheses in this study are derived from current research about metacognition, the effect of time on memory, and memory retrieval:\n\nHypothesis 1 is based on the main findings by Lindholm et al., (2018) and Gustafsson et al. (2019). The hypothesis is also supported by evidence regarding the relationship between retrieval ease and accuracy (Ackerman &amp; Koriat, 2011; Brewer, Caon, Todd &amp; Weber, 2006; Brewer &amp; Weber, 2008; Kelley &amp; Lindsay, 1993; Koriat &amp; Ackerman, 2010; Weidemann &amp; Kahana, 2016). \n\nHypothesis 2 comes from research showing that repeatedly retrieving memories strengthen them (Antony, Ferreira, Norman &amp; Wimber, 2017; Rowland, 2014), which should in turn lead to less effort in recalling them. Furthermore, this should also increase the confidence in them (Hypothesis 4).\nHypothesis 3 follow from previous studies demonstrating the relationship between confidence and memory accuracy (for reviews, see Brewer &amp; Weber, 2008; Roediger &amp; DeSoto; 2014; Roediger, Wixted &amp; DeSoto, 2012; Wixted, Mickes, Clark, Gronlund &amp; Roediger, 2015; Wixted &amp; Wells, 2017). \n\nHypothesis 5 follows from our previous studies demonstrating a mediating effect of effort cues between memory accuracy and confidence (Lindholm et al., 2018; Gustafsson et al., 2019).\n\nHypothesis 6 follow from studies showing that time leads to a weakening and forgetting of memories that are not activated (Schacter, 1999; Wixted, 2004) whereas repeating memories strengthen them and increases their chances of being successfully recalled (see Hypothesis 2).\n\nInteraction 1 follows from the arguments for Hypothesis 2 and 6. That is, participants that repeatedly retrieve their memories over time will require less effort to recall them because repetition facilitates recall, whereas participants that do not recall their memories over time will require more effort to recall them because memory weakening impairs recall.\n\nInteraction 2 &amp; 3 suggest that difference in retrieval effort in recalling correct and incorrect memories will diminish over time for participants in the repetition condition, but not for participants in the control condition. The result for participants in the repetition condition is expected as both incorrect and correct memories will be strengthened by the repetition. Specifically, the recall of correct memories is believed to already be close to a minimum amount of effort (e.g. no delays, no hedges) at the first interview session, which means it cannot become much less effortful by repetition (i.e. a floor effect). The recall of incorrect memories are instead believed to be effortful to retrieve at the first interview session, but will then become easier to recall after the repetition. This means that the incorrect memories will approximate the retrieval effort of the correct memories after the repetition. Conversely, for participants in the control condition all memories are expected to become more difficult to recall at the second interview due to a general memory weakening, which should preserve the relative difference in memory effort between correct and incorrect memories.\n\n"}, "question6a": {"extra": [], "value": "Effects of repetition: Despite evidence supporting Hypothesis 2 and 4 (and Interaction 1-4), some studies have found diverging results. Knutsson, Allwood &amp; Johansson (2011) and Odinot et al. (2013) used repeated questioning to investigate the confidence-memory accuracy relationship and found no effects of repetition.\n\nEffects of time: In an unpublished study, Lindholm compared confidence in eyewitness testimonies with a one-week delay between two interview sessions. The results showed no effect of time on confidence, which contrasts with our expected Interactions 1, 3 and 4. Additionally, Wixted, Read &amp; Lindsay (2016) argue that confidence is good across time for eyewitness identifications. Although eyewitness identifications differ from verbal eyewitness testimonies, it is nonetheless evidence that does not conform to our expected effects.\n\nEffects of time on memory strength: We expect participant in the control group to experience forgetting and weakening of their memories during the interval between interview one and two. This is expected to be consistent throughout memories and therefore preserve an intact relation between memory retrieval effort and memory accuracy. However, it is known that people can strategically regulate which memories they present in free recall tasks (Goldsmith, Koriat &amp; Pansky, 2005; Koriat &amp; Goldsmith, 1996). Therefore, participants may choose to withhold those memories which they find weak and subsequently effortful to recall, with the goal to avoid giving out incorrect information. This would invalidate Interactions 2 and 3\u2014and lead to a smaller effect for Hypotheses 2 and 4\u2014by resulting in a smaller difference in the relation between memory retrieval effort and memory accuracy for the control group. That is, participants in the control group would then show the same trend over time as the repetition group: incorrect and correct memories become more similarly effortful to retrieve. If this is the case, it should also be evident in Hypothesis 6 as a particularly large effect, as fewer memories would be presented in the control group.\n"}}}, "confirmatory-analyses-first": {"value": {"first": {"value": {"question1c": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypothesis 1: Each effort cue \u2013 hedges, word fillers, non-word fillers, delays, false starts and prolongations.

Additionally, people are more confident in answers that quickly come to mind. For example, Kelley &amp; Lindsay (1993) showed that manipulating retrieval ease affects confidence regardless of accuracy, indicating that the ease with which a memory is retrieved serves as a basis for judging its accuracy. \n\nRecently, Lindholm et al (2019) identified additional cues of retrieval ease (or rather, retrieval effort), such as use of fillers (\u201ceh\u201d, \u201cuhm\u201d), which were also related to memory accuracy and confidence. They also found that the retrieval effort cues better predicted accuracy compared to confidence. These results were later replicated by Gustafsson et al., (2019).  Furthermore, both studies found mediating effects of effort cues between memory accuracy and confidence. As the investigation of effort cues is a recent endeavor, it is still unknown how these effort cues relate to accuracy and confidence over time, and to what extent repeated memory retrieval affects these relations. Such an examination is valuable as it will further illuminate the extent of which people rely on retrieval cues in making metacognitive judgments (such as a judgment of confidence). Additionally, it will also serve to elucidate the relationship between memory retrieval effort and memory accuracy.\n\nThe hypotheses in this study are derived from current research about metacognition, the effect of time on memory, and memory retrieval:\n\nHypothesis 1 is based on the main findings by Lindholm et al., (2018) and Gustafsson et al. (2019). The hypothesis is also supported by evidence regarding the relationship between retrieval ease and accuracy (Ackerman &amp; Koriat, 2011; Brewer, Caon, Todd &amp; Weber, 2006; Brewer &amp; Weber, 2008; Kelley &amp; Lindsay, 1993; Koriat &amp; Ackerman, 2010; Weidemann &amp; Kahana, 2016). \n\nHypothesis 2 comes from research showing that repeatedly retrieving memories strengthen them (Antony, Ferreira, Norman &amp; Wimber, 2017; Rowland, 2014), which should in turn lead to less effort in recalling them. Furthermore, this should also increase the confidence in them (Hypothesis 4).\nHypothesis 3 follow from previous studies demonstrating the relationship between confidence and memory accuracy (for reviews, see Brewer &amp; Weber, 2008; Roediger &amp; DeSoto; 2014; Roediger, Wixted &amp; DeSoto, 2012; Wixted, Mickes, Clark, Gronlund &amp; Roediger, 2015; Wixted &amp; Wells, 2017). \n\nHypothesis 5 follows from our previous studies demonstrating a mediating effect of effort cues between memory accuracy and confidence (Lindholm et al., 2018; Gustafsson et al., 2019).\n\nHypothesis 6 follow from studies showing that time leads to a weakening and forgetting of memories that are not activated (Schacter, 1999; Wixted, 2004) whereas repeating memories strengthen them and increases their chances of being successfully recalled (see Hypothesis 2).\n\nInteraction 1 follows from the arguments for Hypothesis 2 and 6. That is, participants that repeatedly retrieve their memories over time will require less effort to recall them because repetition facilitates recall, whereas participants that do not recall their memories over time will require more effort to recall them because memory weakening impairs recall.\n\nInteraction 2 &amp; 3 suggest that difference in retrieval effort in recalling correct and incorrect memories will diminish over time for participants in the repetition condition, but not for participants in the control condition. The result for participants in the repetition condition is expected as both incorrect and correct memories will be strengthened by the repetition. Specifically, the recall of correct memories is believed to already be close to a minimum amount of effort (e.g. no delays, no hedges) at the first interview session, which means it cannot become much less effortful by repetition (i.e. a floor effect). The recall of incorrect memories are instead believed to be effortful to retrieve at the first interview session, but will then become easier to recall after the repetition. This means that the incorrect memories will approximate the retrieval effort of the correct memories after the repetition. Conversely, for participants in the control condition all memories are expected to become more difficult to recall at the second interview due to a general memory weakening, which should preserve the relative difference in memory effort between correct and incorrect memories.\n\n", "recommended-hypothesis.question6a": "Effects of repetition: Despite evidence supporting Hypothesis 2 and 4 (and Interaction 1-4), some studies have found diverging results. Knutsson, Allwood &amp; Johansson (2011) and Odinot et al. (2013) used repeated questioning to investigate the confidence-memory accuracy relationship and found no effects of repetition.\n\nEffects of time: In an unpublished study, Lindholm compared confidence in eyewitness testimonies with a one-week delay between two interview sessions. The results showed no effect of time on confidence, which contrasts with our expected Interactions 1, 3 and 4. Additionally, Wixted, Read &amp; Lindsay (2016) argue that confidence is good across time for eyewitness identifications. Although eyewitness identifications differ from verbal eyewitness testimonies, it is nonetheless evidence that does not conform to our expected effects.\n\nEffects of time on memory strength: We expect participant in the control group to experience forgetting and weakening of their memories during the interval between interview one and two. This is expected to be consistent throughout memories and therefore preserve an intact relation between memory retrieval effort and memory accuracy. However, it is known that people can strategically regulate which memories they present in free recall tasks (Goldsmith, Koriat &amp; Pansky, 2005; Koriat &amp; Goldsmith, 1996). Therefore, participants may choose to withhold those memories which they find weak and subsequently effortful to recall, with the goal to avoid giving out incorrect information. This would invalidate Interactions 2 and 3\u2014and lead to a smaller effect for Hypotheses 2 and 4\u2014by resulting in a smaller difference in the relation between memory retrieval effort and memory accuracy for the control group. That is, participants in the control group would then show the same trend over time as the repetition group: incorrect and correct memories become more similarly effortful to retrieve. If this is the case, it should also be evident in Hypothesis 6 as a particularly large effect, as fewer memories would be presented in the control group.\n", "description-methods.design.question2a": "Repetition.

As the participant responds to the questions, the interviewer will write down the memories on a numbered sheet. Following the interview, the memories that the participant provides will be read aloud by the experiment leader and the participant will then rate his/her confidence for each memory on a scale from 0% to 100% with integers of 20.
