fatigued participants from leaving these items blank. Each participant\u2019s age, race, gender, objective-SES measures of education level, employment status, annual household income, and subjective-SES using the MacArthur Scale (Adler &amp; Stewart, 2007) will be reported.\n\nVariables collected for exploratory purposes at T1:\n\n\u20281. Expectations for reducing or quitting cigarette smoking: Expectations will be assessed with a single item before the manipulation (\u201cHow likely do you think it is that you will reduce or quit your cigarette smoking?\u201d)\n\n\u20282. Incentive value for reducing or quitting cigarette smoking: Incentive value will be assessed with a single item before the manipulation (\u201cHow important is it to you to reduce or quit your cigarette smoking?\u201d)\n\n3. Perceived Stress, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS): To assess stress in the past month, we will present participants with three items from the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983; e.g., \u2018How often have you felt that you were unable to control the important things in your life?\u2019; 0 = Never, 4 = Very often).\n\n4. Anxiety and Depression, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ): To assess symptoms of anxiety and depression in the past two weeks, we will present participants with the four-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4; Kroenke, Spitzer, Williams, &amp; L\u00f6we, 2009; e.g., \u2018Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge\u2019; 0 = Not at all, 3 = Nearly every day). \n\n5. Smoking Dependence Motives: To understand participants\u2019 motives for smoking, we will include 6 items from subscales of the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM-68; Piper, Federman, Bolt, Smith, Fiore, &amp; Baker, 2004). We will select items from the social/environmental goads sub-scale (e.g., \u2018Most of the people I spend time with are smokers\u2019) and the cue exposure/associative processes sub-scale (e.g., 'My life is full of reminders to smoke\u2019). Participants will rate their level of agreement for each statement on a 7-point scale (1 = Not true of me at all, 7 = Extremely true of me). \n\n6. Nicotine Dependence: Participants will also be asked to indicate how much money they would be willing to pay the next morning for just one cigarette after not being able to get ahold of any. This question is taken from the priority subscale of the Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale (NDSS; Shiffman, Waters, &amp; Hickcox, 2004).\n\n7. Cigarette Dependence: To measure cigarette dependence, we will use the 5-item version of the Cigarette Dependence Scale (CDS-5; Etter, Le Houezec, &amp; Perneger, 2003; \u03b1 = .85). The items will ask participants to rate their addiction to cigarettes, how many cigarettes they smoked per day on average, how soon after waking up do they smoke their first cigarette, how difficult quitting smoking would be, and how strong their urges to smoke were. Responses will be recoded to range from 1 to 5. We will define high cigarette dependence as a composite CDS-5 score of 15 or greater.\n\n8. Smoking Induced Deprivation: To measure tobacco-related financial distress, we'll assess smoking induced deprivation (SID) with a single question reported in the literature asking \u2018In the last 30 days, has there been a time when the money you spent on cigarettes resulted in not having enough money for any of these items: housing, food, household utilities, health care, transportation, and necessary clothing?\u2019 (Siahpush, Borland, &amp; Yong, 2007).\n\n9. Smoking Characteristics: Supplementary variables about smoker characteristics will be measured to better characterize the sample. We will ask participants to report if they typically purchase cigarettes by the pack or by the individual cigarette and how much they spend, what age they began smoking, the amount and length of abstinence in days of any quit attempts made in the past year, and other tobacco use.\n\nVariables collected for exploratory purposes at T2:\n\n1. Steps Taken: Participants will be asked to indicate any steps taken to reduce or quit smoking since T0 (e.g., done something to relieve my stress or improve my mood besides smoking a cigarette like deep breathing or talking to a friend; Oettingen &amp; Thorpe, 2010; Mutter et al. 2019).\n\n2.

The children also had to be biologically related to the adult (mother) who participated in the study."}, "dependent": {"extra": [], "value": "Each variable had its own task. Each of the measures are briefly explained and described.\n\nReading abilities\n\tFluency. To measure reading fluency, the participants completed the Sight Word Efficiency task from the Test of Word Reading Efficiency II (Torgesen, Wagner, &amp; Rashotte, 1999). In this standardized task, participants are asked to read aloud as many existing English words as possible during a set time limit of 45 seconds. Examinees are given one point per word that they correctly read within the time limit, with a maximum score of 104 points. The measure that will be used for analyses is the number of correctly read words per second.\n\tComprehension. To assess reading comprehension, the \u201cPassage Comprehension\u201d subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement III (Woodcock, McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001) was used. In this standardized task, participants are asked to read short passages of text and to fill in a blank space with a word that fits the context. The participant is awarded one point for each correct answer, with a maximum of 47 points. The participant continued the task until they reached the last item, or until they reached the ceiling rule of six. The ceiling rule states the number of consecutive incorrect answers that the participant needs to reach for the examiner to end the task. \n\tDecoding. The standardized Phonemic Decoding Efficiency subtest (Test of Word Reading Efficiency II) (Torgesen, Wagner, &amp; Rashotte, 2012) asks participants to read aloud as many pseudo-words as possible during a set time limit of 45 seconds. They are given one point per correctly read pseudo-word, with a maximum of 84 points. The measure that will be used for analyses is the number of correctly read words per second.\n\nMath abilities\n\tFluency. The Math Fluency subtest from the Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement III (Woodcock, McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001) is used to measure the participants\u2019 arithmetic fluency. In this standardized task, participants are asked to solve as many arithmetic exercises during a set time limit of three minutes. They receive one point for each addition, subtraction, and multiplication problem that they solved correctly within the time limit, with a maximum score of 160 points. The measure that will be used for analyses is the number of correctly solved items per second.\n\tCalculations. The standardized Calculation subtest from the Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement III (Woodcock, McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001) requires the participants to complete as many calculation problems as possible. These calculation exercises are more complex than the simple arithmetic problems that are used in the fluency task. The participants solve as many calculation problems as they can without any time limit and the task ends when the participant either completes all 45 problems, or when they reach the ceiling rule of six. One point is awarded for every correct answer, with a maximum of 45 points.\n\tWord problems. To assess word problem-solving abilities, the Applied Problems subtest from the Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement III was used (Woodcock, McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001). In this standardized task, participants are asked to solve mathematical word problems. The experimenter reads a word problem and the participant gives a verbal response. They are given paper and pencil to perform calculations if necessary. The participants either finish the task to completion or are stopped when they reach the ceiling rule of six. They are awarded one point per correct answer, with a maximum of 63 points.\n\nDomain general fluency\n\tTwo versions of the Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) (Wolf, Denckla, 2005) were used to test domain-general fluency abilities: colors and letters. In these tasks, participants are asked to quickly name aloud a series of 50 familiar items presented in random order on a page, making five lines of ten items. The participant has to name them sequentially as fast as possible. The examiner records the time it takes to name all 50 items on the sheets and the number of errors that the participant makes. The participant started with the color RAN, followed by the letter RAN. Participants\u2019 final scores were based on the number of correctly named items per second. The measure that will be used for analyses is the average of the scores of both the color and letter RAN.\n\nIntelligence\n\tVerbal intelligence. The WASI Vocabulary task (Wechsler, 2011) was used to measure verbal intelligence. In this standardized task, participants are asked to define and describe words that are presented visually or orally. Responses are awarded a score of 0, 1, or 2, depending on the quality of the answer. Testing is stopped after the participants receive three consecutive scores of 0. The score is based on the number of points they receive throughout the task, with a maximum score of 53 points. \n\tNonverbal intelligence. The WASI Matrix Reasoning (Wechsler, 2011) asks the participant to look at a matrix with a missing section and to complete that matrix by selecting the correct response out of the five options that are shown. Examinees get one point per correct answer and reach the ceiling level after three consecutive incorrect answers. The score is based on the number of points they receive throughout the task, with a maximum score of 30 points."}, "conditions": {"extra": [], "value": "N/A \u2013 all participants perform the same battery of tasks."}, "hypothesis": {"extra": [], "value": "The relationship between math and reading remains a relatively unexplored territory. Although these skills are often thought of as separate domains of learning, studies have shown high comorbidity rates between reading and math difficulties, suggesting a relationship between the two (Landerl, &amp; Moll, 2010). Along with behavioral data, genetic studies have found that genes related to one learning disability (e.g., difficulties in math) are also likely to affect other learning disabilities (e.g., difficulties in reading), offering genetic evidence for an overlap between math and reading (Plomin, &amp; Kovas, 2005). A third branch of support for a relationship between reading and math comes from neuroimaging studies. Neural activity levels in frontal and parietal areas, along with white matter integrity in the corona radiata and arcuate fasciculus tracts, did not differ between dyslexic, dyscalculic or comorbid individuals (Peters, Bulth\u00e9, Daniels, Op de Beeck, &amp; De Smedt, 2018; Moreau, Wilson, McKay, Nihill, &amp; Waldie, 2018). These results support the potential overlap between math and reading deficits at the neural level.\nWhen studies devote attention to the relationship between math and reading, or use math and reading as control measures, they often limit their measurements to fluency measures of both skills (see e.g., Koponen, Aunola, Ahonen, &amp; Nurmi, 2007). Fluency measures are quick and practical, which is why they are such appealing variables to use. However, fluency is but one of the many subcomponents of math and reading, and stating that math and reading are related after only measuring for fluency could lead to  large overgeneralization regarding the similarities between reading and math. Fluency is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of potential relationships between the subcomponents of math and reading. It is known that reading fluency and math fluency are highly correlated (Balhinez, &amp; Shaul, 2019), yet no further efforts have been made to examine the potential relationships between additional subcomponents. Reading and math also include (but are not limited to) word problem solving (the ability to filter information and follow correct steps to obtain an answer) and calculations (the ability to apply rules to more complex math problems) for math, and decoding (the ability to phonologically decode new words/non-words) and reading comprehension (understanding the context and the conveyed message that you are reading) for reading. This study will explore in greater depth the relationship between a large selection of math and reading subcomponents, along with domain general measures.\nFirst, we will examine the relationship within the subcomponents of the math and reading domains. We will study if all three math subcomponents under study (fluency, word problem solving and calculations) are related to one another. In addition, we will test if the three reading subcomponents measured in this study (fluency decoding and reading comprehension) are related to one another. We hypothesize that both math and reading domains will be correlated within each other.\nSecond, this study will investigate the relationship between the math and reading subcomponents. We hypothesize that the math subcomponents will be correlated to the reading subcomponents, which would suggest some overlap between the two domains of learning (Balhinez, &amp; Shaul, 2019; Hart, Petrill, Thompson, &amp; Plomin, 2009) \nThird, this study will identify the role that the domain general skills play in these relationships between the subcomponents (general fluency, verbal intelligence, nonverbal intelligence). We hypothesize that math and reading fluency will be positively correlated with domain general fluency (Koponen, Salmi, Eklund, &amp; Aro, 2013). We also hypothesize that verbal and nonverbal intelligence will be correlated with all six math and reading subcomponents, as it was found in literature (Hart, Petrill, Thompson, &amp; Plomin, 2009). \nFourth, this study will attempt to detect any potential group differences between children and adults. It is possible that the patterns of correlations between the measures differ as a function of chronological age. One study tested the relationship between IQ and reading ability in 5-12 year old children. They found that the levels of association between reading and intelligence increased with age. Although this current study has older participants (10-14 years old children and much older adults), we predict that it will also show differences between the children and the adult sample correlations (Birch, &amp; Belmont, 1965).

Because we did not use standardized scores, we will control for age in all subsequent analyses. We will also control for multiple comparisons using a Bonferroni correction in all analyses. We will calculate all pairwise correlations between the six math and reading subcomponents and the three domain general skills, for children and adults separately. \nPartial correlations will be used to investigate if the correlations between math and reading subskills still hold when controlling for domain general influences. We will only further analyze the significant cross-domain correlations. \nTo investigate age-related effects, the correlations between the subcomponents will be compared between the children and adult sample using a Williams-Steiger test (http://quantpsy.org/corrtest/corrtest.htm). This test allows to investigate whether two correlation coefficients are significantly different from each other. ", "outliers": "Participants had to be fluent English speakers, with no developmental delays or learning disorders (in other words, they had to be typically developing individuals). The children also had to be biologically related to the adult (mother) who participated in the study.", "dependent": "Each variable had its own task. Each of the measures are briefly explained and described.\n\nReading abilities\n\tFluency. To measure reading fluency, the participants completed the Sight Word Efficiency task from the Test of Word Reading Efficiency II (Torgesen, Wagner, &amp; Rashotte, 1999). In this standardized task, participants are asked to read aloud as many existing English words as possible during a set time limit of 45 seconds. Examinees are given one point per word that they correctly read within the time limit, with a maximum score of 104 points. The measure that will be used for analyses is the number of correctly read words per second.\n\tComprehension. To assess reading comprehension, the \u201cPassage Comprehension\u201d subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement III (Woodcock, McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001) was used. In this standardized task, participants are asked to read short passages of text and to fill in a blank space with a word that fits the context. The participant is awarded one point for each correct answer, with a maximum of 47 points. The participant continued the task until they reached the last item, or until they reached the ceiling rule of six. The ceiling rule states the number of consecutive incorrect answers that the participant needs to reach for the examiner to end the task. \n\tDecoding. The standardized Phonemic Decoding Efficiency subtest (Test of Word Reading Efficiency II) (Torgesen, Wagner, &amp; Rashotte, 2012) asks participants to read aloud as many pseudo-words as possible during a set time limit of 45 seconds. They are given one point per correctly read pseudo-word, with a maximum of 84 points. The measure that will be used for analyses is the number of correctly read words per second.\n\nMath abilities\n\tFluency. The Math Fluency subtest from the Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement III (Woodcock, McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001) is used to measure the participants\u2019 arithmetic fluency. In this standardized task, participants are asked to solve as many arithmetic exercises during a set time limit of three minutes. They receive one point for each addition, subtraction, and multiplication problem that they solved correctly within the time limit, with a maximum score of 160 points. The measure that will be used for analyses is the number of correctly solved items per second.\n\tCalculations. The standardized Calculation subtest from the Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement III (Woodcock, McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001) requires the participants to complete as many calculation problems as possible. These calculation exercises are more complex than the simple arithmetic problems that are used in the fluency task. The participants solve as many calculation problems as they can without any time limit and the task ends when the participant either completes all 45 problems, or when they reach the ceiling rule of six. One point is awarded for every correct answer, with a maximum of 45 points.\n\tWord problems. To assess word problem-solving abilities, the Applied Problems subtest from the Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement III was used (Woodcock, McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001). In this standardized task, participants are asked to solve mathematical word problems. The experimenter reads a word problem and the participant gives a verbal response. They are given paper and pencil to perform calculations if necessary. The participants either finish the task to completion or are stopped when they reach the ceiling rule of six. They are awarded one point per correct answer, with a maximum of 63 points.\n\nDomain general fluency\n\tTwo versions of the Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) (Wolf, Denckla, 2005) were used to test domain-general fluency abilities: colors and letters. In these tasks, participants are asked to quickly name aloud a series of 50 familiar items presented in random order on a page, making five lines of ten items. The participant has to name them sequentially as fast as possible. The examiner records the time it takes to name all 50 items on the sheets and the number of errors that the participant makes. The participant started with the color RAN, followed by the letter RAN. Participants\u2019 final scores were based on the number of correctly named items per second. The measure that will be used for analyses is the average of the scores of both the color and letter RAN.\n\nIntelligence\n\tVerbal intelligence. The WASI Vocabulary task (Wechsler, 2011) was used to measure verbal intelligence. In this standardized task, participants are asked to define and describe words that are presented visually or orally. Responses are awarded a score of 0, 1, or 2, depending on the quality of the answer. Testing is stopped after the participants receive three consecutive scores of 0. The score is based on the number of points they receive throughout the task, with a maximum score of 53 points. \n\tNonverbal intelligence. The WASI Matrix Reasoning (Wechsler, 2011) asks the participant to look at a matrix with a missing section and to complete that matrix by selecting the correct response out of the five options that are shown. Examinees get one point per correct answer and reach the ceiling level after three consecutive incorrect answers. The score is based on the number of points they receive throughout the task, with a maximum score of 30 points.", "conditions": "N/A \u2013 all participants perform the same battery of tasks.", "hypothesis": "The relationship between math and reading remains a relatively unexplored territory. Although these skills are often thought of as separate domains of learning, studies have shown high comorbidity rates between reading and math difficulties, suggesting a relationship between the two (Landerl, &amp; Moll, 2010). Along with behavioral data, genetic studies have found that genes related to one learning disability (e.g., difficulties in math) are also likely to affect other learning disabilities (e.g., difficulties in reading), offering genetic evidence for an overlap between math and reading (Plomin, &amp; Kovas, 2005). A third branch of support for a relationship between reading and math comes from neuroimaging studies. Neural activity levels in frontal and parietal areas, along with white matter integrity in the corona radiata and arcuate fasciculus tracts, did not differ between dyslexic, dyscalculic or comorbid individuals (Peters, Bulth\u00e9, Daniels, Op de Beeck, &amp; De Smedt, 2018; Moreau, Wilson, McKay, Nihill, &amp; Waldie, 2018). These results support the potential overlap between math and reading deficits at the neural level.\nWhen studies devote attention to the relationship between math and reading, or use math and reading as control measures, they often limit their measurements to fluency measures of both skills (see e.g., Koponen, Aunola, Ahonen, &amp; Nurmi, 2007). Fluency measures are quick and practical, which is why they are such appealing variables to use. However, fluency is but one of the many subcomponents of math and reading, and stating that math and reading are related after only measuring for fluency could lead to  large overgeneralization regarding the similarities between reading and math. Fluency is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of potential relationships between the subcomponents of math and reading. It is known that reading fluency and math fluency are highly correlated (Balhinez, &amp; Shaul, 2019), yet no further efforts have been made to examine the potential relationships between additional subcomponents. Reading and math also include (but are not limited to) word problem solving (the ability to filter information and follow correct steps to obtain an answer) and calculations (the ability to apply rules to more complex math problems) for math, and decoding (the ability to phonologically decode new words/non-words) and reading comprehension (understanding the context and the conveyed message that you are reading) for reading. This study will explore in greater depth the relationship between a large selection of math and reading subcomponents, along with domain general measures.\nFirst, we will examine the relationship within the subcomponents of the math and reading domains. We will study if all three math subcomponents under study (fluency, word problem solving and calculations) are related to one another. In addition, we will test if the three reading subcomponents measured in this study (fluency decoding and reading comprehension) are related to one another. We hypothesize that both math and reading domains will be correlated within each other.\nSecond, this study will investigate the relationship between the math and reading subcomponents. We hypothesize that the math subcomponents will be correlated to the reading subcomponents, which would suggest some overlap between the two domains of learning (Balhinez, &amp; Shaul, 2019; Hart, Petrill, Thompson, &amp; Plomin, 2009) \nThird, this study will identify the role that the domain general skills play in these relationships between the subcomponents (general fluency, verbal intelligence, nonverbal intelligence). We hypothesize that math and reading fluency will be positively correlated with domain general fluency (Koponen, Salmi, Eklund, &amp; Aro, 2013). We also hypothesize that verbal and nonverbal intelligence will be correlated with all six math and reading subcomponents, as it was found in literature (Hart, Petrill, Thompson, &amp; Plomin, 2009). \nFourth, this study will attempt to detect any potential group differences between children and adults.

Within this finite pool of worry, however, the distribution of concern will vary depending on the status of the pandemic (spatially and temporally) as well as personal psychological factors related to the pandemic.\n", "study_type": "Survey"}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=2qctb", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/de-1/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "de-1", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "2qctb", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "2qctb", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/werdm/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "werdm", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jnu74/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "jnu74", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5d2d2268d28338002c2432d2/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5d2d2268d28338002c2432d2", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/2qctb/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2qctb/"}}], "links": {"first": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json", "last": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "prev": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=153", "next": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=155", "meta": {"total": 5469, "per_page": 10}}}
