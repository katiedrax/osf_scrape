signals of adverse drug reactions at a global level. Please see the attached files for the full protocol and the annex for the systematic search strategy (adapted to PubMed).\n\nTo the best of the authors' knowledge reviews of signals have not been carried out in a systematic way and have been restricted to classes of medicinal products, types of regulatory communications, language or periods of time. This would then be one of the largest exploratory studies aimed a synthesising the evidence of signals of adverse drug reactions and highlighting patterns of similarities and differences across multiple stakeholders in terms of timing and levels of evidence.

With improved longevity and changes in family structure, grandparents are fulfilling more family functions while the multigenerational bond becomes \u201ca valuable new resource for families in the 21st century\u201d (Bengtson, 2001). Specifically, higher rates of dual-income household, parental divorce and separation, and parent\u2019s physical/mental health conditions create the need for active grandparenthood. Grandparents play important roles in sharing parenting responsibilities within single-parent families, intergenerational co-parenting families, or skipped generation families (Brandon, 2012; Chen, Liu, &amp; Mair, 2011; Keene &amp; Batson, 2010). In view of the diversified family compositions, grandparental care in multigenerational families is crucial to the well-being and development of grandchildren and grandparent over their life course.\nA recent systematic review focuses on how grandparents raising grandchildren has an impact over the health and development of grandchildren (Sadruddin et al. 2019). However, little is known how it affects the well-being of grandparent caregivers (Grinstead, Leder, Jensen &amp; Bond, 2003; Hadfield, 2014; Hayslip &amp; Kaminski, 2005). Further, it is unclear how different factors, such as family structure, perceived social support, and sociocultural context play a role in the association between  grandparenting and the well-being of grandparent caregivers. We will systematically review the characteristics of grandparents raising grandchildren and how it affects the physical and/or mental well-being of grandparents. In the context of an aging society, this systematic review provides a timely understanding of the impact of caregiving on the well-being of grandparent caregivers.\n\nObjectives:\nThe aim of this systematic review is to identify global studies examining the association between grandparents raising grandchildren and the physical and/or mental well-being of grandparents. The proposed systematic review will answer the following questions:\n1.     How does the involvement (i.e., contact, caregiving behavior, and support) of grandparents in grandchildren influence elder\u2019s physical and/or mental health (well-being)?\n2.     What level of evidence exists that family factors (i.e., caregiving role and intensity, co-residence, resources, relationship and communication) play a role in the relationship between grandparent involvement of grandchildren and elder\u2019s health?\n3. What level of evidence exists that cultural factors (i.e., geographical location, ethnicity/race) play a role in the relationship between grandparent involvement of grandchildren and elder\u2019s health?\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Not applicable."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies."}, "q6": {"extra": [], "value": ["No blinding is involved in this study."]}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q8": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "This study will systematically review articles examining the association of grandparents raising grandchildren and the well-being of grandchildren in relevance to the family and sociocultural factors.

The specific search strategies for each database will be designed by the research team in collaboration with a Social Sciences Librarian with expertise in systematic review searching. The draft search strategy is included as Appendix 1.\n\nInformation sources:\nWe will search four online databases for peer-reviewed published articles.

Year of publication: In view of the ageing concerns in the United Nations, peer-reviewed articles published after 1990 will be included.\n2.  Publication type: Peer-reviewed journal articles will be included\n3. Language: Studies in English, Chinese, Korean, and Spanish will be included, as these are spoken by team members.\n4. Study Design: All quantitative studies (including association, longitudinal, intervention/experimental studies) will be included. \n5. Participants: Grandparents involved in formal/ informal caregiving of grandchildren aged between 0 and 18. \n6. Outcomes: Studies reporting well-being broadly defined as physical and/or mental health of grandparent caregivers. \n\nExclusion criteria:\n1.  All grey literature (i.e., book chapter, conference abstract and dissertation) will be excluded.\n2.  Peer-reviewed journal articles which are not published in one of the following languages: English, Chinese, Korean, and Spanish.\n3.  Articles on qualitative studies will be excluded.\n4.  Articles reporting only child-related outcomes will be excluded.\n5. Articles reporting only elders\u2019 wellbeing but no mention of their caregiving roles will be excluded. \n \nStudy Records\nLiterature search results will be imported into Covidence, an Internet based software program that supports deduplication, collaboration among reviewers during the screening process, and the creation of a PRISMA flow diagram upon screening completion. Automatic and manual de-duplication will be conducted in Covidence.\nAll reviewers will be trained on the Covidence software by a librarian with experience in this software. The screening criteria will be piloted by having all reviewers screen a subset of abstracts; this process will be used to refine the criteria and establish consensus among reviewers. Individual reviewers will then code abstracts and full text articles; Covidence will record their decisions allowing reliability to be calculated.\n \nSelection process.\nAll screeners participated in the development of the review aims and inclusion/exclusion criteria; they have equal familiarity with the study goals and screening process. Reviewers will independently apply our inclusion criteria to the titles and abstracts included in the search results. Each reviewer will be randomly assigned to screen particular abstracts using Covidence software available online. Each abstract will be reviewed by at least two reviewers; disagreements will be recorded and resolved by group discussion. Reviewers will then screen full text articles and seek information from study authors if further information is needed in order to determine whether a study meets the inclusion criteria. Disagreements will be recorded and resolved through discussion. All exclusions during abstract and full text screening will be recorded. Reviewers will have access to all publication information during screening, including journal titles and study authors and institutions.\n\nData Collection Process.\nData will be extracted from included articles using a standardized form. Piloting of data extraction forms will be conducted prior to the formal process in order to establish consensus among team members. Two reviewers will extract all data and check for agreement; we will contact study authors a maximum of three times when further information is needed. Disagreements on any data will be resolved through discussion with a third member of the team.\n\nData items.\nThe standardized data extraction form will include variables of interest: year of publication, study location/language, sample size, grandparent characteristics (e.g., ethnicity/race, gender, age, caregiver role, etc), grandchildren characteristics (e.g., age, gender, co-residence status, duration of stay, and health condition), family characteristics (e.g., family support, family relationship, communication, and family structure), sociocultural context (e.g., geographical location, race/ethnicity and culture), primary outcome measures (e.g., grandparents\u2019 physical health, mental health, perceived stress, resilience, well-being and life satisfaction).\n\nRisk of bias in individual studies.\nThe quality and risk of bias of articles are assessed using a checklist of 14 items adapted from an established quality assessment of quantitative studies (Kmet, Cook, &amp; Lee, 2004). See Appendix 2. This ensures the included quantitative studies are of reasonable quality in terms of  research objectives, study design, analytical method, results reporting, and conclusion supported by results. The evaluation process will be performed independently by two researchers and meetings will be held to resolve disagreement. Studies will be categorized as high, moderate or low quality in terms of meeting the number of criteria. \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "Not applicable."}, "q14": {"extra": [], "value": "Not applicable."}, "q15": {"extra": [], "value": "Not applicable."}, "q16": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Not applicable."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q17": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Grandparent characteristics, grandchildren characteristics, family characteristics, sociocultural context, grandparents\u2019 well-being (i.e., physical health, mental health, perceived stress, resilience, and life satisfaction)."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Not applicable."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q19": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Data synthesis.\nThe planned analysis will include two parts.

Specifically, higher rates of dual-income household, parental divorce and separation, and parent\u2019s physical/mental health conditions create the need for active grandparenthood. Grandparents play important roles in sharing parenting responsibilities within single-parent families, intergenerational co-parenting families, or skipped generation families (Brandon, 2012; Chen, Liu, &amp; Mair, 2011; Keene &amp; Batson, 2010). In view of the diversified family compositions, grandparental care in multigenerational families is crucial to the well-being and development of grandchildren and grandparent over their life course.\nA recent systematic review focuses on how grandparents raising grandchildren has an impact over the health and development of grandchildren (Sadruddin et al. 2019). However, little is known how it affects the well-being of grandparent caregivers (Grinstead, Leder, Jensen &amp; Bond, 2003; Hadfield, 2014; Hayslip &amp; Kaminski, 2005). Further, it is unclear how different factors, such as family structure, perceived social support, and sociocultural context play a role in the association between  grandparenting and the well-being of grandparent caregivers. We will systematically review the characteristics of grandparents raising grandchildren and how it affects the physical and/or mental well-being of grandparents. In the context of an aging society, this systematic review provides a timely understanding of the impact of caregiving on the well-being of grandparent caregivers.\n\nObjectives:\nThe aim of this systematic review is to identify global studies examining the association between grandparents raising grandchildren and the physical and/or mental well-being of grandparents. The proposed systematic review will answer the following questions:\n1.     How does the involvement (i.e., contact, caregiving behavior, and support) of grandparents in grandchildren influence elder\u2019s physical and/or mental health (well-being)?\n2.     What level of evidence exists that family factors (i.e., caregiving role and intensity, co-residence, resources, relationship and communication) play a role in the relationship between grandparent involvement of grandchildren and elder\u2019s health?\n3. What level of evidence exists that cultural factors (i.e., geographical location, ethnicity/race) play a role in the relationship between grandparent involvement of grandchildren and elder\u2019s health?\n", "q4": "Not applicable.", "q5": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies.", "q6": ["No blinding is involved in this study."], "q7": "", "q9": "Not applicable.", "q10": "Registration prior to creation of data", "q11": "Search Strategy:\nPeer-reviewed articles published in English, Chinese, Korean, and Spanish will be included, as these are spoken by team members and resources limit our ability for additional translation.

Peer-reviewed articles on quantitative studies published after 1990 will be included.", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Eligibility Criteria\n1.  Year of publication: In view of the ageing concerns in the United Nations, peer-reviewed articles published after 1990 will be included.\n2.  Publication type: Peer-reviewed journal articles will be included\n3. Language: Studies in English, Chinese, Korean, and Spanish will be included, as these are spoken by team members.\n4. Study Design: All quantitative studies (including association, longitudinal, intervention/experimental studies) will be included. \n5. Participants: Grandparents involved in formal/ informal caregiving of grandchildren aged between 0 and 18. \n6. Outcomes: Studies reporting well-being broadly defined as physical and/or mental health of grandparent caregivers. \n\nExclusion criteria:\n1.  All grey literature (i.e., book chapter, conference abstract and dissertation) will be excluded.\n2.  Peer-reviewed journal articles which are not published in one of the following languages: English, Chinese, Korean, and Spanish.\n3.  Articles on qualitative studies will be excluded.\n4.  Articles reporting only child-related outcomes will be excluded.\n5. Articles reporting only elders\u2019 wellbeing but no mention of their caregiving roles will be excluded. \n \nStudy Records\nLiterature search results will be imported into Covidence, an Internet based software program that supports deduplication, collaboration among reviewers during the screening process, and the creation of a PRISMA flow diagram upon screening completion. Automatic and manual de-duplication will be conducted in Covidence.\nAll reviewers will be trained on the Covidence software by a librarian with experience in this software. The screening criteria will be piloted by having all reviewers screen a subset of abstracts; this process will be used to refine the criteria and establish consensus among reviewers. Individual reviewers will then code abstracts and full text articles; Covidence will record their decisions allowing reliability to be calculated.\n \nSelection process.\nAll screeners participated in the development of the review aims and inclusion/exclusion criteria; they have equal familiarity with the study goals and screening process. Reviewers will independently apply our inclusion criteria to the titles and abstracts included in the search results. Each reviewer will be randomly assigned to screen particular abstracts using Covidence software available online. Each abstract will be reviewed by at least two reviewers; disagreements will be recorded and resolved by group discussion. Reviewers will then screen full text articles and seek information from study authors if further information is needed in order to determine whether a study meets the inclusion criteria. Disagreements will be recorded and resolved through discussion. All exclusions during abstract and full text screening will be recorded. Reviewers will have access to all publication information during screening, including journal titles and study authors and institutions.\n\nData Collection Process.\nData will be extracted from included articles using a standardized form. Piloting of data extraction forms will be conducted prior to the formal process in order to establish consensus among team members. Two reviewers will extract all data and check for agreement; we will contact study authors a maximum of three times when further information is needed. Disagreements on any data will be resolved through discussion with a third member of the team.\n\nData items.\nThe standardized data extraction form will include variables of interest: year of publication, study location/language, sample size, grandparent characteristics (e.g., ethnicity/race, gender, age, caregiver role, etc), grandchildren characteristics (e.g., age, gender, co-residence status, duration of stay, and health condition), family characteristics (e.g., family support, family relationship, communication, and family structure), sociocultural context (e.g., geographical location, race/ethnicity and culture), primary outcome measures (e.g., grandparents\u2019 physical health, mental health, perceived stress, resilience, well-being and life satisfaction).\n\nRisk of bias in individual studies.\nThe quality and risk of bias of articles are assessed using a checklist of 14 items adapted from an established quality assessment of quantitative studies (Kmet, Cook, &amp; Lee, 2004). See Appendix 2. This ensures the included quantitative studies are of reasonable quality in terms of  research objectives, study design, analytical method, results reporting, and conclusion supported by results. The evaluation process will be performed independently by two researchers and meetings will be held to resolve disagreement. Studies will be categorized as high, moderate or low quality in terms of meeting the number of criteria. \n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "Not applicable.", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Grandparent characteristics, grandchildren characteristics, family characteristics, sociocultural context, grandparents\u2019 well-being (i.e., physical health, mental health, perceived stress, resilience, and life satisfaction).", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "Not applicable.", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Data synthesis.\nThe planned analysis will include two parts.
