If we need to source individual baseline data to compare with our joint productions, we will create a between-participant condition for study comparison.", "hypothesis": "There are two principal research objectives;\n(1) Can we replicate and extend key outcomes from a study of joint cognition (the AABB study), generalising this to asymmetric production schedules (AAB / ABB)\n(2) If participants are assigned to outgroups through a minimal-group-paradigm MGP intervention, does this affect their collaborative stance and production choices in the joint cognition paradigm?",

Specifically, this study will focus on the effects of perceptions of \"voluntariness\"; the extent to which an individual is exposed to a risk voluntarily, and \"controllability\"; the extent to which an individual can, once exposed to a risk, avoid the consequences of the risk being realized through skill or diligence (from here forward these will be referred to as \u201cvoluntary factor\u201d and \u201ccontrol factor\u201d, respectively).  Although previous literature has assessed the effects of psychotropic risk characteristics on WTP to reduce a hazard, none have focused specifically on voluntary and control factors. It is useful to ascertain the effects of these factors individually, due to the implications they have for the funding of public health policies seeking to reduce the risk of hazards with widely varied perceptions among populations (consider the differences between an individual\u2019s attitudes towards pancreatic cancer and opioid overdose).  Additionally, previous literature has not assessed the level to which individuals within a population agree about the characteristics of different hazards, a gap which this study aims to fill. Assessing this will be useful as, if consensus among a population is low, this would highlight the subjective nature of such risk characteristics, potentially indicating that perceptions could change over time, as noted in Fox-Glassman &amp; Weber (2016), or with different levels of information, which would have implications for funding and policy decisions.\n\nThe experimental design for this paper is based off of Savage (1993) with a few key differences.  First, this study will modify Savage's questionnaire to include questions directly assessing perceptions of voluntary and control factors, allowing for the addition of 2 variables to the models employed by Savage.

Age was selected as the only relevant control for this study based on the results in Savage (1993) concerning the effects of demographics on WTP, where it is found that only age significantly influences WTP across all hazards.\n\nFollowing this control, respondents will proceed to the allocation section of the survey.  In this section, respondents are asked to imagine they are participating in a referendum to decide how to split a government research budget between research to mitigate 4 different hazards, selected to invoke a wide range of perceptions of voluntary and control factors; pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, car accidents, and home fires.  Individuals' responses to this will take the form of allocating different percentages of the budget to each risk, with the requirement that the total adds up to 100%.  Initially, a separate note highlighted in red was included with this question to ask respondents to assume that research towards mitigating each hazard is identically efficient at spending money towards saving lives, in other words, 1% of the budget would save the same number of lives regardless of which hazard it is put towards.  However, this note was removed after pilot tests of the survey showed that participants interpreted this note as meaning there was a \u201ccorrect\u201d answer; to allocate budget evenly between the hazards.  Instead, the question was rephrased to contain this information about equal cost-efficiency in a less attention-grabbing manner.\n\nAfter submitting their allocation, respondents then move on to the risk characteristics section of the survey.  In this section, individuals rate each hazard on a 7-point scale for each risk characteristic.  These characteristics include (and are asked in the following order) how at risk they believe themselves to personally be to a hazard, how voluntary they believe exposure to the hazard is, how controllable the consequences of the hazard are once an individual is exposed to it, how informed they feel about each hazard, and how much dread they feel about the hazard.  During the initial pilot tests of the survey, the order in which individuals were asked to consider these characteristics was randomized, however it was decided to designate a specific order to clarify what should be factored into each characteristic.  For example, individuals\u2019 answers for how personally at risk they believe themselves to be to a hazard should not factor into their rating for the dread factor, so the survey is ordered so that individuals must first separately consider how personally at risk they are to a hazard, before rating the dread factor.\n\nAt the end of the survey, a unique ID is displayed to the respondent, with instructions for them to copy and paste it into AMT.

The first stage addresses the issue of potential correlation between the dread and control factor variables, as highlighted by previous literature Slovic, Fischhoff, and Lichtenstein (1980) and Savage (1993).  This is important to address, as a key difference between this study and Savage (1993) is that Savage chooses to exclude voluntary and control factors from his analysis based on their correlation with dread.  In order to assess the level of correlation, a correlation table showing correlations between all risk characteristic responses will be produced, modeled off of Table 3 in Fox-Glassman &amp; Weber (2016).  If in this correlation table the correlation between dread and control factor is greater than 0.5, a \u201chorse race\u201d between dread and control factor will be conducted to determine which will be included in the following regression analyses.  Within the \u201chorse race\u201d, the p-value threshold for statistical significance is set at p &lt; 0.05.\n\nThe first step of the \u201chorse race\u201d will be a regression with WTP as the outcome variable, using dread and control factor as explanatory variables alongside the age control variable (this is shown as equation (1) in the attached supplement PDF).  If the regression results show both dread and control factor to have significant effects, both will be included in the later regressions.  If the regression results show only one of the variables to have a significant effect, the other will be excluded from the later regressions.  If neither variable has a significant effect, the next step will be to test these variables one-by-one.  This one-by-one testing will consist of 2 regressions, each with WTP as the outcome variable and one of either dread or control factor as explanatory variable alongside the age control (shown as equation (2) in the supplement PDF).  If these regressions show both variables to have significant effects, the variable with the smaller magnitude of effect will be excluded from the later regressions.  If only one variable is shown to have significant effects, the other will be excluded from the later regressions.  If neither variable is shown to have significant effects, both will be excluded from future regressions.\n\nFollowing the \u201chorse race\u201d, the second stage of analysis will be comprised of 3 OLS models assessing the relationship between the risk characteristics and WTP.  These models are based off of equations 2, 3, and 5 from Savage (1993), modified to include the additional risk characteristic variables assessed in this study.  The equations for these 3 models can be found in the attached supplement PDF.  Estimations were set as semi-log-linear OLS due to theory behind the relationship between WTP and disutility from hazard characteristics, and because the dependent variable may take the value of 0 (Savage (1993)).\n\nThe first model, shown as equation (3) in the attached PDF offers analysis of the effects of risk characteristics on WTP across individuals for each hazard.  In other words, this will consist of one regression for each of the 4 hazards, with 21 explanatory variables each.\n\nThe second model, shown as equation (4) in the attached PDF analyzes the effects of risk characteristics across individuals and hazards.  This will consist of one regression with one explanatory variable for each of the 5 risk characteristics.\n\nThe final model, shown as equation (5) in the attached PDF consists of the same analysis as the second model, while adjusting for individual response scaling in the rating of risk characteristics.  In practice, this means that panel data techniques will be used, subtracting each individual\u2019s mean response value for that variable from each observation.\n  \nThe final stage of analysis will be geared towards assessing the level of consensus among the population on perceptions of risk characteristics.  This will consist of a table showing means and measures of variability (standard deviation, variance) of responses to risk characteristic questions, first in absolute terms, and then after adjustment for individual response scaling, as specified above.  Additionally, dispersion of responses on perceived risk characteristics will be graphically represented in box plots, both before and after adjustment for individual response scaling.\n\nIn order to assess whether the 2 hypotheses designated earlier are supported, the following criteria will be used:\n\nH1: In the first model, for each hazard, if the corresponding coefficient for that hazard and the voluntary factor is negative and meets significance thresholds set out in Inference Criteria section, the hypothesis will be considered to be supported, but only necessarily for that specific hazard.  In the 2nd and 3rd models, if the coefficient for the voluntary factor is negative and meets significance thresholds set out in the Inference Criteria section, the hypothesis will be considered to be supported, and will be considered to be robust if this condition is met in both models.\n\nH2: If the control factor is left in the model after the \u201chorse race\u201d, the same criteria for assessing H1 will be used, replacing voluntary factor with control factor.  If control factor is excluded and dread factor is included after the \u201chorse race\u201d, the same criteria for assessing H1 will be used, replacing voluntary factor with dread, however if conditions are met, this result will only be considered suggestive of H2.

This one-by-one testing will consist of 2 regressions, each with WTP as the outcome variable and one of either dread or control factor as explanatory variable alongside the age control (shown as equation (2) in the supplement PDF).  If these regressions show both variables to have significant effects, the variable with the smaller magnitude of effect will be excluded from the later regressions.  If only one variable is shown to have significant effects, the other will be excluded from the later regressions.  If neither variable is shown to have significant effects, both will be excluded from future regressions.\n\nFollowing the \u201chorse race\u201d, the second stage of analysis will be comprised of 3 OLS models assessing the relationship between the risk characteristics and WTP.  These models are based off of equations 2, 3, and 5 from Savage (1993), modified to include the additional risk characteristic variables assessed in this study.  The equations for these 3 models can be found in the attached supplement PDF.  Estimations were set as semi-log-linear OLS due to theory behind the relationship between WTP and disutility from hazard characteristics, and because the dependent variable may take the value of 0 (Savage (1993)).\n\nThe first model, shown as equation (3) in the attached PDF offers analysis of the effects of risk characteristics on WTP across individuals for each hazard.  In other words, this will consist of one regression for each of the 4 hazards, with 21 explanatory variables each.\n\nThe second model, shown as equation (4) in the attached PDF analyzes the effects of risk characteristics across individuals and hazards.  This will consist of one regression with one explanatory variable for each of the 5 risk characteristics.\n\nThe final model, shown as equation (5) in the attached PDF consists of the same analysis as the second model, while adjusting for individual response scaling in the rating of risk characteristics.  In practice, this means that panel data techniques will be used, subtracting each individual\u2019s mean response value for that variable from each observation.\n  \nThe final stage of analysis will be geared towards assessing the level of consensus among the population on perceptions of risk characteristics.  This will consist of a table showing means and measures of variability (standard deviation, variance) of responses to risk characteristic questions, first in absolute terms, and then after adjustment for individual response scaling, as specified above.  Additionally, dispersion of responses on perceived risk characteristics will be graphically represented in box plots, both before and after adjustment for individual response scaling.\n\nIn order to assess whether the 2 hypotheses designated earlier are supported, the following criteria will be used:\n\nH1: In the first model, for each hazard, if the corresponding coefficient for that hazard and the voluntary factor is negative and meets significance thresholds set out in Inference Criteria section, the hypothesis will be considered to be supported, but only necessarily for that specific hazard.  In the 2nd and 3rd models, if the coefficient for the voluntary factor is negative and meets significance thresholds set out in the Inference Criteria section, the hypothesis will be considered to be supported, and will be considered to be robust if this condition is met in both models.\n\nH2: If the control factor is left in the model after the \u201chorse race\u201d, the same criteria for assessing H1 will be used, replacing voluntary factor with control factor.  If control factor is excluded and dread factor is included after the \u201chorse race\u201d, the same criteria for assessing H1 will be used, replacing voluntary factor with dread, however if conditions are met, this result will only be considered suggestive of H2.  If both dread and control factor are excluded from analysis after the \u201chorse race\u201d, results for H2 will be considered inconclusive.", "q19.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e70d4ab0cd06c040c00146e",
