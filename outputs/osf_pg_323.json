Condition or domain being studied: In December 2019, a series of unexplained pneumonia cases appeared in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, with clinical manifestations very similar to viral pneumonia. Deep sequencing of samples from the lower respiratory tract revealed the discovery of a novel coronavirus, which was named the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov), and the pneumonia caused by the virus was also named the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP) by Chinese government.

Intervention(s), exposure(s): Treatment of integrated traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine therapies, including dosage forms of decoction of traditional Chinese medicine, granule of traditional Chinese medicine, powder of traditional Chinese medicine, electuary of traditional Chinese medicine, pill of traditional Chinese medicine, pellet of traditional Chinese medicine and other available forms. There is no limit to the treatment of Western Medicine.\n\n8. Comparator(s)/control: Including TCM therapies alone, Western medicine therapies alone, blank control, placebo control and other interventions. Interventions in the experimental group were not included, including treatment of traditional Chinese medicine as adjuvant therapy in different dosage forms.\n\n9. Types of study to be included: We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published and unpublished, in English and Chinese.\n\n10.

Data extraction (selection and coding): Three reviewers searched the online databases listed above and recorded the titles and abstracts of all the articles.\nThree evaluators assessed the eligibility of these articles and made decisions on every research (inclusion or exclusion) independently. If they did not reach the same decision, the concerned articles were discussed with a fourth reviewer (Qinxiu Zhang).\nThree reviewers extracted data independently from each study.\nDifferences regarding the extracted data were resolved after discussion with a fourth reviewer (Qinxiu Zhang).\n\n13.Risk of bias (quality) assessment: Three authors of our review team will independently assess the methodological quality of included trials, and consensus will be reached by discussion with a third party in case of discrepancy.\nThe methodological quality of RCTs will be assessed according to the risk of bias tool described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [Higgins JPT 2009]. Six elements will be assessed: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, free of selective reporting, and other bias. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion with a third party.\n\n14. Strategy for data synthesis: Statistical analyses will be performed using RevMan 5.3 software (The Cochrane Collaboration).\n- Pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of dichotomous outcomes will be used to report effect estimate.\n- Continuous data will be presented as mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. If different measurement scales are used, standardized mean difference (SMD) will be performed to analyze continuous data.\nIf required data are not reported, we will try to obtain data from corresponding author.\nHeterogeneity will be assessed using both the \u03c7\u00b2 test and the I\u00b2 statistic, and we will consider an I\u00b2 value greater than 50% indicative of substantial heterogeneity.\n- For I\u00b2&lt;50%, a fixed-effect model is used.\n- For I\u00b2 &gt;=50%, a random-effect model is applied.\nIf data permit, we plan to exclude some trials that contribuite most to the heterogeneity to see whether the result change or not.\nWe will also use a summary of findings table to present the main findings using GRADEpro software (The Cochrane Collaboration). Funnel plots will be generated to detect publication bias if more than 10 trials are identified to report the same outcomes. If appropriate, we will use cumulative meta-analyses. Results of meta-analyses will be visualized by forest plots. In addition, we will conduct trial sequential analysis to evaluate the meta-analyses for primary outcomes, which can reveal the required information size and potentially false results in a meta-analysis. Intention-to-treat analysis will be applied for primary outcome, if missing data from the original trials are available.\n\n15. Analysis of subgroups or subsets: If data permitted, we plan to conduct subgroup analyses for different groups, including:\nDifferent age of patients\nDifferent severity of disease\nDifferent regimen applied\nDifferent treat time\nDifferent acupoints selected\nCombined with other interventions or not.\n\n16. Type and method of review: intervention; Meta-analysis; Prevention; Systematic review.\n\n17. Health area of the review : Complementary therapies; General interests; Infections; Public health; Respiratory disorders; \n\n18. Languages of the review: English and Chinese;\n\n19.

So far, China has confirmed more than 40,000 cases, including health care workers, and 25 countries in Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania have confirmed hundreds of export cases. However, there are no specific drugs for the NCP, and most of the existing drugs are controversial and need further study. In the clinical treatment of the NCP in China, traditional Chinese medicine has been widely used, and there are many news reports that the combined treatment of traditional Chinese and western medicine is effective. Till now, about 30 protocols of RCTs about integrated traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine therapies for the NCP have been registered for implementation. There are no SR or protocol on integrated traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine therapies for the NCP. Therefore, research on it is very urgent.\n\n6.Participants/population: Patients confirmed or suspected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), or healthy population defined by specific strategy of RCT, regardless of gender, etiology, ethnic group, severity, diagnosed with specific criteria (i.e. mention any one of criteria for diagnosis of allergic rhinitis) are eligible for inclusion.\n\n7. Intervention(s), exposure(s): Treatment of integrated traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine therapies, including dosage forms of decoction of traditional Chinese medicine, granule of traditional Chinese medicine, powder of traditional Chinese medicine, electuary of traditional Chinese medicine, pill of traditional Chinese medicine, pellet of traditional Chinese medicine and other available forms. There is no limit to the treatment of Western Medicine.\n\n8. Comparator(s)/control: Including TCM therapies alone, Western medicine therapies alone, blank control, placebo control and other interventions. Interventions in the experimental group were not included, including treatment of traditional Chinese medicine as adjuvant therapy in different dosage forms.\n\n9. Types of study to be included: We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published and unpublished, in English and Chinese.\n\n10. Main outcome(s): \u2460The survival rate;\n                                      \u2461Duration of oxygen intaking;\n                                      \u2462Rate of severe patients;\n                                      \u2463Duration of hospital staying;\n                                      \u2464Mortality prior to hospital discharge;\n                                      \u2465Mortality following hospital discharge;\n                                      \u2466Total effective rate;\n\n11. Additional outcome(s): \u2460 Oxygenation index;\n                                                \u2461Respiratory parameters (such as Fi O2, PaO2, PEEP and PaCO2);\n                                                \u2462Duration of mechanical ventilation;\n                                                \u2463Hemodynamic indicators (such as HR, CVP, and MAP);\n                                                \u2464Quality of life score;\n\n12. Data extraction (selection and coding): Three reviewers searched the online databases listed above and recorded the titles and abstracts of all the articles.\nThree evaluators assessed the eligibility of these articles and made decisions on every research (inclusion or exclusion) independently. If they did not reach the same decision, the concerned articles were discussed with a fourth reviewer (Qinxiu Zhang).\nThree reviewers extracted data independently from each study.\nDifferences regarding the extracted data were resolved after discussion with a fourth reviewer (Qinxiu Zhang).\n\n13.Risk of bias (quality) assessment: Three authors of our review team will independently assess the methodological quality of included trials, and consensus will be reached by discussion with a third party in case of discrepancy.\nThe methodological quality of RCTs will be assessed according to the risk of bias tool described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [Higgins JPT 2009]. Six elements will be assessed: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, free of selective reporting, and other bias. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion with a third party.\n\n14. Strategy for data synthesis: Statistical analyses will be performed using RevMan 5.3 software (The Cochrane Collaboration).\n- Pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of dichotomous outcomes will be used to report effect estimate.\n- Continuous data will be presented as mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. If different measurement scales are used, standardized mean difference (SMD) will be performed to analyze continuous data.\nIf required data are not reported, we will try to obtain data from corresponding author.\nHeterogeneity will be assessed using both the \u03c7\u00b2 test and the I\u00b2 statistic, and we will consider an I\u00b2 value greater than 50% indicative of substantial heterogeneity.\n- For I\u00b2&lt;50%, a fixed-effect model is used.\n- For I\u00b2 &gt;=50%, a random-effect model is applied.\nIf data permit, we plan to exclude some trials that contribuite most to the heterogeneity to see whether the result change or not.\nWe will also use a summary of findings table to present the main findings using GRADEpro software (The Cochrane Collaboration). Funnel plots will be generated to detect publication bias if more than 10 trials are identified to report the same outcomes. If appropriate, we will use cumulative meta-analyses. Results of meta-analyses will be visualized by forest plots. In addition, we will conduct trial sequential analysis to evaluate the meta-analyses for primary outcomes, which can reveal the required information size and potentially false results in a meta-analysis. Intention-to-treat analysis will be applied for primary outcome, if missing data from the original trials are available.\n\n15. Analysis of subgroups or subsets: If data permitted, we plan to conduct subgroup analyses for different groups, including:\nDifferent age of patients\nDifferent severity of disease\nDifferent regimen applied\nDifferent treat time\nDifferent acupoints selected\nCombined with other interventions or not.\n\n16. Type and method of review: intervention; Meta-analysis; Prevention; Systematic review.\n\n17. Health area of the review : Complementary therapies; General interests; Infections; Public health; Respiratory disorders; \n\n18. Languages of the review: English and Chinese;\n\n19. Dissemination plans: In addition to producing a report, a paper will be submitted to a journal in this field.\n\n20.

These experiments will replicate and extend the work of Huff, Yates and Balota (2018) who showed that task repetitions of recall testing and guessing increased correct recognition relative to completing a repeated restudy task (i.e., a retrieval-practice effect; Rowland, 2014). \n\nExperiment 1 will be a systematic replication of Huff et al. (2018; Experiment 1). Participants will be given instructions for all 3 tasks (free recall, guessing, and restudy) prior to any list presentation but will be unaware of which specific task they will be asked to complete and therefore would not have developed an expectancy for a given task. After the participant has been presented with the list of words to study, they will be given the instructions for the specific task they will need to complete. After 18 study/task trials, participants will then complete a final recognition test which will include R/K judgments for old words to provide estimates of recollection and familiarity. Based on Huff et al.\u2019s previous work, we predict a reversed retrieval-practice effect in which restudy will produce a correct recognition advantage over testing and guessing tasks. Across all task types, recollection is expected to be greater for testing and guessing lists relative to restudy, and familiarity is expected to be greater for restudy relative to testing and guessing, demonstrating a tradeoff between recollection and familiarity. The recognition test will also contain critical items. We expect that false recognition will be lower for lists using the guessing task as this task requires participants to generate non-studied but related critical lures. Familiarity is also expected to be greater for critical items when compared to recollection across all task types and familiarity will be reduced as a result of the guessing task.\n\nExperiment 2 will also manipulate task presentation within-subjects with the exception that now tasks will be repeated and blocked together in 3 separate blocks to encourage expectancy effects. Experiment 2 is a systematic replication of Huff et al. (2018; Experiment 4A/4B) in which they reported that testing and guessing improved final correct recognition relative to restudy (a retrieval-practice effect). Experiment 2 will have participants repeat tasks 6 times before completing a recognition test. Participants will also be presented with the specific instructions for the task they will be completing prior to list study. Overall, testing and guessing blocks are expected to show an increase in correct recognition of list items and a decrease in false recognition of critical items relative to restudy (patterns reported by Huff et al.). Again, recollection is expected to be greater for lists using both the testing and guessing tasks. Familiarity estimates are expected to be equivalent across all task types, as expectancy effects should not be strong enough after only 6 repetitions to significantly influence familiarity. As in Experiment 1, familiarity is expected to be greater compared to recollection for critical items across all task types.    \n\nExperiment 3 will manipulate task type (free recall vs. guessing vs. restudy) between subjects. Participants will complete 18 repetitions of the same task to enhance the expectancy effects demonstrated in Experiment 2. Participants should demonstrate enhanced benefits of task expectancy due to the extensive repetitions of each task. Overall, correct recognition is expected to increase in the testing and guessing conditions relative to restudy, while false recognition is expected to decrease in these conditions. Recollection estimates are expected to increase for participants in the testing and guessing conditions compared to the restudy condition at an even greater rate than in Experiment 2, due to enhanced expectancy effects. Familiarity estimates are also expected to increase for participants in the testing and guessing conditions, but not to the extent of recollection. For all conditions, familiarity estimates are expected to be greater relative to recollection for false recognition of critical items. Familiarity estimates are expected to be greatest in the restudy condition and lowest in the guessing condition.\n\n"}, "study_type": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment"}, "study_type_other": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"data": "It's complicated.

These experiments will replicate and extend the work of Huff, Yates and Balota (2018) who showed that task repetitions of recall testing and guessing increased correct recognition relative to completing a repeated restudy task (i.e., a retrieval-practice effect; Rowland, 2014). \n\nExperiment 1 will be a systematic replication of Huff et al. (2018; Experiment 1). Participants will be given instructions for all 3 tasks (free recall, guessing, and restudy) prior to any list presentation but will be unaware of which specific task they will be asked to complete and therefore would not have developed an expectancy for a given task. After the participant has been presented with the list of words to study, they will be given the instructions for the specific task they will need to complete. After 18 study/task trials, participants will then complete a final recognition test which will include R/K judgments for old words to provide estimates of recollection and familiarity. Based on Huff et al.\u2019s previous work, we predict a reversed retrieval-practice effect in which restudy will produce a correct recognition advantage over testing and guessing tasks. Across all task types, recollection is expected to be greater for testing and guessing lists relative to restudy, and familiarity is expected to be greater for restudy relative to testing and guessing, demonstrating a tradeoff between recollection and familiarity. The recognition test will also contain critical items. We expect that false recognition will be lower for lists using the guessing task as this task requires participants to generate non-studied but related critical lures. Familiarity is also expected to be greater for critical items when compared to recollection across all task types and familiarity will be reduced as a result of the guessing task.\n\nExperiment 2 will also manipulate task presentation within-subjects with the exception that now tasks will be repeated and blocked together in 3 separate blocks to encourage expectancy effects. Experiment 2 is a systematic replication of Huff et al. (2018; Experiment 4A/4B) in which they reported that testing and guessing improved final correct recognition relative to restudy (a retrieval-practice effect). Experiment 2 will have participants repeat tasks 6 times before completing a recognition test. Participants will also be presented with the specific instructions for the task they will be completing prior to list study. Overall, testing and guessing blocks are expected to show an increase in correct recognition of list items and a decrease in false recognition of critical items relative to restudy (patterns reported by Huff et al.). Again, recollection is expected to be greater for lists using both the testing and guessing tasks. Familiarity estimates are expected to be equivalent across all task types, as expectancy effects should not be strong enough after only 6 repetitions to significantly influence familiarity. As in Experiment 1, familiarity is expected to be greater compared to recollection for critical items across all task types.    \n\nExperiment 3 will manipulate task type (free recall vs. guessing vs. restudy) between subjects. Participants will complete 18 repetitions of the same task to enhance the expectancy effects demonstrated in Experiment 2. Participants should demonstrate enhanced benefits of task expectancy due to the extensive repetitions of each task. Overall, correct recognition is expected to increase in the testing and guessing conditions relative to restudy, while false recognition is expected to decrease in these conditions. Recollection estimates are expected to increase for participants in the testing and guessing conditions compared to the restudy condition at an even greater rate than in Experiment 2, due to enhanced expectancy effects. Familiarity estimates are also expected to increase for participants in the testing and guessing conditions, but not to the extent of recollection. For all conditions, familiarity estimates are expected to be greater relative to recollection for false recognition of critical items. Familiarity estimates are expected to be greatest in the restudy condition and lowest in the guessing condition.\n\n", "study_type": "Experiment"}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children":
