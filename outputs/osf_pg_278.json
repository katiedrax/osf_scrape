Only relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) will be included.\nTypes of participants.  All of the participants must be female older than 18 and have been diagnosed as primary breast cancer stage 0-III patients. The main treatments the participants are currently receiving include any one of the following: surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy. Additionally, the participants should be under no physical limitation prohibiting exercise.\nTypes of intervention.  The experimental group is treated with TCC. Any type of TCC will be eligible, disregarding the styles (such as Yang-style TCC, Chen-style TCC, Wu-style TCC, Sun-style TCC) or forms (such as 24-form, 36-form, 48-form,104-form). Comparisons can be routine treatment including standard medication and/or conventional care program, other types of standard support therapy and non-exercise therapy. All interventions will be treated for no less than 12 weeks with a frequency of at least once per week.\nTypes of outcome measures.  Primary Outcomes: Psychological symptoms (depression and anxiety) and quality of life have been considered as the primary outcome. Secondary Outcomes: The secondary outcome assessments consist of fatigue, sleep quality, cognitive function, and inflammatory cytokine. The time endpoint of the above outcomes will be no earlier than 12 weeks after initiation of treatment.\nExclusion Criteria\n(1) The unrelated and duplicated documents will be deleted.\n(2) Reviews, theoretical discussions, experience summaries, and case reports will not be considered.\n(3) The non-TCC type of intervention and articles without the original data will be not be included.\nData Collection and Extraction\nStudy screening and data extraction were based on the Cochrane collaborative network system evaluator handbook. NoteExpress (version:3.2, Beijing Aegean Software Company) software for literature import and screening was used to exclude duplicate literature, and to exclude unrelated literature by reading the titles and abstracts. Full texts that retain the randomized clinical trials meeting the inclusion criteria will be read. Two reviewers (GJ and SYF) will extract the data independently by adopting a self-developed data extraction form. Any disagreement in the process will be resolved by discussion with another team member (LB).\nThe following characteristics and data from each included study will be extracted. The general information will include research ID (primary author, year of publication, country of origin), title, publication status, report sources, fund support. Methodology information will include the design, number of arms, random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, sample size calculation, baseline comparability. For participant information, it will include the diagnostic criteria, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, sample size, age, population, and status of cancer. Intervention information will include the type of intervention, current treatment, duration and frequency of treatment, intervention instructor and patient follow-up (reasons and number of patients who dropped out or got lost).

function instead is to express that the speaker is in a certain conative or affective state of mind. \n\nThe contrast between moral and non-moral statements is sometimes presented as the idea that, whereas non-moral statements express cognitive mental states such as belief, moral statements express non-cognitive mental states, such as approval. Moreover, the latter express non-cognitive states in the same way that non-moral statements express beliefs. This is Schroeder's 'Parity Thesis':\n\n'[M]oral sentences are related to noncognitive, desire\u2010like states of mind in the same way that ordinary descriptive sentences are related to ordinary beliefs\u2014they express them. (Schroeder, 2008, p. 3). \n\nThe Parity Thesis makes a testable prediction: if moral assertions express non-cognitive attitudes in the same way that non-moral assertions express beliefs, then whatever relations hold between non-moral assertions and belief ascriptions should hold as well between moral assertions and ascriptions of the relevant non-cognitive attitudes. In particular, just as certain combinations of non-moral assertions and belief ascriptions generate so-called Moore paradoxes (1), similar combinations of moral assertions and ascriptions of non-cognitive attitudes ought to generate analogously unacceptable constructions (2).\n\n(1) Murder is wrong but I don\u2019t think it is wrong.\n(2) Murder is wrong but I don\u2019t disapprove of it.\n\nWoods (2014) claims that this is not the case: sentences like (2) are not unacceptable in the same way that Moorean paradoxes are. He argues that this constitutes a major blow to the Parity Thesis. Woods, however, bases his claim that sentences like (2) are acceptable on his intuitions. But intuitions vary, and not everyone agrees with Woods on this score. \n\nThe purpose of our study is to empirically test the acceptability of sentences like (2), and thereby provide empirical evidence that speaks to Wood's claim, the Parity Thesis, and the connection between moral language and non-cognitive attitudes that is the focus of much contemporary literature on metaethics and philosophy of language."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "We have two hypothesis: either sentences like (2) (henceforth 'evaluative incoherencies') are acceptable or they are not.  \n\nTo test these hypotheses, we will study the acceptability of statements constructed following this template: where x is an individual-referring term and A is a propositional attitude verb,\n\nMurder is wrong but x does not A {that murder is wrong / murder}\n\nWe will manipulate two factors on constructions that follow this template:\n(a) Attitude: A will stand for 'think' or 'disapprove of' (thus the variability between assigning a full propositional clause or just a noun)\n(b) Person: x will be the speaker ('I') or a third person ('Ann')\n\nThis two-way manipulation generates the following four statement-types:\n\n(1) Murder is wrong but I don't think that it is wrong.

Moreover, the latter express non-cognitive states in the same way that non-moral statements express beliefs. This is Schroeder's 'Parity Thesis':\n\n'[M]oral sentences are related to noncognitive, desire\u2010like states of mind in the same way that ordinary descriptive sentences are related to ordinary beliefs\u2014they express them. (Schroeder, 2008, p. 3). \n\nThe Parity Thesis makes a testable prediction: if moral assertions express non-cognitive attitudes in the same way that non-moral assertions express beliefs, then whatever relations hold between non-moral assertions and belief ascriptions should hold as well between moral assertions and ascriptions of the relevant non-cognitive attitudes. In particular, just as certain combinations of non-moral assertions and belief ascriptions generate so-called Moore paradoxes (1), similar combinations of moral assertions and ascriptions of non-cognitive attitudes ought to generate analogously unacceptable constructions (2).\n\n(1) Murder is wrong but I don\u2019t think it is wrong.\n(2) Murder is wrong but I don\u2019t disapprove of it.\n\nWoods (2014) claims that this is not the case: sentences like (2) are not unacceptable in the same way that Moorean paradoxes are. He argues that this constitutes a major blow to the Parity Thesis. Woods, however, bases his claim that sentences like (2) are acceptable on his intuitions. But intuitions vary, and not everyone agrees with Woods on this score. \n\nThe purpose of our study is to empirically test the acceptability of sentences like (2), and thereby provide empirical evidence that speaks to Wood's claim, the Parity Thesis, and the connection between moral language and non-cognitive attitudes that is the focus of much contemporary literature on metaethics and philosophy of language.", "q4": "We have two hypothesis: either sentences like (2) (henceforth 'evaluative incoherencies') are acceptable or they are not.  \n\nTo test these hypotheses, we will study the acceptability of statements constructed following this template: where x is an individual-referring term and A is a propositional attitude verb,\n\nMurder is wrong but x does not A {that murder is wrong / murder}\n\nWe will manipulate two factors on constructions that follow this template:\n(a) Attitude: A will stand for 'think' or 'disapprove of' (thus the variability between assigning a full propositional clause or just a noun)\n(b) Person: x will be the speaker ('I') or a third person ('Ann')\n\nThis two-way manipulation generates the following four statement-types:\n\n(1) Murder is wrong but I don't think that it is wrong.

In other words, is the Person factor a good predictor of acceptability of these constructions (modulo potential interactions)?\n\n(ii) Is the difference in acceptability between sentences like (1) and (3) similar to the difference in acceptability between sentences like (2) and (4)?
