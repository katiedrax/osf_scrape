First, I will examine the validity of the mainland CCP-SCIAT samples in terms of demographic and attitudinal covariates, as they compare to the online population from the China Survey and my previous samples with COMR. The hope for this section is that the CCP-SCIAT sample confirms the standard finding in the literature, that citizens display high levels of explicit support for the CCP regime (Chen 2004; Chen & Dickson 2008; Chen, Zhong & Hillard 1997; Lewis-Beck, Tang & Martini 2014; Li 2004; Manion 2006; Shi 2000; Tang 2005; Truex 2014; Zhong, Chen & Scheb 1998). If this is not the case, that would undermine the motivation for the project. The core output from this section will be a figure or table that shows the distribution of explicit support measures in the sample as compared to other surveys. Second, I will examine the distribution of the D-score (implicit.ccp) using a simple density plot, to see whether respondents in the mainland sample have positive or negative implicit attitudes towards the regime. The distribution of (implicit.ccp) in the Hong Kong will serve as a valuable referent point, as we know these citizens are generally less sympathetic to the CCP and have staged repeated large-scale protests. The Hong Kong survey will also ask participants whether they participated in the Occupy movement (occupy), allowing us to see gauge the distribution of implicit attitudes of this population relative to the mainland population. I will also conduct a simple validation of the CCP-SCIAT, investigating the simply bivariate correlation between mplicit.ccp} and occupy. Third, I will plot the implicit.ccp scores agains explicit regime support measures. This will allow us to see whether or not Chinese citizens' implicit attitudes track their explicit attitudes towards the CCP. If we observe a large number of respondents with positive explicit attitudes, but negative implicit attitudes, this would be indicative of preference falsification. It would also raise doubts of the validity of explicit measures. Fourth, I will examine the determinants of implicit.ccp, revisiting some core findings from the literature on public opinion in China. Here, implicit.ccp is modeled as a function of a respondent's age, CCP membership, university education status, government employment status, gender, and ethnicity. The primary output from this section will be a coefficient plot, comparing the output from regressing implicit.ccp on these covariates compared to using explicit measures. Finally, I will examine the determinants of preference falsification. I will create an indicator variable pref.false that identifies any individuals that have positive explicit attitudes, but negative implicit attitudes towards the regime. I will compare the demographic profiles of these individuals relative to those who do not display a disconnect between their explicit and implicit attitudes.

It is also now a key part of citizens\u2019 democratic expectations and rights, increasingly enforced by national and international legislation and legal rulings (Darch and Underwood 2010). Not only is transparency now viewed as desirable in and of itself, it is also expected to bring about a series of benefits, including greater accountability, increased trust and better decision-making while also acting as deterrent to corruption (Hazell et al 2010; Meijer 2014). There are a growing number of transparency mechanisms available to governments to help public authorities reach an acceptable standard of information provision. These can be embedded within the formal frameworks governing how public authorities operate, such as the rules of disclosure on meeting minutes, or driven by the ethical stance of public officials or the more political wish to have their actions recorded for public debate and scrutiny. Such ideas have influenced studies of accountability and responsiveness in a variety of settings (Ferraz and Finan 2011). Regulations include direct or general transparency mechanisms, such as registers of interests and Freedom of Information legislation (also known as Access to Information or Right to Information legislation), to more \u2018targeted\u2019 specific instruments such as lobbying transparency rules or technology-led experiments such as Open Data (Fung and Weil 2010). Mechanisms can be based on the principle of pro-active publication (of for example meeting minutes or spending) or reactive response to requests from users. Some transparency regulations combine both these features. In the UK, Freedom of Information (FOI) legislation sits alongside legislation regulating access to meetings, environmental information disclosure and now a broad array of online data published as part of the UK\u2019s Open Data initiative (Cabinet Office 2013). This experiment aims to see if FOI requests can be used to stimulate pro-active publication and whether transparency leads, as supporters hope, to increased transparency or triggers resistance or inertia. We report the plan of an intervention that evaluates the impact of FOI requests on the smallest unit of local democracy in England, the local parish, compared to a \u2018everyday\u2019 non-legal information request and a control. We plan to observe whether an FOI request causes the parish to respond more frequently than a simple (non-legally binding) information request or ask. We use an experimental design to test whether and to what extent local governments are more responsive to an FOI request than to a normal request of information by asking for information via an FOI request and an informal \u2018ask\u2019 . The experiment is conducted on a sample of 4400 parish councils, which will be subject to two measures. The first measure is a request for information for the organizational chart of the parish council and the second is a request for councillors\u2019 expenses. By asking authorities to go \u2018beyond\u2019 what is legally required and publish the information publically, we can also gain some insight into whether FOI can help lead to greater pro-active openness. We will later send a brief questionnaire to participants asking about their views of openness and FOI to gain some qualitative insights into why the experiment worked in the way it did.\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"Hypothesis 1: Local authorities will be more responsive to an FOI request than to a normal request Hypothesis 2: Local authorities will be more responsive to a request for the organizational chart than to the one for councilors\u2019 expenses Hypothesis 3: Local authorities with an FOI publication scheme or with published budgets and minutes or larger in terms of population will be more responsive\""}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "The outcome variable consists of the five ordinal categories shown above.

given the deadly ethnic riots that followed the previous election in December of 2007. Because of the sensitivity of the election, several organizations sent observer delegations. With so many different organizations present, the recommendations and observations made by different organizations diverged considerably. Furthermore, one of the most prominent institutions sending observers, the European Union, did not issue its report until late May of 2013, nearly two months after the election and significantly after the promised date. The conflicting assessments and the delay called into question both the impartiality of election monitors and the utility of their pronouncements. It also caused African officials to publicly doubt the validity of non-African election observers sent to the region (Kelley 2013). This example and many others like it raises the question: what attributes of election monitoring organizations determine whether domestic actors view a given organization as credible or legitimate (Hyde 2012)? This is germane for international organizations more broadly, but it is a particularly relevant question in the context of international election observer organizations, which countries invite with the very goal of validating their own elections\u2019 legitimacy (Kelley 2008, 230, Hyde 2011). If different organizations make different pronouncements after an election, which organizations do citizens believe? Which assessments do journalists report? Who gains authority and why? The question of organizational credibility and legitimacy is particularly interesting in a realm such as election monitoring in which multiple organizations vie for influence in a given election (Kelley 2009). Whether election monitoring organizations are present matters: they can reduce fraud in the polling stations they visit (Hyde 2007). But it also matters which organizations are present, because not all organizations are equally effective (Kelley 2012, Ch. 7). Thus the credibility and perceptions of legitimacy of these organizations matter both for their ability to function and for how citizens and societies weigh their contributions. In this project we examine the sources of credibility for election monitoring organizations, both domestic and international, and for IGOs as well as NGOs. The inclusion of a more varied set of organizations allows us to speak more generally to the sources of credibility and legitimacy, which, at least theoretically, have been posited to have similarities across the international and domestic contexts. The next section discusses the sources of credibility and legitimacy and derives a set of general hypotheses. After that, we explain how we use a global experiment on non-governmental organizations to test the hypotheses. The basic research design discussion includes an explanation of how the hypotheses are operationalized in the context of election monitoring organizations. The last section discusses the analysis plan. Sources of Legitimacy and Credibility Many important thinkers such as Rawls (1971), Franck (1990), and Beetham (1991) have discussed the concept of legitimacy. Drawing on these and others, Hurd refers to legitimacy as \u201crelational between actor and institution, and defined by the actor\u2019s perception of the institution\u201d (1999, 381). Similarly, Tallberg and Z\u00fcrn refer to the legitimacy of IGOs \u201cin the empirical or sociological sense \u2013 [as] actors\u2019 acceptance of an institution\u2019s rule as appropriately exercised\u201d (Tallberg and Z\u00fcrn 2015, 3). Following this, we define an organization\u2019s \u201cperceived legitimacy\u201d as the extent to which state and societal actors perceive its exercise of authority as legitimate. Perceived legitimacy is thus, by definition, in the eye of the beholder. An organization\u2019s actual behavior or \u201cnormative goodness\u201d is only relevant to its perceived legitimacy to the extent that this behavior influences perceptions and beliefs of relevant audiences (Tallberg and Z\u00fcrn 2015, 10). An organization\u2019s perceived legitimacy can therefore vary among different audiences, be they state elites or ordinary citizens. In this study we thus focus on perceived legitimacy defined and measured in terms of the opinions of relevant actors. What are the sources of perceived legitimacy? Drawing on prior literature of explanations for the legitimacy of domestic institutions, Tallberg and Z\u00fcrn specify two sources, procedure and performance. We discuss these below and add discussion of some alternative sources. Procedural Legitimacy First, procedural accounts of legitimacy suggest that people\u2019s perceptions of and beliefs about an organization\u2019s legitimacy spring from process-related criteria. Even when institutions generate outcomes to citizens\u2019 disadvantage, people may still accept the organizations and their decisions as legitimate because of how the institutions were organized and how they operate (Tallberg and Z\u00fcrn 2015, 13). Procedural legitimacy is the foundation of democracy itself (Held 1995). Many people may not like the outcome of an election, but they respect the institution of democracy because of its processes and the norms it embodies, and therefore they respect the outcome and even value it. Procedural legitimacy thus describes the formal processes that organizations undertake as prescribed by their charters, articles of agreement, and other governing texts. Organizations derive authority from written rules and their adherence to them. Institutions are legitimate because of the rules that structure them and the process through which they exercise authority. Procedural qualities that matter are things like transparency, accountability and professional conduct. Independence Legitimacy Organizations may also gain credibility and legitimacy if they behave autonomously from their sponsoring institutions, especially when those sponsoring institutions are aligned with governments who may be the targets of monitoring or policy change. This is especially important in election observation, as regional organizations such as the African Union have been criticized as mechanisms for collusion among African governments bent on incumbency protection. As Hyde (2011) notes, \u201cIn general, observers are more credible when they are more independent from the target of the monitoring, when they do not have motives that can conflict with promoting democracy, and when they are more closely aligned with a variety of democracy promoting donors\u201d (47). Normative Legitimacy The degree to which an organization conforms to established global norms and standards provides an additional potential source of legitimacy. Tallberg and Zurn focus on perceived legitimacy of \u201cexercised authority,\u201d and explicitly differentiate this from what they term normative legitimacy, which refers to an institution\u2019s right to rule \u201cbased on its conformance to principles such as justice, public interest, and democracy (Tallberg and Z\u00fcrn 2015, 4)\u201d But people\u2019s valuation of an organizations normative content is an important possible source of perceptions of its legitimacy. The values and norms of an organization influence the perceptions of the appropriateness of their authority, and therefore it is difficult to disentangle from perceptions of \u201cexercised authority.\u201d As organizational sociologist Suchman notes, legitimacy can be thought of as \u201ca generalized perception or assumption that the action of an entity are desirable, proper, or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions (Suchman 1995, 574).\u201d Thus, it is not so much about the rules and procedures the organization follows as it is about the norms they uphold. The cause of legitimacy, then, is not the degree to which the organization adheres to a prescribed process or produces public goods; rather, the causal power comes from the global norms themselves, and those norms legitimize the organization to the degree that the organization in question embodies or upholds the norms. Normative legitimacy thus expresses the degree to which the aims and purposes of the organization align with broader international norms. Thus, under the logic of normative legitimacy, organizations derive authority from their embodiment and support of important global norms. Heuristic Legitimacy Performance, procedural, and normative legitimacy are ideal types and possible explanations for why citizens may perceive an organization as legitimate. That said, it is important to stress that while these sources of legitimacy likely embody concepts that citizens might stress are what ought to give an organization legitimacy, it is possible that opinions about what ought to matter differ from what actually does matter. In addition to these sources of legitimacy we therefore suggest a fourth source of perceived legitimacy, which we label heuristic legitimacy, because it flows from the application of heuristic devices to assess organizational legitimacy. This notion draws on psychology and behavioral economics, which have shown that people make judgments using many types of heuristic devices. The word heuristic comes from a Greek word that means to \u2018find\u2019 or \u2018discover\u2019 and heuristic strategies are a form of mental shortcuts that use readily accessible, though loosely applicable, information to solve problems (Pearl 1984) in ways that while not guaranteed to be optimal are sufficient for the immediate goals. Using a heuristic device is a form of decisional satisficing (Simon 1955). Such devices are common because ordinary people are rationally ignorant, meaning they choose to be less informed than they could be about particular decisions because it would be suboptimal for them to invest sufficient time on a subject to understand it fully (Downs 1957). Procedural, independence and normative legitimacy are all driven by rational judgments: People make decisions based on outcomes, or processes, or norms they value. This assumes that people have enough information to make these judgments. We contend that whereas procedural, performance and normative legitimacy are ideal forms in a world of full information, often citizens will not know enough to confidently apply these criteria. Instead, they will rely on heuristics. Here we discuss two heuristics that might be particularly relevant. The \u201cprofile heuristic,\u201d means that people perceive organizations as more legitimate when the organization is more prominent or mentally accessible. The \u201cisomorphism heuristic\u201d means that people may perceive organizations as more legitimate when they can identify with them. Neither of these is based on whether organizations follow rules or deliver their mandated outcomes, and both suggest that greater familiarity with an organization may be used as a shortcut to judgments about legitimacy. Profile Legitimacy Profile refers to the degree to which an organization is established or prominent, including how often others reference it. This concept draws on the recognition heuristic, where people assume that objects they recognize more readily are more likely to possess the characteristic they are assessing. Indeed, in multiple experiments people show strong preference for concepts and objects simply because they have been previously exposed to them (Zajonc 1968, Bornstein 1989). In cognitive psychology, the familiarity principle means that people judge events as important if they are more familiar with them, itself an effect related to the availability heuristic, which rests on the idea that if something can be recalled, it must be important (Tversky and Kahneman 1973). All these related types of heuristics suggest that one source of perceived legitimacy might be mere salience or prevalence of an organization. This may not be related to performance at all. Bad publicity for political candidates may be good for votes, or bad press may be good for business (Berger, Sorensen, and Rasmussen 2010). Organizations that are criticized, for example like the World Health Organization (WHO) for its handling of Ebola outbreaks, might become increasingly perceived as legitimate because more people become familiar with it. Isomorphic Legitimacy Isomorphism is the quality of being of identical or similar in form, shape, or structure. We define this as the tendency to place greater legitimacy in organizations with which a person can identify easily, either due to geographic, cultural, or linguistic affinity. It could be thought of as a manifestation of in-group bias (Brewer 1979), or social identity that lead to \u201csupport for institutions that embody the identity (Ashforth and Mael 1989, 20), which can be expressed in the evaluation of others. Isomorphic accounts of legitimacy may lead actors to be more likely to consider organizations legitimate if they know of them or can relate to them because of similarities to themselves. Coupled with this may be a sense that more regional or local actors are more legitimate because they are more likely to embody indigenous cultures and beliefs. This is akin to the finding that citizens trust in government increases from the federal to the state to the local level (Nye 1997, 1) and the associated efforts at devolution of governance (Hetherington and Nugent 2001, Jennings 1998). Moreover, actors may resist perceived \u201cmeddlers\u201d who, simply by virtue of being foreign or external, are seen as imposing their preferences or norms on local societies. Non-indigenous organizations may also be seen as undermining sovereignty. Certainly in Africa such perceptions have arisen vis-\u00e0-vis the International Criminal Court (Cole 2013). Thus, isomorphism may be a stronger factor in countries with a history of colonialism or external meddling, or in countries that have not been major architects of the global governance regime. If perceived legitimacy has heuristic sources, this would add to our understanding of the attributes that influence perceived legitimacy and suggest that among residents of a given country, organizations that are culturally and geographically more proximate, or those with greater prevalence, may enjoy greater perceived legitimacy, irrespective of behavior."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Legitimacy Hypotheses.

Thus, even though this outcome measure is embedded within what is a survey instrument, it is similar to behavioral outcomes in other studies like signing a petition or sending a postcard. After receiving an email addressed to the NGO, subjects (NGOs) that choose to participate will click on a link to a Qualtrics instrument that will guide them through the survey experiment, which will randomly assign different primes regarding election-monitoring attributes to each participating NGO. The primes will be associated at random with 7 different election observation organizations. Subject NGOs will be able to use the Qualtrics instruments to express support for inviting the election observation organizations one-by-one on a sliding scale from -5 to +5. After the NGO subjects recommend the organizations one-by-one, they will be shown all seven organizations in a list along with summary statements of the priming conditions and asked to assign 100 votes across the 7 organizations. This should enable us to acquire a more nuanced set of revealed preferences for the various organizations potentially affected by the randomly assigned primes. It should be noted that this research design is not optimal for testing the heuristic hypotheses. Heuristics are assumed to operate most strongly in the absence of information, but in this case we are actually providing subjects with information about election monitors, so this may dampen or replace any real-world tendency to rely on heuristics. Furthermore, some heuristic conditions, such as level of exposure to an organization (profile) cannot easily be simulated in our design. Telling people that an organization is prominent is not necessarily equivalent to those people having been highly exposed to it in actuality). That said, if the heuristic hypotheses are supported by significant results in this experiment, this should be persuasive. Before discussing the experiment and the analysis plan in greater depth, we first discuss the treatment primes. Experimental Conditions For each respondent, each of eight election observer groups will be randomly assigned one prime that frames a characteristic corresponding to the theorized sources of organizations\u2019 perceived legitimacy outlined above. For each of the following hypotheses and corresponding treatments, the subject will be asked: \u201cPlease move the slider bar into the position that best represents your desire to support or oppose the above-mentioned election observing organization to observe the next election in your country. A score of 5 represents that you strongly support this organization; a score of -5 indicates that you strongly oppose the organization.\u201d Two of the seven statements will be placebo or control as follows: Control 1 \u201cOrganization X actively observes elections. It is an election observing organization that sends a team of observers to report on the general conduct of national elections in different countries.\u201d Control 2 \"Organization X regularly undertakes election observation missions. Through the election period in various countries, trained observers follow up on developments at polling stations and monitor the vote count.\" The next section discusses each of the hypotheses and associated treatment language. H1. Independence Legitimacy Monitors are mandated to render quality assessments by being honest and independent in their assessment (Hyde 2012) and offering constructive suggestions for improvements in the electoral processes, both before and after the elections. That is, monitors may even visit countries before an election and offer recommendations as to how the election is organized. We therefore operationalize performance legitimacy with the following primes. The Independence Treatment focuses on observation organizations\u2019 ability to deliver an independent assessment. All of the organizations used in the experiment endorse the United Nations Declaration of Principles on International Election Observation from which the quoted language is drawn. Independence Treatment \u201cOrganization X seeks to be independent in election observation. It professes \u2018to conduct an impartial and professional analysis of ... information; and to draw conclusions about the character of electoral processes based on the highest standards for accuracy of information and impartiality of analysis.\u2019\u201d H2. Procedural Legitimacy The Procedural Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they operate transparently and consistent with established rules. In the case of election monitoring organizations, procedural legitimacy will be higher for organizations that follow clear rules of election observation as set by international standard and that produce accessible and thorough assessments (Hyde 2012). Such rules would include only observing elections conditional on an invitation from a state, having systematic and transparent ways of recording data, issuing timely reports, and never interfering with the conduct of the election. We therefore operationalize procedural legitimacy with the following prime, again with quoted language drawn from the United Nations Declaration of Principles on International Election Observation: Procedural Treatment \u201cOrganization X emphasizes proper procedures. It professes to follow \u2018systematic, comprehensive and accurate gathering of information concerning the laws, processes and institutions related to the conduct of elections and other factors concerning the overall electoral environment.\u2019\u201d H3: Normative Legitimacy The Normative Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they subscribe to universally accepted values. For election monitoring organizations, normative legitimacy is about the electoral and democratic norms the observers represent and the extent to which people perceive these as converging with international norms. We therefore operationalize procedural legitimacy with the following prime: Normative Treatment \u201cOrganization X seeks to uphold norms of democracy. It is committed to the idea that the will of the people of a country is the basis for the authority of government, and that will must be determined through genuine periodic elections.\u201d H4. Profile Legitimacy The Profile Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they are prevalent, if they hear more about them, or if they learn that others consider them as opinion leaders. In the case of election monitoring, people may perceive an organization as more legitimate it is very visible or active or has a long history of operating within a country, or if it is well known for example as evidenced by often being referenced by other organizations, the media, and governments whom citizens may consider appropriate opinion leaders. Name recognition itself may be valuable, even if the organization is known for things other than election monitoring. We therefore operationalize prevalence legitimacy with the following primes. Profile Treatment \u201cOrganization X is well known. It is one of the most widely recognized election observation organizations based on coverage by international media and attention on the internet.\u201d H5. Isomorphic Legitimacy The Isomorphism Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they invoke identification based on geography, language or culture. For international election monitoring, this means that people are more likely to perceived organizations as legitimate if they are more local or indigenous. Regional organizations may therefore be seen as more legitimate than global, or western, ones. An example of this occurred when, in March 2013, former Nigeria president, Olusegun Obasanjo gave a keynote address at the 7th Annual symposium of the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA) in Johannesburg, and argued that \u201cnon-African election observer missions should be banned from monitoring polls in the continent,\u201d because they \u201cwere sometimes biased and that their position sometimes seemed to undermine the sovereignty of African countries.\u201d We therefore operationalize Isomorphic Legitimacy with the following primes for regional compard to global organizations: Isomorphism treatments Regional \u201cOrganization X is headquartered in [regional capital] and operates in [region]. Global \u201cOrganization X is headquartered in [foreign capital] and operates globally. Outcomes of Interest The Qualtrics platform will prompt subject NGOs to provide two different types of recommended invitations to the election monitors: 1. NGO level of support, -5 to 5 -point scale from least to most favored for an invitation to observe the NGOs\u2019 home countries\u2019 next elections. The order in which the organizations are presented will be randomized along with the priming statement for each of the factors that we hypothesize will drive legitimacy perceptions. 2. NGO 100-Point Voting. After the initial questions about endorsements based on randomly assigned priming states, subjects will be shown the list of the organizations along with summaries of the priming statements in random order and be invited to assign a number of votes summing to 100 to each of the organizations. Subjects will see the following statement: \u201cCommunicating Your Voice We are interested in your organization\u2019s opinion about which international election observation groups should be invited to observe the next national elections in your country. Below you will find a list of seven different election observation groups that could potentially be invited to observe the next elections along with brief information about each group. In order to communicate how strongly you feel about which organizations should be invited, you are given 100 \u201cvotes\u201d to cast across the seven groups. More votes mean that you feel more strongly that the group should be invited. The 100 votes may be cast in any way you choose across the organizations listed. You can give all your votes to one organization or give some votes to several organizations. It is okay for some organizations to receive no votes. The rankings will enable us to convey which organizations you think should be invited and to provide more detailed information about the strength of your opinions to the election observation organizations.\u201d It is important to note here that the relative level of endorsement received by each of the election monitoring organizations compared to the others will not affect the results in expectation. Each organization serves as its own control, and the treatment effects should thus reflect the relative causal influence of each of the priming statements on NGO support for each organization compared to the placebo statements. We included two placebo conditions to help improve statistical power given the multiple comparisons planned. We will randomly assign the five treatment statements plus two placebos such that each subject sees one of the seven statements associated with each of the seven organizations on the list, one-by-one. In the guided Qualtrics survey instrument, subjects will first be invited to rate the specific organization on the -5 to 5-point scale. Next, subjects will then be shown all seven organizations along with the prompts and asked to distribute the 100 votes. Note that we will not be manipulating the attributes of the organizations per se, since those features are in a real sense already set. But we will be manipulating primes or salient information about the features by providing different prompts. The priming effects, while potentially different from the actual underlying sources of legitimacy and credibility, should nevertheless still be consistent with the theory of legitimacy that we have augmented above. This should give us a relative ranking of treatment effects of information regarding the posited sources of legitimacy. The level of endorsement may give us some separation across the treatments and placebo, but the 100-point voting for the election observer organizations should be an even more sensitive measure that ought to capture relative legitimacy of each election observer organization and, on average, the effects the treatments have on the relative rankings. For example, if the independence statement induces more public endorsement and a higher ranking for the EU compared to the placebo, then we might conclude that information about independence in some sense causes improved legitimacy or credibility. Subject Pool The experiment will be performed on more than 14,000 NGOs involved in international development drawn from the Directory of Development Organizations. Many NGOs will choose not to participate in the study \u2013 indeed, our prior experiments with subjects from this database suggest that the base rate expected for the response proportion will be relatively low (roughly five percent). Nevertheless, since each subject will be making 7 endorsements each and also completing the 100-point voting for each organization, we should have sufficient power to detect meaningful treatment effects. The selected international observers organizations for NGOs in each global region are listed below and their assignments are indicated in the table. These organizations were selected to obtain a set of realistic actors that spanned a variety of regional and global origins and that might plausibly observe elections in given countries given their regional affiliation. Organizations: Carter: The Carter Center NDI: National Democratic Institute IRI: International Republican Institute DI: Democracy International IEMI: International Election Monitors Institute EU: European Union OAS: Organization of American States CARICOM: Caribbean Community and Common Market PIANZEA: Pacific Islands, Australia and New Zealand Electoral Administrators Network ANFREL: Asian Network for Free Elections OSCE: Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe CoE: Council of Europe AU: African Union \u2003 Region 1st Grp 2nd Grp 3rd Grp 4th Grp 5th Grp 6th Grp 7th Grp Americas Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU OAS Caribbean Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU CARICOM Oceania Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU PIANZEA Asia Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU ANFREL Europe EU Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI OSCE CoE Non-EU Europe & Central Asia Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU OSCE Africa Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU AU Randomization Scheme Since each organization will be its own control in that the given NGO (respondent) sees all conditions in the experiment, we should not need to block randomize. Power Analysis Power analysis was conducted assuming a power of .8 and a significance level of .05. Assuming a mean of .3 on the outcome measures rescaled from 0 to 1, with an average cluster size of 7 (for each condition seen by each subject) and the number of clusters per arm of 444 (our best estimate of the number of respondents), the minimum detectable difference is projected to be .03. This suggest adequate power. Data Analysis Plan The core analysis for the randomization of priming statements across the seven observer organizations will be performed using difference-in-means tests comparing treatment priming statements to the control statements across each dependent variable, as listed in Table X. The analysis will focus on how each priming statement influenced the 11-point scales (-5 to 5) and the 100-point voting. \u2003 Analysis Plan Summary Test Outcome Measure/ Dependent Variable Treatment (vs. Control Condition) 1 Difference of means 11 point endorsement scale Independence Core test of H1 2 Difference of means 11 point endorsement scale Procedure Core test of H2 3 Difference of means 11 point endorsement scale Norms Core test of H3 4 Difference of means 11 point endorsement scale Profile Core test of H4 5 Difference of means 11 point endorsement scale Isomorphism Core test of H5 6 OLS 11 point endorsement scale All 5 treatment conditions with control condition as residual category Alternative test of H1-5 7 OLS with NGO-level covariates 11 point endorsement scale All seven treatment conditions with control condition as residual category Alternative test of H1-5 7-14 1-7 will also be run separately for each of the 5 priming treatments compared to control for the 100-point voting measure Each of the 5 treatment conditions compared with control.

Ordinary least squares regression with covariates will be used for analysis of treatment effects on the 11-point scale endorsements and the 100-point voting measure. In regression analysis, standard errors will be clustered by subject, which is prescribed as best practice in a within-subjects\u2019 design. \u2003"}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Global"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "14,700"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q30": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q32": {"extra": [], "value": "D72, C93"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Field Experiments"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Elections"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e31e2964b2010000b20f43f", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/gp9wa/providers/osfstorage/5e31e2964b2010000b20f43f", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/gp9wa/providers/osfstorage/5e31e2964b2010000b20f43f", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/gp9wa/providers/osfstorage/5e31e2964b2010000b20f43f?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/gp9wa/providers/osfstorage/5e31e2964b2010000b20f43f"}, "attributes": {"etag": "c17121af79fb0d0618e9392cbec7a7259b028feb0f943379116f9ae6b89ce690", "kind": "file", "name": "20151112AB_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e31e2964b2010000b20f43f", "size": 235855, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "aa31aa89aa10ca18b17f0174e305916b", "sha256": "b588ba7f00425ad0885f94c555ffb23d56f9f366bd9846343d4c7dd244c512ab"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 235855, "modified": "2020-01-29T19:52:54.373806+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "gp9wa", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20151112AB_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-01-29T19:52:54+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "gp9wa", "sha256": "b588ba7f00425ad0885f94c555ffb23d56f9f366bd9846343d4c7dd244c512ab", "viewUrl": "/project/wsbpa/files/osfstorage/5e31e29a4b2010001620f6d7/", "selectedFileName": "20151112AB_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20151112AB_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": {}, "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "The Sources of Credibility for Election Observation Organizations: A Global Experiment on Non-Governmental Organizations", "q2": "Daniel Nielson | Susan Hyde | Judith Kelley", "q3": "20151112AB", "q4": "11/12/2015 - 21:05", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to any research activities", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "11/12/15", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "The March 2013 Kenyan election was anticipated with a great degree of anxiety given the deadly ethnic riots that followed the previous election in December of 2007. Because of the sensitivity of the election, several organizations sent observer delegations. With so many different organizations present, the recommendations and observations made by different organizations diverged considerably. Furthermore, one of the most prominent institutions sending observers, the European Union, did not issue its report until late May of 2013, nearly two months after the election and significantly after the promised date. The conflicting assessments and the delay called into question both the impartiality of election monitors and the utility of their pronouncements. It also caused African officials to publicly doubt the validity of non-African election observers sent to the region (Kelley 2013). This example and many others like it raises the question: what attributes of election monitoring organizations determine whether domestic actors view a given organization as credible or legitimate (Hyde 2012)? This is germane for international organizations more broadly, but it is a particularly relevant question in the context of international election observer organizations, which countries invite with the very goal of validating their own elections\u2019 legitimacy (Kelley 2008, 230, Hyde 2011). If different organizations make different pronouncements after an election, which organizations do citizens believe? Which assessments do journalists report? Who gains authority and why? The question of organizational credibility and legitimacy is particularly interesting in a realm such as election monitoring in which multiple organizations vie for influence in a given election (Kelley 2009). Whether election monitoring organizations are present matters: they can reduce fraud in the polling stations they visit (Hyde 2007). But it also matters which organizations are present, because not all organizations are equally effective (Kelley 2012, Ch. 7). Thus the credibility and perceptions of legitimacy of these organizations matter both for their ability to function and for how citizens and societies weigh their contributions. In this project we examine the sources of credibility for election monitoring organizations, both domestic and international, and for IGOs as well as NGOs. The inclusion of a more varied set of organizations allows us to speak more generally to the sources of credibility and legitimacy, which, at least theoretically, have been posited to have similarities across the international and domestic contexts. The next section discusses the sources of credibility and legitimacy and derives a set of general hypotheses. After that, we explain how we use a global experiment on non-governmental organizations to test the hypotheses. The basic research design discussion includes an explanation of how the hypotheses are operationalized in the context of election monitoring organizations. The last section discusses the analysis plan. Sources of Legitimacy and Credibility Many important thinkers such as Rawls (1971), Franck (1990), and Beetham (1991) have discussed the concept of legitimacy. Drawing on these and others, Hurd refers to legitimacy as \u201crelational between actor and institution, and defined by the actor\u2019s perception of the institution\u201d (1999, 381). Similarly, Tallberg and Z\u00fcrn refer to the legitimacy of IGOs \u201cin the empirical or sociological sense \u2013 [as] actors\u2019 acceptance of an institution\u2019s rule as appropriately exercised\u201d (Tallberg and Z\u00fcrn 2015, 3). Following this, we define an organization\u2019s \u201cperceived legitimacy\u201d as the extent to which state and societal actors perceive its exercise of authority as legitimate. Perceived legitimacy is thus, by definition, in the eye of the beholder. An organization\u2019s actual behavior or \u201cnormative goodness\u201d is only relevant to its perceived legitimacy to the extent that this behavior influences perceptions and beliefs of relevant audiences (Tallberg and Z\u00fcrn 2015, 10). An organization\u2019s perceived legitimacy can therefore vary among different audiences, be they state elites or ordinary citizens. In this study we thus focus on perceived legitimacy defined and measured in terms of the opinions of relevant actors. What are the sources of perceived legitimacy? Drawing on prior literature of explanations for the legitimacy of domestic institutions, Tallberg and Z\u00fcrn specify two sources, procedure and performance. We discuss these below and add discussion of some alternative sources. Procedural Legitimacy First, procedural accounts of legitimacy suggest that people\u2019s perceptions of and beliefs about an organization\u2019s legitimacy spring from process-related criteria. Even when institutions generate outcomes to citizens\u2019 disadvantage, people may still accept the organizations and their decisions as legitimate because of how the institutions were organized and how they operate (Tallberg and Z\u00fcrn 2015, 13). Procedural legitimacy is the foundation of democracy itself (Held 1995). Many people may not like the outcome of an election, but they respect the institution of democracy because of its processes and the norms it embodies, and therefore they respect the outcome and even value it. Procedural legitimacy thus describes the formal processes that organizations undertake as prescribed by their charters, articles of agreement, and other governing texts. Organizations derive authority from written rules and their adherence to them. Institutions are legitimate because of the rules that structure them and the process through which they exercise authority. Procedural qualities that matter are things like transparency, accountability and professional conduct. Independence Legitimacy Organizations may also gain credibility and legitimacy if they behave autonomously from their sponsoring institutions, especially when those sponsoring institutions are aligned with governments who may be the targets of monitoring or policy change. This is especially important in election observation, as regional organizations such as the African Union have been criticized as mechanisms for collusion among African governments bent on incumbency protection. As Hyde (2011) notes, \u201cIn general, observers are more credible when they are more independent from the target of the monitoring, when they do not have motives that can conflict with promoting democracy, and when they are more closely aligned with a variety of democracy promoting donors\u201d (47). Normative Legitimacy The degree to which an organization conforms to established global norms and standards provides an additional potential source of legitimacy. Tallberg and Zurn focus on perceived legitimacy of \u201cexercised authority,\u201d and explicitly differentiate this from what they term normative legitimacy, which refers to an institution\u2019s right to rule \u201cbased on its conformance to principles such as justice, public interest, and democracy (Tallberg and Z\u00fcrn 2015, 4)\u201d But people\u2019s valuation of an organizations normative content is an important possible source of perceptions of its legitimacy. The values and norms of an organization influence the perceptions of the appropriateness of their authority, and therefore it is difficult to disentangle from perceptions of \u201cexercised authority.\u201d As organizational sociologist Suchman notes, legitimacy can be thought of as \u201ca generalized perception or assumption that the action of an entity are desirable, proper, or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions (Suchman 1995, 574).\u201d Thus, it is not so much about the rules and procedures the organization follows as it is about the norms they uphold. The cause of legitimacy, then, is not the degree to which the organization adheres to a prescribed process or produces public goods; rather, the causal power comes from the global norms themselves, and those norms legitimize the organization to the degree that the organization in question embodies or upholds the norms. Normative legitimacy thus expresses the degree to which the aims and purposes of the organization align with broader international norms. Thus, under the logic of normative legitimacy, organizations derive authority from their embodiment and support of important global norms. Heuristic Legitimacy Performance, procedural, and normative legitimacy are ideal types and possible explanations for why citizens may perceive an organization as legitimate. That said, it is important to stress that while these sources of legitimacy likely embody concepts that citizens might stress are what ought to give an organization legitimacy, it is possible that opinions about what ought to matter differ from what actually does matter. In addition to these sources of legitimacy we therefore suggest a fourth source of perceived legitimacy, which we label heuristic legitimacy, because it flows from the application of heuristic devices to assess organizational legitimacy. This notion draws on psychology and behavioral economics, which have shown that people make judgments using many types of heuristic devices. The word heuristic comes from a Greek word that means to \u2018find\u2019 or \u2018discover\u2019 and heuristic strategies are a form of mental shortcuts that use readily accessible, though loosely applicable, information to solve problems (Pearl 1984) in ways that while not guaranteed to be optimal are sufficient for the immediate goals. Using a heuristic device is a form of decisional satisficing (Simon 1955). Such devices are common because ordinary people are rationally ignorant, meaning they choose to be less informed than they could be about particular decisions because it would be suboptimal for them to invest sufficient time on a subject to understand it fully (Downs 1957). Procedural, independence and normative legitimacy are all driven by rational judgments: People make decisions based on outcomes, or processes, or norms they value. This assumes that people have enough information to make these judgments. We contend that whereas procedural, performance and normative legitimacy are ideal forms in a world of full information, often citizens will not know enough to confidently apply these criteria. Instead, they will rely on heuristics. Here we discuss two heuristics that might be particularly relevant. The \u201cprofile heuristic,\u201d means that people perceive organizations as more legitimate when the organization is more prominent or mentally accessible. The \u201cisomorphism heuristic\u201d means that people may perceive organizations as more legitimate when they can identify with them. Neither of these is based on whether organizations follow rules or deliver their mandated outcomes, and both suggest that greater familiarity with an organization may be used as a shortcut to judgments about legitimacy. Profile Legitimacy Profile refers to the degree to which an organization is established or prominent, including how often others reference it. This concept draws on the recognition heuristic, where people assume that objects they recognize more readily are more likely to possess the characteristic they are assessing. Indeed, in multiple experiments people show strong preference for concepts and objects simply because they have been previously exposed to them (Zajonc 1968, Bornstein 1989). In cognitive psychology, the familiarity principle means that people judge events as important if they are more familiar with them, itself an effect related to the availability heuristic, which rests on the idea that if something can be recalled, it must be important (Tversky and Kahneman 1973). All these related types of heuristics suggest that one source of perceived legitimacy might be mere salience or prevalence of an organization. This may not be related to performance at all. Bad publicity for political candidates may be good for votes, or bad press may be good for business (Berger, Sorensen, and Rasmussen 2010). Organizations that are criticized, for example like the World Health Organization (WHO) for its handling of Ebola outbreaks, might become increasingly perceived as legitimate because more people become familiar with it. Isomorphic Legitimacy Isomorphism is the quality of being of identical or similar in form, shape, or structure. We define this as the tendency to place greater legitimacy in organizations with which a person can identify easily, either due to geographic, cultural, or linguistic affinity. It could be thought of as a manifestation of in-group bias (Brewer 1979), or social identity that lead to \u201csupport for institutions that embody the identity (Ashforth and Mael 1989, 20), which can be expressed in the evaluation of others. Isomorphic accounts of legitimacy may lead actors to be more likely to consider organizations legitimate if they know of them or can relate to them because of similarities to themselves. Coupled with this may be a sense that more regional or local actors are more legitimate because they are more likely to embody indigenous cultures and beliefs. This is akin to the finding that citizens trust in government increases from the federal to the state to the local level (Nye 1997, 1) and the associated efforts at devolution of governance (Hetherington and Nugent 2001, Jennings 1998). Moreover, actors may resist perceived \u201cmeddlers\u201d who, simply by virtue of being foreign or external, are seen as imposing their preferences or norms on local societies. Non-indigenous organizations may also be seen as undermining sovereignty. Certainly in Africa such perceptions have arisen vis-\u00e0-vis the International Criminal Court (Cole 2013). Thus, isomorphism may be a stronger factor in countries with a history of colonialism or external meddling, or in countries that have not been major architects of the global governance regime. If perceived legitimacy has heuristic sources, this would add to our understanding of the attributes that influence perceived legitimacy and suggest that among residents of a given country, organizations that are culturally and geographically more proximate, or those with greater prevalence, may enjoy greater perceived legitimacy, irrespective of behavior.", "q16": "Legitimacy Hypotheses. Compared to baseline, actors perceive organizations as more legitimate and credible if they: H1: Procedural Operate transparently, consistent with established rules H2: Independence Act autonomously and independently from sponsoring organizations or target countries H3: Normative Subscribe to universally accepted values H4: Profile Are recognized broadly in media and on the internet H5: Isomorphic Invoke identification based on geography, language or culture", "q17": "In order to test the effects of information about different organizational attributes on perceived legitimacy, we will conduct a survey experiment with behavioral outcomes in assessing the perceived credibility and legitimacy of prominent international election monitoring organizations. We will send emails to some 14,000 NGOs globally encouraging them to vote in favor of inviting different international governmental organizations (IGOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) involved in election observation to observe the next election in the NGOs\u2019 (respondents\u2019) home countries. We will inform the NGOs that their votes in favor of inviting specific groups will be shared with the election observation organizations so that they can make their decisions on which elections to observe next with fuller information from civil society groups. Thus, even though this outcome measure is embedded within what is a survey instrument, it is similar to behavioral outcomes in other studies like signing a petition or sending a postcard. After receiving an email addressed to the NGO, subjects (NGOs) that choose to participate will click on a link to a Qualtrics instrument that will guide them through the survey experiment, which will randomly assign different primes regarding election-monitoring attributes to each participating NGO. The primes will be associated at random with 7 different election observation organizations. Subject NGOs will be able to use the Qualtrics instruments to express support for inviting the election observation organizations one-by-one on a sliding scale from -5 to +5. After the NGO subjects recommend the organizations one-by-one, they will be shown all seven organizations in a list along with summary statements of the priming conditions and asked to assign 100 votes across the 7 organizations. This should enable us to acquire a more nuanced set of revealed preferences for the various organizations potentially affected by the randomly assigned primes. It should be noted that this research design is not optimal for testing the heuristic hypotheses. Heuristics are assumed to operate most strongly in the absence of information, but in this case we are actually providing subjects with information about election monitors, so this may dampen or replace any real-world tendency to rely on heuristics. Furthermore, some heuristic conditions, such as level of exposure to an organization (profile) cannot easily be simulated in our design. Telling people that an organization is prominent is not necessarily equivalent to those people having been highly exposed to it in actuality). That said, if the heuristic hypotheses are supported by significant results in this experiment, this should be persuasive. Before discussing the experiment and the analysis plan in greater depth, we first discuss the treatment primes. Experimental Conditions For each respondent, each of eight election observer groups will be randomly assigned one prime that frames a characteristic corresponding to the theorized sources of organizations\u2019 perceived legitimacy outlined above. For each of the following hypotheses and corresponding treatments, the subject will be asked: \u201cPlease move the slider bar into the position that best represents your desire to support or oppose the above-mentioned election observing organization to observe the next election in your country. A score of 5 represents that you strongly support this organization; a score of -5 indicates that you strongly oppose the organization.\u201d Two of the seven statements will be placebo or control as follows: Control 1 \u201cOrganization X actively observes elections. It is an election observing organization that sends a team of observers to report on the general conduct of national elections in different countries.\u201d Control 2 \"Organization X regularly undertakes election observation missions. Through the election period in various countries, trained observers follow up on developments at polling stations and monitor the vote count.\" The next section discusses each of the hypotheses and associated treatment language. H1. Independence Legitimacy Monitors are mandated to render quality assessments by being honest and independent in their assessment (Hyde 2012) and offering constructive suggestions for improvements in the electoral processes, both before and after the elections. That is, monitors may even visit countries before an election and offer recommendations as to how the election is organized. We therefore operationalize performance legitimacy with the following primes. The Independence Treatment focuses on observation organizations\u2019 ability to deliver an independent assessment. All of the organizations used in the experiment endorse the United Nations Declaration of Principles on International Election Observation from which the quoted language is drawn. Independence Treatment \u201cOrganization X seeks to be independent in election observation. It professes \u2018to conduct an impartial and professional analysis of ... information; and to draw conclusions about the character of electoral processes based on the highest standards for accuracy of information and impartiality of analysis.\u2019\u201d H2. Procedural Legitimacy The Procedural Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they operate transparently and consistent with established rules. In the case of election monitoring organizations, procedural legitimacy will be higher for organizations that follow clear rules of election observation as set by international standard and that produce accessible and thorough assessments (Hyde 2012). Such rules would include only observing elections conditional on an invitation from a state, having systematic and transparent ways of recording data, issuing timely reports, and never interfering with the conduct of the election. We therefore operationalize procedural legitimacy with the following prime, again with quoted language drawn from the United Nations Declaration of Principles on International Election Observation: Procedural Treatment \u201cOrganization X emphasizes proper procedures. It professes to follow \u2018systematic, comprehensive and accurate gathering of information concerning the laws, processes and institutions related to the conduct of elections and other factors concerning the overall electoral environment.\u2019\u201d H3: Normative Legitimacy The Normative Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they subscribe to universally accepted values. For election monitoring organizations, normative legitimacy is about the electoral and democratic norms the observers represent and the extent to which people perceive these as converging with international norms. We therefore operationalize procedural legitimacy with the following prime: Normative Treatment \u201cOrganization X seeks to uphold norms of democracy. It is committed to the idea that the will of the people of a country is the basis for the authority of government, and that will must be determined through genuine periodic elections.\u201d H4. Profile Legitimacy The Profile Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they are prevalent, if they hear more about them, or if they learn that others consider them as opinion leaders. In the case of election monitoring, people may perceive an organization as more legitimate it is very visible or active or has a long history of operating within a country, or if it is well known for example as evidenced by often being referenced by other organizations, the media, and governments whom citizens may consider appropriate opinion leaders. Name recognition itself may be valuable, even if the organization is known for things other than election monitoring. We therefore operationalize prevalence legitimacy with the following primes. Profile Treatment \u201cOrganization X is well known. It is one of the most widely recognized election observation organizations based on coverage by international media and attention on the internet.\u201d H5. Isomorphic Legitimacy The Isomorphism Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they invoke identification based on geography, language or culture. For international election monitoring, this means that people are more likely to perceived organizations as legitimate if they are more local or indigenous. Regional organizations may therefore be seen as more legitimate than global, or western, ones. An example of this occurred when, in March 2013, former Nigeria president, Olusegun Obasanjo gave a keynote address at the 7th Annual symposium of the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA) in Johannesburg, and argued that \u201cnon-African election observer missions should be banned from monitoring polls in the continent,\u201d because they \u201cwere sometimes biased and that their position sometimes seemed to undermine the sovereignty of African countries.\u201d We therefore operationalize Isomorphic Legitimacy with the following primes for regional compard to global organizations: Isomorphism treatments Regional \u201cOrganization X is headquartered in [regional capital] and operates in [region]. Global \u201cOrganization X is headquartered in [foreign capital] and operates globally. Outcomes of Interest The Qualtrics platform will prompt subject NGOs to provide two different types of recommended invitations to the election monitors: 1. NGO level of support, -5 to 5 -point scale from least to most favored for an invitation to observe the NGOs\u2019 home countries\u2019 next elections. The order in which the organizations are presented will be randomized along with the priming statement for each of the factors that we hypothesize will drive legitimacy perceptions. 2. NGO 100-Point Voting. After the initial questions about endorsements based on randomly assigned priming states, subjects will be shown the list of the organizations along with summaries of the priming statements in random order and be invited to assign a number of votes summing to 100 to each of the organizations. Subjects will see the following statement: \u201cCommunicating Your Voice We are interested in your organization\u2019s opinion about which international election observation groups should be invited to observe the next national elections in your country. Below you will find a list of seven different election observation groups that could potentially be invited to observe the next elections along with brief information about each group. In order to communicate how strongly you feel about which organizations should be invited, you are given 100 \u201cvotes\u201d to cast across the seven groups. More votes mean that you feel more strongly that the group should be invited. The 100 votes may be cast in any way you choose across the organizations listed. You can give all your votes to one organization or give some votes to several organizations. It is okay for some organizations to receive no votes. The rankings will enable us to convey which organizations you think should be invited and to provide more detailed information about the strength of your opinions to the election observation organizations.\u201d It is important to note here that the relative level of endorsement received by each of the election monitoring organizations compared to the others will not affect the results in expectation. Each organization serves as its own control, and the treatment effects should thus reflect the relative causal influence of each of the priming statements on NGO support for each organization compared to the placebo statements. We included two placebo conditions to help improve statistical power given the multiple comparisons planned. We will randomly assign the five treatment statements plus two placebos such that each subject sees one of the seven statements associated with each of the seven organizations on the list, one-by-one. In the guided Qualtrics survey instrument, subjects will first be invited to rate the specific organization on the -5 to 5-point scale. Next, subjects will then be shown all seven organizations along with the prompts and asked to distribute the 100 votes. Note that we will not be manipulating the attributes of the organizations per se, since those features are in a real sense already set. But we will be manipulating primes or salient information about the features by providing different prompts. The priming effects, while potentially different from the actual underlying sources of legitimacy and credibility, should nevertheless still be consistent with the theory of legitimacy that we have augmented above. This should give us a relative ranking of treatment effects of information regarding the posited sources of legitimacy. The level of endorsement may give us some separation across the treatments and placebo, but the 100-point voting for the election observer organizations should be an even more sensitive measure that ought to capture relative legitimacy of each election observer organization and, on average, the effects the treatments have on the relative rankings. For example, if the independence statement induces more public endorsement and a higher ranking for the EU compared to the placebo, then we might conclude that information about independence in some sense causes improved legitimacy or credibility. Subject Pool The experiment will be performed on more than 14,000 NGOs involved in international development drawn from the Directory of Development Organizations. Many NGOs will choose not to participate in the study \u2013 indeed, our prior experiments with subjects from this database suggest that the base rate expected for the response proportion will be relatively low (roughly five percent). Nevertheless, since each subject will be making 7 endorsements each and also completing the 100-point voting for each organization, we should have sufficient power to detect meaningful treatment effects. The selected international observers organizations for NGOs in each global region are listed below and their assignments are indicated in the table. These organizations were selected to obtain a set of realistic actors that spanned a variety of regional and global origins and that might plausibly observe elections in given countries given their regional affiliation. Organizations: Carter: The Carter Center NDI: National Democratic Institute IRI: International Republican Institute DI: Democracy International IEMI: International Election Monitors Institute EU: European Union OAS: Organization of American States CARICOM: Caribbean Community and Common Market PIANZEA: Pacific Islands, Australia and New Zealand Electoral Administrators Network ANFREL: Asian Network for Free Elections OSCE: Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe CoE: Council of Europe AU: African Union \u2003 Region 1st Grp 2nd Grp 3rd Grp 4th Grp 5th Grp 6th Grp 7th Grp Americas Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU OAS Caribbean Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU CARICOM Oceania Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU PIANZEA Asia Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU ANFREL Europe EU Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI OSCE CoE Non-EU Europe & Central Asia Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU OSCE Africa Carter NDI IRI DI IEMI EU AU Randomization Scheme Since each organization will be its own control in that the given NGO (respondent) sees all conditions in the experiment, we should not need to block randomize. Power Analysis Power analysis was conducted assuming a power of .8 and a significance level of .05. Assuming a mean of .3 on the outcome measures rescaled from 0 to 1, with an average cluster size of 7 (for each condition seen by each subject) and the number of clusters per arm of 444 (our best estimate of the number of respondents), the minimum detectable difference is projected to be .03. This suggest adequate power. Data Analysis Plan The core analysis for the randomization of priming statements across the seven observer organizations will be performed using difference-in-means tests comparing treatment priming statements to the control statements across each dependent variable, as listed in Table X. The analysis will focus on how each priming statement influenced the 11-point scales (-5 to 5) and the 100-point voting. \u2003 Analysis Plan Summary Test Outcome Measure/ Dependent Variable Treatment (vs. Control Condition) 1 Difference of means 11 point endorsement scale Independence Core test of H1 2 Difference of means 11 point endorsement scale Procedure Core test of H2 3 Difference of means 11 point endorsement scale Norms Core test of H3 4 Difference of means 11 point endorsement scale Profile Core test of H4 5 Difference of means 11 point endorsement scale Isomorphism Core test of H5 6 OLS 11 point endorsement scale All 5 treatment conditions with control condition as residual category Alternative test of H1-5 7 OLS with NGO-level covariates 11 point endorsement scale All seven treatment conditions with control condition as residual category Alternative test of H1-5 7-14 1-7 will also be run separately for each of the 5 priming treatments compared to control for the 100-point voting measure Each of the 5 treatment conditions compared with control. Alternative tests of H1-5 15-28 1-7 will also be run separately for each of the 5 priming treatments compared to control for the 11-pt scale and the 100-point voting measure for the organizations IEMI, NDI & IRI considered separately as the least known organizations \u2013 and therefore most subject to priming Each of the 5 treatment conditions compared with control for IRI, NDI & IEMI Alternative tests of H1-5 Regression analyses based on NGO (respondent)-provided covariates will be employed as robustness checks. Ordinary least squares regression with covariates will be used for analysis of treatment effects on the 11-point scale endorsements and the 100-point voting measure. In regression analysis, standard errors will be clustered by subject, which is prescribed as best practice in a within-subjects\u2019 design. \u2003", "q18": "Global", "q19": "14,700", "q20": "Yes",

land reform programs in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This paper evaluates one such program in unplanned settlements on the periphery of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where access to short term leaseholds were extended to a large proportion of the city in 2004. Due to technical difficulties in obtaining satellite imagery for several isolated parts of the city, several areas which the Tanzanian government intended to include in the program were subsequently excluded, solely due to a lack of suitable maps. This paper takes advantage of this natural experiment by collecting data on parcel and household-level outcomes at the outermost boundary of the government land registration exercise, using a regression discontinuity design to compare land which was eligible for titling to that which, to date, is still excluded from the program. Analysis will be based on a combination of administrative data sources and a household survey designed and managed by the authors, covering households located within a 100 meter catchment area on either side of the boundary dividing settlements that were either eligible or ineligible for a property right known as a \u201cresidential license\u201d (RL). Note: At the time of registering this pre-analysis plan, data collection has concluded. The authors have not conducted any analysis combining outcome data with knowledge of treatment eligibility or take-up. We have had access to an incomplete sample and set of outcome variables for cleaning purposes, stripped of all information that would identify a household or parcel as treatment or control. \""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"The natural experiment provided by the Ministry\u2019s failure to obtain a usable map for one sub-ward (mtaa) provides an opportunity to test both economic and political hypotheses about the consequences of titling interventions. We enumerate 9 hypotheses, which we plan to analyze as at least two distinct papers: one on economic outcomes (hypotheses A-E below), and a second on politcal-economic responses (hypotheses F-I). A. Construction. We hypothesize that RLs increase both the construction of new structures and the renovation/investment in structures on existing parcels. In subgroup analysis, we expect the impacts of RLs to be larger for parcels that did not contain structures in 2004. To interpret estimated impacts on the construction outcomes described in Section IV below, we will create a summary measure that aggregates the estimated individual treatment effects based on market values. Market values of each component will be estimated using the 2004 municipal building value assessment. However, for purposes of providing a summary measure of construction outcomes, we will use the approach of Katz, Kling, and LIeberman (2007) described in Section III.F. B. Land-market activity. (i) We hypothesize that RLs encourage rental-market activity, as they reduce potential landlords\u2019 risk that tenants or other parties will assert ownership claims. (ii) While reduced uncertainty about legitimate ownership is hypothesized to be conducive to sales-market activity (Besley 1994), frictions in the registration process may actually drive a wedge between the value of land to those who owned it at the time of RL receipt and prospective buyers (Jacoby and Minten 2007); consequently, the effect of RLs on land sales is a priori ambiguous. C. Labor-market activity and business investment. We hypothesize that RLs will increase the supply of household labor (Field 2007) and the investment of household funds into household enterprises (potentially due both to an increase in the supply of credit to affected households and due to the increased returns to investment on parcels where tenure security has been increased (Besley 1994; Field 2005; Besley, Buchardi, and Ghatak 2012). We hypothesize that these should lead to greater capital stocks and higher profits. We further hypothesis that, through these mechanisms, receipt of an RL should increase the likelihood that a household has a business enterprise of its own, and that the household has a business on the treated parcel in particular. Th Because these effects, measured on the population of 2014 owners, can operate either through treatment effects on owners who were resident in 2004 or through the transfer of ownership to households with greater labor supply and investment, we will estimate heterogeneous effects of the RL by subgroups defined by \u2018fixed\u2019 ownership. D. Credit access. We hypothesize that RLs should increase both the demand for, and supply of, credit, though the literature presents mixed results on the credit-supply response (Field and Torero 2008; Besley et al. 2012). E. Tenure security and disputes. We hypothesize that receipt of a RL should (i) reduce the owner\u2019s perceived risk of expropriation by the government; and (ii) reduce the incidence of disputes among both owners and renters. F. Market attitudes, including individualism and trust. Galiani and Schargrodsky (2007) find evidence that the issuance of titles has positive effects on four dimensions of what they term \u2018market-oriented\u2019 beliefs: individualism, the importance of money to happiness, the extent to which effort is rewarded, and whether others can be trusted. We test the hypothesis that there are positive effects on the same dimensions. Since surveys often ask many such questions, and since the line between market-oriented and other aspects of beliefs and attitudes is a blurry one, we believe this is an area in which pre-commitment to a plan for this analysis, which mirrors the G&S measures, adds rigor to this rare replication opportunity. G. Attitudes toward the state. A large literature in political science considers the impact of taxation on citizens\u2019 demand for, and ability to exercise, accountable governance (Bates and Lien 1985; North and Weingast 1989; TIlly 1991; Ross 2004). James Scott (1999) has argued that systems of property rights are essentially vehicles for states to bring their citizens into the formal system of taxation, and indeed, residents of Dar es Salaam were required to pay back taxes in order to obtain Residential Licenses. We hypothesize that this will induce a shift in residents\u2019 perceptions of their relationship with the state, toward more active citizenship. We therefore expect positive effects on four measures: (i) greater support for questioning leaders; (ii) greater support for the view that government should be accountable to citizens; (iii) greater opposition to clientelistic policies; and (iv) greater support for elections. H. Satisfaction with public services. Our view , based on anecdotes at a city-wide level, is that the increase in tax revenue was not met with a commensurate improvement in the quality of government services. Taking subjective satisfaction with public services to be judged relative to these expectations, we hypothesize that satisfaction with government services will have declined, across all levels of government. I. Political engagement. For reasons outlined above, we expect receipt of RLs to have positive effects on political engagement. We test this hypothesis using five specific measures: (i) engagement with the news media; (ii) informal discussions of politics; (iii) social group participation; (iv) active citizenship; and (v) voting.\""}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "\"The hypotheses will be tested using unique, parcel-level data collected on the universe of parcels within a 100 meter bandwidth on either side of an administrative boundary that defined whether parcels were eligible for title in 2004. The empirical specification employed in the analysis is a regression discontinuity design. To make use of quasi-experimental assignment of sub-wards (mitaa) to treatment, while allowing for the possibility that potential outcomes vary smoothly across space, we treat distance to the 2004 mitaa border as a running variable. This is a fuzzy regression discontinuity design in the sense that there is one-sided noncompliance: while no parcels on the \u2018control\u2019 side of the boundary could have been treated, not all parcels on the \u2018treatment\u2019 side of the parcel opted to apply for Residential Licenses. We commit to present results from two types of RD estimators, as in Abdulkadiroglu, Angrist, and Pathak (2014). (1) Our non-parametric specification will implement a locally linear regression, with bandwidth choice following the data-driven procedure of Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012, henceforth IK). As IK propose alternative criteria for the selection of bandwidth in a fuzzy discontinuity case, we will use that protocol for selecting a distinct bandwidth appropriate to the Wald estimate when estimating treatment effects on those actually receiving RLs in the vicinity of the boundary. (2) Our parametric estimates will employ a third-order polynomial in distance-to-the boundary, estimated separately on either side of the boundary. Following Lee and Lemieux, in addition to this primary specification we will explore robustness to alternative polynomial specifications, and will test for functional form misspecification by adding, and testing for the statistical significance of, indicator variables for discrete bins, defined at 10-meter intervals from the boundary.

Subjects play an optimal stopping game to earn money. They are randomly assigned to work as members of a group and their game is randomly generated with high or low degrees of difficulty. Difficulty will proxy for success, as described below. After playing the game, several measures of social capital are recorded. \\section{Background} This lab experiment investigates the impact of collaborative effort and success on the formation of social capital. In the developing world, scholars and policy practioners often recommend partnership with local NGO's for development efforts. Localized and NGO-led development is said to be more effective, efficient, appropriate, democratic, and transparent than top-down efforts by governments or large international actors. More importantly for this study, scholars have also asserted that these efforts will, as a side benefit, help create social capital by organising beneficiaries into community organisations. For example, a World Bank project in Rondonia, Brazil, distributed funds to support sustainable development projects. Funds were awarded to NGO's that were formed by local organisations in rainforest communities. These organisations were often brand-new - formed explicitly and solely to seek the funding for the community. The idea was that in addition to finding locally-appropriate development projects, the formation of these new NGO's would help create social capital by generating community organisations where none previously existed. Observational studies reach diverging conclusions on the impact of local community organisation efforts as part of development strategies. Some find no impact, some find positive effects, and others find negative effects. There is obvious endogeneity in these studies given that successful organisation may require pre-existing social capital. Several field experiments have tried to test this relationship, also with mixed results. We test the independent and interactive impact of two treatments on social capital: group collaboration, and success. We use a laboratory experiment conducted at the University of Southern California. In the experiment, subjects will be randomly assigned to work as a group or individually on a task where they may earn money. The task is an optimal stopping game. We also wish to test whether group success increases social capital. In other words, more than just working together, the group must achieve some substantive success to reinforce the benefits of group effort. As success may be endogenous to preexisting social capital, skill or other confounders, we randomly assign the difficulty of the task. The task we assign to subjects involves a random sequence of numbers; some sequences make it easy to win, and others make it hard to win. Effectively, some groups are ``lucky'' and get an easy task, and other groups are ``unlucky'' and get a harder task. Thus our proxy for success, is difficulty of the task. This variable is not as artificial as it might seem. The success of local development projects depends not only on the skill and organisation of the participants - but also on their luck. Too much or too little rain can doom an otherwise promising project - or reward a not-so-good project. Changes in the global market for a product, say coffee, are also unpredictable and make outcomes stochastic. Similar arguments could be made about the role of violence, changes in politics and property rights, and many other variables. The optimal stopping game involves making decisions about a sequence of numbers. The player(s) are presented with one number at a time from a finite sequence. As each number is presented they must decide whether to stop or to continue drawing numbers (if they have not reached the end of the sequence). If they stop at the largest number, then they win. Some sequences are easy to win using intuition or using probability calculations. For example, if drawing from integers between 1 and 100, the sequence 1,2,3,4,5 is easy to win because at each step, the player knows that the next number must be higher; there are no lower numbers left to sample. Similarly, a sequence 100, 1, 2, 3, 4 is also easy to win; once the player sees the maximum of the population, obviously there are no higher numbers elsewhere in the sequence. Other sequences are very hard; for example, 24, 99, 4, 7, 100. The player will be tempted to choose 99, not knowing a larger number exists later in the sequence. Most sequences of course, fall between these two extremes. But effectively these sequences can be called ``easy'' or ``difficult'', and we can use them to predict success. We classify sequences as easy or difficult depending on whether a player would win using one of several strategies. If the player would win using any of the strategies, we call the game easy. If the player would lose using any of the strategies, we call the game difficult. The strategies are all probabilistic stopping rules. We calculate the probability of winning associated with stopping on some number versus continuing in the sequence. We then apply the following stopping rule: Stop if P(win if stop now) $>$ P(win if continue) + c where we vary $c$ from -.15 to +.15. If the player would win for any value of $c$ between -.2 and +.2, we call the game easy. If the player would lose for any value of $c$ between -.2 and +.2, we call the game difficult. We discard sequences where $-.15 < c < +.15$. Note that the optimal strategy is $c=0$, that is, one should stop if the probability of winning on the current round is greater than .50 to maximise the probability of winning from a random sequence.\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"Hypotheses: \\begin{enumerate} \\item Group activity increases social capital. We expect all measures of social capital to be higher for subjects in the group treatment than those in the individual treatment. \\item Assignment to an easy sequence of numbers in the optimal stopping game increases social capital compared with assignment to a difficult sequence of numbers in the optimal stopping game. We expect subjects assigned to an easy task to report higher rates of social capital than those assigned to the individual treatment. \\item Interaction of Group/Individual and Easy/Hard tasks We expect subjects assigned to the combination of Group/Easy treatments to have the highest level of social capital, as success in their task should reinforce and make positive their group experience.

We use a laboratory experiment conducted at the University of Southern California. In the experiment, subjects will be randomly assigned to work as a group or individually on a task where they may earn money. The task is an optimal stopping game. We also wish to test whether group success increases social capital. In other words, more than just working together, the group must achieve some substantive success to reinforce the benefits of group effort. As success may be endogenous to preexisting social capital, skill or other confounders, we randomly assign the difficulty of the task. The task we assign to subjects involves a random sequence of numbers; some sequences make it easy to win, and others make it hard to win. Effectively, some groups are ``lucky'' and get an easy task, and other groups are ``unlucky'' and get a harder task. Thus our proxy for success, is difficulty of the task. This variable is not as artificial as it might seem. The success of local development projects depends not only on the skill and organisation of the participants - but also on their luck. Too much or too little rain can doom an otherwise promising project - or reward a not-so-good project. Changes in the global market for a product, say coffee, are also unpredictable and make outcomes stochastic. Similar arguments could be made about the role of violence, changes in politics and property rights, and many other variables. The optimal stopping game involves making decisions about a sequence of numbers. The player(s) are presented with one number at a time from a finite sequence. As each number is presented they must decide whether to stop or to continue drawing numbers (if they have not reached the end of the sequence). If they stop at the largest number, then they win. Some sequences are easy to win using intuition or using probability calculations. For example, if drawing from integers between 1 and 100, the sequence 1,2,3,4,5 is easy to win because at each step, the player knows that the next number must be higher; there are no lower numbers left to sample. Similarly, a sequence 100, 1, 2, 3, 4 is also easy to win; once the player sees the maximum of the population, obviously there are no higher numbers elsewhere in the sequence. Other sequences are very hard; for example, 24, 99, 4, 7, 100. The player will be tempted to choose 99, not knowing a larger number exists later in the sequence. Most sequences of course, fall between these two extremes. But effectively these sequences can be called ``easy'' or ``difficult'', and we can use them to predict success. We classify sequences as easy or difficult depending on whether a player would win using one of several strategies. If the player would win using any of the strategies, we call the game easy. If the player would lose using any of the strategies, we call the game difficult. The strategies are all probabilistic stopping rules. We calculate the probability of winning associated with stopping on some number versus continuing in the sequence. We then apply the following stopping rule: Stop if P(win if stop now) $>$ P(win if continue) + c where we vary $c$ from -.15 to +.15. If the player would win for any value of $c$ between -.2 and +.2, we call the game easy. If the player would lose for any value of $c$ between -.2 and +.2, we call the game difficult. We discard sequences where $-.15 < c < +.15$. Note that the optimal strategy is $c=0$, that is, one should stop if the probability of winning on the current round is greater than .50 to maximise the probability of winning from a random sequence.\"", "q16": "\"Hypotheses: \\begin{enumerate} \\item Group activity increases social capital. We expect all measures of social capital to be higher for subjects in the group treatment than those in the individual treatment. \\item Assignment to an easy sequence of numbers in the optimal stopping game increases social capital compared with assignment to a difficult sequence of numbers in the optimal stopping game. We expect subjects assigned to an easy task to report higher rates of social capital than those assigned to the individual treatment. \\item Interaction of Group/Individual and Easy/Hard tasks We expect subjects assigned to the combination of Group/Easy treatments to have the highest level of social capital, as success in their task should reinforce and make positive their group experience. This implies that Easy*Group $>$ Easy*Not Group, Hard*Group, and Hard*Not Group. \\end{enumerate}\"", "q17": "\"\\section{Data Sources} Subjects will be USC undergraduate students. The experiment will be conducted on campus. The dependent variable, social capital, will be measured via three post-treatment games and two post-treatment questions. The measures are as follows: \\begin{enumerate} \\item Post Treatment Games \\begin{enumerate} \\item Trust Game: amounts transferred by player A to player B. \\item Trust Game: amounts transferred back from B to A (if A made a transfer). \\item Number of participants in Stag Hunt \\end{enumerate} \\item Post-Treatment Questionaire \\begin{enumerate} \\item Interpersonal Trust \\item Turnout intention in Fall 2014 election \\end{enumerate} \\end{enumerate} The details of the protocol, questionnaires, and other steps of the experiment are provided in the included questionnaires and protocol documents. \\section{Analysis} For the game-based measures (1a, 1b, 1c, above), tests will be difference in means tests. For the survey question measures (2a, 2b), we will use the difference in proportions test.
