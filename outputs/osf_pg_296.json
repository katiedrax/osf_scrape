These items have since been used to explore how individuals are transitioning into adulthood by determining what milestones are important to them compared to those they achieve. However, recent studies of adulthood have illuminated changes in the transitional markers associated with reaching adult status; namely, there is a growing focus on subjective milestones as opposed to objective external markers. Essentially, new adults are no longer interested in defining their status based on marriage, child rearing, or living independently, but instead discern their own adult status based on relative maturity markers such as developing greater consideration for others and recognizing their own capabilities and shortcomings. Thus, Norman et al. (2020) developed an updated collection of transitional markers, including several from Arnett\u2019s original configuration as well as some new items, to better reflect the current trends in adulthood development.\n\nThe current study utilizes the Revised MoA scale to examine three scoring methods used in prior research: raw scores, dichotomous choices, and fit scoring. We will compare  these methods separately for the original and new MoA items to identify whether one provides stronger predictive  validity for measuring adulthood status. Data collection began with 1161 and resulted in 861 participants across seven national institutions. Of the participants, 288 identified as males, 565 as females, and 7 as nonbinary, gender nonconforming, or other. Participants ranged in age from 18- 62 with an average age of 21. Data collection ensued via an online survey including the Inventory of the Dimensions of Emerging Adulthood (IDEA;Arnett, 2000), 22 original MoA items (Arnett, 2001) with some phrasing revisions, 14 new MoA items (Norman et al., 2020), the Perceived-Esteem Inventory (Hermann, Lucas, &amp; Friedrich, 2008), and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965). \n\nWe will complete the following scoring procedures on the Markers of Adulthood items, computing two sets of scales- one for old items and one for new. For Raw and Dichotomous scoring, we will follow the methods of deDios (2015); for Fit scoring, we will emulate Sharon (2016). Finally, we will regress the six IDEA subscales, Self-Esteem and Perceived Esteem, age and age-squared onto the three sets of MoA scores for New and Original MoA Scales. We expect Raw Scoring to be the strongest predictor of adulthood status, although it will highlight extreme scores and exhibit more variability. We also hypothesize Fit Scoring will be a stronger predictor of adulthood status than Dichotomous, and will have the strongest correlation with age and IDEA scores.

Of the participants, 288 identified as males, 565 as females, and 7 as nonbinary, gender nonconforming, or other. Participants ranged in age from 18- 62 with an average age of 21. Data collection ensued via an online survey including the Inventory of the Dimensions of Emerging Adulthood (IDEA;Arnett, 2000), 22 original MoA items (Arnett, 2001) with some phrasing revisions, 14 new MoA items (Norman et al., 2020), the Perceived-Esteem Inventory (Hermann, Lucas, &amp; Friedrich, 2008), and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965). \n\nWe will complete the following scoring procedures on the Markers of Adulthood items, computing two sets of scales- one for old items and one for new. For Raw and Dichotomous scoring, we will follow the methods of deDios (2015); for Fit scoring, we will emulate Sharon (2016). Finally, we will regress the six IDEA subscales, Self-Esteem and Perceived Esteem, age and age-squared onto the three sets of MoA scores for New and Original MoA Scales. We expect Raw Scoring to be the strongest predictor of adulthood status, although it will highlight extreme scores and exhibit more variability. We also hypothesize Fit Scoring will be a stronger predictor of adulthood status than Dichotomous, and will have the strongest correlation with age and IDEA scores. Lastly, we expect the new MoA items to be better predictors of adulthood status than the original items.", "q4": "Raw vs Dichotomous - Raw will have more variability, will maximize the combination of importance and achievement, but will also highlight extreme scores. Raw will be the strongest predictor. \n\nDichotomous vs Fit - Fit will be more closely aligned to the respondents\u2019 preferences, and will be a stronger predictor. Dichotomous will not be a strong predictor.\n\nRaw vs Fit - Fit will have a higher correlation to age than raw. Both will have low correlations with the IDEA, although Fit will be higher.\n\nNew Vs. Old -- We do not expect New to outperform Old items within our sample since these items were added to be more inclusive of populations beyond the typical college sample. Therefore, our comparisons of New versus Old MoA scoring across the Raw, Dichotomous, and Fit will primarily be to determine if the New items are equivalent to the Old items across the various effects.

Some of this research has shown that this effect might depend on the nature of the social interaction (e.g. cooperative vs competitive). The rationale underlying these findings is that perspective-taking enables us to more accurately intuit another person\u2019s thoughts, which, in turn, can facilitate judgments of  that person\u2019s future behavior and therefore inform decisions (not) to trust that person. However, this rationale has not been experimentally tested directly so far.\n\nThe present study will manipulate perspective-taking and the trustworthiness of other players within a trust game. Trustworthiness of the other players will be established via their behavior during the trust game (i.e., how often they reciprocate and return money to the participant). Before every trial of the trust game, perspective-taking will be manipulated by either having participants take the visual perspective of the other players or their own egocentric perspective. Participants' trust in the other players will be measured over several games by inspecting their willingness to entrust the other players with money during the trust game.\n\nIt is predicted that participants generally learn over time which of the other players are trustworthy or not. It is furthermore predicted that this learning will be accelerated by perspective-taking, which allows participants to more accurately intuit the other players' thoughts, thereby allowing them to more quickly forming an impression of those players as trustworthy or not.

These differences should furthermore be larger for the players whose perspective participants took.", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=7z6tn", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/de-1/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "de-1", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "7z6tn", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "7z6tn", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/zwk0m/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "zwk0m", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6eg5v/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "6eg5v", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/7z6tn/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7z6tn/"}}], "links": {"first": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json", "last": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "prev": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=295", "next": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=297", "meta": {"total": 5469, "per_page": 10}}}
