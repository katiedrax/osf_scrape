The overarching motivation of these changes stems from the first author\u2019s continued learning of best practices in statistics from her graduate coursework. \n\nChange #1: Primary Analyses\nWe previously planned to run ten different models for our primary analyses.  We have simplified this and will now be combining these models into one measured variable path analysis. We believe this will allow for a more accurate depiction of the relations among variables in the system.  All predictors, covariates, and interaction terms will be set to covary. We will also allow the errors to covary for our two outcome measures of responses to conflict (explicit responses and implicit responses).\n\nChange #2: Covariates\nWe previously planned to include only empirically derived covariates in our primary analyses (just including variables that are significantly correlated with our outcome variables as covariates).  We have since decided to include the following a priori covariates: age, race (minority vs non-minority), preferred partner gender, romantic relationship experience (some or none), and school. In addition, we will test the correlations between the remaining demographic variables (e.g., maternal education level) and our outcome variables, and include variables with significant correlations as covariates. We are making this change to avoid omitting a covariate with a low bivariate correlation with an outcome variable, despite having a significant direct effect on that outcome variable. \n\nWe will not include participant gender as a covariate in the primary analyses due to possible multicollinearity issues with preferred partner gender. We may include participant gender in exploratory analyses.\n\nChange #3: Missing Data\nWe had previously planned to use multiple imputation for missing data. We did not specify item level or scale level.  We now plan on using Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) for scale level missingness. This is because FIML is well integrated with path analysis statistical packages and yields similar estimates to multiple imputation (Graham et al., 2007). For item level missingness, we will use participant mean imputation (Parent, 2013) as it yields similar estimates to multiple imputation, while allowing us to use more of our available data. \n\nChange #4: Statistical Software\nWe previously planned on conducting all analyses in R.  We now may also conduct some analyses in Mplus, as Mplus can be very useful for path analyses.\n\nChange #5: Psychometric Analysis\nIn my pilot analyses, we explored the psychometric properties of the data with Cronbach\u2019s alpha.

primarily on broad health outcomes and, to an extent, on specific health behaviors. Responses to a pandemic, particularly with regard to hygiene and social distancing, have not been examined. The literature on psychopathy and the dark triad has linked these characteristics to risk-taking and, in few studies, to physical health outcomes, and there is an increasing interested in psychopathy, the dark triad, and everyday behavior. These traits have not yet been linked to hygiene and social distancing in a pandemic. Finally, personality has been linked to responses to political and commercial messaging, but not to public health messaging. The emergent coronavirus pandemic presents an opportunity to test hypotheses in this area at a time when most people in the U.S. are at least somewhat informed about the pandemic and are still adapting to new demands for social distancing, increased hygiene, and public-health messages.\n\nThe study being registered will link general personality (the Big Five), the triarchic psychopathy model, and the dark triad to self-reported current and intended hygiene and social distancing, to self-reported endorsement of intent to harm others by spreading the infection, and to the personal appeal of public-health messaging about how to protect oneself and others from the virus. Specific predictions are listed following the method description.\n\nMethod Basics\nResearch participants will be up to 500 Mechanical Turk Workers, to be compensated $1.5 for a 15-min. survey. The survey will consist of ad hoc questionnaires about hygiene, social distancing, social and self-protective behaviors, intent to harm others, the mini-IPIP scales (Donnellan et al., 2006), Abbreviated Psychopathy Measure (Semel, 2018), Short Dark Triad (Jones &amp; Paulhus, 2014), and brief scales to measure the persuasiveness, likelihood to take seriously, and likelihood to impact behavior of each of five public-health messages. The messages have been written ad hoc and based to theory to use language that would especially appeal to or be ego-syntonic with narcissistic/Machiavellian, conscientious/overcontrolled, agreeable/compassionate, avoidant/contamination-averse, and extraverted/sociable personalities. Composite scores will be created from the personality questionnaires according to their conventional scoring guidelines. Composite scores will be created for the health-related questionnaires to create the following variables: Current social distancing; current hygiene; intent to socially distance; intent for hygiene; willigness to harm others; message appeal (separately for each of the five messages). The correlational analyses linking personality variables to the health-related composites will control for age, sex, and the extent to which participants report having chronic health conditions that may make them especially susceptible to coronavirus (on a scale from 0-2).  \n\nPower and Data Cleaning\nPartial correlations will be considered significant at p &lt;= .01 (one-tailed). This corresponds to .85 power at alpha = .01 (one-tailed) for an r = .16 with N = 430. We will attempt to obtain valid data from up to 500 participants, based on budget limitations. Realistically, we expect that approximately 60 out of 500 participants will provide data with questionable validity. This will be determined through the use of validity and consistency check, and survey-completion times. We will plot the survey-completion times and look for an inversion point that distinguishes extremely fast completion times from more realistic completion times. We anticipate excluding the participants with the 25 lowest completion times, but we must inspect the actual completion-time data before committing to this decision. We will examine responses to three pairs of inconsistency check questions, to three validity questions (e.g., I am answering these questions truthfully), and to three questions expected to produce nearly constant responses. We will examine the distribution of these inconsistency/validity data and exclude extremely inconsistent/invalid responses. We anticipate excluding participants (probably around 50-60) who fail 2-3 of the inconsistency check and 2-3 of the validity checks, but we must inspect the actual inconsistency/validity data before committing to this decision. We do not anticipate engaging in other data cleaning or in the identification or selection of outliers.\n\nSpecific Predictions\nSelf-reported inclination to engage in social distancing will correlate with:\n- Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Neuroticism, Boldness (negatively), Disinhibition (negatively), and Psychopathy (negatively)\nSelf-reported inclination to engage in hygiene will correlate with:\n- Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Disinhibition (negatively), Meanness (negatively)\nSelf-reported actual engagement in social distancing will correlate with:\n- Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Extraversion (negatively), Neuroticism, Boldness (negatively), Disinhibition (negatively)\nSelf-reported actual engagement in hygiene practice will correlate with:\n- Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Narcissism (because of a desirability bias) and Boldness (for the same reason)\nSelf-reported willingness to deliberately infect others will correlate with:\n- Meanness, Disinhibition, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy\nFinally, appeal of the five public-health messages will correlate differentially with the traits:\nThe narcissistic/Machiavellian message: Narcissism, Meanness, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy;\nThe conscientious/overcontrolled message: Conscientiousness and Disinhibition (negative);\nThe agreeable/compassionate message: Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Narcissism (negative), Machiavellianism (negative), Psychopathy (negative), and Meanness (negative);\nThe avoidant/fearful message: Neuroticism and Boldness (negative)\nThe extraverted message: Extraversion, Boldness, and Openness.\n\nHow does this summary differ from prior registrations?\nThere are no prior registrations of similar projects.
