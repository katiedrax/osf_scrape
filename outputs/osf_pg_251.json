"Louise Loyant, Marine Joly, Jerome Micheletta, Bridget Waller"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Living in a complex social environment requires primates to manage their emotions and inhibit impulsive behaviours to maintain group cohesion and increase their fitness. Such cognitive processes are defined as inhibitory control (Diamond, 2013; Beran, 2018). For example, a primate needs to inhibit his impulses to avoid unnecessary conflicts with group mates. Inhibitory control is thus essential during daily complex problem solving and in social interactions. \nInhibitory control is a multi-dimensional construct comprised of separable processes: inhibition of emotions, actions and inhibition of a cognitive set (Diamond, 2013; Beran, 2018). Having a better understanding of animal inhibitory control is crucial to apprehend the evolutionary underpinnings of this ability, particularly if the selective pressures underlying can be identified. To date, we know little about the selective forces that favour the evolution of this executive function. Ecological factors and absolute brain size seem to shape inhibitory control skills (MacLean et al., 2014) but these results have provoked many controversies (Beran, 2018). As inhibitory control is crucial in the social life of primates it is particularly interesting to understand whether their social environment might affect it. It has been suggested that one route by which social problem solving can evolve is through selection on social tolerance (Hare et al., 2007). Tolerant social styles feature higher reconciliation rates, fewer conflicts and more relaxed social relationships than despotic ones (Thierry, 2000). It has been suggested that species with higher social tolerance, live in more complex groups, and need to employ more cognitive skills as inhibitory strategies ( Dunbar et al. 2007; Thierry et al. 2007).  Therefore, it would be interesting to compare inhibitory control skills in different species displaying different degrees of social tolerance. \nThe macaque radiation, is an ideal taxon for such a comparative study as their social styles can be classified along a four-grade scale, from despotic style of social relations to more tolerant style ones (Thierry, 2000). \nHence the aim of this project is to explore the influence of social tolerance degrees on each main component of inhibitory control skills: basic executive functioning, inhibition of emotions, actions and cognitive sets.\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Our main hypothesis is that overall the more tolerant species will outperform the less tolerant ones in inhibitory control tasks. More precisely:\n- We don\u2019t expect any difference in the basic executive task between macaque species.\n-  For the inhibition of emotion task, we expect that the macaques with lower degree of social tolerance will be more distracted by a negative emotional stimulus as they are more easily aroused (Thierry, 2000).\n- For the inhibition of action task, our hypothesis is that macaques with a higher degree of social tolerance will have better performance at inhibiting their action. As in Joly et al., 2017, the more tolerant macaques species outperformed the less tolerant species at a basic task of inhibition of action.\n- For the inhibition of a cognitive set, we expect that macaque with a higher degree of social tolerance, which has been associated with better problem-solving skills (Hare et al., 2007) will have better performance at reverse learning task.\n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Each task consists of a defined number of trials to complete or a success criterion to reach (75% of success for the whole session for the last task of reverse learning).\n\nEach of the task has its own procedure and criterion for completion:\n-\tTask 1: executive functioning\nStudy 1 is a Reaction Time Task, the individual has to touch a small target displayed at his left or right (a red rectangle 10x15cm) on a touch screen and will receive a reward for it. Task 1 consists of 3 sessions with 20 trials each.\n-\tTask 2: inhibition of emotions, \u201cModified Stroop Task\u201d\nWe are using Reaction Time Task, measuring the time taken by the macaques to touch a target (the same target as in study 1) displayed at the same time as a picture of a conspecific\u2019s face (neutral or threatening facial expression) or a control object on a touch screen. Task 2 consists of 3 sessions with  36 randomised trials each). \n-\tTask 3: inhibition of an action, \u201cGo noGo\u201d\nPerformances of the macaques (Reaction Time and percentage of correct answers) will  be  evaluated  using a go/no go paradigm. On a touch screen, 75% of the time a target will be displayed (the \u201cgo\u201d stimulus) and the macaques will have to touch it to receive a reward. The rest of the time a \u201cno go\u201d stimulus will be displayed, and the macaques will  have to suppress their impulse to touch it. Task 3 consists of 5 sessions with  20 trials each.\n-\tTask 4: inhibition of a cognitive set, \u201c Reverse Learning\u201d\nThe rule learned in Study 3 will be reversed. The \u201cgo\u201d stimulus will become a \u201cno-go\u201d stimulus and the \u201cno-go\u201d stimulus will become the \u201cgo\u201d stimulus. For each trial, we will measure the Reaction Time and percentage  of correct answers. The criterion to complete Task 4 is 75% of success.\nThe subjects have 35sec to complete the trial. If the subject stays inactive for more than 5 min the session will be  stopped and continued the next testing day if available. If the subject does not  participate three testing days in a row it will definitely be excluded from the task.\nThe duration of the data collection phase will depend on the macaques\u2019 performances.\n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "We are going to compare the performances of 3 macaque\u2019s species with different degrees of social tolerance: 21 Macaca mulatta (11 males, 9 females from the MRC, Porto Down, UK; grade \u00bc on the social tolerance scale), 20 M. fascicularis (10 males, 10 females from the BPRC, Utrecht, Netherlands; grade 2/4), 20 M. tonkeana (10 males, 10 females from the Primate Centre, Strasbourg; grade 4/4).\n"}, "q14": {"extra": [], "value": "The sample size described above is a result of the monkeys currently available for testing at different research sites.

Such cognitive processes are defined as inhibitory control (Diamond, 2013; Beran, 2018). For example, a primate needs to inhibit his impulses to avoid unnecessary conflicts with group mates. Inhibitory control is thus essential during daily complex problem solving and in social interactions. \nInhibitory control is a multi-dimensional construct comprised of separable processes: inhibition of emotions, actions and inhibition of a cognitive set (Diamond, 2013; Beran, 2018). Having a better understanding of animal inhibitory control is crucial to apprehend the evolutionary underpinnings of this ability, particularly if the selective pressures underlying can be identified. To date, we know little about the selective forces that favour the evolution of this executive function. Ecological factors and absolute brain size seem to shape inhibitory control skills (MacLean et al., 2014) but these results have provoked many controversies (Beran, 2018). As inhibitory control is crucial in the social life of primates it is particularly interesting to understand whether their social environment might affect it. It has been suggested that one route by which social problem solving can evolve is through selection on social tolerance (Hare et al., 2007). Tolerant social styles feature higher reconciliation rates, fewer conflicts and more relaxed social relationships than despotic ones (Thierry, 2000). It has been suggested that species with higher social tolerance, live in more complex groups, and need to employ more cognitive skills as inhibitory strategies ( Dunbar et al. 2007; Thierry et al. 2007).  Therefore, it would be interesting to compare inhibitory control skills in different species displaying different degrees of social tolerance. \nThe macaque radiation, is an ideal taxon for such a comparative study as their social styles can be classified along a four-grade scale, from despotic style of social relations to more tolerant style ones (Thierry, 2000). \nHence the aim of this project is to explore the influence of social tolerance degrees on each main component of inhibitory control skills: basic executive functioning, inhibition of emotions, actions and cognitive sets.\n", "q4": "Our main hypothesis is that overall the more tolerant species will outperform the less tolerant ones in inhibitory control tasks. More precisely:\n- We don\u2019t expect any difference in the basic executive task between macaque species.\n-  For the inhibition of emotion task, we expect that the macaques with lower degree of social tolerance will be more distracted by a negative emotional stimulus as they are more easily aroused (Thierry, 2000).\n- For the inhibition of action task, our hypothesis is that macaques with a higher degree of social tolerance will have better performance at inhibiting their action. As in Joly et al., 2017, the more tolerant macaques species outperformed the less tolerant species at a basic task of inhibition of action.\n- For the inhibition of a cognitive set, we expect that macaque with a higher degree of social tolerance, which has been associated with better problem-solving skills (Hare et al., 2007) will have better performance at reverse learning task.\n", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.
