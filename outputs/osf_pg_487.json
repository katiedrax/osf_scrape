It is a leading cause of head and neck cancers. Worldwide, the geographical distribution of smokeless tobacco consumption varies considerably. Most smokeless tobacco users (82%) live in Southeast Asia, Central Asia and in many African states (e.g. Nigeria, Ghana, Algeria, Cameroon, Chad, Senegal, Sudan and South Africa) [2]. Most lethal and addictive products are used in Asia and Africa. Depending on the production of the product and its use, the level of health risk to users varies widely [3]. Smokeless tobacco use is strongly associated with oral potentially malignant disorders, head and neck cancers and cardiovascular deaths. Its use during pregnancy is also associated with low birth weight, preterm births, stillbirths and small-for-gestation-age babies. However, smokeless tobacco use is often rooted in cultural traditions and use patterns are determined by wealth and educational inequalities [1]. Other factors that contribute towards high demand for smokeless tobacco use include easy availability at cheap prices, unregulated marketing (including over the internet) and advertising in print media and at point\u2010of\u2010sale. In addition, levels of awareness about the harmful effects of smokeless tobacco are low, compared with smoking. \nGlobal efforts to control smokeless tobacco use trail behind the progress made in the regulation of cigarette consumption. Smokeless tobacco products fall under the policy framework of the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (FCTC). Their demand patterns, diverse nature, distinct health risks and supply chain require a special policy and practice approach. \nWhile the WHO FCTC provides a framework to analyze public tobacco control policies, smokeless tobacco is always in the background. In its review, Mehrotra et al. (2019) reviewed the state of implementation of the WHO FCTC in 180 countries worldwide [4]. This scoping review will add to this work by analyzing whether there are other policy options discussed in the scientific literature and how the options are assessed by the authors of the articles (reasons for or against the analyzed option).\n\t\n\nObjectives\nResearch question\nThe aim is to map policy options to control smokeless tobacco use that are subject of scientific research and to compare these options with the WHO FCTC articles and the work of Mehrotra et al. (2019). The result will provide us with information about the areas in which policies exist, but also show gaps that may offer alternative approaches.\nThe overarching research question is: Are there policy options reported in the scientific research literature to control smokeless tobacco consumption at the national level that are not mentioned in the WHO-FCTC articles and that may enrich the options available?\n\nAims of the scoping review are:\n1)\t To map public smokeless tobacco control policy; areas covered, instruments used (information (media, interpersonal), economic means (incentives, disincentives, in kind), regulations (soft/hard law, conditional, unconditional) and target group addressed to tackle smokeless tobacco use \n2)\tTo map the instruments used \n3)\tTo collect arguments for or against the used option\n4)\tTo compare the approaches identified with WHO FCTC articles and existing public policy control mechanisms in place within countries [4]\nThe research reflects the so-called PICO elements being an acronym for population, intervention, comparator and outcome. \nThe study population covers the whole population as we are analysing public policies targeting countries population. Specific populations might be considered as long as they are part of a policy issued by a state/public body.\nThe interventions in focus are public policies that mean policies issued by state bodies/public actors targeting the reduction of smokeless tobacco use within a country\u2019s population (e.g., national, federal, regional or municipal public bodies).\nStudy results are compared either against the policy objective or against results in other countries.

"Participants\n\nXXX undergraduate students at the University of Poitiers received partial course credit for participation in what was presented as a memory and judgment study. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two boxes of a plan 2 (memory recall: failure, disappointment) x 2 (situational judgment problem: self vs other). The first variable is between-subject and the second is within-subject.\n\nMaterials, procedure and measures\n\nMemory recall and performance at situational judgment problem\nThe experience included two tasks. The first task was a recall of memory (failure or disappointment). In the experimental condition, participants had to recall a failure in an area important to them where they had a lower performance compared to another person. They also had to detail the traits that characterized them, and which may have contributed to their failure. In the control condition, participants were asked to recall a disappointment where someone close to them had behaved below their expectations. They also had to detail the traits that characterized the person and that may have contributed to the disappointing behavior.\nThe second task was a computer-based situational problem judgment task and was designed with PsychoPy.\n\nAfter reading the information form and completing the consent forms, participants received a document. This document contained three sheets:\n\u2022\tA sheet with questions about socio-demographic data\n\u2022\tA sheet with the instruction of the first task and below a box to write the memory\n\u2022\tA sheet with the presentation of the second task and an example of a situational judgment problem.\nOn the first task, participants had fifteen minutes to write a memory. After completing the first task, participants had to open the door for the experimenter to explain the second task. Then participants had to read the third sheet and they had to click \"OK\" to start the computer-based task. The explanations and instructions were written on the screen.\nOn the first task, participants had fifteen minutes to write a memory. After completing the first task, participants had to open the door for the experimenter to explain the second task. Then participants had to read the third sheet and they had to click \"OK\" to start the computer-based task. The explanations and instructions were written on the screen.\nThe second task was presented as part of data collection for standardizing the test. Participants were asked to choose between two types of situational judgment problems: type 1 (by pressing the \u201c1\u201d key) and type 2 (by pressing the \u201c2\u201d key). Problems type 1 and 2 did not differentiate between them and served to distract participants from identifying the protagonist either by \"you\" or by a first name in the situational judgment problem statement.\nAfter choosing the type of problem, they read a problem of situational judgment. The protagonist was identified either with the term \"you\" or with a first name. Then participants could choose to either respond to the problem (by pressing the \u201cA\u201d key), decline the problem and move on to the next (by pressing the \u201cP\u201d key), or terminate the experiment (by pressing the \u201cG\u201d key ). For each situational judgment problem, they were asked to indicate the most effective behavior and then the least effective behavior. To address situational judgment problem, for each of the two responses (most efficient and least efficient behavior) they had to choose among four statements and press the key \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, \u201c3\u201d or \u201c4\u201d.

Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two boxes of a plan 2 (memory recall: failure, disappointment) x 2 (situational judgment problem: self vs other). The first variable is between-subject and the second is within-subject.\n\nMaterials, procedure and measures\n\nMemory recall and performance at situational judgment problem\nThe experience included two tasks. The first task was a recall of memory (failure or disappointment). In the experimental condition, participants had to recall a failure in an area important to them where they had a lower performance compared to another person. They also had to detail the traits that characterized them, and which may have contributed to their failure. In the control condition, participants were asked to recall a disappointment where someone close to them had behaved below their expectations. They also had to detail the traits that characterized the person and that may have contributed to the disappointing behavior.\nThe second task was a computer-based situational problem judgment task and was designed with PsychoPy.\n\nAfter reading the information form and completing the consent forms, participants received a document. This document contained three sheets:\n\u2022\tA sheet with questions about socio-demographic data\n\u2022\tA sheet with the instruction of the first task and below a box to write the memory\n\u2022\tA sheet with the presentation of the second task and an example of a situational judgment problem.\nOn the first task, participants had fifteen minutes to write a memory. After completing the first task, participants had to open the door for the experimenter to explain the second task. Then participants had to read the third sheet and they had to click \"OK\" to start the computer-based task.

After completing the first task, participants had to open the door for the experimenter to explain the second task. Then participants had to read the third sheet and they had to click \"OK\" to start the computer-based task. The explanations and instructions were written on the screen.\nThe second task was presented as part of data collection for standardizing the test. Participants were asked to choose between two types of situational judgment problems: type 1 (by pressing the \u201c1\u201d key) and type 2 (by pressing the \u201c2\u201d key). Problems type 1 and 2 did not differentiate between them and served to distract participants from identifying the protagonist either by \"you\" or by a first name in the situational judgment problem statement.\nAfter choosing the type of problem, they read a problem of situational judgment. The protagonist was identified either with the term \"you\" or with a first name. Then participants could choose to either respond to the problem (by pressing the \u201cA\u201d key), decline the problem and move on to the next (by pressing the \u201cP\u201d key), or terminate the experiment (by pressing the \u201cG\u201d key ). For each situational judgment problem, they were asked to indicate the most effective behavior and then the least effective behavior. To address situational judgment problem, for each of the two responses (most efficient and least efficient behavior) they had to choose among four statements and press the key \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, \u201c3\u201d or \u201c4\u201d.

In the experiment a computer-based simulation task based on firefighting scenarios is used with different levels of complexity and task difficulty. The amount of knowledge rules the participants have to follow in order to fulfill the task defines task complexity. Task difficulty is increased by the amount of fire outbreaks at different locations (low, medium, high fire intensity). The experiment starts with an introduction phase, a learning phase with three simulation task runs with low, medium, and high difficulty at complexity level 1, followed by a practice phase with low and medium difficulty (three minutes each) at complexity level 2, and a disruption phase with a medium difficulty simulation task run lasting six minutes also at complexity level 2.\nWe expect specialist teams with metaknowledge to be more efficient in managing the drop out of a team member, and therefore, perform better than generalist teams with or without, and specialist teams with no metaknowledge, as specialist teams with metaknowledge have more information processing capacity than the other team types. Their information processing capacity should be higher compared to teams without metaknowledge as the latter have to inform themselves first about the tasks of the missing team member in order to be able to reorganize their team tasks.

We manipulate (1) team task differentiation (specialist vs. generalist teams) and the knowledge about other team members\u2019 tasks and roles (metaknowledge vs. no metaknowledge). \nThe experimental sessions last about 60 minutes in total. In the experiment a computer-based simulation task based on firefighting scenarios is used with different levels of complexity and task difficulty. The amount of knowledge rules the participants have to follow in order to fulfill the task defines task complexity. Task difficulty is increased by the amount of fire outbreaks at different locations (low, medium, high fire intensity). The experiment starts with an introduction phase, a learning phase with three simulation task runs with low, medium, and high difficulty at complexity level 1, followed by a practice phase with low and medium difficulty (three minutes each) at complexity level 2, and a disruption phase with a medium difficulty simulation task run lasting six minutes also at complexity level 2.\nWe expect specialist teams with metaknowledge to be more efficient in managing the drop out of a team member, and therefore, perform better than generalist teams with or without, and specialist teams with no metaknowledge, as specialist teams with metaknowledge have more information processing capacity than the other team types. Their information processing capacity should be higher compared to teams without metaknowledge as the latter have to inform themselves first about the tasks of the missing team member in order to be able to reorganize their team tasks.

First, we will perform one-sample t-tests, in which whole-brain analyses will be computed for all contrasts separately for individuals with SD and HCs to identify whether the paradigm will activate brain regions as established in previous studies (Gunther Moor et al., 2010; Powers et al., 2013; Somerville et al., 2006; Somerville et al., 2010). To detect group differences, two-sample t-tests will be also conducted at the whole-brain level. These tests will be set to a threshold of family-wise error (FWE)- or false discovery rate (FDR)- corrected p &lt; 0.05. \n-     From our a priori defined ROIs, ACC and striatum will be anatomically derived from the automated anatomical labelling in the Wake Forest University Pick Atlas (WFUPick Atlas v2.5; http://fmri.wfubmc.edu/software/PickAtlas). The TPJ (left: \u221253, \u221259, 20; right: 56, \u221256, 18) spherical ROI of 6 mm will be defined based on MNI coordinates taken from a recent meta-analysis of Theory of Mind studies (Schurz et al., 2014). The MPFC region from Powers et al. (2013; MNI coordinates 6, 54, 21; 6 mm sphere) and Schurz et al (2014; MNI coordinates \u22121, 56, 24; 6 mm sphere) will be combined into the ROI of MPFC. Peak activations will be extracted from ROIs that reached significance threshold of p &lt; 0.012 with FWE or FDR correction (Bonferroni adjusted accounting for four ROIs) using the MarsBaR function (Matthew et al., 2002). Maximum peak activations will be submitted to statistical analysis and plotted to further characterize the activations for all trial types in these brain regions.\n\nBrain-characteristic correlations:\n\u2022\tFor each participant, beta weights will be extracted from ROIs that reached significance during second-level analyses for both anticipation and consumption stages. The extracted beta weights represent the magnitude of peak activation for each significant ROI, which will be used to test for the degree of association between characteristic measures and anticipation- and consumption-related brain activation. To assess brain-characteristic correlations, we will calculate group-wise Pearson\u2019s partial correlation coefficients separately for individuals with SD and HCs to allow for statistical non-independence (p &lt; 0.05; two-tailed; Poldrack and Mumford, 2009; Ubl et al., 2015).

This study included individuals from this sample with subthreshold depression (SD) indexed by BDI-II scores\u2009\uff1e\u200913. Note: according to the norms of BDI-II (Zung et al., 1965), a BDI-II score \uff1e 13/19/28 indicates mild, moderate, and severe depression.\nExclusion criteria included: (1) any lifetime Axis I disorders other than depression according to Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders, Research Version, Non-Patient Edition (SCID-I/NP; First et al., 2002); (2) high level of anxiety, i.e., students with STAI-T scores ranked above 75% of the distribution (He et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2018); (3) seizure disorder; (4) history of head injury with possible neurological sequelae; (5) self-reported prior use of any psychoactive drugs especially medication for depression; (6) current alcohol drug dependence.\nAge and gender matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited from the same sample source as individuals with SD. These participants had scores of depressive severity \uff1c13 (measured by BDI-II) and satisfied the same exclusion criteria as individuals with SD; furthermore, the HCs were screened with SCID-I/NP to guarantee without depression. Among the students who met the above criteria, 50 individuals (24 individuals with SD and 26 HCs) participated in the current study. Written informed consent was obtained prior to the experiment. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shenzhen University. \nPrior to entering the fMRI scanner, participants were required to complete four questionnaires: the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), BDI-II, STAI-T and the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ).\nBoth the SDS (Zung et al., 1965) and BDI-II (Beck et al., 1996) are widely used questionnaires to assess depressive symptoms.

We will choose this parameter for spatial smooth as it was double the voxel size (3 mm) and would retain resolution for identifying changes in the relatively small brain regions we are interested in (see Pizzagalli et al., 2009; Ubl et al., 2015)\n\u2022\tWe will conduct first- and second-level analyses for our event-related fMRI design using the general linear model (GLM) approach\n  -     In the first-level analysis for each participant, regressors including 2 delay conditions (expectation after \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d) and 4 feedback conditions (\u2018Yes\u2019\uff0d\u2018Yes\u2019, \u2018Yes\u2019\uff0d\u2018No\u2019, \u2018No\u2019\uff0d\u2018Yes\u2019, \u2018No\u2019\uff0d\u2018No\u2019) will be modeled (a total of 6 factors). To account for variance caused by head movement, six realignment motion parameters (3 translations/rotations) and outlier scans identified by the ART toolbox will be included as nuisance regressors in the model. Each normalized image will be high-pass filtered using a cutoff time constant of 128 s. Contrast images will be separately calculated for both delay and feedback stages. Contrasts in delay stage will include 1) expectation after \u201cYes\u201d, 2) expectation after \u201cNo\u201d. Contrasts in the feedback stage will include 1) Yes-Yes, 2) Yes-No, 3) No-Yes, and 4) No-No. The baseline used for the task will be the implicit baseline as calculated by SPM.\n   -     These contrast images will be taken to the second-level analysis. First, we will perform one-sample t-tests, in which whole-brain analyses will be computed for all contrasts separately for individuals with SD and HCs to identify whether the paradigm will activate brain regions as established in previous studies (Gunther Moor et al., 2010; Powers et al., 2013; Somerville et al., 2006; Somerville et al., 2010). To detect group differences, two-sample t-tests will be also conducted at the whole-brain level. These tests will be set to a threshold of family-wise error (FWE)- or false discovery rate (FDR)- corrected p &lt; 0.05. \n-     From our a priori defined ROIs, ACC and striatum will be anatomically derived from the automated anatomical labelling in the Wake Forest University Pick Atlas (WFUPick Atlas v2.5; http://fmri.wfubmc.edu/software/PickAtlas). The TPJ (left: \u221253, \u221259, 20; right: 56, \u221256, 18) spherical ROI of 6 mm will be defined based on MNI coordinates taken from a recent meta-analysis of Theory of Mind studies (Schurz et al., 2014). The MPFC region from Powers et al. (2013; MNI coordinates 6, 54, 21; 6 mm sphere) and Schurz et al (2014; MNI coordinates \u22121, 56, 24; 6 mm sphere) will be combined into the ROI of MPFC. Peak activations will be extracted from ROIs that reached significance threshold of p &lt; 0.012 with FWE or FDR correction (Bonferroni adjusted accounting for four ROIs) using the MarsBaR function (Matthew et al., 2002). Maximum peak activations will be submitted to statistical analysis and plotted to further characterize the activations for all trial types in these brain regions.\n\nBrain-characteristic correlations:\n\u2022\tFor each participant, beta weights will be extracted from ROIs that reached significance during second-level analyses for both anticipation and consumption stages. The extracted beta weights represent the magnitude of peak activation for each significant ROI, which will be used to test for the degree of association between characteristic measures and anticipation- and consumption-related brain activation. To assess brain-characteristic correlations, we will calculate group-wise Pearson\u2019s partial correlation coefficients separately for individuals with SD and HCs to allow for statistical non-independence (p &lt; 0.05; two-tailed; Poldrack and Mumford, 2009; Ubl et al., 2015). Depression severity measured by the SDS will be controlled. The Fisher r-to-z transformation (Zar, 1996) will be applied to assess the significance of the difference between two correlation coefficients.\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []},

From this moment, anthropologists have questioned the implications of different kinship systems and how they interact with the development of human society (Godelier 2012; Murdock 1949). For example: In Hindi the term \u2018d\u012bd\u012b\u2019 is used to refer to both an elder sister and the elder daughter of a parent\u2019s sibling (i.e. female cousin). Why is it that for native Hindi speakers this is a natural classification, whereas for an English speaker it seems dissonant? Anthropological theory proposes that patterns of social organisation (such as marriage, descent, and residence) prescribe cultural expectations of behaviour (e.g. being cooperative) towards particular categories of kin. The variation in expected behaviour is operationalised by categorizing kin under the same term. Terms that cover multiple relatives can be one of two types, descriptive or classificatory. The initial definition of classificatory kinterms has been interpreted ambiguously over time: here we use the original definition: grouping collateral and lineal kin under a single kinterm (although it could reasonably be extended to include affinal kin, Dole 1972). Under a cultural understanding of kinship terminologies, a person should expect to have similar relationships with all relatives called d\u012bd\u012b, or to use an English example, a person might expect to have similar relationships to a consanguineal uncle and an affinal uncle. Biological understandings of kinship suggest kin-oriented behaviour is primarily driven by improving one\u2019s genetic fitness through the theory of kin-selection (Hamilton\u2019s rule). This idea predicts that cooperative behaviour will occur when the cost to the co-operator (c) is outweighed by the benefit to the recipient (b), multiplied by their relatedness (r, formulated as: br &gt; c, Hamilton, 1964). The cultural classification of kin has been largely ignored in biological studies of kinship, which has resulted in opposing predictions in biological and cultural theories of kinship. If we assume that both the benefit and cost are constant in some hypothetical situation, we would predict that on average an individual would prefer to cooperate with sister over a cousin, or a consanguineal over an affinal uncle, contrary to the cultural prediction of treating them equally. This dichotomy is what we will explore in this experiment. "}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Here we propose that the reason these dichotomous predictions exist is because cultural and biological domains of kinship are at opposing ends of the same scale and that their relative importance is contextually constrained. The influence of each domain is the result of a trade-off between what we call social-cost and genetic-cost. Social-cost is when the cost of not behaving appropriately impacts social standing; for example, not attending a relative\u2019s birthday or excluding them from inheritance. Genetic-cost is when there is impact on genetic fitness; for example, having to save a relative from life-threatening situations, but also caring for relative\u2019s offspring or making marital decisions. With significant variation in kinship organisation, parsing the interaction of these two processes can help explain cross-cultural variation in kin-oriented behaviour, but also unveil how our cultural environment interacts with biological predispositions. We test the predictions across two languages, Indian Hindi and America, where Indian Hindi contains a single classificatory term for elder sister and father\u2019s brother\u2019s elder daughter (d\u012bd\u012b), and English contains distinct terms (sister / cousin). This difference in kinship organisation allows us to test the impact of cultural difference, against the human universal response of kin-selection theory.  \n\nWe therefore propose two hypotheses: \n1. In high social-cost situations, classificatory relationships will be prioritised over genealogical and there will be a difference in behaviour between Indian and English participants\n\n2. In high genetic-cost situations, genealogical relationship will be prioritised over classificatory and there will be no difference in behaviour between Indian and English participants. \n\nThese are operationalised in to 5 scenarios (available in the draft survey attached to the study design section):\n\nScenario 1: high social cost and low genetic cost\n\tBirthday parties\nScenario 2a: low social cost and high genetic cost\n\tBabysitting\nScenario 2b: low social cost and high genetic cost\n\tLife of death situation\nScenario 3: low social cost and low genetic cost\n\tMoving house\nScenario 4: high social cost and high genetic cost\n\tInheritance / Wills"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

From this moment, anthropologists have questioned the implications of different kinship systems and how they interact with the development of human society (Godelier 2012; Murdock 1949). For example: In Hindi the term \u2018d\u012bd\u012b\u2019 is used to refer to both an elder sister and the elder daughter of a parent\u2019s sibling (i.e. female cousin). Why is it that for native Hindi speakers this is a natural classification, whereas for an English speaker it seems dissonant? Anthropological theory proposes that patterns of social organisation (such as marriage, descent, and residence) prescribe cultural expectations of behaviour (e.g. being cooperative) towards particular categories of kin. The variation in expected behaviour is operationalised by categorizing kin under the same term. Terms that cover multiple relatives can be one of two types, descriptive or classificatory. The initial definition of classificatory kinterms has been interpreted ambiguously over time: here we use the original definition: grouping collateral and lineal kin under a single kinterm (although it could reasonably be extended to include affinal kin, Dole 1972). Under a cultural understanding of kinship terminologies, a person should expect to have similar relationships with all relatives called d\u012bd\u012b, or to use an English example, a person might expect to have similar relationships to a consanguineal uncle and an affinal uncle. Biological understandings of kinship suggest kin-oriented behaviour is primarily driven by improving one\u2019s genetic fitness through the theory of kin-selection (Hamilton\u2019s rule). This idea predicts that cooperative behaviour will occur when the cost to the co-operator (c) is outweighed by the benefit to the recipient (b), multiplied by their relatedness (r, formulated as: br &gt; c, Hamilton, 1964). The cultural classification of kin has been largely ignored in biological studies of kinship, which has resulted in opposing predictions in biological and cultural theories of kinship. If we assume that both the benefit and cost are constant in some hypothetical situation, we would predict that on average an individual would prefer to cooperate with sister over a cousin, or a consanguineal over an affinal uncle, contrary to the cultural prediction of treating them equally. This dichotomy is what we will explore in this experiment. ", "q4": "Here we propose that the reason these dichotomous predictions exist is because cultural and biological domains of kinship are at opposing ends of the same scale and that their relative importance is contextually constrained. The influence of each domain is the result of a trade-off between what we call social-cost and genetic-cost. Social-cost is when the cost of not behaving appropriately impacts social standing; for example, not attending a relative\u2019s birthday or excluding them from inheritance. Genetic-cost is when there is impact on genetic fitness; for example, having to save a relative from life-threatening situations, but also caring for relative\u2019s offspring or making marital decisions. With significant variation in kinship organisation, parsing the interaction of these two processes can help explain cross-cultural variation in kin-oriented behaviour, but also unveil how our cultural environment interacts with biological predispositions. We test the predictions across two languages, Indian Hindi and America, where Indian Hindi contains a single classificatory term for elder sister and father\u2019s brother\u2019s elder daughter (d\u012bd\u012b), and English contains distinct terms (sister / cousin). This difference in kinship organisation allows us to test the impact of cultural difference, against the human universal response of kin-selection theory.  \n\nWe therefore propose two hypotheses: \n1. In high social-cost situations, classificatory relationships will be prioritised over genealogical and there will be a difference in behaviour between Indian and English participants\n\n2. In high genetic-cost situations, genealogical relationship will be prioritised over classificatory and there will be no difference in behaviour between Indian and English participants. \n\nThese are operationalised in to 5 scenarios (available in the draft survey attached to the study design section):\n\nScenario 1: high social cost and low genetic cost\n\tBirthday parties\nScenario 2a: low social cost and high genetic cost\n\tBabysitting\nScenario 2b: low social cost and high genetic cost\n\tLife of death situation\nScenario 3: low social cost and low genetic cost\n\tMoving house\nScenario 4: high social cost and high genetic cost\n\tInheritance / Wills", "q5": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.
