The inclusion of the BFI is to provide some \u201cwork\u201d for participants to do; after all, people who are highly motivated to learn about self-esteem should be willing to answer some self-esteem irrelevant items to get to the self-esteem feedback that they desire. The SEIS has been included so we can assess a roughly four-month test-retest reliability of that measure. Afterwards, participants receive genuine information feedback about their trait self-esteem based on their actual scores. That is, participants with low self-esteem (below 25th percentile) get one kind of feedback, whereas participants with high self-esteem (above 75th) get a different feedback. Those in the middle get told that their self-esteem is moderate. (See materials for specific feedback provided.)\nAt the end of the study, we will explain the true purpose of the study to participants in a debriefing form: all that we are interested in is who did this \u2018bonus study\u2019 whose sole reward is learning about their self-esteem (vs cash award). We hypothesize that self-esteem importance scores should be elevated in the study version that is only reinforced with accurate self-esteem feedback, compared to the study version in which cash incentives are used. The logic is that people who think that self-esteem leads to important consequences \u2013 positive or negative \u2013 should be more motivated to learn about their self-esteem levels, since knowing this information should be more consequential in their minds. However, they should not be any more interested in receiving a cash award (a very general and non-specific reinforcer).", "study_type": "Experiment"}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children":

Especially the replacement of a human team member (e.g. with a digital one) is a critical aspect for successful teamwork that is often discussed (Emurian, Canfield, &amp; Brady, 2010; Summers, Humphrey, &amp; Ferris, 2012; Wasen, 2010). Particularly, in the replacement phase aspects of trust and acceptance are critical factors for future successful cooperation.\nTheories of team cognition underline the importance of task and role knowledge as a critical predictor of successful teamwork. In this study, task and role knowledge about a digital team member is applied to hybrid teams consisting of human actors and software agents. Following team as well as human factor research (Venkatesh, Morris, &amp; Davis, 2003), we postulate that role and task knowledge regaring the new digital team member predicts trust and user acceptance before the first collaboration task is done. User acceptance comprises two facets: effort and performance expectancies. Performance expectancies describes the perceived usefulness of a digital system and subsequently, the intention to use or work with it, while effort expectancies describe the perceived efforts that are necessary when working with a digital system (Venkatesh, et al., 2003). Differentiating pre- and post-action processes (Marks, Mathieu, &amp; Zaccaro, 2001) we assume that positive and negative experiences will also influence the effects of role and task knowledge regarding software agents on post action evaluations of trust and user acceptance. Furthermore, we expect that task experiences with respect to the outcomes of the socio-digital collaboration, providing feedback from the task itself, influence the relation between role and task knowledge, trust and user acceptance. Therefore, we integrate theories from team research as well as human factor research, which offer validated evidence, in order to predict human reactions to the staffing of a team with digital software agents. \nIn a laboratory experiment, three team members work on an interdependent task. After one of the team members drops out, it is replaced by artificial intelligence (digital software agent). The remaining two team members are either informed or not informed about the roles and tasks of the software agent and evaluate the software agent before and after the first collaboration task. The research questions are: (1) Does high (vs. low) knowledge about the roles and tasks of digital team members influence the acceptance and trust of the digital team member (T1)?

The given knowledge refered to teamwork (i.e. roles and expertise) and taskwork (i.e. interactions, goals) knowledge. This differentiation from teamwork research (DeChurch &amp; Mesmer-Magnus, 2010b, 2010a) is similarly reflected in human factors. We followed the model of understanding digital systems by Schaefer et al. (2016). Teamwork knowledge related to the facet of \u201cunderstanding of the digital agent\u201d and \u201cself perceived ability\u201d; taskwork knowledge refered to \u201cexpectancy concerning the digital agent\u201d.", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Performance Expectancy and effort expectancy. Both facets of user acceptance were measured with three items each adapted from Venkatesh et al. (2003). E.g., 'I would find the use of the digital agent as a team member useful in the task' for performance expectancy;  'The interaction with the digital agent would be clear and understandable' for effort expectancy (1 = disagree, 6 = strongly agree).\n\nTrust. A three-item scale from Hertel et al. (2019) was slightly adapted to the setting of the experiment, e.g. 'I trust the digital agent completely' or 'I rely heavily on the digital agent' (1 = disagree, 6 = strongly agree).  \n\nExperience. Experience was measured with 3 items. One Item was adapted from Hinkle, Taylor, Fox-Cardamone, and Crook (1989) (\u2018I think that this socio-digital team has worked well together\u2019), and two items were adapted from Hoegl and Gemuenden (2001), e.g. \u2018Looking at the result of the work phase, the task completion in the team can be described as successful\u2019 (1 = disagree, 6 = strongly agree). \n", "q17.uploader": [],
