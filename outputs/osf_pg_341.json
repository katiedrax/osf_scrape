The control group receives no information besides a general introductory vignette, simply reminding them of the past election. The two treatment groups, in addition to the general introduction, receive an experimental prime. The first treatment condition provides information about strong security force presence during the elections. The second treatment condition, in addition to the neutral prime and the information about the security force presence provided above, also provides information about an insurgent attack on a political party convoy. We then measure support for authoritarian policies by asking individuals to evaluate several statements that represent violations of core democratic principles.

In recent years, scholars have argued that public support for democracy and elite commitment to democratic values are on the decline. However, this research typically focuses on measuring abstract notions of support for democracy or ratings of democratic performance. As a result, few studies have considered voters\u2019 commitment to democracy in practice relative to other important considerations. Building on Graham and Svolik (2018) and Svolik (2018), we use fully randomized conjoint analysis to explore the strength of Americans\u2019 commitment to democratic values in a series of hypothetical election scenarios. Our main interest is to determine whether and to what extent voters oppose candidates who do not uphold democratic values. We test a series of competing expectations regarding popular opposition to democratic norm violations versus popular support for voter ID laws, the involvement of legislators in law enforcement investigations, and unwillingness to compromise with partisan opponents. We also investigate (1) which specific democratic values and policy positions are most strongly related to vote choice and how those effects compare; (2) whether voters are more likely to forgive transgressions against democratic values by co-partisan candidates than opposition party candidates (and how that relationship varies by approval of Donald Trump); and (3) whether the the effects of candidates acting undemocratically vary by education, political knowledge, political interest, and/or age. Answers to these questions will help us better understand the strength of Americans\u2019 commitment to democracy and how it operates in the context of competitive partisan elections."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Main effects H1a.

We conduct an online survey experiment on Qualtrics with a sample of approximately 1000 respondents recruited from the online marketplace, Amazon Mechanical Turk. Drawing theoretical inspiration from Graham and Svolik (2018) and Svolik (2018), we present respondents with 10 pairs of hypothetical candidates in an election who randomly vary on seven attributes: name, partisanship, two policy platforms, and three \u201cdemocracy\u201d platforms. The policy platforms concern attitudes toward limited government and cultural conservatism, and the democracy platforms concern voting rights, investigations, and legislative compromise. A complete list of the attributes and levels in our experiment is included at the end of this document. All candidate attribute-levels are randomly selected from a predetermined set of levels. Specifically, candidate names are randomly chosen from a set of 123 names used in Butler and Homola (2017) as signals of race/ethnicity and gender. In our analysis, we will pool names into race/ethnicity and gender categories (i.e., white female, Hispanic male, black female, etc.) and estimate the AMCEs for each category, using the \u201cwhite male\u201d category as a baseline. Note that we opt to use names rather than individual attributes for race/ethnicity and gender to (1) increase the realism of the candidate profiles and (2) use fewer total attributes in the conjoint tables. All other attributes have just two levels; partisanship is randomly selected to be Democrat or Republican, each policy platform is randomly chosen to correspond to a conservative (e.g., \u201cWants to lower taxes on the wealthy\u201d) or liberal (e.g., \u201cWants to raise taxes on the wealthy\u201d) stance, and each democracy platform is randomly chosen to correspond to a democratic norm (e.g., \u201cSaid law enforcement investigations of politicians and their associates should be free of partisan influence.\u201d) or a democratic norm transgression (e.g., \u201cSaid elected officials should supervise law enforcement investigations of politicians and their associates\u201d). The name and partisanship attributes appear first in the table, in that order, but the order of all other attributes is randomized across respondents. After viewing each pair of profiles, respondents are asked to select which candidate they would be more likely to support. They are then asked to rate each candidate on a 4-point favorability scale. They repeat this exercise a total of ten times for each candidate pair. The survey also includes a battery of demographic and attitudinal questions, a series of questions on political knowledge, and an opportunity for respondents to provide written feedback. For our main analysis, we will calculate the average marginal component effects (AMCEs) for each level of each attribute included in the conjoint. AMCEs correspond to the average effect of changing each hypothetical candidate attribute on respondents\u2019 preferences for one candidate over another, relative to a baseline level. Following Hainmueller and Hopkins (2015), we will calculate the AMCEs based on two dichotomous outcome measures: candidate preferred (a dichotomous variable indicating whether or not a given candidate was selected), and candidate rating (a dichotomous measure created from respondents\u2019 rating of each candidate on a 4-point scale, where scores scores above the median indicate that the candidate is preferred and below the median indicate that the candidate is not preferred). We intend to use the AMCE estimates based on the \u201ccandidate preferred\u201d outcome measure for our main results, but will conduct analyses based on the \u201ccandidate rating\u201d outcome measure as a robustness check. The treatment variables in our analysis are sets of dichotomous variables for each attribute, wherein if a given attribute has k levels, we include k - 1 dichotomous variables in our model. We estimate clustered standard errors in which each cluster is a respondent. For our analysis of heterogeneous treatment effects among respondent subgroups, we will first divide respondents into two groups using a predetermined set of criteria for each moderator (i.e., partisanship, Trump approval, political interest, political knowledge, education level, and age; see below). We will then calculate the AMCEs for each group separately and take the difference between the two subgroups for each level of each attribute."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "United States"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "1,000"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "Dartmouth Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects Study #00030030, Modification # MOD00007815"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "13-Sep-18"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q32": {"extra": [], "value": "C90, C83, D72"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e3860f657427b01790c4ce2", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/mnkr5/providers/osfstorage/5e3860f657427b01790c4ce2", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/mnkr5/providers/osfstorage/5e3860f657427b01790c4ce2", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/mnkr5/providers/osfstorage/5e3860f657427b01790c4ce2?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/mnkr5/providers/osfstorage/5e3860f657427b01790c4ce2"}, "attributes": {"etag": "b93bf908c8dbe3032905f80fb780c83f8441069408ce7ed37e3a70c0bb0d6036", "kind": "file", "name": "20181003AA_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e3860f657427b01790c4ce2", "size": 136860, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "51759687e985fcf2cd3ab258773854a6", "sha256": "4c94a66af6b59365826ac029a5cb15c424a82ddb716569c9844f3f1ece938b94"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 136860, "modified": "2020-02-03T18:05:42.396114+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "mnkr5", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20181003AA_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T18:05:42+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "mnkr5", "sha256": "4c94a66af6b59365826ac029a5cb15c424a82ddb716569c9844f3f1ece938b94", "viewUrl": "/project/tkhpw/files/osfstorage/5e3860fdfa39b7017d1dc9fc/", "selectedFileName": "20181003AA_PAP.pdf"}, {"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e3860f957427b01630c58d7", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/mnkr5/providers/osfstorage/5e3860f957427b01630c58d7", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/mnkr5/providers/osfstorage/5e3860f957427b01630c58d7", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/mnkr5/providers/osfstorage/5e3860f957427b01630c58d7?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/mnkr5/providers/osfstorage/5e3860f957427b01630c58d7"}, "attributes": {"etag": "21c5bd4251f933ba974c18170dc8abfabcb7afc3eb20f67329cee388108e3724", "kind": "file", "name": "20181003AA_survey.pdf", "path": "/5e3860f957427b01630c58d7", "size": 322669, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "31225212f351b1757315e5be80a15d59", "sha256": "8a09e80c7b1e5750d178d69d1c2c8932e5115fbd68cbb348575535a9f9d75a1e"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 322669, "modified": "2020-02-03T18:05:45.864879+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "mnkr5", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20181003AA_survey.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T18:05:45+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "mnkr5", "sha256": "8a09e80c7b1e5750d178d69d1c2c8932e5115fbd68cbb348575535a9f9d75a1e", "viewUrl": "/project/tkhpw/files/osfstorage/5e3860fdfa39b7017d1dc9f9/", "selectedFileName": "20181003AA_survey.pdf"}], "value": "20181003AA_PAP.pdf, 20181003AA_survey.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Party, policy, and democracy: What do voters value in candidates?

In recent years, scholars have argued that public support for democracy and elite commitment to democratic values are on the decline. However, this research typically focuses on measuring abstract notions of support for democracy or ratings of democratic performance. As a result, few studies have considered voters\u2019 commitment to democracy in practice relative to other important considerations. Building on Graham and Svolik (2018) and Svolik (2018), we use fully randomized conjoint analysis to explore the strength of Americans\u2019 commitment to democratic values in a series of hypothetical election scenarios. Our main interest is to determine whether and to what extent voters oppose candidates who do not uphold democratic values. We test a series of competing expectations regarding popular opposition to democratic norm violations versus popular support for voter ID laws, the involvement of legislators in law enforcement investigations, and unwillingness to compromise with partisan opponents. We also investigate (1) which specific democratic values and policy positions are most strongly related to vote choice and how those effects compare; (2) whether voters are more likely to forgive transgressions against democratic values by co-partisan candidates than opposition party candidates (and how that relationship varies by approval of Donald Trump); and (3) whether the the effects of candidates acting undemocratically vary by education, political knowledge, political interest, and/or age. Answers to these questions will help us better understand the strength of Americans\u2019 commitment to democracy and how it operates in the context of competitive partisan elections.", "q16": "Main effects H1a.

access to public schooling and have seen significant increases in school enrolment. While this has been a significant achievement, many children in public schools still perform well below expected learning levels. In India, for example, over 60 percent of children aged 6-14 cannot read at the second grade level, despite primary school enrolment rates of over 95 percent. It is clear that citizens in India do care for access to high quality education. Moreover, they are often aware of low levels of learning in govern- ment schools and do express disapproval of government facilities (Dreze and Sen 1995). Yet these concerns do not translate into political demands for improvements in public education, in the way that concerns over the provision of other public services lead to demands for goods such as roads, electricity or water (cite something to support this in India, i.e. that citizens care about, and vote for, the provision of other public goods). This problem raises an important question about the limits to democratic accountability. Why do citizens who are dissatisfied with the quality of public education not voice demand for its improvement by their elected representatives? Such low levels of demands of a service that is poorly provided and has a high impact on citizen welfare is puzzling. Most studies of democratic accountability focus on whether voters punish or reward politicians for services that they deliver. By evaluating and rewarding policies that incumbents delivers, voters ensure that policymakers invest in those policies and enhance overall welfare. This potential welfare enhancing effect of democracy requires voters to raise demands for improvements in public services; absent voter demands for services as crucial as education input it is not a surprise that governments overlook the provision of these inputs.

We provide information on attribution for responsibility for education inputs in government schools in Delhi and examine whether this leads voters to (a) correctly attribute responsibility for these inputs; (b) increase political demands for education inputs; and (c) political participation and interest; (d) prefer candidates that emphasise education inputs over candidates that emphasise other policies in their campaign promises.

However, as of yet we have little knowledge about the tradeoffs that voters make in evaluating former combatants running for office; in particular, we do not know how variance in wartime violence affects post-conflict elections. How do voters evaluate wartime violence against civilians in the context of post-conflict elections in which former combatants run for office? I will conduct a survey experiment which pits hypothetical candidates for governor in Colombia directly against each other; these candidates differ principally on the dimensions of their engagement in civilian victimization. This design helps isolate the effects of various ways that individuals can be involved in civilian targeting on public opinion, therefore filling an important gap in the literatures on both war crimes and post-conflict elections."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Competence: H1) Respondents are more likely to support a male candidate than a female one.
