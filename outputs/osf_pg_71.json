choices by socioeconomic position: a randomized controlled trial in an experimental online supermarket", "description": "People of lower socioeconomic position (SEP) are more likely to have obesity than people of higher SEP and SEP inequities in obesity in Europe are widening (World Health Organization, 2014). Lower socioeconomic position (SEP) is associated with a more energy dense diet (Aggarwal et al., 2011; Monsivais &amp; Drewnowski, 2009). Consumption of more energy dense foods has been consistently linked to higher energy intake in experimental studies (Karl &amp; Roberts, 2014) and results from prospective cohort studies have shown a positive association between energy density (ED) of the total diet and BMI (Karl &amp; Roberts, 2014). Thus, the association between SEP and obesity may be mediated, in part, by the consumption of a more energy-dense diet (Drewnowski &amp; Specter, 2004). Interventions that reduce dietary energy density would benefit public health, particularly among people of lower SEP.\n\nIn the UK, 26% of the adults eat meals out one or more times per week and 20% eat takeaway meals at home one or more times per week, suggesting that the major part of the meals consists in food prepared at home (Goffe et al., 2017). People from lower SEP tend to spend a greater proportion of their average food expenditure on prepared-at-home produce (such as products purchased in supermarkets) as opposed to catering services than people of higher SEP (lowest equivalised disposable income decile group: 74% vs. highest: 60%) (Office for National Statistics, 2019). Thus, nutrition interventions targeting supermarket purchases provide an opportunity to benefit the diet of all of the population and people of lower SEP in particular.\n\nInformation-based nutrition interventions are one of the most common approaches to improving diet (Capewell &amp; Capewell, 2017; Frieden, 2010). An example of an information-based intervention is menu energy labelling in restaurants (VanEpps et al., 2016). This type of interventions has been suggested to be less effective among people of lower compared to higher SEP (Beauchamp et al., 2014; Sarink et al., 2016). However, systematic reviews of the impact of menu energy labelling has highlighted the limited quality of evidence supporting this hypothesis (Crockett et al., 2018; Sarink et al., 2016). It has been suggested that structural interventions that target core features of the food environment (i.e., reducing portion sizes, increasing the availability of heathier food options) and require individuals to use a low level of agency may be most effective and most equitable (Adams et al., 2016; Backholer et al., 2014; Capewell &amp; Capewell, 2017). However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support this hypothesis.\n\nInformation-based interventions typically rely on people being motivated by health in their food choices (Dub\u00e9 &amp; Cantin, 2000). Yet, health may be a less influential motive for food choice among people of lower SEP (Pepper &amp; Nettle, 2017). Thus, SEP based differences in food choice motives, and notably health motivation, may explain why information-based interventions could be less effective among people of lower vs. higher SEP.\n\nThe aim of this study is to examine how an information-based intervention (labelling of lower ED food products) and a structural intervention (greater proportion of lower ED options in food product ranges) affect the ED of food purchases within a virtual online supermarket (Forwood et al., 2015) in participants of lower vs. higher SEP. The primary hypothesis is that labelling will reduce the ED of virtual online supermarket food purchases to a greater extent in participants of higher SEP vs. lower SEP. Conversely, we hypothesise that a greater proportion of lower ED options will decrease the ED of food purchases equally among participants of lower and higher SEP. The secondary hypothesis is that differences in health-based food choice motives in participants of lower vs. higher SEP will mediate the differential effect that ED labelling has on ED of food purchases among participants of lower vs. higher SEP.\n\nAdams, J., Mytton, O., White, M., &amp; Monsivais, P.

This study showed a large main effect (f=0.42) of altering the default order: -4.78% (95%IC: -5.43 to -4.12) of energy from SFA; and a small-to-medium main effect (f=0.12) of offering swaps: -1.48% (95%IC: -2.19 to -0.76) of energy from SFA. Regarding ED reduction, this study showed a small-to-medium main effect (f=0.14) of altering the default order: -5.16 (95%IC: -7.3 to -3.02); and no significant main effect (f=0.04) of offering swaps -1.5 (95% IC: -3.65 to 0.67).\n\nBased on these previous results, we will power our analyses to detect small main effects (f=0.1) of the labelling and increased proportion interventions. In an ANCOVA including four groups (control, labelling, increased proportion, increased proportion &amp; labelling) and one covariate (level of education), to detect a main effect of labelling or increased proportion we will require a sample size of 788 participants (197 per group) for 80% power at \u03b1 = 0.05 (GPower 3.1).\n\nA sample size of 788 participants will allow to detect small interaction effects (f=0.1) of labelling or increased proportion with level of education in an ANCOVA including four groups (control, labelling, increased proportion, increased proportion &amp; labelling) and one covariate (level of education) for 80% power at \u03b1 = 0.05 (GPower 3.1).\n\nTo observe a mediated effect of SEP through health and weight control motives\n\nBased on existing literature we hypothesise that the relationship between SEP and food choice motives will be small-to-medium in size (Pechey et al., 2015). Moreover, in a previous trial we ran using a virtual fast food restaurant (osf.io/ajcr6), we found a small-to-medium correlation between level of education and healthiness motivation (r=0.17) as well as small-to-medium correlation between healthiness motivation and kcal ordered (r=-0.25). Empirical estimates of sample sizes needed for 0.8 power in mediation analyses indicate that samples of \u2248 380 are sufficient to detect mediation through pathways that are small and small-to-moderate in statistical size using bias-corrected bootstrap tests (Fritz &amp; Mackinnon, 2007). Thus, a sample of 788 participants (i.e., 394 per labelling or proportion condition) allow for adequate power in our planned moderated mediation analysis.\n\nWe will recruit a sample of 1,000 participants (= participants who completed the entire study) to account for potential data loss due to incorrect answers, technical problems, failed attention checks, no compliance with the shopping task (up to ~20%) resulting in a minimum sample of 788 participants for our primary analyses.\n\nFritz, M.

If this analysis reveals the predicted significant interaction between labelling or proportion condition and the continuous measure of level of education on mean ED, we will further examine the nature of the interactions by conducting floodlight analysis (Spiller et al., 2013). We will calculate the Johnson\u2013Neyman point defined as the value of educational level for which the effect of labelling (or proportion) reaches statistical significance (Johnson &amp; Neyman, 1936). Values of level of education above this point will correspond to significant differences between the labelling and no labelling conditions (resp. the default and increased proportion conditions) whereas values below the point will not.

We will use the PROCESS macro (Model 15) on SAS software that provides asymmetric bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals for inference about the conditional indirect effects using 5,000 bootstrap samples (Hayes, 2012). Moderated mediation will be tested by determining whether or not the confidence interval for the difference between conditional indirect effects for labelling vs. no labelling conditions (resp. the increased and baseline availability conditions) contains zero.\n\nAnalyses of secondary outcomes\n\nFor descriptive purposes we will code each participant product selection based on the food categories outlined in the shopping list and repeat the primary analysis strategy on each of the 10 food categories individually.\n\nTo further investigate the effect of the interventions and level of education, we will repeat the primary analysis strategy with the following dependent variables:\n-\ton total energy of the foods purchased;\n-\ton energy from total sugar;\n-\ton energy from SFA;\n-\ton salt content;\n-\ton proportion of lower ED foods in the basket of foods purchased;\n-\ton cost of the foods purchased.\n\nWe will also repeat the primary analysis including the interaction between labelling and proportion in the model.\n\nDebriefing questionnaire\n\nWe will explore whether the shopping list was valid and the extent to which participants reported being influenced by calorie content when making food choices.

Conversely, we hypothesise that a greater proportion of lower ED options will decrease the ED of food purchases equally among participants of lower and higher SEP.\n\nThe secondary hypothesis is that differences in health-based food choice motives in participants of lower vs. higher SEP will mediate the differential effect that ED labelling has on ED of food purchases among participants of lower vs. higher SEP.", "q3": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

This study showed a large main effect (f=0.42) of altering the default order: -4.78% (95%IC: -5.43 to -4.12) of energy from SFA; and a small-to-medium main effect (f=0.12) of offering swaps: -1.48% (95%IC: -2.19 to -0.76) of energy from SFA. Regarding ED reduction, this study showed a small-to-medium main effect (f=0.14) of altering the default order: -5.16 (95%IC: -7.3 to -3.02); and no significant main effect (f=0.04) of offering swaps -1.5 (95% IC: -3.65 to 0.67).\n\nBased on these previous results, we will power our analyses to detect small main effects (f=0.1) of the labelling and increased proportion interventions. In an ANCOVA including four groups (control, labelling, increased proportion, increased proportion &amp; labelling) and one covariate (level of education), to detect a main effect of labelling or increased proportion we will require a sample size of 788 participants (197 per group) for 80% power at \u03b1 = 0.05 (GPower 3.1).\n\nA sample size of 788 participants will allow to detect small interaction effects (f=0.1) of labelling or increased proportion with level of education in an ANCOVA including four groups (control, labelling, increased proportion, increased proportion &amp; labelling) and one covariate (level of education) for 80% power at \u03b1 = 0.05 (GPower 3.1).\n\nTo observe a mediated effect of SEP through health and weight control motives\n\nBased on existing literature we hypothesise that the relationship between SEP and food choice motives will be small-to-medium in size (Pechey et al., 2015). Moreover, in a previous trial we ran using a virtual fast food restaurant (osf.io/ajcr6), we found a small-to-medium correlation between level of education and healthiness motivation (r=0.17) as well as small-to-medium correlation between healthiness motivation and kcal ordered (r=-0.25). Empirical estimates of sample sizes needed for 0.8 power in mediation analyses indicate that samples of \u2248 380 are sufficient to detect mediation through pathways that are small and small-to-moderate in statistical size using bias-corrected bootstrap tests (Fritz &amp; Mackinnon, 2007). Thus, a sample of 788 participants (i.e., 394 per labelling or proportion condition) allow for adequate power in our planned moderated mediation analysis.\n\nWe will recruit a sample of 1,000 participants (= participants who completed the entire study) to account for potential data loss due to incorrect answers, technical problems, failed attention checks, no compliance with the shopping task (up to ~20%) resulting in a minimum sample of 788 participants for our primary analyses.\n\nFritz, M.

Equivalised income will be calculated by dividing the after tax household income by the sum of the equivalence value of all the household members: first adult = 1, additional adult or child aged 14 and over = 0.5, child aged 0-13 = 0.3.\n\nSubjective SEP: The measure of the Subjective Social Status using the MacArthur Scale will be coded from 1 to 10.\n\nHealth and weight control food choice motives\nBoth health and weight control scores will be computed by averaging ratings for individual items of each dimension (health motivation: 6 items; weight control motivation: 4 items). Response options range from 1 to 4: 1 = Not at all important; 2 = A little important; 3 = Moderately important; 4 = Very important. Cronbach\u2019s alpha will be calculated as an indicator of internal consistency in order to compare our data with the original study that developed this measure.\n\nBMI: Self-reported height will be recalculated into height in metres (1 ft = 0.3048 m, 1 in = 0.0254 m). Self-reported weight will be recalculated into weight in kilograms. (1 stone = 6.35029 kg, 1 lb = 0.453592 kg). BMI will be calculated as weight (kg) / height (m2). BMI data will be trimmed for implausible values excluding weight for less than 30 kg and more than 250 kg, height for less than 145 cm and more than 3m, BMI &lt; 14 or BMI &gt; 48.\n\nAim guessing: Participants who identify the aim of the study as being to examine the influence of labelling or increased proportion of lower ED/healthier food items on food purchases will be coded as being aware of the study aims. Responses will be independently coded by two researchers, with discrepancies in coding decisions resolved by a third researcher.\n", "q15.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Primary analyses\n\nThe measure of SEP used in our primary analysis will be the level of education because previous research showed that people of higher education were more likely to use nutrition labels (Breck et al., 2014; Cowburn &amp; Stockley, 2008).\n\nANCOVA will be used to test the effect of labelling (categorical variable: yes or no), proportion (categorical variable: default or increased), level of education (continuous variable) and labelling*level of education and proportion*level of education interactions on the mean ED of foods purchased. If this analysis reveals the predicted significant interaction between labelling or proportion condition and the continuous measure of level of education on mean ED, we will further examine the nature of the interactions by conducting floodlight analysis (Spiller et al., 2013). We will calculate the Johnson\u2013Neyman point defined as the value of educational level for which the effect of labelling (or proportion) reaches statistical significance (Johnson &amp; Neyman, 1936). Values of level of education above this point will correspond to significant differences between the labelling and no labelling conditions (resp. the default and increased proportion conditions) whereas values below the point will not. The floodlight analysis will be run using the SAS macro developed by Hayes &amp; Matthes, 2009 (Hayes &amp; Matthes, 2009).\n\nSensitivity analyses\n\nSensitivity analyses will be conducted to examine whether the pattern of results from the primary analyses differ after excluding participants guessing the aims of the study. We will repeat our main analyses with a more stringent criteria for having completed the shopping task as intended (excluding any participants who did not select 10 items in total and 1 item from each category on the shopping list). We will also repeat the main analysis substituting the composite variable level of education by years in higher education as a continuous covariate (ANCOVA) and by highest educational qualification split into lower vs. higher qualification levels as a binary covariate (2x2x2 ANOVA).\n\nWe will report whether sensitivity analyses result in deviations from the pattern of significance to the main analyses (i.e., any significant differences between conditions becoming not significant, and vice versa).\n\nSecondary analyses\n\nModerated mediation analysis\n\nWe will describe health and weight control motivation in the overall sample using mean and standard deviation and report the correlation (Pearson\u2019s) between the health and weight control motivation scores and level of education.\n\nIf the primary analyses suggest that level of education moderates the effect of labelling or proportion on the mean ED of foods purchased (i.e., the labelling*level of education or proportion*level of education interaction is significant), mediation analyses will be performed in order to examine the extent to which 1/ health food choice motive, 2/ weight control food choice motive mediates the effect of level of education on the mean ED.\n\nThe moderated mediation will be tested by estimating the conditional indirect effect of level of education on the mean ED through M for labelling and no labelling conditions (resp. the default and increased proportion conditions) and testing the conditional indirect effect for those conditions using bias-corrected bootstrap. We will use the PROCESS macro (Model 15) on SAS software that provides asymmetric bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals for inference about the conditional indirect effects using 5,000 bootstrap samples (Hayes, 2012). Moderated mediation will be tested by determining whether or not the confidence interval for the difference between conditional indirect effects for labelling vs. no labelling conditions (resp. the increased and baseline availability conditions) contains zero.\n\nAnalyses of secondary outcomes\n\nFor descriptive purposes we will code each participant product selection based on the food categories outlined in the shopping list and repeat the primary analysis strategy on each of the 10 food categories individually.\n\nTo further investigate the effect of the interventions and level of education, we will repeat the primary analysis strategy with the following dependent variables:\n-\ton total energy of the foods purchased;\n-\ton energy from total sugar;\n-\ton energy from SFA;\n-\ton salt content;\n-\ton proportion of lower ED foods in the basket of foods purchased;\n-\ton cost of the foods purchased.\n\nWe will also repeat the primary analysis including the interaction between labelling and proportion in the model.\n\nDebriefing questionnaire\n\nWe will explore whether the shopping list was valid and the extent to which participants reported being influenced by calorie content when making food choices. Responses to the debriefing questionnaire will be analysed.\n-\tWe will report the distribution of responses for validity and kcal influence (mean, SD, median, quartiles Q1 and Q3) in the overall sample.\n-\tTwo ANCOVAs will be run (as in primary analysis) to test the effect of labelling, proportion and level of education on (a) validity and (b) kcal influence to investigate whether the responses differ across conditions and SEP.\n\nFor the labelling conditions only, we will report the percentage of participants who know what the \u201chealthier choice\u201d badge means, i.e., who tick the answer \u201cFewer calories per gram option\u201d.\n\nBreck, A., Cantor, J., Martinez, O., &amp; Elbel, B.
