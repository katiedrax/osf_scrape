Further, we will demonstrate an effect of training group on behaviour using a baseline measure of navigation repeated after training in both groups (positive control).\n \n5) the RL group will demonstrate a reduction in the number of different mazes completed over time due to increasing task demands;\n6) the FN group will demonstrate an increase in the number of different mazes completed over time due to decreasing task demands;\n7) The RL group will demonstrate improved cognitive performance on a baseline measure of navigation post training (positive control); and\n8) The RL group will demonstrate greater improvement in cognitive performance on a baseline measure of navigation post training compared to the FN group (positive control).\n\nSee 'Method+Analyses-KK et al. 2020.pdf'.\n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

In support of our primary microstructural hypotheses, we present behavioural hypotheses to demonstrate the validity of our training paradigm and offer a positive control. \n\nEffects of spatial navigation training on fornix microstructure \n\nBased on the evidence for a role of the posterior hippocampal fornix division in spatial navigation, our main hypothesis is that spatial navigation training will induce an increase in an MRI-based microstructure metric predominantly sensitive to differences in myelin (see 'Planned primary statistical analyses' for detailed description of analyses) in the route learning  (RL) group. \n\nTo support our chief hypothesis, we predict the following:\n\n1)\tRL will induce an increase in a predominantly myelin-sensitive metric (macromolecular proton fraction (MMPF)) within the RL group;\n2)\tRL will induce a greater increase in a predominantly myelin sensitive metric (MMPF) in the posterior compared to the anterior fornix division within the RL group; \n3)\tRL will induce a greater increase in the MMPF in the posterior fornix division in the RL compared to the FN group; and\n4)\tRL will induce a greater increase in a metric predominantly sensitive to myelin (MMPF) compared  with a metric predominantly sensitive to axonal properties (the restricted signal fraction (RSF)) in the posterior fornix division in the RL group.\n\nEffects of spatial navigation training on cognition \n\nIn support of our primary hypotheses predicting the effects of spatial navigation training on fornix microstructure, we will additionally demonstrate the validity of our procedure by showing within group performance change during training in response to the different task demands in both groups. Further, we will demonstrate an effect of training group on behaviour using a baseline measure of navigation repeated after training in both groups (positive control).\n \n5) the RL group will demonstrate a reduction in the number of different mazes completed over time due to increasing task demands;\n6) the FN group will demonstrate an increase in the number of different mazes completed over time due to decreasing task demands;\n7) The RL group will demonstrate improved cognitive performance on a baseline measure of navigation post training (positive control); and\n8) The RL group will demonstrate greater improvement in cognitive performance on a baseline measure of navigation post training compared to the FN group (positive control).\n\nSee 'Method+Analyses-KK et al. 2020.pdf'.\n", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Pearson correlations between time points, pathways (anterior and posterior fornix divisions) and metrics (restricted signal fraction and macromolecular proton fraction) were used as inputs in GLIMMPSE and G*Power to account for variability in correlation among repeated measures (see Table 2). In each instance, the lowest r coefficient among the two metrics (MMPF/RSF), fornix divisions and time points was used to ensure sufficient power for the lowest correlation among repeated measures. Effect sizes were converted (standardised) to Cohen\u2019s d, therefore, the standard deviation was treated as 1, and effect sizes were treated as mean values representing change for each statistical test.

However, in the unlikely event that data may need to be excluded, the following additional exclusion criteria will apply: 1) MRI artefacts in the fornix; 2) participant drop out (failure to complete at least 75% of the spatial navigation training); and 3) failure to complete post-training baseline maze learning task.

Based on results from our repeatability experiment (see FullManuscript.pdf), we have chosen two metrics of interest to include in our primary analyses; one \u2018axon\u2019 metric thought to be predominantly sensitive to axon density  (restricted diffusion signal fraction) in which an increase is not predicted, and one \u2018myelin\u2019 metric predominantly sensitive to microstructural properties specific to myelin (macromolecular proton fraction, MMPF) in which a quantitative increase is indeed predicted.  Our design will test whether a microstructure metric predominantly sensitive to myelin, rather than to axonal morphometric properties, shows a more marked increase in the posterior, compared to the anterior, division of the fornix, after 4 weeks of spatial navigation training. MRI scans will be collected at two time points pre- and post-training. Therefore, our between-subjects variable will be Group (Route Learning /Free Navigation ) and within-subjects variables will include Time (pre-/post-training), Pathway (anterior/posterior hippocampal fornix division) and Metric (myelin/axon).\n\n\tSince multiple comparisons would require Bonferroni correction, thereby restricting the required significance alpha, we aim to include only one myelin-axon metric pair (i.e., MMPF versus RSF) for each statistical test in our primary analyses. Although we predict similar effects in the other combinations of myelin and axon metric pairs, we aim to include these metrics in exploratory analyses only.

Screening for eligibility to participate will be conducted prior to study participation. The screening session will ensure compliance with inclusion/exclusion criteria which include safety eligibility to undergo MRI scanning, normal to mild range anxiety and depression, and at least average range (\u2265 25th percentile) estimated intelligence, working memory, learning, and information processing capacity when compared to test norms (see \u2018Pre-study screening\u2019 for list of assessments). Additional inclusion criteria will include access to a PC/laptop with Windows or Ubuntu, with keyboard, audio and internet (browser Chrome or Firefox). The sample will be randomly allocated to two groups (route learning (RL)  and free navigation (FN) ). Participants will receive monetary compensation for participation and all participation will be contingent upon prior written informed consent provided by each participant. Ethical approval for this study has been granted by Cardiff University\u2019s board of ethics. In the event of participant drop-out, we will continue to test until the sufficient sample size is achieved. The data collection phase of this study is anticipated to be 12 months in duration. Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic data collection will recommence when it is safe to do so.\n\nPre-study screening \n\nPre-study screening will be administered to ensure that both groups are matched according to age, demographics, mood and cognitive ability. \nParticipants will complete the following assessments during screening prior to participation; \n1) a demographics questionnaire (inclusive of yes/no disclosure of relevant medical history); and\n2) a mood questionnaire (DASS: Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995)) where participants within the \u2018normal\u2019 and \u2018mild\u2019 ranges, but not within the \u2018moderate\u2019 or \u2018severe\u2019 ranges, will be included to control for the impact of depression (ie. scores \u2264 13) and anxiety (ie. scores \u2264  9) on cognitive functioning; and \n3) a cognitive screen inclusive of: verbal working memory (Digit Span Task, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV,Wechsler, 2008), visual working memory (Symbol Span, Wechsler Memory Scale IV,Wechsler, 2009), verbal and visual learning, and information processing speed (BIRT Memory and Information Processing Battery, Coughlan, Oddy, &amp; Crawford,2007) and estimate of intelligence  (Test of Premorbid Functioning (TOPF), Wechsler, 2011).\n\nThe cognitive screen will be based on standardised tests, thereby allowing for performance comparison with normative data, which in turn will allow us to include only participants who perform at least within the average range relative to their age-matched peers, to ensure relative homogeneity at baseline and successful achievement of expected training demands. Finally, an MRI safety questionnaire will be administered to screen for safety eligibility to undergo MRI scanning.

The goal of PBT is to improve human wellbeing with evidence-based procedures and processes of change. While PBT has the potential to increase availability and accessibility of resources, more precise tests of its application are needed to clarify its real-world feasibility. The proposed project aims to test the feasibility of the PBT model using an online app intervention (containing two training modules) targeting clinical perfectionism. Clinical perfectionism was chosen because like PBT it is defined by processes (e.g., rigidity around personal standards) rather than specific behaviors or symptoms. It is also transdiagnostic in that perfectionism is relevant to many diagnoses including OCD, OCPD, GAD, and anorexia nervosa. The trainings will teach cognitive variation and motivational variation respectively, two elements of PBT. Cognitive variation refers to responding flexibly to cognitive stimuli (e.g., reappraisal, decentering) whereas motivational variation refers to being able to contact reinforcement for behaviors from various sources (e.g., tangible rewards, values). We hypothesize: (1) the trainings will specifically move the change processes they target (e.g., cognitive variation training will increase cognitive variation), showing precision of procedures, and (2) the change processes will, in turn, move meaningful outcomes, showing relevance of change processes to personal well-being. Support for these hypotheses would provide evidence that the PBT approach is feasible, effective, and can be applied with precision. Future research can build on this work and focus on refining intervention approaches in line with PBT principles to improve quality and accessibility of mental health services.
