background noise: energetic masking (direct interference between the target speech and background noise in the cochlea) and informational masking (interference higher in the auditory pathway) [1]. We have coined the term \"Inf-Int\" to refer specifically to high-level informational masking involving linguistic and cognitive factors and which is influenced by long-term knowledge. For example, background speech in a known language is more distracting than background speech in an unfamiliar language [2]. Inf-Int is currently poorly understood, at least in part because it is extremely difficult to manipulate Inf-Int without altering lower-level informational masking or energetic masking.\n\nThis study aims to explore interference at the word-form level as one possible locus of Inf-Int. This will be achieved by using as a masker an artificial language similar to those typically used in statistical learning studies. Such languages comprise a continuous stream of syllables, with no acoustic cues to segmentation; however, the transition probabilities between adjacent syllables allow listeners to infer and learn the \"words\" which make up the language [3].\n\nThe study will involve 3 tasks: a training task and two subsequent SiN tasks. During the training task, listeners will be taught to recognise the \"words\" present in the artificial language. The two subsequent SiN tasks will require listeners to transcribe sentences presented in one of two types of background masker. In one SiN task, the masker will be derived from the trained artificial language. In the other SiN task, the masker will be derived from a random concatenation of syllables from the artifical language, but containing no \"words\" from the artificial language and no other regular structure.\n\nWe will therefore create a situation in which the background masker is highly similar across the two SiN tasks, but listeners are only aware of word forms in the masker in one of the two tasks. By comparing performance across the two SiN tasks, it should thus be possible to isolate any effect on speech-in-noise perception arising from word-form interference.\n\n[1] Mattys, S. L., Davis, M.

We have coined the term \"Inf-Int\" to refer specifically to high-level informational masking involving linguistic and cognitive factors and which is influenced by long-term knowledge. For example, background speech in a known language is more distracting than background speech in an unfamiliar language [2]. Inf-Int is currently poorly understood, at least in part because it is extremely difficult to manipulate Inf-Int without altering lower-level informational masking or energetic masking.\n\nThis study aims to explore interference at the word-form level as one possible locus of Inf-Int. This will be achieved by using as a masker an artificial language similar to those typically used in statistical learning studies. Such languages comprise a continuous stream of syllables, with no acoustic cues to segmentation; however, the transition probabilities between adjacent syllables allow listeners to infer and learn the \"words\" which make up the language [3].\n\nThe study will involve 3 tasks: a training task and two subsequent SiN tasks. During the training task, listeners will be taught to recognise the \"words\" present in the artificial language. The two subsequent SiN tasks will require listeners to transcribe sentences presented in one of two types of background masker. In one SiN task, the masker will be derived from the trained artificial language. In the other SiN task, the masker will be derived from a random concatenation of syllables from the artifical language, but containing no \"words\" from the artificial language and no other regular structure.\n\nWe will therefore create a situation in which the background masker is highly similar across the two SiN tasks, but listeners are only aware of word forms in the masker in one of the two tasks. By comparing performance across the two SiN tasks, it should thus be possible to isolate any effect on speech-in-noise perception arising from word-form interference.\n\n[1] Mattys, S. L., Davis, M.

We also intend to undertake a multinational survey experiment (Study 3) in the future, for which we will submit another addendum. \u2022 At least in Study 2, we decided not to test Hypothesis 2, which is about the treatment effect on respondents\u2019 belief in \u201cshared values with the U.S.\u201d Retrospectively, we should have considered this variable as a causal mediator. Namely, the exposure to information that U.S. democracy is reduced, which is our treatment variable, may affect whether foreign citizens think that they share many common values and ideals with Americans. Then, this sense of sharing values and ideals may affect whether foreign citizens trust the U.S. as an ally, which is the variable used to test Hypothesis 1. At least in Study 2, we do not undertake causal mediation analysis and focus on examining the treatment effects of the two fundamentally important variables: foreign citizens\u2019 trust in, and perceived effectiveness of, the U.S. as an ally. \u2022 As we did not obtain clear patterns of conditional treatment effects (Hypotheses 4 and 5) in Study 1, we do not examine these effects in Study 2. This decision also derives from our concern that some pre-treatment attitudinal questions, such as respondents\u2019 support for President Trump, may encourage them to provide consistent answers throughout the survey. For example, those who report that they do not support President Trump may also report that they do not trust the U.S. as an ally, regardless of our treatment assignment. This issue was less of a concern in Study 1 because we had a range of filler questions (for another experiment unrelated to our project) between the key pre-treatment questions and the treatment assignment. Study 2, however, is much shorter (about 3 minutes). Therefore, if we added these attitudinal questions, they could contaminate the treatment effects. \u2022 We rephrased and renumbered our hypotheses (see Section C2) and improved our experimental design in various ways (see Section C3)."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "For Study 1, please refer to the original EGAP submission, which includes a pre- analysis plan. \u2022 In Study 2, we re-examine the following two hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 corresponds to Hypotheses 1a and 1b in Study 1. Hypothesis 2 corresponds to Hypotheses 3a and 3b in Study 1. \u2022 Hypothesis 1: Receiving information about the reduction of U.S. democracy will decrease foreign citizens\u2019 belief that the U.S. is a trustworthy ally. We theorize that providing respondents with information that American democracy is in danger due to Russian election interference will reduce foreign citizens\u2019 trust in the U.S. to fulfill its alliance commitment. Because common interests shared by democracies should constitute a foundation of the motivation for the alliance relationship, the logic goes, once this fundamental aspect of U.S. identity is reduced, citizens of allied democracies will also reduce their expectations that the U.S. will have an interest in defending other democracies. Trust is the central dynamic of a military alliance, since each party must trust the other to honor the agreement. Thus, we consider Hypothesis 1 as of the utmost importance for our study. \u2022 Hypothesis 2: Receiving information about Russian election interference will decrease foreign citizens\u2019 belief that the U.S. is an effective ally. Providing information about Russian election interference in the U.S. might convey an impression of U.S. weakness to address external threats. If the U.S. cannot protect one of its core domestic institu- tions from interference by an adversary, its desirability as an ally on purely pragmatic terms might be questioned. A theoretically relevant concept here is effectiveness, which is slightly different from capability. The latter term may imply military strength (e.g., force structure and technical sophistication), rather than the organizational compe- tence and political will to use that strength. We think that the election interference would cast doubt on U.S. will and competence, but perhaps not on the narrow defini- tion of military capability. Effectiveness thus can be seen as a component of a broader conception of capability."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "For Study 1, please refer to the original EGAP submission, which includes a pre- analysis plan. \u2022 We will field a survey experiment using Lancers, a crowd-sourcing platform in Japan. The targeted participants are Japanese adult citizens. \u2022 After obtaining consent from participants, we ask four essential demographic questions. They include each respondent\u2019s (1) highest level of educational attainment (elementary school or junior high school, high school, vocational school, junior college or technical junior college, university and/or graduate school); (2) gender (man, woman, other); (3) age group (18\u201325, 26\u201335, 36\u201345, 46\u201355, 56\u201365, 66 and over); and (4) current place of residence (Hokkaido, ... Okinawa, and a foreign country). \u2022 Based on these four variables, we make 13 strata. The first stratum includes respon- dents living in Okinawa. Because more than 60% of all U.S. bases in Japan are in Okinawa, citizens in Okinawa are expected to have different attitudes toward the al- liance with the U.S. Respondents in other parts of Japan are then divided into 12 strata = 2 (whether or not a respondent\u2019s highest level of education is university or graduate school) \u00d7 2 (whether or not a respondent is a woman; respondents who report \u201cother\u201c are randomly assigned to either \u201cman\u201d or \u201cwoman\u201d) \u00d7 3 (whether or not a respondent\u2019s age is 18\u201335, 36\u201345, or 45 or over).

Respondents in the control group are exposed to no information. Respondents in the two treatment groups are given information about the Russian election interference in recent U.S. elections. As in Study 1, Treat- ment 1 emphasizes that the interference reduced U.S. democracy, while Treatment 2 emphasizes that the interference did not reduce U.S. democracy. \u2022 After the treatment assignment, all respondents are asked the following questions in random order.

We also intend to undertake a multinational survey experiment (Study 3) in the future, for which we will submit another addendum. \u2022 At least in Study 2, we decided not to test Hypothesis 2, which is about the treatment effect on respondents\u2019 belief in \u201cshared values with the U.S.\u201d Retrospectively, we should have considered this variable as a causal mediator. Namely, the exposure to information that U.S. democracy is reduced, which is our treatment variable, may affect whether foreign citizens think that they share many common values and ideals with Americans. Then, this sense of sharing values and ideals may affect whether foreign citizens trust the U.S. as an ally, which is the variable used to test Hypothesis 1. At least in Study 2, we do not undertake causal mediation analysis and focus on examining the treatment effects of the two fundamentally important variables: foreign citizens\u2019 trust in, and perceived effectiveness of, the U.S. as an ally. \u2022 As we did not obtain clear patterns of conditional treatment effects (Hypotheses 4 and 5) in Study 1, we do not examine these effects in Study 2. This decision also derives from our concern that some pre-treatment attitudinal questions, such as respondents\u2019 support for President Trump, may encourage them to provide consistent answers throughout the survey. For example, those who report that they do not support President Trump may also report that they do not trust the U.S. as an ally, regardless of our treatment assignment. This issue was less of a concern in Study 1 because we had a range of filler questions (for another experiment unrelated to our project) between the key pre-treatment questions and the treatment assignment. Study 2, however, is much shorter (about 3 minutes). Therefore, if we added these attitudinal questions, they could contaminate the treatment effects. \u2022 We rephrased and renumbered our hypotheses (see Section C2) and improved our experimental design in various ways (see Section C3).", "q16": "For Study 1, please refer to the original EGAP submission, which includes a pre- analysis plan. \u2022 In Study 2, we re-examine the following two hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 corresponds to Hypotheses 1a and 1b in Study 1. Hypothesis 2 corresponds to Hypotheses 3a and 3b in Study 1. \u2022 Hypothesis 1: Receiving information about the reduction of U.S. democracy will decrease foreign citizens\u2019 belief that the U.S. is a trustworthy ally. We theorize that providing respondents with information that American democracy is in danger due to Russian election interference will reduce foreign citizens\u2019 trust in the U.S. to fulfill its alliance commitment. Because common interests shared by democracies should constitute a foundation of the motivation for the alliance relationship, the logic goes, once this fundamental aspect of U.S. identity is reduced, citizens of allied democracies will also reduce their expectations that the U.S. will have an interest in defending other democracies. Trust is the central dynamic of a military alliance, since each party must trust the other to honor the agreement. Thus, we consider Hypothesis 1 as of the utmost importance for our study. \u2022 Hypothesis 2: Receiving information about Russian election interference will decrease foreign citizens\u2019 belief that the U.S. is an effective ally. Providing information about Russian election interference in the U.S. might convey an impression of U.S. weakness to address external threats. If the U.S. cannot protect one of its core domestic institu- tions from interference by an adversary, its desirability as an ally on purely pragmatic terms might be questioned. A theoretically relevant concept here is effectiveness, which is slightly different from capability. The latter term may imply military strength (e.g., force structure and technical sophistication), rather than the organizational compe- tence and political will to use that strength. We think that the election interference would cast doubt on U.S. will and competence, but perhaps not on the narrow defini- tion of military capability. Effectiveness thus can be seen as a component of a broader conception of capability.", "q17": "For Study 1, please refer to the original EGAP submission, which includes a pre- analysis plan. \u2022 We will field a survey experiment using Lancers, a crowd-sourcing platform in Japan. The targeted participants are Japanese adult citizens. \u2022 After obtaining consent from participants, we ask four essential demographic questions. They include each respondent\u2019s (1) highest level of educational attainment (elementary school or junior high school, high school, vocational school, junior college or technical junior college, university and/or graduate school); (2) gender (man, woman, other); (3) age group (18\u201325, 26\u201335, 36\u201345, 46\u201355, 56\u201365, 66 and over); and (4) current place of residence (Hokkaido, ... Okinawa, and a foreign country). \u2022 Based on these four variables, we make 13 strata. The first stratum includes respon- dents living in Okinawa. Because more than 60% of all U.S. bases in Japan are in Okinawa, citizens in Okinawa are expected to have different attitudes toward the al- liance with the U.S. Respondents in other parts of Japan are then divided into 12 strata = 2 (whether or not a respondent\u2019s highest level of education is university or graduate school) \u00d7 2 (whether or not a respondent is a woman; respondents who report \u201cother\u201c are randomly assigned to either \u201cman\u201d or \u201cwoman\u201d) \u00d7 3 (whether or not a respondent\u2019s age is 18\u201335, 36\u201345, or 45 or over). To improve efficiency in estimation, we will administer block randomization within each stratum. \u2022 Respondents are randomly divided into three groups: Control (p = 1/3), Treatment 1 (p = 1/3), and Treatment 2 (p = 1/3). Respondents in the control group are exposed to no information. Respondents in the two treatment groups are given information about the Russian election interference in recent U.S. elections. As in Study 1, Treat- ment 1 emphasizes that the interference reduced U.S. democracy, while Treatment 2 emphasizes that the interference did not reduce U.S. democracy. \u2022 After the treatment assignment, all respondents are asked the following questions in random order. To provide context, a prompt is added before these questions: Prompt \u201cPlease answer the following questions, assuming that attacks from other countries threaten Japan\u2019s security and that the United States is expected to help defend Japan based on the Japan-US alliance.\u201d Question 1 \u201cDo you believe that the United States will keep its promise to defend Japan, or not?\u201d Question 2 \u201cDo you believe that the United States can defend Japan, or not?\u201d \u2022 The numerical values are assigned to the outcome variables in the following way: Question 1 \u201cI believe the U.S. will keep its promise\u201d (4); \u201cIf anything, I believe the U.S. will keep its promise\u201d (3); \u201cIf anything, I don\u2019t believe the U.S. will keep its promise\u201d (2); and \u201cI don\u2019t believe the U.S. will keep its promise\u201d (1).

As part of our research program aimed to understand demographic changes in Japan and their ramifications, we will field a survey experiment designed to test hypotheses regarding the factors that motivate Japanese skilled workers to emigrate to other countries.", "q16": "\u2022 We test the following main hypotheses using all valid respondents: Hypothesis 1: Japanese skilled workers are motivated to emigrate from Japan per- manently when they are exposed to information about the quality of life, which is reported to be better in foreign countries than in Japan. Hypothesis 2: Japanese skilled workers are motivated to emigrate from Japan per- manently when they are exposed to information about potential risk that Japanese economy and Japan\u2019s natural environment are facing according to some reports. Hypothesis 3: The effect of exposure to information about the quality of life is smaller than the effect of exposure to information about risk. \u2022 In addition, we examine the following exploratory research questions (RQs). RQ 1: On Hypothesis 2, is the effect different depending on whether Japanese skilled workers are exposed to information about economic risk or about risk associated with natural environment? RQ 2: Are Japanese skilled workers with a child/children motivated to help their child/children to pursue a degree at a foreign university when they are exposed to information about the quality of life? RQ 3: Are Japanese skilled workers with a child/children motivated to help their child/children to pursue a degree at a foreign university when they are exposed to information about Japan\u2019s risk? RQ 4: On Hypotheses 1\u20133, are the effects different depending on Japanese skilled workers\u2019 age, gender, income level, whether they have a child/children or their prior experience of living abroad? RQ 5: On Hypotheses 1\u20133, are the effects different depending on Japanese skilled workers\u2019 political attitudes (trust in government, frequency of voting in the past elections)?", "q17": "\u2022 We will field a survey experiment using Lancers, a crowd-sourcing platform in Japan. The targeted participants are Japanese adult citizens (and residents) with a university degree or a higher degree. \u2022 Based on pre-treatment demographic questions (specifically, age, gender, income, having a child/children or not, having lived abroad or not), we make 48 strata and administer block randomization within each stratum. \u2022 Respondents are randomly divided into three groups: Control (p = 1/3), Treatment 1 (p = 1/3), and Treatment 2 (p = 1/3). Respondents in the control group are exposed to no information. Respondents in the two treatment groups are given information about the quality of life in Japan (Treatment 1) or about Japan\u2019s risk (Treatment 2). Furthermore, respondents in Treatment 2 are randomly and equally divided into two subgroups \u2013 those who are exposed to information about economic risk (Treatment 2a) and those who are exposed to information about risk associated with natural environment (Treatment 2b). \u2022 After the treatment assignment, all respondents are asked the following question: \u201cDo you think that there is a possibility, in the future, that you will gather information and/or apply for jobs for the purpose of long-term immigration to foreign countries? (Note: Long-term immigration means living abroad for more than five years and includes the possibility of permanent residence in the future. However, overseas expatriates, such as intra-company transfer, are excluded.)\u201d This first outcome variable is coded 1 if an answer is \u201cYes,\u201d and 0 if an answer is \u201cNo.\u201d \u2022 Respondents with a child/children are also asked the following questions: \u201cDo you think there is a possibility, in the future, that you will gather information for the purpose of helping your child/children obtain a degree at an overseas university or graduate school?\u201d The second outcome variable is coded 1 if the answer is \u201cYes,\u201d and 0 if it is \u201cNo.\u201d \u2022 We ask one factual manipulation check question after the questions for our outcome variables. We ask this question to assess the quality of responses and interpret the nuanced effects of the treatment variables. We do not make subsets of respondents based on this question for subgroup analysis. \u2022 We run OLS regression analysis with all valid responses to test Hypotheses 1\u20133. The baseline for the treatment variables is the control group. The independent variables are the dummy variables for Treatment 1 and Treatment 2. We estimate the average treatment effects (to test Hypotheses 1 and 2) with and without using a set of dummy variables for the pre-stratified blocks. The difference in the two treatment effects (to test Hypothesis 3) is also tested statistically. \u2022 To examine RQ 1, we repeat the above procedure with three (instead of two) dummy variables for Treatment 1, Treatment 2a, and Treatment 2b. The difference in the treatment effect of economic risk and the treatment effect of risk associated with natural environment is tested statistically. \u2022 Similarly, we run OLS regression analysis with all respondents with at least one child to examine RQ 2 and RQ 3. The baseline for the treatment variables is the control group and the model includes two dummy variables for Treatment 1 and Treatment 2 or three dummy variables for Treatment 1, Treatment 2a and Treatment 2b. We estimate the average treatment effects with and without using a set of dummy variables for the pre- stratified blocks. The differences between pairs of coefficients are tested statistically. \u2022 To examine RQ 4 and RQ 5, we estimate treatment effect heterogeneity using pre-treatment variables, including the variables used to make the randomized blocks and the questions about respondents\u2019 trust in government and their frequency of voting in the past elections.", "q18": "Japan", "q19": "2,000", "q20":

While some large political figures, such as President Trump, often ignore and even bash a harsh backlash from the media and public opinion to their uncivil comments, other politicians apologize after making these comments.

Another political candidate, who was running for the North Carolina state House, apologized after an old expletive-filled rant on Mexicans she made surfaced (Specht 2018). However, how much do these apologies matter? Past studies in political science and psychology find that anger expression and incivility are not effective as a persuasion tactic, and can even cause politicians to be viewed less favorably and as unfriendly and incompetent (Brooks and Geer 2007; Brooks 2011; Riet, Schaap, and Kleemans 2018).
