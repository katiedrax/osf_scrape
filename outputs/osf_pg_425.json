Impact of Nationalism on Ideology: We expect that our negative nationalism prompt will shift respondents in a more conservative direction on both political and economic variables. \u2022 Hypothesis 2a: Respondents receiving the prompt respond with more conservative political and economic answers to DV questions. This is our expected response. \u2022 Hypothesis 2b: Respondents are only shifted to be more conservative on political questions. \u2022 Hypothesis 2c: No effect. 3.

With the spread of low-cost hand-held phones to all corners of the globe, the impact of the mobile technology revolution on politics is of great importance. Existing observational studies generally find a positive association between mobile communication and civic and political participation (Campbell and Kwak 2010; Lee et al. 2014), including on violent and non-violent mobilization (Pierskalla and Hollenbach 2013; Manacorda and Tesei 2016). There have been fewer experimental studies, however, on the effect of mobile phone ownership on political engagement. Those studies that have been undertaken focus almost exclusively on the effect of Short Message Service (SMS) texts, or text messages, on inducing voter turnout (Dale and Strauss 2009; Malhotra et al. 2011), shaping vote choice (Buntaine, Bush, Jablonski, Nielson, and Pickering 2016) and eliciting citizen feedback (Grossman et al. 2015a; Grossman et al. 2015b). As a cheap and efficient means to disseminate information in bulk, mobile messaging has been embraced by international organizations, non-governmental organizations, governments and private corporations to reach out to a large number of end-users. In the political realm, this transformation in the intensity and extensity of information exchange between citizens and their governments, especially in non-democratic states where such linkages are traditionally weak, may help to strengthen the citizen-government feedback loop that underpins political accountability (Bailur and Gigler 2014). However, existing experimental research probing the effects of mobile-based informational campaigns on political or civic engagement rarely takes into consideration the mediating effects phone ownership may have. Who holds the phone likely affects who receives information and ultimately who participates in political and civic life. This matters because critical disparities in mobile phone ownership exist both across society and within households. According to existing research, women are 14 percent less likely to own a mobile phone than men in low or middle-income countries (GSMA 2015). The gap is even starker among rural women or between literate and illiterate individuals. One broader implication of this digital divide is informational campaigns designed to empower citizens and improve political accountability may be further marginalizing the marginalized and reinforcing or even worsening social inequality. This study represents the first field experiment to examine the effect of heterogeneous phone ownership on the efficacy of a mobile technology-based informational campaign on inducing civic engagement. Building on the random assignment of mobile phone handsets and SIM cards to a sub-sample of 400 female non-phone owners in December 2015 in rural Tanzania (Roessler, Myamba, Carroll and Nielson 2016), participants will be invited to a land rights workshop to be held at the end of June 2016. All participants will be invited to the land rights workshop via SMS and a follow-up phone call in the same manner\u2014via their best contact, which is their own SIM card if they own a mobile phone or if they don\u2019t own a mobile phone, the number of a family member, friend, or neighbor that they provided us (their alternate contact). The previous random assignment of mobile phones in December 2015 allows us to rigorously test how the impact of mobile phone ownership affects rural women\u2019s participation in a workshop to learn how to secure their land rights through the existing legal and political systems. Our primary analysis leverages the random assignment of phones to identify differences between the phone group, cash placebo and control on our key outcomes: receiving the invitation, signing up for the land rights workshop (both the count of who signs up and how long it takes them to sign up), attendance and participation in the workshop. We will also analyze sub-group effects, including: whether literacy affects overall participation, including of those in the phone group; whether the some 40% of participants in the cash group who bought phones with their cash transfers are more likely to learn of the event, sign-up, and attend the training workshop; whether the gender, relationship, and proximity of the best contact matters for those in the non-phone groups who receive the invitation indirectly; and whether there appear to be spillovers in which those in the non-phone groups are more likely to have learned of the training from others in the phone group. Among those in the phone group, we will also analyze whether more active phone users are more likely to participate, as measured by the study outcomes, compared with less active phone users. It is important to note that some women who were randomly assigned to the phone condition at baseline no longer possessed them at endline, many women in the cash placebo condition used their cash to purchase phones, and some women in the control condition acquired phones in the intervening five months. In experimental terms, this suggests double-sided non-compliance. Thus, the design enables both the assessment of the intent-to-treat effects as well as the complier-average-causal effects or treatment effects on the treated (Gerber and Green 2012). It therefore enables the isolation of the effects of phone ownership on responsiveness to invitations for civic engagement. The rest of this pre-analysis plan is as follows: we motivate why the ownership of mobile phones has political implications; we then provide hypotheses about the effect of mobile phone ownership and detail a research design and protocol to test these hypotheses, including the invitation language and a description of outcomes; finally, we discuss how we will estimate treatment effects. 2-Motivation As mobile phone ownership has become increasingly common in the developing world, governments, NGOs, and international organizations have turned to mobile communication as a means to engage and disseminate information to the public. For example, in Uganda, UNICEF has started a service, U-Report, that allows citizens to send free SMS text messages on public issues such as health, education, and disease outbreaks, with the goal of aggregating citizen preferences and grievances to enable the Ugandan government to better serve its constituents (UNICEF 2005; Blaschke et al. 2013). During the Ebola health crisis in West Africa, the United States\u2019 Centers for Disease Control partnered with major telecommunications companies in the affected countries to disseminate information, including via text messages (or SMS), on how Ebola is spread. Mobile outreach and engagement has enormous potential to deepen linkages between governments (and other service providers) and citizens, and to strengthen the feedback loop that underpins political accountability (Bailur and Gigler 2014). But mobile technology\u2019s promise to close the feedback loop hinges critically on the structure of mobile phone ownership. Who holds the phone determines whose voice is heard and who receives public information. Unequal phone ownership poses a problem for feedback loops that rely on mobile technology. In developing countries, where women are significantly less likely to own phones compared to men (GSMA 2015), organizations that seek to disseminate and gather information risk skewed reach and feedback. In Ghana, the Grameen Foundation\u2019s MOTECH project sought to use mobile phones to provide health information to pregnant women, but discovered the information was not reaching the intended beneficiaries because it was not being shared by male phone owners (Gates 2014). In Uganda, men were twice as likely as women to enroll in the free UNICEF-Uganda citizen-polling platform, U-Report. In two studies on mobile outreach in Uganda\u2014one an HIV/AIDS awareness campaign and the other to elicit citizen feedback on taxation\u2014among registered users, the response rate among men was more than twice that compared to women (Chib et al. 2012; Grossman et al. 2015a). The upshot, as one review article analyzing this problem in the mHealth field concludes, is: \u201cmobile-based programs may inadvertently reinforce the digital divide, particularly in terms of access to information\u201d (Jennings and Gagliardi 2013). A number of factors may account for the low-levels of female participation in mobile-based programming. Consistent with other types of political participation, it could be due to structural differences in economic resources, lower levels of efficacy resulting from clientelism, gender norms or restricted civil liberties (Isaksson et al. 2014); in this study we focus on the direct effect control of technology plays. Our intuition is that unequal mobile phone ownership hinders women\u2019s ability to participate in mobile-based programming. Those who do not personally own a phone, but otherwise want to take advantage of programming and information disseminated through mobile technology, have to rely on others who own phones, such as family members, friends, or neighbors, to pass along messages and calls that are intended for them. Quite ironically like a game of telephone, receiving information second-hand can distort the content of the message or prevent it from reaching the intended recipient at all. This interruption of the flow of information occurs for a wide range of reasons, including human foibles (e.g., forgetfulness), geographic distance between phone holder and intended recipient, or due to the discretionary power of the phone holder\u2014in which they act as information gatekeepers and decide whether or not to pass along the message to the intended recipient. Heretofore, there has been little systematic research on the impact of mobile phone ownership on public mobile campaigns\u2014especially related to gender disparities. Because we are able to leverage the random assignment of phones from the prior separate study, we are uniquely positioned to measure the effect of phone ownership on female participation in a politically relevant gathering. Unlike the breadth of literature on mobile messaging campaigns, our downstream experimental design (Green and Gerber 2002) allows us to estimate the causal effect of phone ownership on participation. By exogenously assigning mobile ownership, we are able to isolate the influence of ownership on participation from the other related causes. We test the impact of mobile phone ownership on civic engagement in the context of a land rights training workshop held by the Tanzanian non-governmental organization, HAKIARDHI. A training workshop on land rights and land tenure makes a good test of direct mobile communication on female civic engagement as prevailing patriarchal norms and interests may affect women\u2019s ability to learn about such opportunities. While formally women\u2019s right to own and inherit land is safeguarded by the 1999 Tanzanian Land Act, in many communities customary practices based on patrilineal principles continue to prevail. Thus, in the case of divorce or death of their husbands women are often denied from inheriting land (Duncan 2015). As a land rights advocacy organization, HAKIARDHI holds a number of training workshops, including those for women to educate them about their legal protections and how to act on their rights. Based on a survey we conducted in May 2016 with the participants, it is clear they see this issue as an important one and are intrinsically interested in learning more about it. In that survey, more than 80% of the respondents viewed lack of equal rights to own and inherit land as an important issue women in Tanzania face and nearly 90% of the participants said they would be interested in attending a workshop to learn more about land and inheritance rights for women."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "The central premise of this study is that mobile phone ownership increases civic engagement by removing the barriers to information access that citizens need to participate in community life. By improving access to information, it should be easier for citizens to take advantage of these opportunities. We expect ownership of a mobile device, which directly receives information about a community gathering, to improve the probability of expressing interest and attending the event, compared to those who must rely on others to transmit information to them (even if these individuals are the self-reported best contacts of the subjects of our study). We also expect higher interest and attendance among: phone owners with higher literacy and socio-economic levels, study participants in the cash and control groups who purchased their own phones, those without phones whose best contact is also female and more socially connected to them, and those in the phone group who are more active users of their phones, as measured by phone usage data from cell service provider, Tigo. From these expectations we develop the following hypotheses: Primary Hypotheses H1: Mobile phone ownership will increase the likelihood that participants sign-up for the land rights workshop compared to the control and cash groups. H2: Mobile phone ownership will reduce the time it takes for participants to register for the land rights workshop compared to the control and cash groups. H3: Mobile phone ownership will increase the likelihood that participants attend the land rights workshop compared to the control and cash groups. Secondary Hypotheses H4: The effects of mobile phone ownership tested in H1 through H3 will be more pronounced among participants in the cash and control groups who purchased phones during the period of our study compared to those who did not purchase a phone in the cash and control group. H5: The effects of mobile phone ownership tested in H1 through H3 will be more pronounced among participants with higher literacy and socio-economic levels, compared to participants with lower literacy and socio-economic levels. H6: The effects of mobile phone ownership tested in H1 through H3 will be more pronounced among participants in the phone group who are active users of their phone, compared to participants who are less active users."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "Exogenous variation in mobile phone ownership This study builds on an existing randomized controlled trial we have conducted in Tanzania, \"Mobile Phones and Women's Empowerment: Phase II of a Field Experiment\" among 400 female Tanzanian non-phone owners from the regions of Rufiji and Kilwa (south of Dar es Salaam by 175 kilometers and 322 kilometers, respectively) (Roessler, Myamba, Carroll and Nielson 2016). The RCT, launched in December 2015 (for a timeline of program events see Appendix 1), entailed the random assignment of 150 participants to a phone group, in which they attended a mobile technology training workshop, received a cost-free Nokia 105 handset, a Tigo sim card, and 10,000 Tanzania Shillings (or roughly $5) in start-up credit. Another 100 were assigned to a cash group, in which participants received the same value as the phone package ($23) in the form of a lump sum unconditional cash transfer. A final 150 participants were assigned to the wait-list control group, in which they will receive a cash grant or phone at the completion of the study (slated for July 2016). The exogenous variation in phone ownership arising from the randomization procedures enables us to rigorously test how phone ownership affects subjects\u2019 ability to learn about and attend a land rights training workshop. To test this, we have partnered again with the Journalists Environmental Association of Tanzania (JET) as well as one of its partners, HAKIRARDHI (the Land Rights Research and Resources Institute). As JET helped to recruit all participants into the original field experiment, assisted with distribution of the phones and cash grants at baseline and will help to distribute phones and cash grants to the participants at endline, HAKIARDHI is leading the training at the workshop and all promotion of the workshop. HAKIARDHI has held land rights training events in Rufiji and Kilwa in the past. Mobile-based Programming Outreach and Heterogeneous Phone Ownership Like other organizations, HAKIARDHI has turned to mobile communication to reduce costs in participant recruitment. The organization sends out SMS and conducts follow-up phone calls to invitees to its programming. Thus in reaching out to the subjects in our study through mobile communication, this represents a natural means of participant outreach. One challenge organizations like HAKIARDHI face in their outreach is that not all potential participants own a phone or SIM card. Traditionally, organizations such as our partner JET, tap into local networks to find and recruit citizens who cannot be reached by mobile phone for their programming. This entails contacting well-connected individuals in local villages, such as the chairmen of community-based organizations, paying them a facilitator fee, and covering their transport costs as they go house-to-house to recruit specific individuals. There are several downsides to this approach. First, it is costly, especially the transport expenses. Second, the NGOs face principal-agent problems. Without close monitoring, the chairmen may turn to individuals with whom they have personal ties or others in their own network to invite to the program. An alternative to using local runners to contact those without phones is to leverage phone sharing as a means to recruit mobile-less participants. Even if a given person may not have a phone, as discussed above, they often know someone\u2014a family member, friend or neighbor\u2014who has a phone who they deem their alternative best contact and through whom they can receive calls or messages. Thus for those without phones, mobile-based programming information intended for them often goes to someone they know who has a phone. In this study, working with HAKIARDHI, we aim to directly reach out to the subjects in our original experiment and invite them to a land rights training workshop\u2014one of which will be held in Kilwa Masoko on June 28 and the other to be held in Rufiji on June 30. In contacting the participants, we aim to reach them as directly as possible and thus give each person the same opportunity to learn about the workshop. For those who own phones (whether in phone group, cash group or control) as of May 2016 (when we conducted a survey with all participants), we will contact them via the phone number associated with their primary SIM card. For those who do not own phones, we will contact them via the phone number they report as the best contact on which to reach them. Following from our phone distribution in December 2015, there is significant variation in phone ownership across study groups. But the variation is not perfectly correlated with the phone distribution. A few in the control group obtained phones since the start of the experiment; an even greater number in the cash group obtained phones as they leveraged their cash grants to buy phones. In the phone group, phone ownership as of May was more than 90%, suggesting potentially meaningful non-compliance, but only 70% in the phone provided us with a SIM number. This discrepancy is puzzling but may partially be due to some respondents not remembering their phone number. Mobile-based Invitation Protocol All the participants will be contacted via an online mass SMS text messaging platform called \u201cFrontlineSMS.\u201d This system has an online interface that sends mass customized messages, including the addition of the recipient\u2019s name in the message . It is compatible with the major cell service carriers in Tanzania such as Tigo, Vodacom, and Airtel. It also provides information on whether messages are delivered and allows one to customize the sent number so participants can respond directly. As a majority of the participants in the study have a Tigo SIM card, we programmed a Tigo number as the reply number. Participants in the study will initially receive two invitational text messages in successive days (10 or 12 days before the training workshops). Then each person will receive a follow-up phone call (7 or 9 days before the training workshop) and a reminder text message the day before the workshop. Again as explained above, subjects in the phone group will receive the messages and call to either the first SIM provided to those who own phones or, for those who do not own phones, to an alternate contact, such as a family member or friend. Three messages will be sent (two initial messages and a reminder message) will explain the details of the workshop. All participants will receive one phone call. The script for the text messages and phone calls, as well as a protocol for the information we provide in response to questions, is found below. We also anticipated common questions and responses to these questions, which we include in the appendix. The first text message will be sent on June 18, 2016 to all participants of the study. It reads: In Kiswahili: Habari [name] HAKIARDHI , haki za ardhi shirika la utetezi wa taifa, ni kuwakaribisha wewe mafunzo juu ya masuala ya haki za ardhi, umiliki wa ardhi na nchi dhamana kupata mikopo ya fedha kwenye [28/06/2016 / 30/06/2016] katika [Serengeti /Kwamiwa] saa tatu asubuhi hadi saa nane mchana.

Three days prior to each workshop, the participants who have confirmed attendance will receive an SMS text message reminder that will again share the details of the workshop. This message will read: REMINDER: Hello [name], you have confirmed attendance to a training on land rights and land tenure with HAKIARDHI on [28/06/2016 / 30/06/2016] at [Serengeti Hall/Kilwa location] at 9:00 a.m. Land rights workshops The land rights workshop in Rufiji will be held at Serengeti Hall at 9 a.m on June 28th. The land rights workshop in Kilwa will be held at Kwamiwa Hall at 9 a.m on June 30th. The workshops will focus specifically on women\u2019s issues when it comes to property ownership and the use of land as collateral. As noted above, Tanzanian women have de jure equality with men under existing land laws, yet face heavy discrimination in practice. The workshop will attempt to address avenues by which women can settle land disputes, specifically educating them about legal recourses to ensure that they are fairly treated. The workshop will also focus on women\u2019s limited access to banks and other financial institutions, and how to safely use land as collateral in order to receive loans. Measuring outcomes Who signs up We can easily measure this by recording who texts or calls back, confirming that they will be attending the workshop. In addition, we can also record when responses are received, to measure whether the treatment has any effect on the timing of the response. Who attends workshop We will prepare a list of all 400 women in our original experiment, and note on that list whether the woman had confirmed her attendance. We will then check off each woman as she registers in person at the workshop. Participation at workshop During the workshop, we will measure the participation of those who attend the workshop, including the duration of comments and number of times that attendees comment at the workshop. Debriefing survey Following the workshop, we will ask each attendee to complete a short survey. The survey instrument will evaluate the attendees understanding of the workshop and willingess to take action in the area of the workshop topic of land rights. Tigo SIM usage data Because of our partnership with Tigo, we are able to access anonymized usage data for women in our study for the six months prior to the workshop. This data includes frequency of SMS and call transmissions, mobile money and data use, data amount used, and whether the account is active. Estimation of Treatment Effects Simple difference-in-means analysis for the outcome measures \u2013 workshop signup, timeliness of signup, attendance, participation, and survey measures \u2013 will be performed comparing the phone treatment group in Roessler et al. 2016 to the waitlist control and cash placebo groups. Regression analysis with demographic covariates will supplement the analysis. This analysis will focus on the intent to treat with random assignment to experimental conditions functioning as the key causal variable in analysis. Additionally, complier-average causal effects will be computed accounting for double-sided non-compliance. That is, some women assigned to receive phones in the treatment group no longer possessed them at endline, some women in the waitlist control acquired phones between baseline and endline, and many women in the cash placebo group used the cash to purchase phones. Due to this measured non-compliance, the treatment effect on the treated is therefore also of interest. This analysis will also be performed with and without the inclusion of demographic covariates as controls. Subgroup analysis through difference-in-means tests and employing regression with covariates will also be undertaken as outlined in the hypotheses. The subject pool will be partitioned into high and low literacy/education groups, active and less-active phone users, and phone and non-phone owners."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Tanzania"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "400"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design", "Field Experiments"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Development", "Gender"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e38454e57427b01740c2e8e", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/hvsc2/providers/osfstorage/5e38454e57427b01740c2e8e", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/hvsc2/providers/osfstorage/5e38454e57427b01740c2e8e", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/hvsc2/providers/osfstorage/5e38454e57427b01740c2e8e?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/hvsc2/providers/osfstorage/5e38454e57427b01740c2e8e"}, "attributes": {"etag": "9586487283894a8475fff2d57819e904a17b5476ad46b5100167db6709171445", "kind": "file", "name": "20160618AA_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e38454e57427b01740c2e8e", "size": 297314, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "331abecf0ca695d3809a4d49978bc8b6", "sha256": "0ae4f93949ef115fbd83855b66199dd1b066652a70361fd419b500fb6dd92212"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 297314, "modified": "2020-02-03T16:07:42.397117+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "hvsc2", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20160618AA_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T16:07:42+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "hvsc2", "sha256": "0ae4f93949ef115fbd83855b66199dd1b066652a70361fd419b500fb6dd92212", "viewUrl": "/project/y3znw/files/osfstorage/5e384553fa39b701691db479/", "selectedFileName": "20160618AA_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20160618AA_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Mobile Phone Ownership and Civic Participation: A Field Experiment in Tanzania", "q2": "Philip Roessler | Flora Myamba | Peter Carroll | Daniel Nielson", "q3": "20160618AA", "q4": "06/18/2016 - 04:00", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to any research activities", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "6/18/16", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "1-Introduction What is the effect of mobile phone ownership on civic and political engagement? With the spread of low-cost hand-held phones to all corners of the globe, the impact of the mobile technology revolution on politics is of great importance. Existing observational studies generally find a positive association between mobile communication and civic and political participation (Campbell and Kwak 2010; Lee et al. 2014), including on violent and non-violent mobilization (Pierskalla and Hollenbach 2013; Manacorda and Tesei 2016). There have been fewer experimental studies, however, on the effect of mobile phone ownership on political engagement. Those studies that have been undertaken focus almost exclusively on the effect of Short Message Service (SMS) texts, or text messages, on inducing voter turnout (Dale and Strauss 2009; Malhotra et al. 2011), shaping vote choice (Buntaine, Bush, Jablonski, Nielson, and Pickering 2016) and eliciting citizen feedback (Grossman et al. 2015a; Grossman et al. 2015b). As a cheap and efficient means to disseminate information in bulk, mobile messaging has been embraced by international organizations, non-governmental organizations, governments and private corporations to reach out to a large number of end-users. In the political realm, this transformation in the intensity and extensity of information exchange between citizens and their governments, especially in non-democratic states where such linkages are traditionally weak, may help to strengthen the citizen-government feedback loop that underpins political accountability (Bailur and Gigler 2014). However, existing experimental research probing the effects of mobile-based informational campaigns on political or civic engagement rarely takes into consideration the mediating effects phone ownership may have. Who holds the phone likely affects who receives information and ultimately who participates in political and civic life. This matters because critical disparities in mobile phone ownership exist both across society and within households. According to existing research, women are 14 percent less likely to own a mobile phone than men in low or middle-income countries (GSMA 2015). The gap is even starker among rural women or between literate and illiterate individuals. One broader implication of this digital divide is informational campaigns designed to empower citizens and improve political accountability may be further marginalizing the marginalized and reinforcing or even worsening social inequality. This study represents the first field experiment to examine the effect of heterogeneous phone ownership on the efficacy of a mobile technology-based informational campaign on inducing civic engagement. Building on the random assignment of mobile phone handsets and SIM cards to a sub-sample of 400 female non-phone owners in December 2015 in rural Tanzania (Roessler, Myamba, Carroll and Nielson 2016), participants will be invited to a land rights workshop to be held at the end of June 2016. All participants will be invited to the land rights workshop via SMS and a follow-up phone call in the same manner\u2014via their best contact, which is their own SIM card if they own a mobile phone or if they don\u2019t own a mobile phone, the number of a family member, friend, or neighbor that they provided us (their alternate contact). The previous random assignment of mobile phones in December 2015 allows us to rigorously test how the impact of mobile phone ownership affects rural women\u2019s participation in a workshop to learn how to secure their land rights through the existing legal and political systems. Our primary analysis leverages the random assignment of phones to identify differences between the phone group, cash placebo and control on our key outcomes: receiving the invitation, signing up for the land rights workshop (both the count of who signs up and how long it takes them to sign up), attendance and participation in the workshop. We will also analyze sub-group effects, including: whether literacy affects overall participation, including of those in the phone group; whether the some 40% of participants in the cash group who bought phones with their cash transfers are more likely to learn of the event, sign-up, and attend the training workshop; whether the gender, relationship, and proximity of the best contact matters for those in the non-phone groups who receive the invitation indirectly; and whether there appear to be spillovers in which those in the non-phone groups are more likely to have learned of the training from others in the phone group. Among those in the phone group, we will also analyze whether more active phone users are more likely to participate, as measured by the study outcomes, compared with less active phone users. It is important to note that some women who were randomly assigned to the phone condition at baseline no longer possessed them at endline, many women in the cash placebo condition used their cash to purchase phones, and some women in the control condition acquired phones in the intervening five months. In experimental terms, this suggests double-sided non-compliance. Thus, the design enables both the assessment of the intent-to-treat effects as well as the complier-average-causal effects or treatment effects on the treated (Gerber and Green 2012). It therefore enables the isolation of the effects of phone ownership on responsiveness to invitations for civic engagement. The rest of this pre-analysis plan is as follows: we motivate why the ownership of mobile phones has political implications; we then provide hypotheses about the effect of mobile phone ownership and detail a research design and protocol to test these hypotheses, including the invitation language and a description of outcomes; finally, we discuss how we will estimate treatment effects. 2-Motivation As mobile phone ownership has become increasingly common in the developing world, governments, NGOs, and international organizations have turned to mobile communication as a means to engage and disseminate information to the public. For example, in Uganda, UNICEF has started a service, U-Report, that allows citizens to send free SMS text messages on public issues such as health, education, and disease outbreaks, with the goal of aggregating citizen preferences and grievances to enable the Ugandan government to better serve its constituents (UNICEF 2005; Blaschke et al. 2013). During the Ebola health crisis in West Africa, the United States\u2019 Centers for Disease Control partnered with major telecommunications companies in the affected countries to disseminate information, including via text messages (or SMS), on how Ebola is spread. Mobile outreach and engagement has enormous potential to deepen linkages between governments (and other service providers) and citizens, and to strengthen the feedback loop that underpins political accountability (Bailur and Gigler 2014). But mobile technology\u2019s promise to close the feedback loop hinges critically on the structure of mobile phone ownership. Who holds the phone determines whose voice is heard and who receives public information. Unequal phone ownership poses a problem for feedback loops that rely on mobile technology. In developing countries, where women are significantly less likely to own phones compared to men (GSMA 2015), organizations that seek to disseminate and gather information risk skewed reach and feedback. In Ghana, the Grameen Foundation\u2019s MOTECH project sought to use mobile phones to provide health information to pregnant women, but discovered the information was not reaching the intended beneficiaries because it was not being shared by male phone owners (Gates 2014). In Uganda, men were twice as likely as women to enroll in the free UNICEF-Uganda citizen-polling platform, U-Report. In two studies on mobile outreach in Uganda\u2014one an HIV/AIDS awareness campaign and the other to elicit citizen feedback on taxation\u2014among registered users, the response rate among men was more than twice that compared to women (Chib et al. 2012; Grossman et al. 2015a). The upshot, as one review article analyzing this problem in the mHealth field concludes, is: \u201cmobile-based programs may inadvertently reinforce the digital divide, particularly in terms of access to information\u201d (Jennings and Gagliardi 2013). A number of factors may account for the low-levels of female participation in mobile-based programming. Consistent with other types of political participation, it could be due to structural differences in economic resources, lower levels of efficacy resulting from clientelism, gender norms or restricted civil liberties (Isaksson et al. 2014); in this study we focus on the direct effect control of technology plays. Our intuition is that unequal mobile phone ownership hinders women\u2019s ability to participate in mobile-based programming. Those who do not personally own a phone, but otherwise want to take advantage of programming and information disseminated through mobile technology, have to rely on others who own phones, such as family members, friends, or neighbors, to pass along messages and calls that are intended for them. Quite ironically like a game of telephone, receiving information second-hand can distort the content of the message or prevent it from reaching the intended recipient at all. This interruption of the flow of information occurs for a wide range of reasons, including human foibles (e.g., forgetfulness), geographic distance between phone holder and intended recipient, or due to the discretionary power of the phone holder\u2014in which they act as information gatekeepers and decide whether or not to pass along the message to the intended recipient. Heretofore, there has been little systematic research on the impact of mobile phone ownership on public mobile campaigns\u2014especially related to gender disparities. Because we are able to leverage the random assignment of phones from the prior separate study, we are uniquely positioned to measure the effect of phone ownership on female participation in a politically relevant gathering. Unlike the breadth of literature on mobile messaging campaigns, our downstream experimental design (Green and Gerber 2002) allows us to estimate the causal effect of phone ownership on participation. By exogenously assigning mobile ownership, we are able to isolate the influence of ownership on participation from the other related causes. We test the impact of mobile phone ownership on civic engagement in the context of a land rights training workshop held by the Tanzanian non-governmental organization, HAKIARDHI. A training workshop on land rights and land tenure makes a good test of direct mobile communication on female civic engagement as prevailing patriarchal norms and interests may affect women\u2019s ability to learn about such opportunities. While formally women\u2019s right to own and inherit land is safeguarded by the 1999 Tanzanian Land Act, in many communities customary practices based on patrilineal principles continue to prevail. Thus, in the case of divorce or death of their husbands women are often denied from inheriting land (Duncan 2015). As a land rights advocacy organization, HAKIARDHI holds a number of training workshops, including those for women to educate them about their legal protections and how to act on their rights. Based on a survey we conducted in May 2016 with the participants, it is clear they see this issue as an important one and are intrinsically interested in learning more about it. In that survey, more than 80% of the respondents viewed lack of equal rights to own and inherit land as an important issue women in Tanzania face and nearly 90% of the participants said they would be interested in attending a workshop to learn more about land and inheritance rights for women.", "q16": "The central premise of this study is that mobile phone ownership increases civic engagement by removing the barriers to information access that citizens need to participate in community life. By improving access to information, it should be easier for citizens to take advantage of these opportunities. We expect ownership of a mobile device, which directly receives information about a community gathering, to improve the probability of expressing interest and attending the event, compared to those who must rely on others to transmit information to them (even if these individuals are the self-reported best contacts of the subjects of our study). We also expect higher interest and attendance among: phone owners with higher literacy and socio-economic levels, study participants in the cash and control groups who purchased their own phones, those without phones whose best contact is also female and more socially connected to them, and those in the phone group who are more active users of their phones, as measured by phone usage data from cell service provider, Tigo. From these expectations we develop the following hypotheses: Primary Hypotheses H1: Mobile phone ownership will increase the likelihood that participants sign-up for the land rights workshop compared to the control and cash groups. H2: Mobile phone ownership will reduce the time it takes for participants to register for the land rights workshop compared to the control and cash groups. H3: Mobile phone ownership will increase the likelihood that participants attend the land rights workshop compared to the control and cash groups. Secondary Hypotheses H4: The effects of mobile phone ownership tested in H1 through H3 will be more pronounced among participants in the cash and control groups who purchased phones during the period of our study compared to those who did not purchase a phone in the cash and control group. H5: The effects of mobile phone ownership tested in H1 through H3 will be more pronounced among participants with higher literacy and socio-economic levels, compared to participants with lower literacy and socio-economic levels. H6: The effects of mobile phone ownership tested in H1 through H3 will be more pronounced among participants in the phone group who are active users of their phone, compared to participants who are less active users.", "q17": "Exogenous variation in mobile phone ownership This study builds on an existing randomized controlled trial we have conducted in Tanzania, \"Mobile Phones and Women's Empowerment: Phase II of a Field Experiment\" among 400 female Tanzanian non-phone owners from the regions of Rufiji and Kilwa (south of Dar es Salaam by 175 kilometers and 322 kilometers, respectively) (Roessler, Myamba, Carroll and Nielson 2016). The RCT, launched in December 2015 (for a timeline of program events see Appendix 1), entailed the random assignment of 150 participants to a phone group, in which they attended a mobile technology training workshop, received a cost-free Nokia 105 handset, a Tigo sim card, and 10,000 Tanzania Shillings (or roughly $5) in start-up credit. Another 100 were assigned to a cash group, in which participants received the same value as the phone package ($23) in the form of a lump sum unconditional cash transfer. A final 150 participants were assigned to the wait-list control group, in which they will receive a cash grant or phone at the completion of the study (slated for July 2016). The exogenous variation in phone ownership arising from the randomization procedures enables us to rigorously test how phone ownership affects subjects\u2019 ability to learn about and attend a land rights training workshop. To test this, we have partnered again with the Journalists Environmental Association of Tanzania (JET) as well as one of its partners, HAKIRARDHI (the Land Rights Research and Resources Institute). As JET helped to recruit all participants into the original field experiment, assisted with distribution of the phones and cash grants at baseline and will help to distribute phones and cash grants to the participants at endline, HAKIARDHI is leading the training at the workshop and all promotion of the workshop. HAKIARDHI has held land rights training events in Rufiji and Kilwa in the past. Mobile-based Programming Outreach and Heterogeneous Phone Ownership Like other organizations, HAKIARDHI has turned to mobile communication to reduce costs in participant recruitment. The organization sends out SMS and conducts follow-up phone calls to invitees to its programming. Thus in reaching out to the subjects in our study through mobile communication, this represents a natural means of participant outreach. One challenge organizations like HAKIARDHI face in their outreach is that not all potential participants own a phone or SIM card. Traditionally, organizations such as our partner JET, tap into local networks to find and recruit citizens who cannot be reached by mobile phone for their programming. This entails contacting well-connected individuals in local villages, such as the chairmen of community-based organizations, paying them a facilitator fee, and covering their transport costs as they go house-to-house to recruit specific individuals. There are several downsides to this approach. First, it is costly, especially the transport expenses. Second, the NGOs face principal-agent problems. Without close monitoring, the chairmen may turn to individuals with whom they have personal ties or others in their own network to invite to the program. An alternative to using local runners to contact those without phones is to leverage phone sharing as a means to recruit mobile-less participants. Even if a given person may not have a phone, as discussed above, they often know someone\u2014a family member, friend or neighbor\u2014who has a phone who they deem their alternative best contact and through whom they can receive calls or messages. Thus for those without phones, mobile-based programming information intended for them often goes to someone they know who has a phone. In this study, working with HAKIARDHI, we aim to directly reach out to the subjects in our original experiment and invite them to a land rights training workshop\u2014one of which will be held in Kilwa Masoko on June 28 and the other to be held in Rufiji on June 30. In contacting the participants, we aim to reach them as directly as possible and thus give each person the same opportunity to learn about the workshop. For those who own phones (whether in phone group, cash group or control) as of May 2016 (when we conducted a survey with all participants), we will contact them via the phone number associated with their primary SIM card. For those who do not own phones, we will contact them via the phone number they report as the best contact on which to reach them. Following from our phone distribution in December 2015, there is significant variation in phone ownership across study groups. But the variation is not perfectly correlated with the phone distribution. A few in the control group obtained phones since the start of the experiment; an even greater number in the cash group obtained phones as they leveraged their cash grants to buy phones. In the phone group, phone ownership as of May was more than 90%, suggesting potentially meaningful non-compliance, but only 70% in the phone provided us with a SIM number. This discrepancy is puzzling but may partially be due to some respondents not remembering their phone number. Mobile-based Invitation Protocol All the participants will be contacted via an online mass SMS text messaging platform called \u201cFrontlineSMS.\u201d This system has an online interface that sends mass customized messages, including the addition of the recipient\u2019s name in the message . It is compatible with the major cell service carriers in Tanzania such as Tigo, Vodacom, and Airtel. It also provides information on whether messages are delivered and allows one to customize the sent number so participants can respond directly. As a majority of the participants in the study have a Tigo SIM card, we programmed a Tigo number as the reply number. Participants in the study will initially receive two invitational text messages in successive days (10 or 12 days before the training workshops). Then each person will receive a follow-up phone call (7 or 9 days before the training workshop) and a reminder text message the day before the workshop. Again as explained above, subjects in the phone group will receive the messages and call to either the first SIM provided to those who own phones or, for those who do not own phones, to an alternate contact, such as a family member or friend. Three messages will be sent (two initial messages and a reminder message) will explain the details of the workshop. All participants will receive one phone call. The script for the text messages and phone calls, as well as a protocol for the information we provide in response to questions, is found below. We also anticipated common questions and responses to these questions, which we include in the appendix. The first text message will be sent on June 18, 2016 to all participants of the study. It reads: In Kiswahili: Habari [name] HAKIARDHI , haki za ardhi shirika la utetezi wa taifa, ni kuwakaribisha wewe mafunzo juu ya masuala ya haki za ardhi, umiliki wa ardhi na nchi dhamana kupata mikopo ya fedha kwenye [28/06/2016 / 30/06/2016] katika [Serengeti /Kwamiwa] saa tatu asubuhi hadi saa nane mchana.

Confirm you participation through this number: [number of on call field assistant]. The second text message will be sent on June 16th to all participants. It reads the exact same as the first text message sent. Three days after the initial message, we will hold a phone bank and call every participant. This allows us to confirm that our message was received and read. The phone banks will be conducted by REPOA field assistants who will adhere to a strict script when addressing participants and answering questions. The script will read as follows: Hello! Am I speaking to [name]? If yes . . . 1.

Three days prior to each workshop, the participants who have confirmed attendance will receive an SMS text message reminder that will again share the details of the workshop. This message will read: REMINDER: Hello [name], you have confirmed attendance to a training on land rights and land tenure with HAKIARDHI on [28/06/2016 / 30/06/2016] at [Serengeti Hall/Kilwa location] at 9:00 a.m. Land rights workshops The land rights workshop in Rufiji will be held at Serengeti Hall at 9 a.m on June 28th. The land rights workshop in Kilwa will be held at Kwamiwa Hall at 9 a.m on June 30th. The workshops will focus specifically on women\u2019s issues when it comes to property ownership and the use of land as collateral. As noted above, Tanzanian women have de jure equality with men under existing land laws, yet face heavy discrimination in practice. The workshop will attempt to address avenues by which women can settle land disputes, specifically educating them about legal recourses to ensure that they are fairly treated. The workshop will also focus on women\u2019s limited access to banks and other financial institutions, and how to safely use land as collateral in order to receive loans. Measuring outcomes Who signs up We can easily measure this by recording who texts or calls back, confirming that they will be attending the workshop. In addition, we can also record when responses are received, to measure whether the treatment has any effect on the timing of the response. Who attends workshop We will prepare a list of all 400 women in our original experiment, and note on that list whether the woman had confirmed her attendance. We will then check off each woman as she registers in person at the workshop. Participation at workshop During the workshop, we will measure the participation of those who attend the workshop, including the duration of comments and number of times that attendees comment at the workshop. Debriefing survey Following the workshop, we will ask each attendee to complete a short survey. The survey instrument will evaluate the attendees understanding of the workshop and willingess to take action in the area of the workshop topic of land rights. Tigo SIM usage data Because of our partnership with Tigo, we are able to access anonymized usage data for women in our study for the six months prior to the workshop. This data includes frequency of SMS and call transmissions, mobile money and data use, data amount used, and whether the account is active. Estimation of Treatment Effects Simple difference-in-means analysis for the outcome measures \u2013 workshop signup, timeliness of signup, attendance, participation, and survey measures \u2013 will be performed comparing the phone treatment group in Roessler et al. 2016 to the waitlist control and cash placebo groups. Regression analysis with demographic covariates will supplement the analysis. This analysis will focus on the intent to treat with random assignment to experimental conditions functioning as the key causal variable in analysis. Additionally, complier-average causal effects will be computed accounting for double-sided non-compliance. That is, some women assigned to receive phones in the treatment group no longer possessed them at endline, some women in the waitlist control acquired phones between baseline and endline, and many women in the cash placebo group used the cash to purchase phones. Due to this measured non-compliance, the treatment effect on the treated is therefore also of interest. This analysis will also be performed with and without the inclusion of demographic covariates as controls. Subgroup analysis through difference-in-means tests and employing regression with covariates will also be undertaken as outlined in the hypotheses. The subject pool will be partitioned into high and low literacy/education groups, active and less-active phone users, and phone and non-phone owners.", "q18": "Tanzania", "q19": "400", "q20": "Yes",

The trend has grown rapidly, with prominent organizations such as FactCheck.org and PolitiFact receiving national recognition and journalism awards. The work of fact-checking organizations is often cited in the media, giving credibility and professional acceptance to this new form of political coverage. There is currently very little literature on the effects of fact-checking. Moreover, existing research on the effects of correcting misperceptions has generated conflicting results. Nyhan and Reifler (2010) found that corrections failed to reduce misperceptions and, in some extreme cases produced a \u201cbackfire effect\u201d in which corrections strengthened misperceptions. Fridkin et al. (2015) showed that fact-checks of negative television advertisements influenced people\u2019s assessments of the accuracy, usefulness, and tone of negative political advertisements. Finally, Nyhan and Reifler (2016) showed that there was no evidence that exposure to fact-checking affected people\u2019s attitudes toward the practice, trust in politicians, or feelings of political efficacy, but exposure to fact-checking did increase how much people knew about contemporary political controversies and debates. The specific objective of this project is to examine the effects of summary fact-checking, an innovation in the field that is becoming more common. This format presents an overview of ratings of the accuracy of a politician\u2019s statements rather than an evaluation of a single statement. Our study will measure the effects of summary fact-checks on a politician\u2019s perceived accuracy and favorability. This project will also compare the effects of summary fact-checks to individual fact-checks that only verify a singular statement. We expect that summary fact-checking will be seen as more comprehensive and less selective than individual fact-checks and may therefore have a greater effect on public perceptions of politicians. Our experiment will therefore assess whether or not the effect of individual fact-checks differs from the effect of summary fact-checks on an individual\u2019s favorability toward a politician or the perceived accuracy of their statements. We will also take the political affiliation of both the participant and the politician into account, so we can determine whether the effects of individual and summary fact-checks vary by whether the target is a co-partisan or an opposition partisan. Finally, we will also consider whether these effects vary by political knowledge and analyze whether exposure to summary or individual fact-checks affects attitudes toward the practice more generally. The results of this experiment will allow us to understand the efficacy of different forms of fact-checking, which may help us better understand how news outlets\u2019 fact-checking practices influence public opinion.

All Turkers are eligible to participate in this study who meet the specified qualifications and did not take part in an earlier pilot study or our first experiment. The sample size will be approximately 2825 to match the sample size in our previous experiments. Researchers have no role in selecting the participants after listing the project on Mechanical Turk. Randomization approach We will use a between-subjects design in which respondents are randomly assigned to one of six conditions by the Qualtrics online survey platform (p=1/6 for each): Summary fact-check treatment conditions: -Fact-checking a Democrat (Harry Reid; asked about him first) -Fact-checking a Republican (Mitch McConnell; asked about him first) Individual fact-check treatment conditions: -Fact-checking a Democrat (Harry Reid; asked about him first) -Fact-checking a Republican (Mitch McConnell; asked about him first) Control conditions (placebo image/text; no fact-check provided): -Asked about perceptions of a Democrat first (Harry Reid) -Asked about perceptions of a Republican first (Mitch McConnell) Participants will first be randomized into one of the three conditions (summary fact-check, individual fact-check, or control) with equal probability (1/3) and then randomized into the Reid or McConnell versions of each with equal probability (1/2). Data collection and blinding Data will be collected on the Qualtrics online survey platform. There may be some online discussion among Mechanical Turk workers about the details of our survey. This cannot be prevented and we hope that these participants preserve the integrity of the research. Primary and secondary outcome measures Our primary outcome variables are perceptions of the favorability and accuracy of the fact-check target (McConnell or Reid) compared to participants in the control group who were asked first about the same person. Each outcome variable will be measured on a five-point scale: The next few questions will be about Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the Majority Leader of the Senate. In general, how often do you think that he makes accurate statements? -All of the time (5) -Most of the time (4) -About half the time (3) -Occasionally (2) -Never (1) Do you have a favorable or unfavorable view of Senator McConnell (R-KY)? -Very favorable (5) -Somewhat favorable (4) -Neither favorable nor unfavorable (3) -Somewhat unfavorable (2) -Very unfavorable (1) The following statement was said by Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY). We would like to know how accurate you believe the statement to be. \u201cI haven't switched my position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.\u201d [changed from 20161104AB due to a potential confound with the content of the individual fact-check treatment] -Very accurate (4) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Not very accurate (2) -Not at all accurate (1) The next few questions will be about Senator Harry Reid (D-NV), the former Majority Leader of the Senate. In general, how often do you think that he makes accurate statements? -All of the time (5) -Most of the time (4) -About half the time (3) -Occasionally (2) -Never (1) Do you have a favorable or unfavorable view of Senator Reid (D-NV)? -Very favorable (5) -Somewhat favorable (4) -Neither favorable nor unfavorable (3) -Somewhat unfavorable (2) -Very unfavorable (1) The following statement was said by Senator Harry Reid (D-NV).

In general, how favorable or unfavorable is your overall opinion of the fact-checking movement in journalism? -Very favorable (6) -Somewhat favorable (5) -Slightly favorable (4) -Slightly unfavorable (3) -Somewhat unfavorable (2) -Very unfavorable (1) Thinking about the amount of fact-checking that you see being performed today by journalists, do you think there should be more fact-checking, the current amount of fact-checking is about right, or there should be less fact-checking? -There should be more fact-checking. (3) -The current amount of fact-checking is about right. (2) -There should be less fact-checking. (1) In general, how often do you think articles published by fact-checkers are accurate? -All of the time (5) -Most of the time (4) -About half the time (3) -Occasionally (2) -Never (1) In presenting the news dealing with political and social issues, do you think fact-checkers deal fairly with all sides or tend to favor one side? -Fact-checkers tend to deal fairly with all sides. (1) -Fact-checkers tend to favor one side. (0) Statistical analyses For each of our analyses, we will use OLS with robust standard errors and estimate ordered probit models with robust standard errors as a robustness check. Unless otherwise noted, all experimental treatment effects will be estimated as intent to treat effects. Leaners will be treated as partisans in our statistical analyses. Perceptions of politicians will only be assessed for the first politician for which outcome measures were collected to avoid contrast effects. Participants\u2019 political knowledge will be assessed with a standard five-question battery that test participant knowledge of U.S. electoral rules and awareness of current political figures. Partisanship is measured on a standard seven-point scale administered via branching questions. Our primary model will be pooled regressions for individuals who saw either candidate, but we will also estimate regressions interacting target politician with fact-checking type (the main explanatory variable). If we cannot reject the null of no difference in effects by target, we will present the pooled model and also present separate results for Reid and McConnell either in the main text or an appendix. If the effects of key explanatory variables differ depending on the fact-checking target, we will present separate models for Reid and McConnell in the main text for expositional clarity and present interactive models in an appendix. We will estimate marginal effects as appropriate when interaction terms are included in our models. (We will also estimate our treatment effect models with standard demographic controls and report these results if the treatment effect estimate is substantively different from the model only including partisan affiliation.) To test H1, we will estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC for the accuracy and favorability outcome measures. To test H2, we will then evaluate b1-b2 directly for each outcome measure. To test H3, we will estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*copartisan+b4*opposition+b5*summaryFCXcopartisan+b6*summaryFCXopposition+b7*individualFCXcopartisan+b8*individualFCXopposition and then estimate b5-b6 and b7-b8. [Per above, we will estimate all pairwise comparisons in treatment effects between partisan groups. However, we expect to encounter power problems given the relatively small number of pure independents and may thus focus on the comparison between the co-partisan and opposition partisan groups.] To test RQ1, we will first estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*knowledge+ b4*summaryFCXknowledge+b5*individualFCXknowledge and then estimate y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*copartisan+b4*opposition+b5*summaryFCXcopartisan+b6*summaryFCXopposition+b7*individualFCXcopartisan+b8*individualFCXopposition +b9*knowledge+b10*summaryFCXknowledge+b11*individualFCXknowledge+b12*copartisanXknowledge+b13*oppositionXknowledge+b14*summaryFCXknowledgeXopposition+b15*individualFCXknowledgeXopposition. In each model, we will estimate whether the effects of the fact-checks vary by political knowledge versus the control group and each other (and, in the latter case, by partisanship as well). We will test whether the effect of knowledge is linear per Hainmueller et al. and follow their recommendations if not. We may also present a simple median split on knowledge in the main text and report the continuous interaction model in the appendix for expositional clarity. We will follow the same procedures for education, grouping all the some college/associate groups together in the continuous measure and treating college/non-college as the relevant binary measure. To test RQ2, we will estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC for individual fact-check opinion measures and the composite fact-check opinion measure (if they scale together) and then estimate b1-b2."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "United States of America"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "2825"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "STUDY00029513"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "4/22/16"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e384ab0fa39b7014e1dc764", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/etrwk/providers/osfstorage/5e384ab0fa39b7014e1dc764", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/etrwk/providers/osfstorage/5e384ab0fa39b7014e1dc764", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/etrwk/providers/osfstorage/5e384ab0fa39b7014e1dc764?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/etrwk/providers/osfstorage/5e384ab0fa39b7014e1dc764"}, "attributes": {"etag": "51c079cc1a1b2ac471b83fdd7170c6ca7ffffdb9d45ce04a0ce7c34432064b71", "kind": "file", "name": "20170112AA_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e384ab0fa39b7014e1dc764", "size": 83183, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "3db0d6fbd5dc05ce37b5aa767a7ee417", "sha256": "548f891d922068e7150d46604357263aae3d1b1c73f4c92949b6395068a990b9"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 83183, "modified": "2020-02-03T16:30:40.874532+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "etrwk", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20170112AA_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T16:30:40+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "etrwk", "sha256": "548f891d922068e7150d46604357263aae3d1b1c73f4c92949b6395068a990b9", "viewUrl": "/project/jrzcm/files/osfstorage/5e384ab6fa39b701741da880/", "selectedFileName": "20170112AA_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20170112AA_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Summary versus individual fact-checking", "q2": "Brendan Nyhan", "q3": "20170112AA", "q4": "01/13/2017 - 03:41", "q5": "Dartmouth College Office of Undergraduate Research", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to assignment of treatment", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "1/12/17", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "[Note: This preregistration is an updated version of our preregistration for EGAP studies 20160507AA and 20161104AB.

Randomization approach We will use a between-subjects design in which respondents are randomly assigned to one of six conditions by the Qualtrics online survey platform (p=1/6 for each): Summary fact-check treatment conditions: -Fact-checking a Democrat (Harry Reid; asked about him first) -Fact-checking a Republican (Mitch McConnell; asked about him first) Individual fact-check treatment conditions: -Fact-checking a Democrat (Harry Reid; asked about him first) -Fact-checking a Republican (Mitch McConnell; asked about him first) Control conditions (placebo image/text; no fact-check provided): -Asked about perceptions of a Democrat first (Harry Reid) -Asked about perceptions of a Republican first (Mitch McConnell) Participants will first be randomized into one of the three conditions (summary fact-check, individual fact-check, or control) with equal probability (1/3) and then randomized into the Reid or McConnell versions of each with equal probability (1/2). Data collection and blinding Data will be collected on the Qualtrics online survey platform. There may be some online discussion among Mechanical Turk workers about the details of our survey. This cannot be prevented and we hope that these participants preserve the integrity of the research. Primary and secondary outcome measures Our primary outcome variables are perceptions of the favorability and accuracy of the fact-check target (McConnell or Reid) compared to participants in the control group who were asked first about the same person. Each outcome variable will be measured on a five-point scale: The next few questions will be about Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the Majority Leader of the Senate. In general, how often do you think that he makes accurate statements? -All of the time (5) -Most of the time (4) -About half the time (3) -Occasionally (2) -Never (1) Do you have a favorable or unfavorable view of Senator McConnell (R-KY)? -Very favorable (5) -Somewhat favorable (4) -Neither favorable nor unfavorable (3) -Somewhat unfavorable (2) -Very unfavorable (1) The following statement was said by Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY). We would like to know how accurate you believe the statement to be. \u201cI haven't switched my position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.\u201d [changed from 20161104AB due to a potential confound with the content of the individual fact-check treatment] -Very accurate (4) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Not very accurate (2) -Not at all accurate (1) The next few questions will be about Senator Harry Reid (D-NV), the former Majority Leader of the Senate. In general, how often do you think that he makes accurate statements? -All of the time (5) -Most of the time (4) -About half the time (3) -Occasionally (2) -Never (1) Do you have a favorable or unfavorable view of Senator Reid (D-NV)? -Very favorable (5) -Somewhat favorable (4) -Neither favorable nor unfavorable (3) -Somewhat unfavorable (2) -Very unfavorable (1) The following statement was said by Senator Harry Reid (D-NV). We would like to know how accurate you believe the statement to be. \u201cI haven't switched my position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.\u201d [changed from 20161104AB due to a potential confound with the content of the individual fact-check treatment] -Very accurate (4) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Not very accurate (2) -Not at all accurate (1) Our secondary outcome variables measure opinions toward fact-checking using the following questions, which will be analyzed separately and also as a composite measure if they scale together using principal components factor analysis. In general, how favorable or unfavorable is your overall opinion of the fact-checking movement in journalism? -Very favorable (6) -Somewhat favorable (5) -Slightly favorable (4) -Slightly unfavorable (3) -Somewhat unfavorable (2) -Very unfavorable (1) Thinking about the amount of fact-checking that you see being performed today by journalists, do you think there should be more fact-checking, the current amount of fact-checking is about right, or there should be less fact-checking? -There should be more fact-checking. (3) -The current amount of fact-checking is about right. (2) -There should be less fact-checking. (1) In general, how often do you think articles published by fact-checkers are accurate? -All of the time (5) -Most of the time (4) -About half the time (3) -Occasionally (2) -Never (1) In presenting the news dealing with political and social issues, do you think fact-checkers deal fairly with all sides or tend to favor one side? -Fact-checkers tend to deal fairly with all sides. (1) -Fact-checkers tend to favor one side. (0) Statistical analyses For each of our analyses, we will use OLS with robust standard errors and estimate ordered probit models with robust standard errors as a robustness check. Unless otherwise noted, all experimental treatment effects will be estimated as intent to treat effects. Leaners will be treated as partisans in our statistical analyses. Perceptions of politicians will only be assessed for the first politician for which outcome measures were collected to avoid contrast effects. Participants\u2019 political knowledge will be assessed with a standard five-question battery that test participant knowledge of U.S. electoral rules and awareness of current political figures. Partisanship is measured on a standard seven-point scale administered via branching questions. Our primary model will be pooled regressions for individuals who saw either candidate, but we will also estimate regressions interacting target politician with fact-checking type (the main explanatory variable). If we cannot reject the null of no difference in effects by target, we will present the pooled model and also present separate results for Reid and McConnell either in the main text or an appendix. If the effects of key explanatory variables differ depending on the fact-checking target, we will present separate models for Reid and McConnell in the main text for expositional clarity and present interactive models in an appendix. We will estimate marginal effects as appropriate when interaction terms are included in our models. (We will also estimate our treatment effect models with standard demographic controls and report these results if the treatment effect estimate is substantively different from the model only including partisan affiliation.) To test H1, we will estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC for the accuracy and favorability outcome measures. To test H2, we will then evaluate b1-b2 directly for each outcome measure. To test H3, we will estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*copartisan+b4*opposition+b5*summaryFCXcopartisan+b6*summaryFCXopposition+b7*individualFCXcopartisan+b8*individualFCXopposition and then estimate b5-b6 and b7-b8. [Per above, we will estimate all pairwise comparisons in treatment effects between partisan groups. However, we expect to encounter power problems given the relatively small number of pure independents and may thus focus on the comparison between the co-partisan and opposition partisan groups.] To test RQ1, we will first estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*knowledge+ b4*summaryFCXknowledge+b5*individualFCXknowledge and then estimate y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*copartisan+b4*opposition+b5*summaryFCXcopartisan+b6*summaryFCXopposition+b7*individualFCXcopartisan+b8*individualFCXopposition +b9*knowledge+b10*summaryFCXknowledge+b11*individualFCXknowledge+b12*copartisanXknowledge+b13*oppositionXknowledge+b14*summaryFCXknowledgeXopposition+b15*individualFCXknowledgeXopposition. In each model, we will estimate whether the effects of the fact-checks vary by political knowledge versus the control group and each other (and, in the latter case, by partisanship as well). We will test whether the effect of knowledge is linear per Hainmueller et al. and follow their recommendations if not. We may also present a simple median split on knowledge in the main text and report the continuous interaction model in the appendix for expositional clarity. We will follow the same procedures for education, grouping all the some college/associate groups together in the continuous measure and treating college/non-college as the relevant binary measure. To test RQ2, we will estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC for individual fact-check opinion measures and the composite fact-check opinion measure (if they scale together) and then estimate b1-b2.", "q18": "United States of America", "q19": "2825", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "STUDY00029513", "q25": "4/22/16", "q26": "Researchers", "q27": "", "q28":

and participation. Yet post-election surveys routinely over-estimate political interest and turnout, often by large margins. While sampling issues no doubt contribute to these inaccuracies, studies of turnout suggest that misreporting is also a substantial issue, even when surveys are self-administered, either online or on paper (Rivers and Wells 2015; Ansolabehere and Hersch 2012). The existing literature relates misreporting to the concept of social desirability bias, which captures the extent to which a survey question elicits answers that are socially (un-)acceptable or (un-)desirable. In most democracies paying attention to politics and voting are considered civic duties and therefore highly desirable behaviours, such that people may be reluctant to admit failing to engage in them. Previous attempts to reduce misreporting rely on a combination of wording and answer strategies (such as forgiving wording and face-saving answering options), as well as anonymity preserving question designs (such as randomized response or the item count technique). Evidence of the effectiveness of these approaches is mixed (Tourangeau & Yan 2007). In this study, we unpack the concept of social desirability and assess to what extent misreporting, in the context of a self-administered online survey might be due to self-regarding psychological processes rather than other-regarding motivations. This is done through a series of survey experiments in the immediate aftermath of the upcoming 2016 British EU referendum. Paulhus (1984, 2002) distinguishes two components of social desirability bias: self-deception and impression management. While self-deception is a relatively unconscious process through which individuals deny their own faults, impression management is a more strategic and conscious process, involving deliberately minimizing one\u2019s mistakes by making excuses and executing other damage control maneuvers. Linking this to the literature on psychological threat and self-integrity (Steele 1988), we argue that misreporting in self-administered online surveys \u2013 where there is no interviewer present for the respondent to impress with their answers (nor, in all likelihood, any other individual who does not already know whether the respondent turned out) \u2013 is likely to be due to self-deception and not impression management. For respondents who did not vote, questions about turnout represent a challenge to the adequacy of the self, leading to defensive responses such as denial and self-deception. Existing strategies for reducing misreporting do not address the self-deception mechanism explicitly, which we believe accounts for their mixed success. Based on the psychological threat literature we develop two distinct approaches towards reducing misreporting: (1) strengthening and affirming the self (see Cohen and Sherman 2014) and (2) contextualizing the sensitive question to reduce its psychological threat."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "The study will assess the performance of the different turnout instruments against actual national and regional turnout rates and against each other to judge their relative performance.

The survey will be fielded by YouGov over two waves, yielding a total sample size of 4,000. Respondents will be randomly assigned to five possible experimental conditions: 1. Baseline: Standard British Election Study (BES) turnout and political attention question 2. Self-Affirmation experiment treatment 3. Self-Affirmation experiment placebo control 4. Contextualization 5. Contextualization with norm-defiance Each of our five hypotheses takes two techniques for eliciting turnout self-reports and predicts that one should reduce turnout misreporting compared to the other. We test for the expected differences in misreporting between techniques in two ways: first, by comparing the accuracy of GB turnout estimates generated using each method; second, by comparing the accuracy of regional turnout estimates generated using each method. We also plan to perform additional validation checks where methods are deemed to successfully reduce turnout misreporting compared to current standard approaches. We deal with each of these three approaches in turn. Accuracy of GB turnout estimates First, we will generate and compare weighted and un-weighted estimates of national (GB) turnout for each of our five experimental conditions. Our overall sample will be designed to be representative of the GB population and the respondents receiving each experimental condition constitute a random sub-sample from this sample. Therefore, the mean number of self-reported voters in each experimental condition represents an un-weighted estimate of turnout under that condition. To get weighted estimates of turnout for each condition, we will incorporate YouGov\u2019s standard survey weights. To allow initial comparison across all of the experimental conditions, we will plot the weighted and un-weighted estimates of turnout under each condition, together with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. To test the pairwise comparisons implied by H1-H5 more directly, we will perform five z-tests for differences-in-(weighted-)means: \u2022 for H1, baseline vs. self-affirmation treatment \u2022 for H2, self-affirmation placebo vs. self-affirmation treatment \u2022 for H3, baseline vs. norm-compliant contextualization \u2022 for H4, baseline vs. norm-defiant contextualization \u2022 for H5 norm-compliant vs. norm-defiant contextualization Note that, when interpreting these comparisons, a method which reduces average turnout estimates compared to the standard turnout question is taken to reduce turnout misreporting. This assumes that the reduction in estimated turnout results from a reduction in the number of non-voting respondents who nevertheless report voting. Accuracy of regional turnout estimates Our comparisons of GB turnout estimates under the different experimental conditions can be considered our \u2018headline\u2019 results, but a method might reduce average turnout estimates for the wrong reasons. How can we check that this is not happening? Ideally, we would use validated measures of respondent turnout to do this: armed with validated turnout measures for each respondent, we could further test our hypotheses by checking whether the number of non-voting respondents who nevertheless report voting declines as expected. Unfortunately, we do not envisage having access to validated voting measures for individual respondents, as we are unaware of a validated vote study taking place following the EU referendum. But while we cannot observe the true turnout behavior of individual survey respondents, we can nevertheless observe true turnout behavior at levels of aggregation that are lower than the national level. We will take advantage of this to test our hypotheses at lower levels of aggregation. Specifically, for each experimental condition we will estimate referendum turnout rates in each of the eleven Government Office Regions of Britain, and compare these estimates to each other and to the known referendum turnout rates in each region. We will obtain region identifiers for each respondent from YouGov. However, disaggregating the respondents in each of our five experimental according to their region of residence will leave a relatively small number of observations in each condition-region sub-sample: with 800 respondents in each experimental condition and 11 regions, we would have on average 73 respondents in each group. To overcome problems of noise and sampling error in such sparse sub-samples, we will generate our regional estimates of turnout multilevel regression and poststratification using (MRP) (Park, Gelman and Bafumi 2004; Lax and Philips 2009), as follows: \u2022 Step 1. Estimate a logistic regression model of turnout as a function of respondent demographic characteristics (gender, age group, social grade, highest educational qualification), with intercepts that vary randomly by region and by experimental condition. \u2022 Step 2. Based on the model from Step 1, generate fitted probabilities of turnout for each possible demographic type of respondent (as defined by the demographic predictors in the regression) in each possible region and under each possible experimental condition. \u2022 Step 3. For each combination of region and experimental condition, generate an estimated turnout rate via a weighted average of the fitted probabilities from step 2, weighted according to the number of people of each demographic \u2018type\u2019 in the region (as observed from census data). This process will yield five estimates of EU referendum turnout for each region. We will first compare the five estimates for each region (and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals) graphically. We will then perform more systematic tests of Hypotheses H1-H5 by comparing posterior distributions: specifically, for each pairwise comparison implied by each individual hypothesis, we will calculate the number of regions for which we can be 95% confident (based on draws from the posterior distribution) that the predicted turnout rate under one condition is lower than that under the other condition. For example, with respect to H1, we would calculate the number of regions for which we can say with 95% confidence that predicted turnout under the self-affirmation treatment is lower than that under the standard turnout question. We will also compute the mean, median, and maximum difference in predicted turnout rates across regions, for each pairwise comparison of methods. Additional validation checks Where experimental treatments appear to correct turnout misreporting according to inspection of national and regional turnout estimates, we will also perform additional validation checks. First, we will inspect item nonresponse and `don\u2019t know\u2019 rates under each experimental condition. One possibility is that some methods might reduce turnout estimates only by increasing item nonresponse, particularly among those who would normally report voting under a standard turnout question. Second, we will estimate demographic models of turnout under each experimental condition, regressing self-reported turnout on self-reported party identification, gender, age group, and highest education qualification. This will result in five models of turnout, which can be compared to each other and to a benchmark model of turnout estimated based on validated vote data from the 2015 British Election Study. One drawback with this benchmark, is that the mechanisms determining turnout (and by implication mis-reporting) are likely to be different for the EU referendum compared to the 2015 General Election. (For example, in the case of the EU referendum, party cues are much weaker in this campaign, and therefore the relationship between party ID and turnout may be different to the 2015 General Election). However, in the absence of validated vote data for the EU referendum, the 2015 validated vote model will at least serve as a benchmark against which we can compare our experiment-based models, to see whether the demographic patterns in turnout are broadly consistent across the different models."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "United Kingdom"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "4000"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "NA"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "NA"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q27": {"extra": [], "value": "YouGov Omnibus Surveys"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design", "Statistics", "Survey Methodology"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Elections"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Reducing Misreporting due to Psychological Threat: An Experimental Design", "q2": "Patrick M Kuhn | Nick Vivyan", "q3": "20160617AA", "q4": "06/17/2016 - 10:26", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to assignment of treatment", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "6/24/16", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "No", "q15": "Political scientists require accurate survey-based measures of turnout and political interest to evaluate individual level models of political attitudes and participation.
