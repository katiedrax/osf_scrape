For example, in the familiar white-note diatonic scale, the pitch class C and the C major chord are generally perceived as stable while the pitch class B and the G major chord are perceived as unstable (Milne et al. 2015).\n\nRecent research has indicated that these feelings of stability and instability may be mediated by spectral pitch similarity (Milne et al. 2015). For example, with respect to the white-note diatonic scale, the unstable pitch class B has lower spectral pitch class similarity than does the stable pitch class C; the unstable chord G major has lower spectral pitch class similarity than does the stable chord C major. It was further hypothesised that a sequence of chords where there is low spectral similarity between the first and second chord, but high spectral similarity between the first and third and between the second and third enhances the perceived stability of that third chord (Milne 2010, Milne et al. 2015).\n\nThis experiment investigates whether these effects generalize to sequences of unfamiliar sounding inharmonic spectra. (Inharmonic spectra give a sensation of vague, ambiguous, or multiple pitches.) A positive result would support the proposition that tonality \u2013 hierarchies of stability \u2013 in Western music has psychoacoustic influences or origins.\n\nThe experiment comprises an exposure phase where participants learn to associate five different sounds with colours. They hear the sounds played in random order and consistently associated with a colour. They then hear each sound without any colour showing and are asked to indicate the matching colour. This is repeated twice. After this exposure phase, they then listen to 30 different three-sound sequences (each sound from the exposure set). They rate the \"stability\" of the final sound.

infancy/toddlerhood, and later language outcomes. Recent work has reported that power in the gamma frequency range (25-45 Hz) is associated with both SES and later language outcomes (Benasich et al., 2008; Brito et al., 2016; Gabard-Durnam et al., 2017). Specifically, lower socioeconomic status has been associated with reduced gamma power (Cantiani, Piazza, Mornati, Molteni, &amp; Riva, 2019), specifically frontal gamma power (Tomalski et al., 2013). On the other hand, higher frontal gamma power in infancy/toddlerhood is associated with better language outcomes in early childhood (Gou, Choudhury, &amp; Benasich, 2011) and no history of familial language impairment (Benasich, Gou, Choudhury, &amp; Harris, 2008). Thus, there is a rising interest in early experience\u2019s impact on frontal gamma power and subsequent language development.\nHowever, resting gamma power is typically only a small portion of the total EEG power spectrum and has been shown to at least partially be contaminated by oculo-motor artifacts (Hipp &amp; Siegel, 2013), a particularly difficult problem in young infants. Thus, we are interested in testing the conceptual replicability of relations between frontal gamma power and SES/language across three independent datasets by: 1) examining the presence of gamma in infants as well as 2) its relations to early adverse environmental characteristics and later language outcomes. Moreover, we will test the specificity of these relations to gamma as opposed to other frequency bands or overall shifts in the entire power spectrum. \n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Our hypothesis is that we will be unable to find relations between frontal gamma power in infancy and socioeconomic status in three independent datasets.

All recordings will be processed in the same way. First, data from 10 electrodes will be filtered with a 0.5Hz highpass filter and 50Hz lowpass hamming FIR filter. Resting state data will be epoched into 1 second epochs and baseline corrected over the entire epoch. Any epoch with a channel greater than +/-200mv activity was rejected. The data will then be re-referenced to the average of the electrodes. Frontal gamma power will be measured after a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the power spectrum and defined as the mean power in the 25-45Hz range at electrodes F3 and F4 during resting state in infants. The 25-45Hz range was determined based on previous work examining gamma in infants/toddlerhood (Brito et al., 2017; Gabard-Durnam et al., 2019).\n\nSES/adversity:\nThe three independent datasets (described in section 5 below) being utilized in this study include different measures of SES/adversity. In two datasets, level of maternal education will be used as SES.

Recent work has reported that power in the gamma frequency range (25-45 Hz) is associated with both SES and later language outcomes (Benasich et al., 2008; Brito et al., 2016; Gabard-Durnam et al., 2017). Specifically, lower socioeconomic status has been associated with reduced gamma power (Cantiani, Piazza, Mornati, Molteni, &amp; Riva, 2019), specifically frontal gamma power (Tomalski et al., 2013). On the other hand, higher frontal gamma power in infancy/toddlerhood is associated with better language outcomes in early childhood (Gou, Choudhury, &amp; Benasich, 2011) and no history of familial language impairment (Benasich, Gou, Choudhury, &amp; Harris, 2008). Thus, there is a rising interest in early experience\u2019s impact on frontal gamma power and subsequent language development.\nHowever, resting gamma power is typically only a small portion of the total EEG power spectrum and has been shown to at least partially be contaminated by oculo-motor artifacts (Hipp &amp; Siegel, 2013), a particularly difficult problem in young infants. Thus, we are interested in testing the conceptual replicability of relations between frontal gamma power and SES/language across three independent datasets by: 1) examining the presence of gamma in infants as well as 2) its relations to early adverse environmental characteristics and later language outcomes.
