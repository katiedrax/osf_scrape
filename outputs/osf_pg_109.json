Wright, Whitney R. Ringwald"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "The purpose of the study is to investigate the relationships between state and trait empathy and alcohol use in a large sample of young adults using ecological momentary assessment methodology.\nAlcohol is one of the most widely consumed psychoactive substances in the world. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, about 70% of people in the United States over the age of 18 reported drinking in the past year and about 50% reported drinking in the past month (NSDUH, 2018). Excessive alcohol use can increase the risk of health problems and is associated with adverse psychological and social consequences. In fact, excessive alcohol use is responsible for around 88,000 deaths each year, including 1 in 10 deaths among working age adults (CDC, 2019). \nAlcohol is best described as a social drug because it is most often consumed in social contexts such as bars, parties, and social gatherings (Fairbairn &amp; Sayette, 2014; Hendriks et al., 2018). Alcohol consumption plays a particularly large role in young people\u2019s social identity exploration, and expectancies of social facilitation are especially powerful in young adult drinkers (Rideout et al., 2012; Patrick et al., 2011). The importance of the social context of alcohol use is also apparent from research that demonstrates robust effects of peer influence, social norms, and social networks on young adult alcohol consumption (Bot et al., 2005; Maxwell et al., 2005; Urberg et al., 2003). Therefore, identifying relevant social factors in the etiology of alcohol use problems is particularly important and can better inform prevention strategies against risky drinking behavior (Creswell et al., 2012).\nThe present study will focus on empathy as it relates to alcohol use because of the critical role empathy plays in social relationships. Empathy is typically defined as the capacity to understand another\u2019s perspective or mental state (cognitive empathy) and the capacity to respond with an appropriate emotion to another\u2019s emotional state (affective empathy) (Hoffman, 1982; Riggio et al., 1989). The ability to empathize with others is vital for everyday social interactions and for the development and maintenance of long-term relationships (Ashington &amp; Jenkins, 1995; de Waal, 2008; Goldstein &amp; Winner, 2012). Empathy has been construed as both a between-person (trait level) and within-person (state level) construct (Graaff et al., 2015; Nezlek et al., 2001; Nezlek et al., 2007). Trait empathy can be thought of as a general tendency for a person to show empathy, whereas state empathy can be thought of as a person\u2019s fluctuations in empathy in response to particular interpersonal interactions (Graaff et al., 2015; Nezlek et al., 2001) or features of the social context (Zaki, 2014). The motivated model of empathy suggests that people are either driven to employ empathy or to avoid it (Zaki, 2014). Positive affect, affiliation, and social desirability typically motivate people to approach empathy, whereas competition, material costs, and cognitive costs typically motivate people to avoid empathy (Cameron et al., 2019; Zaki, 2014). This theory suggests that empathy is an adaptive process, and that people are more or less motivated to empathize depending on particular characteristics of the social context. Thus, though people show individual differences in average empathy (trait empathy), they can also fluctuate and shift meaningfully in their empathy across situations (state empathy). Importantly, state and trait empathy have been shown to function mathematically independent of one other, with each explaining some of the variance in empathy (Nezlek et al., 2007).\nSocial processes play an instrumental role in the development of alcohol problems (Sher et al., 2005), and empathy may be a particularly important social construct when considering risk. Several cross-sectional studies have found deficits in empathy for clinical samples of alcohol dependent individuals. Compared with controls, adults with alcohol dependence exhibited impairments in recognizing facial expressions of positive and negative emotions (Kornreich et al., 2002; Kornreich et al., 2013; Maurage et al., 2011a) and showed impairments in theory of mind (i.e., the ability to attribute mental states to others) and trait empathy (Bosco et al., 2013; Dethier &amp; Blairy, 2012; Erol et al., 2016; Martinotti et al., 2009; Mohagheghi et al., 2015; Thoma et al., 2013), with particular impairments in affective (versus cognitive) empathy (Gizewski et al., 2013; Maurage et al., 2011b).\nA few cross-sectional studies have also examined links between low trait empathy and increased alcohol consumption and problems in non-clinical samples. In a sample of African American adolescents, low trait empathy was associated with lower drug refusal self-efficacy and greater past 30-day drug use, but analyses were not conducted separately for cognitive versus affective empathy (Nguyen et al., 2011). In Italian adolescents, deficits in affective (but not cognitive) empathy were associated with binge drinking (Laghi et al., 2019a) and, in the presence of high conformity, impaired theory of mind was associated with more binge drinking episodes (Laghi et al., 2019b). Further, in a sample of French adolescents, both cognitive and affective empathy were found to be associated with alcohol problems and binge drinking (Lannoy et al., 2020). Finally, low emotional intelligence (of which empathy is a facet; Salovey et al., 2004) has been linked to greater past week and past month alcohol consumption in American middle-school students and with more heavy episodic drinking and more alcohol problems in Australian adults (Schutte et al., 2010; Trinidad &amp; Johnson, 2000). \nTaken together, results from both clinical and non-clinical samples suggest that deficits in trait empathy are associated with increased alcohol consumption and more alcohol-related problems. We are unaware of prior studies that examined the relationships between state empathy and alcohol use or problems, however. Research on related constructs highlights why this work might be important. For instance, fluctuating mood states, which are context dependent, have been shown to robustly influence the direction, intensity, and persistence of a wide range of human behaviors (Holzahauer et al., 2020; Gardner, 1985; Gendolla, 2000; Gendolla &amp; Brinkmann, 2005). Additionally, meaningful within\u2010person variability in the Big Five personality traits has helped to explain important trait-content manifestations of behavior (Ching et al., 2014; Fleeson, 2007; Fleeson &amp; Glallagher, 2009; Geukes et al., 2017).  In general, more research is needed to explore associations between empathy and alcohol use and, in particular, the extent to which trait (versus state) empathy and cognitive (versus affective) empathy is linked to alcohol use. \nThe goal of the current study is to advance knowledge about the association between empathy and alcohol use by examining these variables in a well-powered (n=1,080) sample of young adults using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodology. This study design allowed us to collect daily reports of alcohol use, thereby eliminating recall bias, and to assess empathy engagement (both affective and cognitive) multiple times per day, thus providing a measure of state-level empathy. As such, this study provides the first opportunity to disentangle the effects of trait versus state empathy in their associations with alcohol use. Specifically, while prior studies have shown that individuals with low trait empathy report more alcohol involvement, the current study will allow us to determine whether empathy is implicated in the within-person process of alcohol use behavior (e.g., do individuals drink more alcohol on days that they report lower empathy?).\n\nStudy Aim\n1.

Wright, Whitney R. Ringwald", "q3": "The purpose of the study is to investigate the relationships between state and trait empathy and alcohol use in a large sample of young adults using ecological momentary assessment methodology.\nAlcohol is one of the most widely consumed psychoactive substances in the world. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, about 70% of people in the United States over the age of 18 reported drinking in the past year and about 50% reported drinking in the past month (NSDUH, 2018). Excessive alcohol use can increase the risk of health problems and is associated with adverse psychological and social consequences. In fact, excessive alcohol use is responsible for around 88,000 deaths each year, including 1 in 10 deaths among working age adults (CDC, 2019). \nAlcohol is best described as a social drug because it is most often consumed in social contexts such as bars, parties, and social gatherings (Fairbairn &amp; Sayette, 2014; Hendriks et al., 2018). Alcohol consumption plays a particularly large role in young people\u2019s social identity exploration, and expectancies of social facilitation are especially powerful in young adult drinkers (Rideout et al., 2012; Patrick et al., 2011). The importance of the social context of alcohol use is also apparent from research that demonstrates robust effects of peer influence, social norms, and social networks on young adult alcohol consumption (Bot et al., 2005; Maxwell et al., 2005; Urberg et al., 2003). Therefore, identifying relevant social factors in the etiology of alcohol use problems is particularly important and can better inform prevention strategies against risky drinking behavior (Creswell et al., 2012).\nThe present study will focus on empathy as it relates to alcohol use because of the critical role empathy plays in social relationships. Empathy is typically defined as the capacity to understand another\u2019s perspective or mental state (cognitive empathy) and the capacity to respond with an appropriate emotion to another\u2019s emotional state (affective empathy) (Hoffman, 1982; Riggio et al., 1989). The ability to empathize with others is vital for everyday social interactions and for the development and maintenance of long-term relationships (Ashington &amp; Jenkins, 1995; de Waal, 2008; Goldstein &amp; Winner, 2012). Empathy has been construed as both a between-person (trait level) and within-person (state level) construct (Graaff et al., 2015; Nezlek et al., 2001; Nezlek et al., 2007). Trait empathy can be thought of as a general tendency for a person to show empathy, whereas state empathy can be thought of as a person\u2019s fluctuations in empathy in response to particular interpersonal interactions (Graaff et al., 2015; Nezlek et al., 2001) or features of the social context (Zaki, 2014). The motivated model of empathy suggests that people are either driven to employ empathy or to avoid it (Zaki, 2014). Positive affect, affiliation, and social desirability typically motivate people to approach empathy, whereas competition, material costs, and cognitive costs typically motivate people to avoid empathy (Cameron et al., 2019; Zaki, 2014). This theory suggests that empathy is an adaptive process, and that people are more or less motivated to empathize depending on particular characteristics of the social context. Thus, though people show individual differences in average empathy (trait empathy), they can also fluctuate and shift meaningfully in their empathy across situations (state empathy). Importantly, state and trait empathy have been shown to function mathematically independent of one other, with each explaining some of the variance in empathy (Nezlek et al., 2007).\nSocial processes play an instrumental role in the development of alcohol problems (Sher et al., 2005), and empathy may be a particularly important social construct when considering risk. Several cross-sectional studies have found deficits in empathy for clinical samples of alcohol dependent individuals. Compared with controls, adults with alcohol dependence exhibited impairments in recognizing facial expressions of positive and negative emotions (Kornreich et al., 2002; Kornreich et al., 2013; Maurage et al., 2011a) and showed impairments in theory of mind (i.e., the ability to attribute mental states to others) and trait empathy (Bosco et al., 2013; Dethier &amp; Blairy, 2012; Erol et al., 2016; Martinotti et al., 2009; Mohagheghi et al., 2015; Thoma et al., 2013), with particular impairments in affective (versus cognitive) empathy (Gizewski et al., 2013; Maurage et al., 2011b).\nA few cross-sectional studies have also examined links between low trait empathy and increased alcohol consumption and problems in non-clinical samples. In a sample of African American adolescents, low trait empathy was associated with lower drug refusal self-efficacy and greater past 30-day drug use, but analyses were not conducted separately for cognitive versus affective empathy (Nguyen et al., 2011). In Italian adolescents, deficits in affective (but not cognitive) empathy were associated with binge drinking (Laghi et al., 2019a) and, in the presence of high conformity, impaired theory of mind was associated with more binge drinking episodes (Laghi et al., 2019b). Further, in a sample of French adolescents, both cognitive and affective empathy were found to be associated with alcohol problems and binge drinking (Lannoy et al., 2020). Finally, low emotional intelligence (of which empathy is a facet; Salovey et al., 2004) has been linked to greater past week and past month alcohol consumption in American middle-school students and with more heavy episodic drinking and more alcohol problems in Australian adults (Schutte et al., 2010; Trinidad &amp; Johnson, 2000). \nTaken together, results from both clinical and non-clinical samples suggest that deficits in trait empathy are associated with increased alcohol consumption and more alcohol-related problems. We are unaware of prior studies that examined the relationships between state empathy and alcohol use or problems, however. Research on related constructs highlights why this work might be important. For instance, fluctuating mood states, which are context dependent, have been shown to robustly influence the direction, intensity, and persistence of a wide range of human behaviors (Holzahauer et al., 2020; Gardner, 1985; Gendolla, 2000; Gendolla &amp; Brinkmann, 2005). Additionally, meaningful within\u2010person variability in the Big Five personality traits has helped to explain important trait-content manifestations of behavior (Ching et al., 2014; Fleeson, 2007; Fleeson &amp; Glallagher, 2009; Geukes et al., 2017).  In general, more research is needed to explore associations between empathy and alcohol use and, in particular, the extent to which trait (versus state) empathy and cognitive (versus affective) empathy is linked to alcohol use. \nThe goal of the current study is to advance knowledge about the association between empathy and alcohol use by examining these variables in a well-powered (n=1,080) sample of young adults using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodology. This study design allowed us to collect daily reports of alcohol use, thereby eliminating recall bias, and to assess empathy engagement (both affective and cognitive) multiple times per day, thus providing a measure of state-level empathy. As such, this study provides the first opportunity to disentangle the effects of trait versus state empathy in their associations with alcohol use. Specifically, while prior studies have shown that individuals with low trait empathy report more alcohol involvement, the current study will allow us to determine whether empathy is implicated in the within-person process of alcohol use behavior (e.g., do individuals drink more alcohol on days that they report lower empathy?).\n\nStudy Aim\n1. Determine whether individual differences in empathy are associated with individual differences in daily drinking behavior. \n2. Determine whether daily fluctuations in empathy are associated with daily fluctuations in alcohol use.\n", "q4": "Hypothesis 1: Individual differences in trait empathy are expected to be associated with individual differences in daily drinking. People with lower trait empathy are expected to report more drinking days and more alcohol drinks per day than people with higher trait empathy. \nHypothesis 2: Daily fluctuations in empathy (state empathy) are expected to be associated with fluctuations in same day alcohol use.\nHypothesis 3: Associations between empathy and alcohol use are expected to be stronger for affective (versus cognitive) empathy.", "q5": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

For the community sample, participants had to be between 18 and 40 years of age and users of a smartphone running iOS or Android software. To recruit a distinct community sample, individuals were not eligible if they were enrolled in a full-time undergraduate program. Participants in the student samples received course credit for their participation. Participants in the community sample who completed baseline questionnaires were entered into prize drawings for $75 Amazon gift cards. Following these questionnaires, participants could elect to participate in the EMA portion of the study. Participants who completed 90% or greater of the total surveys administered during the study period received $100 Amazon gift cards. Gift cards of prorated value were given to those who completed less than 90% of surveys. \nThe baseline questionnaires were entered online, typically in a single setting. Following the baseline questionnaires, participants viewed a video training presentation explaining the EMA procedures and instructions for downloading the MetricWire smartphone application.

Interpersonal interactions were defined as real-time, direct conversations between the participant and one or more other individuals that lasted for at least five minutes. This could include in-person, voice, video, or text-based conversations. If an interaction had occurred, they were asked to complete the three state-level empathy questions. If participants indicated an interaction did not occur, they answered a different set of questions.

We will then randomize whether respondents receive an additional brief psychological message intended to highlight the need for financial security in America, by connecting the experiences of insecurity that many are facing now in response to COVID-19 with experiences of many Americans during a typical year. \nWe hypothesize that this message will increase (a) support for an extension of the CARES Act to make cash payments ongoing  and (b) support for a basic income policy in subsequent waves.

It is the largest emergency aid package that has been passed in the history of the United States. It allocates $2 trillion to help American households and the economy in the face of the coronavirus / COVID-19 outbreak.\nRepublican members of congress promoted direct cash payments to most Americans as part of the CARES Act. The CARES Act overall passed with near unanimous bipartisan support in Congress.     \nIn the coming weeks, Americans making below $75,000 as an individual (or $150,000 as a couple) are set to receive stimulus checks of $1,200 per person, with an additional $500 per child. Checks of smaller amounts will go to Americans making up to $99,000 as individuals (or $198,000 as a couple).\u201d\n\nThen, participants will be randomly assigned, via a Qualtrics randomizer, to receive an additional intervention related to financial insecurity (treatment) or no further information (control). \n\nTreatment condition: \nThe financial insecurity prompts participants to connect the experiences of financial insecurity of many Americans during the coronavirus to the experiences of financial insecurity that many American face in a typical year (e.g. job losses or hours reduced, natural disasters). Then, we prompt participants to think about the following: \u201cSo, people are beginning to propose extending the CARES Act to provide monthly payments as basic income on an ongoing basis. This program would give people the flexibility and freedom to maintain financial independence in the face of disruptions. Giving people direct cash also means the government doesn't have to tell people what to do and allows individuals to make the best decisions for themselves in that moment, no matter what kind of financial disruption they face.\u201d In response, participants are asked to describe how a basic income policy could be useful and/or promote important values in this country.\n ", "description-methods.design.question2b": "ALL WAVES\n\nFor the longitudinal design, we measure at baseline (pre-intervention) and subsequent waves the following constructs:\n \n1.

Three participant groups will be created depending on exam scores by subject: participants who score similarly between science/maths and arts subjects, participants who perform better on arts subjects, and participants who perform better on science/maths subjects. Exam performance will be scored as \u201cbetter\u201d if the grade is two or more points different (e.g. C is two grade points from A). Group differences will then be explored using an ANVOCA with new exam pattern group as the IV and autistic traits (CAST score) as the DV, IQ will be included as a covariate. Chi-square analysis will be conducted to explore autism diagnostic status between groups. A dimensional approach to difference in exam scores will also be adopted. A sum of grade differences between pairs of arts-science subjects will be generated, for example if a participant\u2019s results were English Lit A, English Lang B, History B, Science B, Maths C, and Computer Science C, a discrepancy score of 3 would be generated (one point between each pair, ordering within arts and science best to worst). Correlational analysis will then be conducted to see if there is a relationship between discrepancy scores and autistic traits. \n\nFor all ANOVA/ANCOVA analyses, post-hoc Tukey tests will be conducted.

However, empirical studies on trigger warnings suggest that they are functionally inert or cause small adverse side effects. We conducted a preregistered replication and extension of a previous experiment. Trauma survivors (n = 451) were randomly assigned to either receive or not receive trigger warnings prior to reading passages from world literature. We found no evidence that trigger warnings were helpful for trauma survivors, for those who self-reported a PTSD diagnosis, or for those who qualified for probable PTSD, even when survivors' trauma matched the passages' content. We found substantial evidence that trigger warnings countertherapeutically reinforce survivors' view of their trauma as central to their identity. Regarding replication hypotheses, the evidence was either ambiguous or substantially favored the hypothesis that trigger warnings have no effect. In summary, we find that trigger warnings are not helpful for trauma survivors. \n", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-02T18:12:47.818939", "date_modified": "2020-04-02T18:04:28.747739", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["pre-registered replication", "PTSD", "resilience", "trauma", "trigger warnings"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [""], "year": "2019"}, "analytics_key": "8e3154db8a05566b513c1df2c2a65a7e5c5c06ced7387ac3d020193e5e2509f4b885bf25f309169e2ed71bfacab84ab502762d9075494f3ef957e806401cd9bec1e2e3d9726aee7410fdbbda6ca4f1022f0e3f7b55f7de026bf6c48b4212519aa813d636cc8be821b6660b79c980a1495acb8511fd9720a6ad88aa38a9524fb6b18d0b50870cce8fed0357459c8aab8b", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-02T18:12:47.788636", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Open-Ended Registration", "registered_meta": {"summary": {"extra": [], "value": "This is a post-acceptance registration to create a frozen, non-editable version of all relevant open data and materials.
