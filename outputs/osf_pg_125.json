Epicondylalgia is pain in the lateral epicondyle of the humerus or in the tendons or muscles originating from it. The condition usually arises from resisted use of the extensor muscles of the wrist and can be associated with occupational tasks or sports  which require forceful and/or repetitive activity. Overall the economic burden of epicondylalgia is high resulting in significant loss of work days and reduced work capacity.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-03-30T15:36:22.819869", "date_modified": "2020-03-30T15:42:52.630964", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Copyright"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "71c39b89376a1b2ffb41903462e599f8c4e0f6d924528455aa19fcfaab727d10b1301b7d8fc167e7671e1077c18947c4f7a758a1e2a63d0ec252f43d81b941ec4b27cb99e0521a5e4859c0e9304654ad6782ea8b60e72a5b1ad4cd36399a750f22e9e6bb69c98138bad300f1f0482412c9b6b129a31e25e7a4ea15210ff155076fc71529f4638c0167fb9e6d3889ceb9", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-03-30T15:36:22.794415", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Marcos Navarro Santana"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Dry needling (without drugs) are effective for the treatment of the lateral elbow tendinopathy"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": ["No blinding is involved in this study."]}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q6": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "A systematic review and meta-analysis included parallel or cross-over randomized clinical trials that used  dry needling alone or in combination with other treatments in comparison with other group or control"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q8": {"extra": [], "value": "Registration prior to creation of data"}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q10": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Participants must be al least 18 years old with lateral elbow tendinopathy diagnosed through common physical test or ultrasound imaging treated with any modalities of dry needling.
