Studies have shown that contingent monetary reward improves performance during conflict resolution (Krebs, Boehler, and Woldorff, 2010), task-switching (Braem, 2017), inhibition (Boehler, Schevernels, Hopf, Stoppel, and Krebs, 2014), or proactive control (Chiew and Braver, 2013). However, little is known about how cognitive control is influenced by different types of learned reward contingencies. In this study, instrumental action-reward contingency is manipulated in two color-naming Stroop task experiments. Action-reward contingency is one of the most extensively studied moderator of instrumental learning (e.g., Vaghi, Cardinal, Apergis-Schoute, Fineberg, Sule, &amp; Robbins, 2019), and we aim at testing how cognitive control, and particularly conflict resolution, is influenced by this moderator. The difference between the two experiments consists in the use of cues in the second experiment signaling whether the next word probe stimulus is congruent or incongruent. Thus, the second experiment involves the possibility to prepare for the trial's congruency identity without having seen the target yet. This study is a first step to a systematic investigation of how different motivational contexts influence cognitive control, which is relevant both at a descriptive and a conceptual level of understanding of cognitive control mechanisms. In addition, this would open to more efficient ways to manipulate motivation during cognitive control training, and improve interventions in patients with deficits in cognitive control."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Across both experiments, our main hypothesis is that conflict resolution is influenced by instrumental contingency, with improved conflict resolution for positive action-reward contingency in incongruent trials (i.e., incongruent trials are rewarded more), as compared to neutral (i.e., incongruent and congruent trials are rewarded equally) or negative contingencies (i.e., congruent trials are rewarded more). In the first color-naming Stroop task experiment, it is possible that participants detect the action-reward contingencies manipulated but do not change their responses accordingly due to limited time available to adapt attentional settings and prepare a response. Therefore, if instrumental contingency is a moderator of conflict resolution, we believe the effect is potentially more pronounced in the second experiment, in which participants receive a cue that will allow them to prepare for the congruency condition. Therefore, while both experiments first and foremost serve as a test to evaluate our main hypothesis, a secondary hypothesis could be that we expect the effect to be more pronounced in the second versus first experiment."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Organization (WHO) Constitution, the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being [1]. Yet, today, in many countries in the world, large numbers of people do not enjoy this basic right. Part of the explanation for this is that health inequalities still exist between social classes, between different regions, between men and women, and between people from different ethnic backgrounds [2]. Understanding the inequality dynamics at the local level can thus be important and help to better understand overall national inequality [3]. \nWe would like to address the following research questions: \n(1) What is the magnitude of health inequality within the post-conflict DRC?\n(2) What is the distribution of health inequalities within the post-conflict DRC? \n(3) What are the trends (observed between 2007 &amp; 2013/2014) in health inequality in the post-conflict DRC? \n(4) What factors are associated with structural health inequalities over time and between socio-economic groups within the DRC?\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "We hypothesize the following for each of the research questions listed above:\n\nResearch question 1 (R.Q.1): What is the magnitude of health inequality within the post-conflict DRC?\n\nPopulations that have experienced armed conflict often have among the worst indicators of infant, child and maternal mortality, as well as very high levels of psychological impairment, of all countries in the world [4]. In addition, due to a large number of conflicts in different parts of the world, implementing and sustaining health programs have been among the most serious challenges for the health community [5]. \nIn the specific case of the post-conflict DRC, there are only a very limited number of studies that could tell us how much health inequalities exists. Thus, we hypothesize that the health inequality has deteriorated within the post-conflict DRC. Analysis of selected child and maternal health indicators will provide an estimate of the magnitude of health inequalities within the post-conflict DRC.\n\nResearch question 2 (R.Q.2): What is the distribution of health inequalities within the post-conflict DRC?\n\nInequalities within a country relate to the distribution of accumulated wealth within a society, and in particular how that society is organized and the social relations and power established among its various strata. It is defined by the history and the political models that have been adopted, and how the state has redistributed national wealth through fiscal and transfer systems, which have generated greater or lesser distributive distances between existing social groups [6]. Without an indication of the distribution of health across the various social subgroups, it can be difficult for the country to claim whether health inequalities increase, decrease, or remain status quo over time. \nThe hypothesis regarding the second research question is that there is an unequal distribution of determinants of health at different levels within the DRC, which are associated with higher or lower levels of inequalities in health. More specifically, data on maternal and child care and malnutrition are expected to show that the war has accentuated the health situation, and that the western part of the country will have better outcomes than the eastern part of the country.\n\nResearch question 3 (R.Q.3): What are the trends in health inequality in the post-conflict DRC?\n\nIn post-conflict situations, there is limited data available for decision-making [7]. Nevertheless, to allow trend analysis, data availability with respect to individuals or groups of interest is essential. With this, it is possible to do much more with the existing data and resources than what is being done currently [9].\nThe hypothesis regarding the third research question is that between 2007 and 2013/14, the DRC had seen little or no progress towards decreasing health inequalities in the selected maternal and child health indicators. \n\nResearch question 4 (R.Q.4): What could explain structural health inequalities over time and between socio-economic groups within the DRC?. \n\nPeople all over the world still live in slums lacking access to basic infrastructure and services such as water, sanitation, electricity, health care and education. Unless decisive actions are taken, there might be 3 billion slum dwellers by 2050 [8]. Therefore, understanding the factors associated with different health inequality determinants increases understanding of what contributes to health inequalities and where targeted programmes could potentially be developed to address them.\nDrawing on a large body of reports, the hypothesis regarding the fourth research question proposes that various attributes including type of residence, education level, religion, ethnicity, wealth and occupation influence structural health inequalities between socio-economic groups.

In this study, data from Demographic and Health Surveys of 2007, 2013/14 will be analysed for inequities in health using different concentration curves/indices: \n\n(1)The standard Concentration Index (CI): it is the most appropriate measure of health inequality, since it meets the three basic requirements of a health inequality index, namely, \u2018\u2026\u2009(i) that it reflects the socio-economic dimension to inequalities in health; (ii) that it reflects the experiences of the entire population; and (iii) that it is sensitive to changes in the distribution of the population across socioeconomic groups\u2009\u2026\u2019 [13].\nThe concentration index is defined as twice the area between the concentration curve and the line of equality. The value of the concentration index can vary between \u20131 and +1. Its negative values imply that a variable is concentrated among disadvantaged people while the opposite is true for its positive values. When there is no equality, the concentration index will be zero. While the original application of CI was to study income inequality [14], economists have since extended the application of CI to study social inequality in health [13, 15, 16].\n\n(2)The Wealth Index: is based on a set of household characteristics and asset ownership and was explicitly designed to overcome acknowledged challenges in measuring income [17]. Given that there is no single household characteristic or asset that gives us enough information to determine whether someone is poor or not, one way of looking at relative poverty is to divide the population into equal quintiles (which is a fifth (20%) of the population). Wealth quintiles are commonly used as proxies of socioeconomic position, especially in low income countries where lack of data is customary. They are measured in a standardized way in each DHS by an asset index which is constructed from household asset data and dwelling characteristics. Based on the asset index, the population is divided into five wealth quintiles. However, it can be difficult to summarize household wealth represented by each of the assets and household characteristics, therefore Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has been suggested as a solution. In this study, we will use PCA which is a statistical method which determines the relative importance of each variable when seeking to summarize a set of variables [18]. \n\n(3) Z-score: will be used as descriptor of child nutrition.

We will assess the changes in the magnitude of health inequalities across different time periods using the ranges, including rate ratios (RR) and rate differences (RD). These measures compare the range in rates of illness/mortality between the least healthy and the healthiest groups or between the lowest and the highest socioeconomic groups. In this regard, we will measure the ranges respectively, for the indicators: child mortality, child nutrition, maternal mortality, Immunization, breastfeeding, fever, diarrhea, prevalence and treatment of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI).\n\nSecond, we will analyze geographic and wealth inequalities in health distribution using concentration indices (CIs) and curves. The CI takes values between \u2013 1 (when all the population\u2019s health is concentrated in the hands of the most disadvantaged person) and + 1 (when all the population\u2019s health is concentrated in the hands of the least disadvantaged person). If health is equally distributed across socioeconomic groups, the concentration curve will coincide with the diagonal. We will calculate concentration indices (CIs) for the indicators: prenatal care, postnatal care, C-section and delivery of care.\n\nThird, we will assess trends in health inequities by comparing the concentration indices of maternal and child health services utilization variables between the 2007 and 2013/14 waves using Wagstaff two groups concentration indices comparison method. The concentration curve plots the cumulative percentage of the health variable against the cumulative percentage of the sample, ranked by their socioeconomic status, beginning with the most disadvantaged, and ending with the least disadvantaged. Similarly, we will use the concentration indices to measure the trends in health services utilization (access to health) for maternal and child health care services.\n\nFourth, we will decompose health inequalities into its contributing factors using a decomposition analysis (multivariate analysis). This method of analysis allows one to estimate how determinants proportionally contribute to inequality in a health variable. It will enable us to quantify the real contribution of each determinant of a health variable - controlled for the other determinants - to socioeconomic inequality in that health variable. \nFollowing dependent variables (child and maternal health indicators) and independent variables (survey period (2007 versus 2013/14), region (Eastern part of the DRC, Western part of the DRC and the capital city of the DRC) will be used.

Yet, today, in many countries in the world, large numbers of people do not enjoy this basic right. Part of the explanation for this is that health inequalities still exist between social classes, between different regions, between men and women, and between people from different ethnic backgrounds [2]. Understanding the inequality dynamics at the local level can thus be important and help to better understand overall national inequality [3]. \nWe would like to address the following research questions: \n(1) What is the magnitude of health inequality within the post-conflict DRC?\n(2) What is the distribution of health inequalities within the post-conflict DRC? \n(3) What are the trends (observed between 2007 &amp; 2013/2014) in health inequality in the post-conflict DRC? \n(4) What factors are associated with structural health inequalities over time and between socio-economic groups within the DRC?\n", "q4": "We hypothesize the following for each of the research questions listed above:\n\nResearch question 1 (R.Q.1): What is the magnitude of health inequality within the post-conflict DRC?\n\nPopulations that have experienced armed conflict often have among the worst indicators of infant, child and maternal mortality, as well as very high levels of psychological impairment, of all countries in the world [4]. In addition, due to a large number of conflicts in different parts of the world, implementing and sustaining health programs have been among the most serious challenges for the health community [5]. \nIn the specific case of the post-conflict DRC, there are only a very limited number of studies that could tell us how much health inequalities exists. Thus, we hypothesize that the health inequality has deteriorated within the post-conflict DRC. Analysis of selected child and maternal health indicators will provide an estimate of the magnitude of health inequalities within the post-conflict DRC.\n\nResearch question 2 (R.Q.2): What is the distribution of health inequalities within the post-conflict DRC?\n\nInequalities within a country relate to the distribution of accumulated wealth within a society, and in particular how that society is organized and the social relations and power established among its various strata. It is defined by the history and the political models that have been adopted, and how the state has redistributed national wealth through fiscal and transfer systems, which have generated greater or lesser distributive distances between existing social groups [6]. Without an indication of the distribution of health across the various social subgroups, it can be difficult for the country to claim whether health inequalities increase, decrease, or remain status quo over time. \nThe hypothesis regarding the second research question is that there is an unequal distribution of determinants of health at different levels within the DRC, which are associated with higher or lower levels of inequalities in health. More specifically, data on maternal and child care and malnutrition are expected to show that the war has accentuated the health situation, and that the western part of the country will have better outcomes than the eastern part of the country.\n\nResearch question 3 (R.Q.3): What are the trends in health inequality in the post-conflict DRC?\n\nIn post-conflict situations, there is limited data available for decision-making [7]. Nevertheless, to allow trend analysis, data availability with respect to individuals or groups of interest is essential. With this, it is possible to do much more with the existing data and resources than what is being done currently [9].\nThe hypothesis regarding the third research question is that between 2007 and 2013/14, the DRC had seen little or no progress towards decreasing health inequalities in the selected maternal and child health indicators. \n\nResearch question 4 (R.Q.4): What could explain structural health inequalities over time and between socio-economic groups within the DRC?. \n\nPeople all over the world still live in slums lacking access to basic infrastructure and services such as water, sanitation, electricity, health care and education. Unless decisive actions are taken, there might be 3 billion slum dwellers by 2050 [8]. Therefore, understanding the factors associated with different health inequality determinants increases understanding of what contributes to health inequalities and where targeted programmes could potentially be developed to address them.\nDrawing on a large body of reports, the hypothesis regarding the fourth research question proposes that various attributes including type of residence, education level, religion, ethnicity, wealth and occupation influence structural health inequalities between socio-economic groups. Particularly, ethnicity in all its forms plays an important role in health inequalities within the DRC.", "q5": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

Our primary data sources are the Democratic Republic of the Congo Demographic and Health Surveys (EDS-RDC) of 2007 and 2013-2014. \nDHS are a basis for many indicators of health that are in turn used to evaluate the effectiveness of programs and interventions and to guide future changes in health programs. They collect information on a number of health, demographic, and social characteristics for nationally representative large samples of women of reproductive age, as well as other variables of interest. We analyse the DRC\u2019s main child and maternal health indicators after the conflict.

They  involved a two-stage cluster and systematic sampling design with households selected at random. Respondents were selected on the basis of being female (for the female survey) or male (for the male survey) and whether the respondent was a usual member of the household or having spent the night prior to the survey in the household. \nDuring the EDS-RDC I of 2007, a total of 8.886 households were randomly selected, the final sample included women of age from 15 to 49 (n= 9.995) and men of age from 15 to 59 (n= 4.757). The total sample size was 14.752.

The total sample size was 27.483.\n \nThese surveys employed standard Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) questionnaires and techniques for data collection. The women\u2019s Questionnaire was used to collect respondent\u2019s individual characteristics including age, marital status, occupation, residence as well as other information on topics including; reproductive history; contraceptive knowledge and use; antenatal, delivery and postnatal care; marriage; attitudes about family planning.\n", "q14": "DHS surveys are designed to provide reliable estimates for most of the key DHS indicators at the national level and as well as at the country\u2019s first administrative level (region/province).

The final sampling unit selected was the cluster (neighborhood or village) and, clusters were randomly selected as primary sampling units.

In both waves, study population included women in reproductive age (15- 49 years old) and men (age: 15 - 59) who lived in the DRC. The methodology will involve a decomposition analysis of the concentration index for the two main variables (Child and Maternal health indicators) and multivariate logistic analyses.", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Data collection procedure is identical to the original survey wave (unless noted otherwise).\nThe EDS-RDC were part of the larger MEASURE DHS project funded by USAID, in which the DRC conducted national household surveys to monitor and evaluate a range of indicators related to population, health and nutrition. Technical assistance in the design, implementation, and analysis of the survey was provided by the global Demographic and Health Surveys project (MEASURE DHS) of Macro International, Inc.\nAll survey data is presented both nationally and by sub-national reporting area, which are often, but not always, provinces or groups of provinces, and are included in all recoded data files. They were administered by the same company, following a standard set of questionnaires and similar sampling designs.\n\nThe Institutional Review Board of Macro International, Inc. reviewed and approved the MEASURE Demographic and Health Surveys Project Phase II. Both, the 2007 and 2013/14 EDS-RDC were categorized under that approval. DHS datasets are available from www.measuredhs.com.\n\nThe EDS-RDC I of 2007 (first wave) was the first survey of its kind conducted in the DRC [11]. It was a nationally representative survey designed to provide information on fertility levels and preferences, sexual activity, knowledge and use of family planning, breastfeeding, nutritional status of women and children, mortality of children and adults, maternal mortality, maternal and child health, as well as knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections.\nThe EDS-RDC II (second wave) of 2013-2014 [12] was designed to provide reliable data on fertility and fertility preferences, sexual activity, knowledge and use of family planning, breastfeeding, the nutritional status of women and children under age 5, childhood mortality, adult mortality (including maternal mortality), maternal and child health, HIV/AIDS and STI knowledge, and the use of mosquito nets to prevent malaria.

", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "To ascertain prevailing levels of inequality and changes over time there is a need to have an effective means of displaying distributions and of comparing them to one another \u2013 ideally through a summary index. In this study, data from Demographic and Health Surveys of 2007, 2013/14 will be analysed for inequities in health using different concentration curves/indices: \n\n(1)The standard Concentration Index (CI): it is the most appropriate measure of health inequality, since it meets the three basic requirements of a health inequality index, namely, \u2018\u2026\u2009(i) that it reflects the socio-economic dimension to inequalities in health; (ii) that it reflects the experiences of the entire population; and (iii) that it is sensitive to changes in the distribution of the population across socioeconomic groups\u2009\u2026\u2019 [13].\nThe concentration index is defined as twice the area between the concentration curve and the line of equality. The value of the concentration index can vary between \u20131 and +1. Its negative values imply that a variable is concentrated among disadvantaged people while the opposite is true for its positive values. When there is no equality, the concentration index will be zero. While the original application of CI was to study income inequality [14], economists have since extended the application of CI to study social inequality in health [13, 15, 16].\n\n(2)The Wealth Index: is based on a set of household characteristics and asset ownership and was explicitly designed to overcome acknowledged challenges in measuring income [17]. Given that there is no single household characteristic or asset that gives us enough information to determine whether someone is poor or not, one way of looking at relative poverty is to divide the population into equal quintiles (which is a fifth (20%) of the population). Wealth quintiles are commonly used as proxies of socioeconomic position, especially in low income countries where lack of data is customary. They are measured in a standardized way in each DHS by an asset index which is constructed from household asset data and dwelling characteristics. Based on the asset index, the population is divided into five wealth quintiles. However, it can be difficult to summarize household wealth represented by each of the assets and household characteristics, therefore Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has been suggested as a solution. In this study, we will use PCA which is a statistical method which determines the relative importance of each variable when seeking to summarize a set of variables [18]. \n\n(3) Z-score: will be used as descriptor of child nutrition. Both wasting (a sign of acute malnutrition)  and stunting (a sign of chronic malnutrition) will be measured.", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Data analysis\n\nTo correctly answer our four key research questions, we will proceed as follows:\n\nFirst, in order to document the magnitude of health inequities, data are required on: (i) a measure of health; and (ii) a measure of social position or an \u201cequity stratifier\u201d that defines strata in a social hierarchy. We will assess the changes in the magnitude of health inequalities across different time periods using the ranges, including rate ratios (RR) and rate differences (RD). These measures compare the range in rates of illness/mortality between the least healthy and the healthiest groups or between the lowest and the highest socioeconomic groups. In this regard, we will measure the ranges respectively, for the indicators: child mortality, child nutrition, maternal mortality, Immunization, breastfeeding, fever, diarrhea, prevalence and treatment of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI).\n\nSecond, we will analyze geographic and wealth inequalities in health distribution using concentration indices (CIs) and curves. The CI takes values between \u2013 1 (when all the population\u2019s health is concentrated in the hands of the most disadvantaged person) and + 1 (when all the population\u2019s health is concentrated in the hands of the least disadvantaged person). If health is equally distributed across socioeconomic groups, the concentration curve will coincide with the diagonal. We will calculate concentration indices (CIs) for the indicators: prenatal care, postnatal care, C-section and delivery of care.\n\nThird, we will assess trends in health inequities by comparing the concentration indices of maternal and child health services utilization variables between the 2007 and 2013/14 waves using Wagstaff two groups concentration indices comparison method. The concentration curve plots the cumulative percentage of the health variable against the cumulative percentage of the sample, ranked by their socioeconomic status, beginning with the most disadvantaged, and ending with the least disadvantaged. Similarly, we will use the concentration indices to measure the trends in health services utilization (access to health) for maternal and child health care services.\n\nFourth, we will decompose health inequalities into its contributing factors using a decomposition analysis (multivariate analysis). This method of analysis allows one to estimate how determinants proportionally contribute to inequality in a health variable. It will enable us to quantify the real contribution of each determinant of a health variable - controlled for the other determinants - to socioeconomic inequality in that health variable. \nFollowing dependent variables (child and maternal health indicators) and independent variables (survey period (2007 versus 2013/14), region (Eastern part of the DRC, Western part of the DRC and the capital city of the DRC) will be used. Additional control variables such as wealth, education, employment status, place of residence (urban vs rural) and ethnicity will be used.\n\nData management and data analysis will be performed by using STATA Version 11 (STATA Corp., College Station, TX, USA) and Distributive Analysis/Analyse Distributive (DAD) 4.4 [19].", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children":

Before the participants\u2019 arrival, the present researcher will assess the stratification lists to determine which condition the participants would be in. Four lists will be used to stratify and ensure an even distribution of male/student, male/general-population, female/student, and female/general population in each induction condition. \nUpon arrival, participants will be briefed and give written consent. Next, participants will be presented with a laptop with the first block of questionnaires. This includes the demographical data and the trait measures. After, participants will be introduced by the researcher to the induction task, depending on the condition the participants were placed in, the instruction will either follow the SCMI or the OCMI. At this point, the participants will choose their specific situation. Following, participants will continue to fill out the manipulation check and the pre-induction state measures. After, participants will follow the induction by writing about 1. Mindfulness; 2. Common humanity; and 3. (Self-)kindness as specified through written instructions on the laptop. Once the participants finish writing, they will be asked to read what they have written carefully before answering the attention check. Next, the manipulation check item will be shown again, followed by the post-induction state measures. Once the participants finish the measures, they will be asked to write about what they think the study was about and how they felt during participation. Lastly, they will be debriefed and thanked for their participation. Participants will receive a compensation of either University participation credits or a voucher worth \u20ac12.50. \n\n\n\nOrder Other-Compassion Condition: \n1.\tDemographics: age, sex, nationality, education, marital status, employment, and medication. \nTrait measures:\n2.\tTrait Self-Compassion: Trait self-compassion was measured using the 12-item short form Self-Compassion Scale (SCS-SF; Raes et al., 2011). Items are rated on a 5-point Likert-scale. The scale includes three positive (self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness) and three negative components (self-judgement, isolation, and over-identification) of self-compassion.\n3.\tTrait Other-Compassion: The 16-item Compassion Scale (Pommier, Neff, &amp; Toth-Kiraly, 2019) was used to measure trait other-compassion. Each item is rated on a 5 point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). The scale includes three positive (kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness) and three negative components (indifference, separation, and disengagement) of compassion with factor loadings of .50 or higher.\n4.\tRegulatory Focus: Chronic regulatory focus will be measured by the 11-item Regulatory Focus Questionnaire (RFQ; Higgins et al., 2001), which aims to assess participants\u2019 subjective prevention/promotion successes and failures. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (never/certainly false) to 5 (very often/certainly true). \n5.\tGrandiose Narcissism: The 37-item Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI; Raskin &amp; Hall, 1979; Morf &amp; Rhodewalt, 1993) measures grandiose narcissistic traits. The NPI approaches narcissism dimensionally and only includes factor loadings greater than .35 (Emmons, 1987; Brown &amp; Zeigler-Hill, 2004). Its items are scored on a 7-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 7 (strongly disagree). It has a four-factor loading solution: Leadership \u2013 Authority, Self-Absorption \u2013 Self-Administration, Superiority \u2013 Arrogance, and Exploitiveness \u2013 Entitlement (Emmons, 1987). \n6.\tVulnerable Narcissism: The 10-item Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS; Hendin &amp; Cheek, 1997) measures vulnerable narcissistic traits. Items are rated on a 7-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). \n7.\tPsychopathy: The 26-item Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (LSRP; Levenson, Kiehl, &amp; Fitzpatrick, 1995) measures the dimensions of sub-clinical psychopathic traits. The scale has an optimal 2-factor structure (Lynam, Whiteside, &amp; Jones, 1999; Douma et al., in press); one primary psychopathy subscale measuring selfish, uncaring, and manipulative content towards others, and one secondary psychopathy subscale assessing anti-social behavior, impulsivity, and a self-defeating lifestyle. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). \n\nPre-Induction State measures:\n8.\tState Self-Compassion: To measure state self-compassion, the newly developed state Self-Compassion Scale (Neff, in press) will be used, in which participants are asked to think of a painful or difficult situation in their life while answering the items. The scale consists of 18 items which are scored on a 5 point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (not at all true for me) to 5 (very true for me). The measure includes 6 subscales: kindness, self-judgement, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, and over-identification. \n9.\tAffect: An adapted version of the Affect Valuation Index (AVI; Tsai &amp; Knutson, 2006) will be used to measure changes in positive and negative affect. The original AVI asks responders to indicate their average ideal and actual affect over the past week, whereas this study asked to rate the current actual affect. 30-items were rated on a 5-point Scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (all the time). \n10.\tState Other-Compassion (General): The General State Other-compassion scale was developed by the current authors by adapting the items on the Compassion Scale to match the language used in the state Self-Compassion Scale. The instructions of the questionnaire ask participants to indicate how they feel about people in general (everyoneone, strangers neighbours etc\u2026) right now. The final version includes 16-items, which are scored on a 5-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very true for me). The items are grouped into six subscales, following the Compassion scale: kindness, common humanity, mindfulness, indifference, separation, and disengagement).\n11.\tSpecific Person Check: Participants are asked to pick a specific person they think about during the induction. The are supposed to name the person, indicate their relationship, how important that person is to them and how much they like that person. \n12.\tManipulation Check: Before and after the induction a manipulation check will be inserted, in which participants indicate how compassionate they feel for their chosen person in the moment. Answers are scored on a 5-point Likert-Scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a great deal). \n13.\tState Other-Compassion (Specific): The State Specific Other-compassion scale was developed by the current authors by adapting the items on the Compassion Scale to match the language used in the state Self-Compassion Scale, while consulting with Neff who\u2019s developed previous compassion scales with her team. The instructions of the questionnaire ask participants to think about a difficult or painful situation someone they know is experiencing and indicate how they feel about the specific person right now. The final version includes 16-items, which are scored on a 5-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very true for me). The items are grouped into six subscales, following the Compassion scale: kindness, common humanity, mindfulness, indifference, separation, and disengagement).\n14.\tOther-Compassion Induction: Participants will be asked to think of a particular situation that is painful or difficult to someone they know before the induction.\nOther-compassion will be induced by administering an Other-Compassion Mindstate induction, which was developed by the current authors by adapting Neff et al.\u2019s SCMI. The current authors have changed the wording to facilitate other-compassion by asking the participants to think of a particular situation that is painful or difficult to someone they know, while encouraging the participant to relate to the other person\u2019s struggle. The induction follows the three positive components of compassion: mindfulness, common humanity, and kindness. Each component is facilitated by a component specific writing prompt, which asks participants to write at least 200 words of compassionate language to their chosen person.

Items are rated on a 5-point Likert-scale. The scale includes three positive (self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness) and three negative components (self-judgement, isolation, and over-identification) of self-compassion.\n3.\tTrait Other-Compassion: The 16-item Compassion Scale (Pommier, Neff, &amp; Toth-Kiraly, 2019) was used to measure trait other-compassion. Each item is rated on a 5 point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). The scale includes three positive (kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness) and three negative components (indifference, separation, and disengagement) of compassion with factor loadings of .50 or higher.\n4.\tRegulatory Focus: Chronic regulatory focus will be measured by the 11-item Regulatory Focus Questionnaire (RFQ; Higgins et al., 2001), which aims to assess participants\u2019 subjective prevention/promotion successes and failures. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (never/certainly false) to 5 (very often/certainly true). \n5.\tGrandiose Narcissism: The 37-item Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI; Raskin &amp; Hall, 1979; Morf &amp; Rhodewalt, 1993) measures grandiose narcissistic traits. The NPI approaches narcissism dimensionally and only includes factor loadings greater than .35 (Emmons, 1987; Brown &amp; Zeigler-Hill, 2004). Its items are scored on a 7-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 7 (strongly disagree). It has a four-factor loading solution: Leadership \u2013 Authority, Self-Absorption \u2013 Self-Administration, Superiority \u2013 Arrogance, and Exploitiveness \u2013 Entitlement (Emmons, 1987). \n6.\tVulnerable Narcissism: The 10-item Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS; Hendin &amp; Cheek, 1997) measures vulnerable narcissistic traits. Items are rated on a 7-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). \n7.\tPsychopathy: The 26-item Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (LSRP; Levenson, Kiehl, &amp; Fitzpatrick, 1995) measures the dimensions of sub-clinical psychopathic traits. The scale has an optimal 2-factor structure (Lynam, Whiteside, &amp; Jones, 1999; Douma et al., in press); one primary psychopathy subscale measuring selfish, uncaring, and manipulative content towards others, and one secondary psychopathy subscale assessing anti-social behavior, impulsivity, and a self-defeating lifestyle. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). \n\nPre-Induction State measures:\n8.\tState Self-Compassion: To measure state self-compassion, the newly developed state Self-Compassion Scale (Neff, in press) will be used, in which participants are asked to think of a painful or difficult situation in their life while answering the items. The scale consists of 18 items which are scored on a 5 point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (not at all true for me) to 5 (very true for me). The measure includes 6 subscales: kindness, self-judgement, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, and over-identification. \n9.\tAffect: An adapted version of the Affect Valuation Index (AVI; Tsai &amp; Knutson, 2006) will be used to measure changes in positive and negative affect. The original AVI asks responders to indicate their average ideal and actual affect over the past week, whereas this study asked to rate the current actual affect. 30-items were rated on a 5-point Scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (all the time). \n10.\tState Other-Compassion (General): The General State Other-compassion scale was developed by the current authors by adapting the items on the Compassion Scale to match the language used in the state Self-Compassion Scale. The instructions of the questionnaire ask participants to indicate how they feel about people in general (everyoneone, strangers neighbours etc\u2026) right now. The final version includes 16-items, which are scored on a 5-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very true for me). The items are grouped into six subscales, following the Compassion scale: kindness, common humanity, mindfulness, indifference, separation, and disengagement).\n11.\tSpecific Person Check: Participants are asked to pick a specific person they think about during the induction. The are supposed to name the person, indicate their relationship, how important that person is to them and how much they like that person. \n12.\tManipulation Check: Before and after the induction a manipulation check will be inserted, in which participants indicate how compassionate they feel for their chosen person in the moment. Answers are scored on a 5-point Likert-Scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a great deal). \n13.\tState Other-Compassion (Specific): The State Specific Other-compassion scale was developed by the current authors by adapting the items on the Compassion Scale to match the language used in the state Self-Compassion Scale, while consulting with Neff who\u2019s developed previous compassion scales with her team. The instructions of the questionnaire ask participants to think about a difficult or painful situation someone they know is experiencing and indicate how they feel about the specific person right now. The final version includes 16-items, which are scored on a 5-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very true for me). The items are grouped into six subscales, following the Compassion scale: kindness, common humanity, mindfulness, indifference, separation, and disengagement).\n14.\tOther-Compassion Induction: Participants will be asked to think of a particular situation that is painful or difficult to someone they know before the induction.\nOther-compassion will be induced by administering an Other-Compassion Mindstate induction, which was developed by the current authors by adapting Neff et al.\u2019s SCMI. The current authors have changed the wording to facilitate other-compassion by asking the participants to think of a particular situation that is painful or difficult to someone they know, while encouraging the participant to relate to the other person\u2019s struggle. The induction follows the three positive components of compassion: mindfulness, common humanity, and kindness. Each component is facilitated by a component specific writing prompt, which asks participants to write at least 200 words of compassionate language to their chosen person. The writing task is followed by an attention check which asks participants to indicate what was asked of them during the writing ask, i.e. to write about someone\u2019s feelings in an accepting and validating way, consider how going through difficult situations is part of being human, and write to the other person like a supportive friend.

Prior work suggests that White evaluators rate White job applicants as a better fit for a hierarchy-enhancing role than a similarly high-status hierarchy-attenuating role. This study aims to replicate this effect and extend it by exploring the impact of job status. We predict an effect of hierarchy-relevance of job (hierarchy-enhancing, hierarchy-attenuating) in predicting White evaluators\u2019 ratings of White and Black applicant fit, such that evaluators rate a White applicant as a better fit for a hierarchy-enhancing (versus -attenuating) role (Hypothesis 1) and a Black applicant as a better fit for a hierarchy-attenuating (versus -enhancing) role (Hypothesis 2). As an exploratory step, we will also test whether these effects are moderated by job status (high, low) by asking White participants to evaluate a White or Black applicant seeking either a high-status (i.e., CEO) or low status (i.e., entry level associate) role at a hierarchy-enhancing (hedge fund) or hierarchy-enhancing (nonprofit) organization.
