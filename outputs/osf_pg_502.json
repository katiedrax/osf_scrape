The rationale underlying these findings is that people who have a close connection to their body have an advantage while performing embodied simulations. People with a high interoceptive accuracy will generally more frequently perceive signals from the bodily modalities. In this study, we experimentally manipulate the attention for such signals by focusing participants' attention inwards (on their bodily sensations) or outwards (on sounds heard via headphones). It is predicted that focusing participants' attention on their body will improve performance on a visuo-spatial perspective-taking task that involves embodied simulation (i.e., result in more efficient simulations and thus faster perspective-taking). In contrast to previous studies on this subject (see this project), interoceptive attention is focused on the motor rather than the cardiac system because it is more closely tied to the embodiment of perspective-taking. \n\nFurthermore, in previous research it was found that focusing attention to the cardiac system was perceived as much more difficult than the exteroceptive attention manipulation. Perceived difficulty within one task (here the attention orientation task) can trigger success motivation for subsequent tasks, which will translate into better performance. The present experiment will also address this alternative explanation based on success motivation. It is predicted that higher perceived difficulty on the attention orientation task is positively related to success motivation after this task, which then predicts faster reaction times on the subsequent VPT task. \n\nFinally, the novel interoceptive attention manipulation adopted for this study involves elements of mindfulness meditation techniques.

This hypothesis will be tested as a two-way interaction within a mixed model framework.\n\n2) It is predicted that there is an indirect effect of perceived difficulty of the attention manipulation on VPT performance (reaction times), mediated via success motivation.

Alternatively, the high frequency with which these individuals attend to their bodies could also lead to habituation and therefore a smaller effect of the momentary body attention manipulation on reaction times (compared to less mindful individuals).

CM, which encompasses various forms of abuse and neglect occurring in childhood, is associated with pervasive impairments in physical and mental health (Kisely et al. 2018; Hughes et al. 2017; Nelson et al. 2017; Norman et al. 2012), increased suicidality (Angelakis et al. 2019) and a growing body of research has found associations between CM and eating disorders (EDs; Hazzard et al., 2019; Quilliot et al. 2019; Molendijk et al. 2017; Micali et al. 2017; Caslini et al. 2016). Individuals with EDs who report experiencing abuse and/or neglect as a child are more likely to drop-out of treatment, have lower rates of full recovery (Castellini et al., 2018) and present with higher levels of psychiatric comorbidity, compared to their counterparts who do not experience CM. \n\nAlthough there is a growing body of research suggesting that CM plays an important role in the development and clinical course of EDs, the number and quality of studies is small, compared to other disorders, and further research is required. In this study, we aim to investigate the association between several types of childhood maltreatment (CM) and anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge-eating disorder (BED), and any eating disorder specified in accordance to diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) criteria.
