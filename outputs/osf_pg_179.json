Specifically, an ERP component (CDA) associated with visual working memory (VWM) decreased in amplitude at the same rate with target repetition between stimulus types. However, the real-world stimuli elicited ERP components associated with long-term memory (LTM) engagement (N400) and attentional selection (N2pc) with target repetition. \n\nThis research suggests the behavioral benefits observed for real-world stimuli may be due to the ability to recruit semantic associations in LTM in preparation for visual search, but these effects do not lead to differences in VWM engagement. However, Landolt Cs and real-world stimuli differ in a number of other aspects, including visual complexity. In this experiment, we aim to replicate previous findings using perceptually similar target objects that fall into two categories: easily accessible, nameable objects and objects lacking a common, accessible name.\n\nResearch Questions:\n\n1) Is there a behavioral benefit for nameable objects relative to unnameable objects with target repetition?\n\n2) How do the observed electrophysiological correlates of VWM, LTM, and attentional selection differ between nameable and unnameable objects with target repetition?"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "We predict that nameable objects will have a behavioral benefit relative to unnamable objects during search due to aid from semantic associations in LTM.
