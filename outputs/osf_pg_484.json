Investigating the effects of open science badges  on perceived trustworthiness in journal articles.", "description": "The Replication Crisis diminishes trust in empirical sciences and with it the perceived value of science (Lupia, 2018). Open Science Practices (i.a. open data, open analysis script, open materials) are an increasingly popular approach to deal with challenges in replication and to rebuilt trust (Geukes, Sch\u00f6nbrodt, Utesch, Geukes, &amp; Back, 2016). First investigations could, however, deliver no evidence toward the effects of Open Science Practices (OSP) on trustworthiness (Wingen, Berkessel, &amp; Englich, 2019). The study investigated the effect on a discipline level (psychology) with an abstract description of OSP. Within the ongoing discussion about incentives for OSP (e.g. badges), we want to shift the focus from discipline level to concrete individual journal articles and consider epistemic beliefs of readers to play a moderating role (Merk &amp; Rosman, 2018): Will visible OSP (vs. not visible vs. visibly non-OSP) foster perceived trustworthiness when reading journal articles of empirical studies? Will multiplistic epistemic beliefs moderate the relationship between OSP and trustworthiness?\n\nThe design will include three conditions: visible Open Science Practices (visOSP), Practices not visible (nonvis) and visible non-Open Science Practices (nonOSP). Two of the conditions are randomized within person. Realizing all three conditions within person would highlight the variation between conditions as too obvious and thus undermine blinding of subjects.\nvisOSP condition: Subjects receive a title page of an empirical study (Title, Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, ...) together with three Open Science badges. The badges are explained using hints in style of speech bubbles and indicate that the authors engaged in the OSP open data, open analysis script and open materials.\nnonvis condition: Subjects receive a title page of an empirical study (Title, Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, ...) with no further information on Open Science, reflecting a \"standard\" journal article.\nnonOSP condition: Subjects receive a title page of an empirical study (Title, Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, ...) together with three Open Science badges. The badges are explained using hints in style of speech bubbles and indicate that the authors did not engage in the OSP open data, open analysis script and open materials. As participants are exposed to more than one condition, we create all three conditions for three different empirical studies (topics). This way we avoid participants to see one study topic twice under different conditions, which would undermine the blinding.\nMeasured variables are perceives trustworthiness: We apply the Muenster Epistemic Trustworthiness Inventory (Hendriks, Kienhues, &amp; Bromme, 2015) with all three subscales. However, as dependent variable we will only employ the subscale integrity. The other two subscales are used for further exploratory analyses. Topic-specific multiplism: We apply the subscale of topic specific multiplism from Merk et al. (2017) Topic-specific consistency: We apply the three item-measure from Merk et al. (2017), Treatment check: We test the perceived openness/ transparency of the empirical study.

CBT techniques draw upon an individual\u2019s autobiographical memory for their personal past, and require the individual to imagine future events, with the aim of changing the negative beliefs and assumptions that underpin dysfunctional models of the self and the world. Many of the core elements of CBT rely on cognitive processes (e.g., cognitive reappraisal, problem solving) that depend on the ability to recall specific, autobiographical information. For example, a commonly-used CBT technique involves asking an individual to evaluate the validity of a maladaptive assumption or belief (e.g., I am a total failure) by gathering specific information from their past which may act as evidence against the belief (e.g., I made a tasty dinner last week). Autobiographical memory processes are commonly disrupted in depression. People with depression show a chronic bias towards retrieving generalised summaries about the personal past, rather than memories for specific, single episodes (Dalgleish et al., 2007; Sumner, 2012; Williams et al., 2007). These biases towards overgeneralised memory retrieval, and away from recall of specific information, may thereby impair the ability to engage with, and benefit from CBT. \n\nRecent work has shown that inducing a more specific processing style can temporarily help people to become more specific in their memory retrieval, and enhance performance on tasks that draw upon episodic memory processes (Jing, Madore, &amp; Schacter, 2016, 2017; Madore &amp; Schacter, 2014; Sheldon, Gurguryan, Madore, &amp; Schacter, 2019). Jing et al. (2016) found that an episodic specificity induction \u2013 brief training in recollecting specific details of a recent experience - enhanced problem solving and episodic reappraisal within a healthy student population. Within a depressed population, McFarland, Primosch, Maxson, &amp; Stewart, (2017) found that the same specificity induction procedure improved performance on a subsequent problem solving task.\n\nThe current study will investigate whether a similar specificity induction procedure can help depressed individuals complete CBT exercises that rely on specific autobiographical retrieval, and whether this improves the efficacy of the CBT exercises. We will examine whether, relative to a control (general impressions about an event) induction procedure, the episodic specificity induction a) enhances the number of specific alternative interpretations generated on an episodic reappraisal task, and b) increases the number of pieces of evidence gathered in an exercise designed to evaluate the validity of a negative self-assumption (evidence gathering task). We will examine whether there is a corresponding change in strength of belief ratings (both how much it is logically believed to be true, and how much it feels true) for the challenged interpretations and assumptions. We will also explore the endurance of these effects, and possible moderating factors. \n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Primary hypotheses:\n1)\tOn the reappraisal task, we anticipate that \na)\tParticipants will generate a greater number, on average, of alternate interpretations following the specificity induction, compared with the control induction condition. \nb)\tAs a result of this, we anticipate a greater decrease in both logical and emotional belief ratings for the original negative appraisal for the event reappraised in the specificity induction condition, relative to the control condition.  \n2)\tOn the evidence gathering task, we predict that\na)\tA greater number of pieces of evidence will be generated following the specificity induction, relative to the control induction condition. \nb)\tThere will be a greater increase in strength of belief (logical, emotional) in the new, alternative assumption following the evidence gathering task completed in the specificity induction condition, relative to the control induction condition.\nSecondary hypotheses:   \n\n3)\tFor the evidence gathering task, we predict that there will be a greater decrease in strength of belief ratings for the original assumption in the specificity induction condition than the control condition.   \n\n4)\tFollowing a 1-week delay, we predict that a greater proportion of the generated a) alternative interpretations and b) pieces of evidence, will be recalled for the specificity induction condition, relative to the control induction condition.

Depression status will be confirmed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (First, Williams, Karg, &amp; Spitzer, 2015). Exclusion criteria include any intellectual disability, past or present neurological disorder, and current substance or alcohol dependence. Any participants who show severe impairments on executive tests in session 1 will be excluded from the study. \n\nProcedure \n \nThe study will be completed in two 60-90 minute sessions, completed on two separate days. During Session 1, participants will complete the memory and executive function tests; the Alternating Instructions version of the Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT-AI) , a retrieval-induced forgetting test, the Verbal Fluency Task and the Digit Span Test of working memory. Questionnaire measures of depressive symptoms (Beck\u2019s Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)), ruminative tendency (Ruminative Response Scale (RRS)) and dysfunctional attitudes (Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (DAS)) will also be administered. Finally, participants will select two maladaptive assumptions and generate memories of two negative scenarios (a negative social interaction, and a time when something didn't go as planned) for use in the CBT tasks in Session 2. \n\nIn Session 2, participants will complete an induction (specificity or control) followed by the reappraisal task, a short top-up induction, and the evidence gathering task. The procedure will then be completed with the alternate (specificity or control) induction. The order of the induction type (specificity, impressions control) will be counterbalanced. Both induction procedures involve watching a two minute video clip of individuals completing everyday activities (e.g., cooking, morning routine), and answering questions about the video. A different video will be used for each induction, and videos will be counterbalanced across task (evidence gathering, reappraisal) and induction-type. The reappraisal scenario type (negative social interaction, and a time when something didn't go as planned), and the nature of the assumption (failure, inferiority) selected for evidence gathering will be counterbalanced across induction conditions. \n\nOne week after Session 2, participants will be contacted by telephone and/or email and asked to complete a follow-up worksheet designed to assess the endurance of the experimental effects. \n\n\nMaterials and method:\n\n\nAutobiographical memory test (alternating instructions):\n\nThe AMT is designed to measure ability to deliberately retrieve specific memories in response to a series of positive, negative and neutrally valenced cue words (Williams &amp; Broadbent, 1986).  The alternating instructions AMT (AMT-AI) is an adapted version of the original AMT, in which participants are required to recall both specific and categoric memories. A specific memory is defined as an event that happened at a specific time in a certain place (e.g. \u2018Winning my tennis match last Thursday\u2019), whereas a categoric memory is defined as a memory of an event that happened on many different occasions (e.g. \u2018I used to play tennis every Thursday\u2019). Participants are presented with 24 cue words in total (8 positive, 8 negative and 8 neutral), divided into three blocks. In one block of 6 cues, participants are asked to generate specific memories, for one block of 6 cues they are asked to generate categoric memories. For one block of 12 cues, they alternate between recall of categoric and specific memories. The order of these blocks will be randomised across participants to control for order effects. \nTwo lists of cue words will be randomised between participants, the original list created by Dritschel, Beltsos, McClintock, &amp; Beltosis, (2014), and a second list created by Hitchcock et al., (2019). Both cue lists were taken from the MRC Psycholinguistic database, and have been matched for word frequency (Wilson, 1988). \nThe instructions will be presented on a computer. Before completing the test trials, participants will be given four practice trials (two specific, two categoric), using neutral cue words, and feedback will be given for any incorrect answers. During the test phase, each cue will appear on the screen with an instruction indicating whether to recall a specific or categoric memory (e.g. \u2018please retrieve a specific memory associated with the word \u2018happy\u2019\u2019). Participants will be given 1 minute to respond, indicating that they have a memory in mind, and will then report the memory to the researcher aloud. Responses will be coded by the experimenter, and voice recorded for later second rating by an independent scorer. \nItems will be coded as specific, extended (lasting longer than 1 day), categoric, a repetition (a memory that had previously been reported), a semantic associate (information related to the cue, but which is not an autobiographical memory), or an omission (failure to generate a memory). For each block, the number of correct responses will be calculated. The proportion of internal and external details generated will be assessed using the Autobiographical Interview scoring procedure. Internal details consist of specific information regarding who, what, where, and when features of a specific episodic memory, whereas external details include description of related facts, elaborations, or references to other events, and are thought to draw on more general semantic processing.\n\n\nRetrieval induced forgetting:\n\nRIF will be measured using a procedure based on the original paradigm established by Anderson, Bjork, &amp; Bjork, (1994). Participants will begin by studying 48 category\u2013exemplar pairs (e.g., Kitchen\u2013fork; profession\u2013 nurse) (36 critical pairs, 12 fillers). Half of the exemplars will be \u2018strong\u2019 (high frequency) exemplars of the given category (e.g. kitchen \u2013 fork), whilst the other half will be weak exemplars of the category (e.g. kitchen \u2013 mixer).  Participants will then practice retrieving the weak subset of exemplars from a subset of categories, when provided with the category cue plus the letter stem of the target exemplar (e.g., Kitchen\u2013mi____?). Each exemplar will be practised three times each. \nParticipants will take a 5-minute break, following which they will complete a final recall test. They will be cued with the category plus single letter-stem, and asked to recall the associated exemplar. The order will be controlled such that unpractised items from practiced categories (RP- items) and their baselines (NRP- items) will be cued first, followed by practiced (RP+) items and their baselines (NRP+). This is to reduce the chances of the strengthened RP+ items blocking recall of the RP- items. A single RIF score will be calculated by subtracting percentage of RP\u2212 exemplars correctly recalled from percentage of NRP exemplars correctly recalled.  Higher scores indicate greater RIF, which is thought to reflect ability to inhibit competing items during selective retrieval. \n\n\nVerbal fluency:\n\nThe Verbal Fluency Task (VFT; Spreen &amp; Strauss, 1998) assesses executive control over verbal information.  Participants will be asked to generate as many words within a given category (animals, foods, or occupations) as they can in 60 seconds. They will then be given a further 60 s to generate as many words as they can beginning with a certain letter (F, A or S). Participants will be told that repetitions, proper nouns (e.g., France), and more than one word of the same origin (e.g., swim, swimming) will not be accepted. Verbal fluency score will be calculated as the number of correct words in each condition.\n\n\nWorking memory:\n\nThe Digit Span (DS) subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV) (Wechsler, 2008) will be administered and scored according to the test manual. Participants are read a sequence of numbers of increasing length at a rate of approximately one digit per second, and are asked to repeat the sequence back to the experimenter (DS-forward). The task is stopped when the participant reports the sequence incorrectly on two consecutive trials. This procedure is repeated, this time asking participants to report the sequence in reverse order (DS-backwards). Scores will be calculated by summing the raw forwards and backwards DS scores. \n\n\nSymptom measures:\n\nThe BDI-II consists of 21 items that assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms over the past 2 weeks. A score of 13 or below is considered to be within the normal/nonclinical range, 14 to 19 reflects the mild range, 17 to 29 reflects the moderate range, and 30 and above reflects the severe range of symptom severity (Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996).\n\nRuminative tendency will be assessed using the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS) (Nolen-Hoeksema &amp; Morrow, 1991), a 22-item questionnaire that assesses how often how often participants engage in ruminative thought patterns when they are feeling sad or down. Each item is rated on a 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always) Likert scale. The RRS is a reliable and valid measure of rumination (Luminet, 2004), with high internal consistency (reported Cronbach\u2019s coefficient of .91, Moberly &amp; Watkins, 2008). Scores range from 22 to 88, with higher scores indicative of greater levels of ruminative thinking.\n\nThe intensity of dysfunctional attitudes will be measured with the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS-A-17)(de Graaf, Roelofs, &amp; Huibers, 2009). Participants rate 17 statements on a 4-point Likert scale of how much they agree with the statement. The scale shows high internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s alpha .91). Total score is the sum of the 17 items, with a range of 17-68. Higher scores reflect more dysfunctional attitudes.\n\n\nReappraisal scenario generation:\n\nIn Session 1, participants will generate two negative scenarios for use in the reappraisal tasks in Session 2. Participants will be instructed to recall and describe two specific scenarios to the experimenter in as much detail as they can remember; 1) an occasion when something didn\u2019t work out as well they wanted, and 2) an occasion when a social interaction didn\u2019t go well. If participants struggle to recall a specific event, they will be given some further prompts (e.g. \u2018perhaps a time when you were disappointed in your performance\u2019). They will be instructed not to choose major life events (e.g. marital breakdown, losing their job), but every day-type negative events. Once they have come up with an event, participants will be asked to write down their appraisal of the event (e.g. 'I never get anything right' or 'She doesn't like me'). They will then be asked to rate how much they logically believe this thought to be true and how much they feel like it is true, on a scale of 0-100. In the final section of the worksheet, participants will be asked to rate, in relation to the event, how strongly they feel each of 5 listed emotions (satisfied, sad, hopeful, guilty, anxious) on a scale of 0-100. This procedure will be repeated for the second event. \n\n\nSelection of assumptions:\n\nParticipants will also select two negative self-assumptions which they will challenge during the evidence gathering tasks in Session 2. They will be given a list of six statements which were selected and adapted from the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (DAS). The selected statements reflect core beliefs that are commonly held by people with depression, relating either to failure (e.g. 'If I cannot do something well, there is little point in doing it at all'), or inferiority (e.g. 'If other people know what you're really like, they will think less of you'). Participants will rate each statement in terms of how much they believe it to be true (logically, emotionally), and how important that assumption is to their identity.  Based on these ratings the experimenter will select one failure assumption and one inferiority assumption, matched as closely as possible for strength of belief and importance to identity. \n\nCognitive reappraisal task:\n\nCognitive reappraisal is a technique used frequently in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which aims to down-regulate the negative emotions associated with a certain situation by reframing it and reinterpreting its meaning. In the current study, participants will be presented with one of the episodes that they generated in Session 1 (a time when something didn\u2019t go as planned, or a time when a social interaction didn\u2019t go well). Before the induction procedure, participants will be given a standardised set of instructions and an example of a completed reappraisal worksheet. Instructions will state that they should try to reframe the original meaning of the event by trying to think of alternative interpretations. Following the induction, participants will be given a blank version of the worksheet with one their previously generated negative scenarios. They will be given approximately 10 minutes to write down as many more adaptive reappraisals as they can. The worksheet includes prompts such as \u2018What would another person in a similar situation think about this?\u2019 or \u2018Is what I believe the only way, or the best way to view this situation?\u2019 They will then be asked to re-rate how strongly they believe the original event appraisal (logically, emotionally), and to re-rate the intensity of feelings (satisfied, sad, hopeful, guilty, anxious) about the event. This procedure will be repeated for the second event following the second induction. The event-type (poor task performance, social) will be counterbalanced across induction conditions (specificity vs control). \n\nNumber of alternative appraisals generated by the participant will be counted by blinded scorers. To assess the change in belief in the original event appraisal as a result of the exercise, difference scores will be calculated by deducting the original belief ratings (logical and emotional) from the post-reappraisal belief ratings. More negative scores indicate a reduction in the strength of belief whereas a positive score indicates a strengthening of the belief following reappraisal. A change score will also be calculated for the rated intensity of each the 5 emotions by deducting the original ratings from the post-reappraisal ratings. Again, negative scores indicate a decrease in the strength of the feeling(s). \n\n\nEvidence gathering task:\n\nEvidence gathering is another commonly used CBT technique, which aims to modify the maladaptive assumptions that an individual holds about themselves or the world. Once a maladpative assumption (e.g., If I fail at my work, then I am a failure as a person) is identified, the evidence for and against it can be evaluated, supporting the generation of a more functional assumption.  \nIn Session 2, participants will gather evidence to support an alternate assumption which counters the negative self-assumption that was selected in Session 1. Before the induction procedure, participants will be given a standardised set of instructions and an example evidence gathering worksheet.  Participants will be instructed to come up with an alternative, more helpful assumption which counters the negative self-assumption. They will be instructed to rate how much they believe this to be true (logically and emotionally, on a scale of 0-100).They will also be asked to rate, in relation to the new assumption, how strongly they feel each of 5 emotions (satisfied, sad, hopeful, guilty, anxious) on a scale of 0-100. \nFollowing the induction procedure, they will be instructed to think of some examples of situations from their personal past that would support the new, more helpful assumption. Participants will have approximately 10 minutes to come up with as many pieces of evidence as they can, writing them in the relevant section on the worksheet. Following this exercise, they will be asked to re-rate the extent to which they now believe the original and the new assumption (both logically and emotionally), and re-rate the strength of their emotions about the new assumption. This procedure will be repeated for the second negative assumption following the second induction. The assumption-type (failure, inferiority) will be counterbalanced across conditions (specificity vs control). \nNumber of specific pieces of evidence will be counted by blinded scorers. Change in belief rating scores for both the original assumption and the new assumption will be calculated by deducting the original belief ratings (logical, emotional) from the post-evidence gathering belief ratings. Negative scores indicate a reduction in the strength of belief whereas a positive score indicates a strengthening of the belief following the evidence gathering task. A change score will also be calculated for the rated intensity of each of the 5 rated emotions by deducting the original ratings from the post-reappraisal ratings. Again, negative scores indicate a decrease in the strength of the feeling(s). \n\n\nFollow up worksheet:\n\nOne-week after completion of Session 2, participants will be contacted via email/phone, and asked to complete four short follow-up worksheets. The worksheets follow the same structure as the reappraisal and evidence gathering worksheets completed in Session 2. To examine the enduring effects of the reappraisal task, participants will be provided with their original negative event descriptions and original appraisal. They will be asked to write down as many of the reappraisals that they can remember generating in Session 2. They will then be asked to re-rate how much they believe the original interpretation (logically, emotionally). In the final section of the worksheet, the 5 previously rated emotions will be listed (satisfied, sad, hopeful, guilty, anxious), and participants will be asked to rate how strongly they now feel this way about it. This procedure will be repeated for both of the reappraisal exercises (control and specificity conditions). \nSimilarly, for the follow-up evidence gathering worksheets participants will be provided with their original negative assumption, and the alternative assumption that they generated. They will be asked to write down as many of the pieces of evidence they can remember generating in Session 2 in support of the alternative assumption. They will then be asked to re-rate their strength of belief in the original assumption (logically and emotionally), and the alternative assumption (logically, emotionally). Lastly, the five previously-rated emotions will be listed and participants will be asked to rate how strongly they now feel this way about the new assumption. This will be completed for the assumptions challenged in both the specificity and control induction condition. \n\nThe proportion of a) event reappraisals and b) pieces of evidence correctly recalled will be counted by independent scorers, who will be blinded to the experimental conditions. For both tasks, belief change scores will be calculated by deducting the original belief ratings (logical, emotional) from the follow-up belief rating scores. Negative scores indicate a reduction in the strength of belief, whereas positive scores indicate a strengthening of the belief. Similarly, a change score will be calculated for each of the 5 rated emotions by deducting the original ratings from the follow-up ratings, with more negative scores indicating a greater reduction in the emotion strength. \n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "Our required sample size is 30 participants.

CBT techniques draw upon an individual\u2019s autobiographical memory for their personal past, and require the individual to imagine future events, with the aim of changing the negative beliefs and assumptions that underpin dysfunctional models of the self and the world. Many of the core elements of CBT rely on cognitive processes (e.g., cognitive reappraisal, problem solving) that depend on the ability to recall specific, autobiographical information. For example, a commonly-used CBT technique involves asking an individual to evaluate the validity of a maladaptive assumption or belief (e.g., I am a total failure) by gathering specific information from their past which may act as evidence against the belief (e.g., I made a tasty dinner last week). Autobiographical memory processes are commonly disrupted in depression. People with depression show a chronic bias towards retrieving generalised summaries about the personal past, rather than memories for specific, single episodes (Dalgleish et al., 2007; Sumner, 2012; Williams et al., 2007). These biases towards overgeneralised memory retrieval, and away from recall of specific information, may thereby impair the ability to engage with, and benefit from CBT. \n\nRecent work has shown that inducing a more specific processing style can temporarily help people to become more specific in their memory retrieval, and enhance performance on tasks that draw upon episodic memory processes (Jing, Madore, &amp; Schacter, 2016, 2017; Madore &amp; Schacter, 2014; Sheldon, Gurguryan, Madore, &amp; Schacter, 2019). Jing et al. (2016) found that an episodic specificity induction \u2013 brief training in recollecting specific details of a recent experience - enhanced problem solving and episodic reappraisal within a healthy student population. Within a depressed population, McFarland, Primosch, Maxson, &amp; Stewart, (2017) found that the same specificity induction procedure improved performance on a subsequent problem solving task.\n\nThe current study will investigate whether a similar specificity induction procedure can help depressed individuals complete CBT exercises that rely on specific autobiographical retrieval, and whether this improves the efficacy of the CBT exercises. We will examine whether, relative to a control (general impressions about an event) induction procedure, the episodic specificity induction a) enhances the number of specific alternative interpretations generated on an episodic reappraisal task, and b) increases the number of pieces of evidence gathered in an exercise designed to evaluate the validity of a negative self-assumption (evidence gathering task). We will examine whether there is a corresponding change in strength of belief ratings (both how much it is logically believed to be true, and how much it feels true) for the challenged interpretations and assumptions. We will also explore the endurance of these effects, and possible moderating factors. \n", "q4": "Primary hypotheses:\n1)\tOn the reappraisal task, we anticipate that \na)\tParticipants will generate a greater number, on average, of alternate interpretations following the specificity induction, compared with the control induction condition. \nb)\tAs a result of this, we anticipate a greater decrease in both logical and emotional belief ratings for the original negative appraisal for the event reappraised in the specificity induction condition, relative to the control condition.  \n2)\tOn the evidence gathering task, we predict that\na)\tA greater number of pieces of evidence will be generated following the specificity induction, relative to the control induction condition. \nb)\tThere will be a greater increase in strength of belief (logical, emotional) in the new, alternative assumption following the evidence gathering task completed in the specificity induction condition, relative to the control induction condition.\nSecondary hypotheses:   \n\n3)\tFor the evidence gathering task, we predict that there will be a greater decrease in strength of belief ratings for the original assumption in the specificity induction condition than the control condition.   \n\n4)\tFollowing a 1-week delay, we predict that a greater proportion of the generated a) alternative interpretations and b) pieces of evidence, will be recalled for the specificity induction condition, relative to the control induction condition.

The order of the induction type will be counterbalanced across induction conditions. The order of the CBT tasks will be fixed (reappraisal then evidence gathering) as, based on our clinical experience, it is likely that completing evidence gathering first would have strong effects on later completion of a reappraisal task. \n ", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Participants aged 18-70 who meet criteria for a current diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder will be recruited from the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit clinical volunteer panel. Depression status will be confirmed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (First, Williams, Karg, &amp; Spitzer, 2015). Exclusion criteria include any intellectual disability, past or present neurological disorder, and current substance or alcohol dependence. Any participants who show severe impairments on executive tests in session 1 will be excluded from the study. \n\nProcedure \n \nThe study will be completed in two 60-90 minute sessions, completed on two separate days. During Session 1, participants will complete the memory and executive function tests; the Alternating Instructions version of the Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT-AI) , a retrieval-induced forgetting test, the Verbal Fluency Task and the Digit Span Test of working memory. Questionnaire measures of depressive symptoms (Beck\u2019s Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)), ruminative tendency (Ruminative Response Scale (RRS)) and dysfunctional attitudes (Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (DAS)) will also be administered. Finally, participants will select two maladaptive assumptions and generate memories of two negative scenarios (a negative social interaction, and a time when something didn't go as planned) for use in the CBT tasks in Session 2. \n\nIn Session 2, participants will complete an induction (specificity or control) followed by the reappraisal task, a short top-up induction, and the evidence gathering task. The procedure will then be completed with the alternate (specificity or control) induction. The order of the induction type (specificity, impressions control) will be counterbalanced. Both induction procedures involve watching a two minute video clip of individuals completing everyday activities (e.g., cooking, morning routine), and answering questions about the video. A different video will be used for each induction, and videos will be counterbalanced across task (evidence gathering, reappraisal) and induction-type. The reappraisal scenario type (negative social interaction, and a time when something didn't go as planned), and the nature of the assumption (failure, inferiority) selected for evidence gathering will be counterbalanced across induction conditions. \n\nOne week after Session 2, participants will be contacted by telephone and/or email and asked to complete a follow-up worksheet designed to assess the endurance of the experimental effects. \n\n\nMaterials and method:\n\n\nAutobiographical memory test (alternating instructions):\n\nThe AMT is designed to measure ability to deliberately retrieve specific memories in response to a series of positive, negative and neutrally valenced cue words (Williams &amp; Broadbent, 1986).  The alternating instructions AMT (AMT-AI) is an adapted version of the original AMT, in which participants are required to recall both specific and categoric memories. A specific memory is defined as an event that happened at a specific time in a certain place (e.g. \u2018Winning my tennis match last Thursday\u2019), whereas a categoric memory is defined as a memory of an event that happened on many different occasions (e.g. \u2018I used to play tennis every Thursday\u2019). Participants are presented with 24 cue words in total (8 positive, 8 negative and 8 neutral), divided into three blocks. In one block of 6 cues, participants are asked to generate specific memories, for one block of 6 cues they are asked to generate categoric memories. For one block of 12 cues, they alternate between recall of categoric and specific memories. The order of these blocks will be randomised across participants to control for order effects. \nTwo lists of cue words will be randomised between participants, the original list created by Dritschel, Beltsos, McClintock, &amp; Beltosis, (2014), and a second list created by Hitchcock et al., (2019). Both cue lists were taken from the MRC Psycholinguistic database, and have been matched for word frequency (Wilson, 1988). \nThe instructions will be presented on a computer. Before completing the test trials, participants will be given four practice trials (two specific, two categoric), using neutral cue words, and feedback will be given for any incorrect answers. During the test phase, each cue will appear on the screen with an instruction indicating whether to recall a specific or categoric memory (e.g. \u2018please retrieve a specific memory associated with the word \u2018happy\u2019\u2019). Participants will be given 1 minute to respond, indicating that they have a memory in mind, and will then report the memory to the researcher aloud. Responses will be coded by the experimenter, and voice recorded for later second rating by an independent scorer. \nItems will be coded as specific, extended (lasting longer than 1 day), categoric, a repetition (a memory that had previously been reported), a semantic associate (information related to the cue, but which is not an autobiographical memory), or an omission (failure to generate a memory). For each block, the number of correct responses will be calculated. The proportion of internal and external details generated will be assessed using the Autobiographical Interview scoring procedure. Internal details consist of specific information regarding who, what, where, and when features of a specific episodic memory, whereas external details include description of related facts, elaborations, or references to other events, and are thought to draw on more general semantic processing.\n\n\nRetrieval induced forgetting:\n\nRIF will be measured using a procedure based on the original paradigm established by Anderson, Bjork, &amp; Bjork, (1994). Participants will begin by studying 48 category\u2013exemplar pairs (e.g., Kitchen\u2013fork; profession\u2013 nurse) (36 critical pairs, 12 fillers). Half of the exemplars will be \u2018strong\u2019 (high frequency) exemplars of the given category (e.g. kitchen \u2013 fork), whilst the other half will be weak exemplars of the category (e.g. kitchen \u2013 mixer).  Participants will then practice retrieving the weak subset of exemplars from a subset of categories, when provided with the category cue plus the letter stem of the target exemplar (e.g., Kitchen\u2013mi____?). Each exemplar will be practised three times each. \nParticipants will take a 5-minute break, following which they will complete a final recall test. They will be cued with the category plus single letter-stem, and asked to recall the associated exemplar. The order will be controlled such that unpractised items from practiced categories (RP- items) and their baselines (NRP- items) will be cued first, followed by practiced (RP+) items and their baselines (NRP+). This is to reduce the chances of the strengthened RP+ items blocking recall of the RP- items. A single RIF score will be calculated by subtracting percentage of RP\u2212 exemplars correctly recalled from percentage of NRP exemplars correctly recalled.  Higher scores indicate greater RIF, which is thought to reflect ability to inhibit competing items during selective retrieval. \n\n\nVerbal fluency:\n\nThe Verbal Fluency Task (VFT; Spreen &amp; Strauss, 1998) assesses executive control over verbal information.  Participants will be asked to generate as many words within a given category (animals, foods, or occupations) as they can in 60 seconds. They will then be given a further 60 s to generate as many words as they can beginning with a certain letter (F, A or S). Participants will be told that repetitions, proper nouns (e.g., France), and more than one word of the same origin (e.g., swim, swimming) will not be accepted. Verbal fluency score will be calculated as the number of correct words in each condition.\n\n\nWorking memory:\n\nThe Digit Span (DS) subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV) (Wechsler, 2008) will be administered and scored according to the test manual. Participants are read a sequence of numbers of increasing length at a rate of approximately one digit per second, and are asked to repeat the sequence back to the experimenter (DS-forward). The task is stopped when the participant reports the sequence incorrectly on two consecutive trials. This procedure is repeated, this time asking participants to report the sequence in reverse order (DS-backwards). Scores will be calculated by summing the raw forwards and backwards DS scores. \n\n\nSymptom measures:\n\nThe BDI-II consists of 21 items that assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms over the past 2 weeks. A score of 13 or below is considered to be within the normal/nonclinical range, 14 to 19 reflects the mild range, 17 to 29 reflects the moderate range, and 30 and above reflects the severe range of symptom severity (Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996).\n\nRuminative tendency will be assessed using the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS) (Nolen-Hoeksema &amp; Morrow, 1991), a 22-item questionnaire that assesses how often how often participants engage in ruminative thought patterns when they are feeling sad or down. Each item is rated on a 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always) Likert scale. The RRS is a reliable and valid measure of rumination (Luminet, 2004), with high internal consistency (reported Cronbach\u2019s coefficient of .91, Moberly &amp; Watkins, 2008). Scores range from 22 to 88, with higher scores indicative of greater levels of ruminative thinking.\n\nThe intensity of dysfunctional attitudes will be measured with the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS-A-17)(de Graaf, Roelofs, &amp; Huibers, 2009). Participants rate 17 statements on a 4-point Likert scale of how much they agree with the statement. The scale shows high internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s alpha .91). Total score is the sum of the 17 items, with a range of 17-68. Higher scores reflect more dysfunctional attitudes.\n\n\nReappraisal scenario generation:\n\nIn Session 1, participants will generate two negative scenarios for use in the reappraisal tasks in Session 2. Participants will be instructed to recall and describe two specific scenarios to the experimenter in as much detail as they can remember; 1) an occasion when something didn\u2019t work out as well they wanted, and 2) an occasion when a social interaction didn\u2019t go well. If participants struggle to recall a specific event, they will be given some further prompts (e.g. \u2018perhaps a time when you were disappointed in your performance\u2019). They will be instructed not to choose major life events (e.g. marital breakdown, losing their job), but every day-type negative events. Once they have come up with an event, participants will be asked to write down their appraisal of the event (e.g. 'I never get anything right' or 'She doesn't like me'). They will then be asked to rate how much they logically believe this thought to be true and how much they feel like it is true, on a scale of 0-100. In the final section of the worksheet, participants will be asked to rate, in relation to the event, how strongly they feel each of 5 listed emotions (satisfied, sad, hopeful, guilty, anxious) on a scale of 0-100. This procedure will be repeated for the second event. \n\n\nSelection of assumptions:\n\nParticipants will also select two negative self-assumptions which they will challenge during the evidence gathering tasks in Session 2. They will be given a list of six statements which were selected and adapted from the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (DAS). The selected statements reflect core beliefs that are commonly held by people with depression, relating either to failure (e.g. 'If I cannot do something well, there is little point in doing it at all'), or inferiority (e.g. 'If other people know what you're really like, they will think less of you'). Participants will rate each statement in terms of how much they believe it to be true (logically, emotionally), and how important that assumption is to their identity.  Based on these ratings the experimenter will select one failure assumption and one inferiority assumption, matched as closely as possible for strength of belief and importance to identity. \n\nCognitive reappraisal task:\n\nCognitive reappraisal is a technique used frequently in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which aims to down-regulate the negative emotions associated with a certain situation by reframing it and reinterpreting its meaning. In the current study, participants will be presented with one of the episodes that they generated in Session 1 (a time when something didn\u2019t go as planned, or a time when a social interaction didn\u2019t go well). Before the induction procedure, participants will be given a standardised set of instructions and an example of a completed reappraisal worksheet. Instructions will state that they should try to reframe the original meaning of the event by trying to think of alternative interpretations. Following the induction, participants will be given a blank version of the worksheet with one their previously generated negative scenarios. They will be given approximately 10 minutes to write down as many more adaptive reappraisals as they can. The worksheet includes prompts such as \u2018What would another person in a similar situation think about this?\u2019 or \u2018Is what I believe the only way, or the best way to view this situation?\u2019 They will then be asked to re-rate how strongly they believe the original event appraisal (logically, emotionally), and to re-rate the intensity of feelings (satisfied, sad, hopeful, guilty, anxious) about the event. This procedure will be repeated for the second event following the second induction. The event-type (poor task performance, social) will be counterbalanced across induction conditions (specificity vs control). \n\nNumber of alternative appraisals generated by the participant will be counted by blinded scorers. To assess the change in belief in the original event appraisal as a result of the exercise, difference scores will be calculated by deducting the original belief ratings (logical and emotional) from the post-reappraisal belief ratings. More negative scores indicate a reduction in the strength of belief whereas a positive score indicates a strengthening of the belief following reappraisal. A change score will also be calculated for the rated intensity of each the 5 emotions by deducting the original ratings from the post-reappraisal ratings. Again, negative scores indicate a decrease in the strength of the feeling(s). \n\n\nEvidence gathering task:\n\nEvidence gathering is another commonly used CBT technique, which aims to modify the maladaptive assumptions that an individual holds about themselves or the world. Once a maladpative assumption (e.g., If I fail at my work, then I am a failure as a person) is identified, the evidence for and against it can be evaluated, supporting the generation of a more functional assumption.  \nIn Session 2, participants will gather evidence to support an alternate assumption which counters the negative self-assumption that was selected in Session 1. Before the induction procedure, participants will be given a standardised set of instructions and an example evidence gathering worksheet.  Participants will be instructed to come up with an alternative, more helpful assumption which counters the negative self-assumption. They will be instructed to rate how much they believe this to be true (logically and emotionally, on a scale of 0-100).They will also be asked to rate, in relation to the new assumption, how strongly they feel each of 5 emotions (satisfied, sad, hopeful, guilty, anxious) on a scale of 0-100. \nFollowing the induction procedure, they will be instructed to think of some examples of situations from their personal past that would support the new, more helpful assumption. Participants will have approximately 10 minutes to come up with as many pieces of evidence as they can, writing them in the relevant section on the worksheet. Following this exercise, they will be asked to re-rate the extent to which they now believe the original and the new assumption (both logically and emotionally), and re-rate the strength of their emotions about the new assumption. This procedure will be repeated for the second negative assumption following the second induction. The assumption-type (failure, inferiority) will be counterbalanced across conditions (specificity vs control). \nNumber of specific pieces of evidence will be counted by blinded scorers. Change in belief rating scores for both the original assumption and the new assumption will be calculated by deducting the original belief ratings (logical, emotional) from the post-evidence gathering belief ratings. Negative scores indicate a reduction in the strength of belief whereas a positive score indicates a strengthening of the belief following the evidence gathering task. A change score will also be calculated for the rated intensity of each of the 5 rated emotions by deducting the original ratings from the post-reappraisal ratings. Again, negative scores indicate a decrease in the strength of the feeling(s). \n\n\nFollow up worksheet:\n\nOne-week after completion of Session 2, participants will be contacted via email/phone, and asked to complete four short follow-up worksheets. The worksheets follow the same structure as the reappraisal and evidence gathering worksheets completed in Session 2. To examine the enduring effects of the reappraisal task, participants will be provided with their original negative event descriptions and original appraisal. They will be asked to write down as many of the reappraisals that they can remember generating in Session 2. They will then be asked to re-rate how much they believe the original interpretation (logically, emotionally). In the final section of the worksheet, the 5 previously rated emotions will be listed (satisfied, sad, hopeful, guilty, anxious), and participants will be asked to rate how strongly they now feel this way about it. This procedure will be repeated for both of the reappraisal exercises (control and specificity conditions). \nSimilarly, for the follow-up evidence gathering worksheets participants will be provided with their original negative assumption, and the alternative assumption that they generated. They will be asked to write down as many of the pieces of evidence they can remember generating in Session 2 in support of the alternative assumption. They will then be asked to re-rate their strength of belief in the original assumption (logically and emotionally), and the alternative assumption (logically, emotionally). Lastly, the five previously-rated emotions will be listed and participants will be asked to rate how strongly they now feel this way about the new assumption. This will be completed for the assumptions challenged in both the specificity and control induction condition. \n\nThe proportion of a) event reappraisals and b) pieces of evidence correctly recalled will be counted by independent scorers, who will be blinded to the experimental conditions. For both tasks, belief change scores will be calculated by deducting the original belief ratings (logical, emotional) from the follow-up belief rating scores. Negative scores indicate a reduction in the strength of belief, whereas positive scores indicate a strengthening of the belief. Similarly, a change score will be calculated for each of the 5 rated emotions by deducting the original ratings from the follow-up ratings, with more negative scores indicating a greater reduction in the emotion strength. \n\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "Specificity vs control induction. \nThe (a) reappraisal and b) evidence gathering exercises will be completed following the i) control induction and ii) the specificity induction (counterbalanced order). The inductions will be conducted in the same manner as previous studies (e.g. Jing et al., 2016; 2017; Madore et al., 2014). Both induction-types involve watching a 2 minute video clip of adults performing routine activities, and then answering questions about the video. In the control induction, the questions ask participants for their general impressions about the video (e.g., whether they liked it, the techniques used to make the video). In the specificity induction, the questions ask participants to provide specific detail regarding the people, actions, and surroundings in the video, using mental imagery probes. Total questioning time for the initial inductions will be six minutes. The brief top-up inductions completed between tasks will follow the same procedure as the initial inductions, but with a shorter, three minute questioning period.

Difference scores will be compared using repeated measures ANOVAs with the within subjects factors of induction (specificity, control) and belief type (emotional, logical), for both the reappraisal and evidence gathering tasks.\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/jqpek/children/?format=json",

fractures (PHF) are the third most common non-vertebral osteoporotic fractures among the elderly (Calvo et al., 2011; Court-Brown et al., 2017; Launonen et al., 2015). Palvanen et al. reported an average increase of 13.7% per year between 1970 and 2002 of patients older than 60 hospitalized with PHF (Palvanen et al., 2006). In a more recent study by Launonen et al. the authors reported an incidence of 379 PHF per 100,000 person-years for women and 232 per 100,000 person-years for men over the age of 80 years (Launonen et al., 2015). Both operative and non-operative interventions have been used as methods of treatment. Non-operative treatment often constitutes a period of immobilization in a sling combined with either immediate passive mobilization or delayed passive and active exercises after a period of immobilization. Multiple surgical treatment options exist, including closed reduction and percutaneous pinning, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with either plate and screws, tension-band or intramedullary fixation. Complex fractures like head-splitting fractures, fracture dislocations, and some 4-part fractures have been treated surgically with hemi-arthroplasty (HA). However, the use of reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) in the primary treatment of these fractures has been increasing. Klug et al. reported a more than eightfold increase in the use of RSA for the treatment of PHF in Germany between 2007 and 2016 while the use of HA decreased by 57.1%. Locking plate fixation was used as the primary treatment in 48.3% of cases making it most used treatment of choice(Klug et al., 2019). However, no consensus on the optimal treatment modality for the primary care of PHF exist. \n\nSeveral randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared the functional outcome following operative or non-operative treatments for PHF (Boons et al., 2012; Fjalestad et al., 2012, 2010; Fjalestad and Hole, 2014; Handoll et al., 2017; Launonen et al., 2019; Lopiz et al., 2019; Olerud et al., 2011a, 2011b; Rangan et al., 2015; Stableforth, 1984; Zyto et al., 1997). Based on these studies several meta-analyses have been conducted to summarize the available evidence. However, the conclusions have been conflicting. A preliminary search identified 15 overlapping meta-analyses of the difference in clinical outcome between operative and non-operative treatments for PHF. Of these, 11 reported no significant difference in functional outcome measures between operative and non-operative treatments (Beks et al., 2018; Fu et al., 2014; Handoll and Brorson, 2015; Jia et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016, 2013; Mao et al., 2015, 2014; Navarro et al., 2018; Rabi, 2015; Song et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2015). Although Mao et al. (2015) reported no significant difference in functional outcome they did, however, report that patients treated operatively reported significantly higher post-operative quality of life scores compared to patients treated non-operatively. \n\nThree of the 15 identified meta-analyses reported a significant improvement in functional outcome for the operative intervention when compared to non-operative treatments (Chen et al., 2016; Du et al., 2017; Sabharwal et al., 2016). In the study by Sabharwal et al., the authors conducted subgroup analyses based on fracture complexity and reported that 4-part fractures managed operatively had significantly higher quality of life scores at 24 months. However, they did not report any significant difference in functional outcome between operative and non-operative treatment (Sabharwal et al., 2016). Both Chen et al. and Du et al. conducted network meta-analyses and reported that RSA was associated with the highest probability for improving functional outcome compared to other operative interventions and non-operative treatment (Chen et al., 2016; Du et al., 2017). \n\nSystematic reviews and meta-analyses are often used to summarize the current evidence on treatment effects and are often used by decision-makers to guide clinical practice (Mulrow, 1994). It has previously been reported that differences in methodological quality potentially can affect the outcome of meta-analyses thereby leading to conflicting conclusions (Higgins and Green, 2011; Simunovic et al., 2009). One could, therefore, hypothesize that the discordant conclusions described above are in part caused by variation in methodological quality. \n\nThe primary aim of this study is, therefore, to investigate if variation in methodological quality can explain the discordant conclusions of systematic reviews with meta-analyses comparing operative versus non-operative treatment for proximal humeral fractures in the elderly.\n\nMethods\nThe present study protocol was developed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) (Moher et al., 2015). \nEligibility criteria\nSystematic reviews reporting meta-analyses comparing operative and non-operative treatments for PHF will be included. \nSystematic reviews including studies on patients below the mean age of 60 or studies on pathological fractures will be excluded. Systematic reviews that do not perform any meta-analyses will be excluded. If we identify duplicate publications or updates of the same review, we will only include the newest version as defined by publication date. No limits on publication date or language will be set.\nInformation sources\nPubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and Web of Science will be searched using the strategy described below. Furthermore, the references of the included studies and of relevant studies identified during the selection process will be screened for potentially eligible studies. \n\nSearch strategy\nThe search strategy will be developed for PubMed and will be adapted for the other bibliographic databases. \n\nStudy records\n\nData management \nThe retrieved records will be imported to an EndNote X9 database. Duplicates will be identified manually using EndNote\u2019s built-in functions. The remaining records will then be uploaded to the Covidence website for the selection process (Covidence systematic review software, Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia. Available at www.covidence.org, n.d.).\n\nSelection process\nThe abstract and full text screening of potentially eligible studies will be performed independently by the first and second author. Disagreements will be solved by consensus.\n\nData collection process\nA data extraction form will be created using Excel and piloted by the first and second author on three studies randomly selected from the included studies. After any corrections are made following the piloting process, all studies will then be extracted independently by the first and second author. Disagreements will be solved by consensus.\n\nData items\nThe following variables on study characteristics will be extracted: \n\u2022\tpublication year\n\u2022\tlanguage\n\u2022\trationale for repeating review\n\u2022\tPICO\n\u2022\tdatabases searched\n\u2022\tyears covered in search\n\u2022\tincluded trials\n\u2022\tnumber of patients \nThe conclusions will be grouped and classified based on outcome as follows; 1) quality of life, 2) functional outcome and 3) harm of intervention. The conclusions will be scored on a scale from 1 to 6 as described by Als-Nielsen et al. (Als-Nielsen et al., 2003). Intervention will be defined as operative treatment and control will be defined as non-operative treatment.\n\nThe methodological quality of the included studies will be evaluated using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR2) tool (Shea et al., 2017). AMSTAR2 is an updated version of the original AMSTAR, which is a validated tool for assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews(Shea et al., 2009, 2007). The tool consists of 16 items evaluating the methodological quality of different steps during the process of conducting a meta-analysis. Item 1,3,5,6 and 10-16 will be scored as either \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019. Item 2, 4 and 7-9 will be scored as either \u2018yes\u2019, \u2018partial yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019. Each study will be assigned an overall rating of either high, moderate, low or critically low using the criteria defined in the AMSTAR2 guidelines (Shea et al., 2017). The AMSTAR2 authors define 7 of the 16 items as being critical and these items therefore have a larger impact on the overall rating. The critical domains are: item 1 regarding protocol registration, item 4 regarding search strategy, item 7 regarding exclusion of studies, item 9 regarding risk of bias in included studies, item 11 regarding the method of meta-analysis, item 13 regarding the consideration of risk of bias when interpreting the results and item 15 regarding the assessment of publication bias (Shea et al., 2017). The information used to answer each AMSTAR2 question will also be extracted as variables.\n\nFurthermore, the following variables not covered by AMSTAR2 will be extracted. These variables associated with methodological quality has previously been shown or hypothesized to affect study conclusions:\n\u2022\tsources of funding (not reported, none, yes \u2013 industry support, Yes \u2013 non-profit support) (Ebrahim et al., 2016; J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2008) \n\u2022\tjournal type (open access, subscription based, Cochrane) (J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2006) \n\u2022\tis one of the authors a content area expert, defined as either orthopedic specialist or author of an included study (yes, no) (Assendelft et al., 1995; G\u00f8tzsche and Ioannidis, 2012)\n\u2022\tinclusion criteria (Bolland and Grey, 2014; Ford et al., 2010; Goodyear-Smith et al., 2012; Linde and Willich, 2003)  \n\nLastly, we will conduct an explorative analysis of each included study to identify any methodological variables not described above that could explain the discordant conclusions. If any such variables are identified we will, if possible, extract these as quantitative variables.\n\nOutcomes and prioritization\nThe primary aim is to analyze the association between AMSTAR2 rating and study conclusions. \nThe secondary aim is to investigate the association between the critical AMSTAR2 items described above and study conclusions.\nThe tertiary aim is to identify methodological variables, not included in AMSTAR2, and analyze the effect on study conclusions.\n\nData synthesis\nWe do not expect the data for our outcomes or subgroup analyses to be normally distributed. Therefore, the Mann-Whitney test will be used for independent variables with two levels while the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance will be used for the independent variables with more than two levels. Furthermore, we will calculate Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient between the overall AMSTAR2 rating and study conclusions. We will conduct sensitivity analyses based on the number of included patients for each included study and the years covered by the included studies search strategy. \nSignificance will be defined as p-values &lt; 0.05. If we find a significant difference in conclusions for the AMSTAR2 ratings, we will perform pairwise comparisons for each combination of AMSTAR2 ratings. If the pairwise comparisons are performed, the significance level for these analyses will be corrected using the Holm-Bonferroni method. \nSome of the extracted variables does not allow for statistical testing. We will therefore provide a descriptive analysis of these variables using summary statistics. Means and standard deviations will be calculated for normally distributed variables while medians and interquartile ranges will be calculated for non-normally distributed variables. \nAll analyses will be performed using the statistical computing software R (2019).\n\nAnalysis of subgroups or subsets\nWe plan to investigate the association between study conclusions and the following variables: \n\u2022\tJournal type\n\u2022\tSources of funding\n\u2022\tOne of the authors is a content area expert\nFurthermore, if the data permits, we will perform relevant subgroup analyses on variables identified as potential methodological issues not covered by the AMSTAR2 tool. If multiple new variables are identified and subgroup analyses performed, the significance level will be corrected using the Holm-Bonferroni method. \n\nConflicts of interest\nNone\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Inge Petersen, Biostatistician at the University of Southern Denmark Open Patient data Explorative Network, for assisting in the development of the data analysis plan. \n\u2003\nReferences \nAls-Nielsen, B., Chen, W., Gluud, C., Kjaergard, L.L., 2003.

Palvanen et al. reported an average increase of 13.7% per year between 1970 and 2002 of patients older than 60 hospitalized with PHF (Palvanen et al., 2006). In a more recent study by Launonen et al. the authors reported an incidence of 379 PHF per 100,000 person-years for women and 232 per 100,000 person-years for men over the age of 80 years (Launonen et al., 2015). Both operative and non-operative interventions have been used as methods of treatment. Non-operative treatment often constitutes a period of immobilization in a sling combined with either immediate passive mobilization or delayed passive and active exercises after a period of immobilization. Multiple surgical treatment options exist, including closed reduction and percutaneous pinning, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with either plate and screws, tension-band or intramedullary fixation. Complex fractures like head-splitting fractures, fracture dislocations, and some 4-part fractures have been treated surgically with hemi-arthroplasty (HA). However, the use of reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) in the primary treatment of these fractures has been increasing. Klug et al. reported a more than eightfold increase in the use of RSA for the treatment of PHF in Germany between 2007 and 2016 while the use of HA decreased by 57.1%. Locking plate fixation was used as the primary treatment in 48.3% of cases making it most used treatment of choice(Klug et al., 2019). However, no consensus on the optimal treatment modality for the primary care of PHF exist. \n\nSeveral randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared the functional outcome following operative or non-operative treatments for PHF (Boons et al., 2012; Fjalestad et al., 2012, 2010; Fjalestad and Hole, 2014; Handoll et al., 2017; Launonen et al., 2019; Lopiz et al., 2019; Olerud et al., 2011a, 2011b; Rangan et al., 2015; Stableforth, 1984; Zyto et al., 1997). Based on these studies several meta-analyses have been conducted to summarize the available evidence. However, the conclusions have been conflicting. A preliminary search identified 15 overlapping meta-analyses of the difference in clinical outcome between operative and non-operative treatments for PHF. Of these, 11 reported no significant difference in functional outcome measures between operative and non-operative treatments (Beks et al., 2018; Fu et al., 2014; Handoll and Brorson, 2015; Jia et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016, 2013; Mao et al., 2015, 2014; Navarro et al., 2018; Rabi, 2015; Song et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2015). Although Mao et al. (2015) reported no significant difference in functional outcome they did, however, report that patients treated operatively reported significantly higher post-operative quality of life scores compared to patients treated non-operatively. \n\nThree of the 15 identified meta-analyses reported a significant improvement in functional outcome for the operative intervention when compared to non-operative treatments (Chen et al., 2016; Du et al., 2017; Sabharwal et al., 2016). In the study by Sabharwal et al., the authors conducted subgroup analyses based on fracture complexity and reported that 4-part fractures managed operatively had significantly higher quality of life scores at 24 months. However, they did not report any significant difference in functional outcome between operative and non-operative treatment (Sabharwal et al., 2016). Both Chen et al. and Du et al. conducted network meta-analyses and reported that RSA was associated with the highest probability for improving functional outcome compared to other operative interventions and non-operative treatment (Chen et al., 2016; Du et al., 2017). \n\nSystematic reviews and meta-analyses are often used to summarize the current evidence on treatment effects and are often used by decision-makers to guide clinical practice (Mulrow, 1994). It has previously been reported that differences in methodological quality potentially can affect the outcome of meta-analyses thereby leading to conflicting conclusions (Higgins and Green, 2011; Simunovic et al., 2009). One could, therefore, hypothesize that the discordant conclusions described above are in part caused by variation in methodological quality. \n\nThe primary aim of this study is, therefore, to investigate if variation in methodological quality can explain the discordant conclusions of systematic reviews with meta-analyses comparing operative versus non-operative treatment for proximal humeral fractures in the elderly.\n\nMethods\nThe present study protocol was developed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) (Moher et al., 2015). \nEligibility criteria\nSystematic reviews reporting meta-analyses comparing operative and non-operative treatments for PHF will be included. \nSystematic reviews including studies on patients below the mean age of 60 or studies on pathological fractures will be excluded. Systematic reviews that do not perform any meta-analyses will be excluded. If we identify duplicate publications or updates of the same review, we will only include the newest version as defined by publication date. No limits on publication date or language will be set.\nInformation sources\nPubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and Web of Science will be searched using the strategy described below. Furthermore, the references of the included studies and of relevant studies identified during the selection process will be screened for potentially eligible studies. \n\nSearch strategy\nThe search strategy will be developed for PubMed and will be adapted for the other bibliographic databases. \n\nStudy records\n\nData management \nThe retrieved records will be imported to an EndNote X9 database. Duplicates will be identified manually using EndNote\u2019s built-in functions. The remaining records will then be uploaded to the Covidence website for the selection process (Covidence systematic review software, Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia. Available at www.covidence.org, n.d.).\n\nSelection process\nThe abstract and full text screening of potentially eligible studies will be performed independently by the first and second author. Disagreements will be solved by consensus.\n\nData collection process\nA data extraction form will be created using Excel and piloted by the first and second author on three studies randomly selected from the included studies. After any corrections are made following the piloting process, all studies will then be extracted independently by the first and second author. Disagreements will be solved by consensus.\n\nData items\nThe following variables on study characteristics will be extracted: \n\u2022\tpublication year\n\u2022\tlanguage\n\u2022\trationale for repeating review\n\u2022\tPICO\n\u2022\tdatabases searched\n\u2022\tyears covered in search\n\u2022\tincluded trials\n\u2022\tnumber of patients \nThe conclusions will be grouped and classified based on outcome as follows; 1) quality of life, 2) functional outcome and 3) harm of intervention. The conclusions will be scored on a scale from 1 to 6 as described by Als-Nielsen et al. (Als-Nielsen et al., 2003). Intervention will be defined as operative treatment and control will be defined as non-operative treatment.\n\nThe methodological quality of the included studies will be evaluated using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR2) tool (Shea et al., 2017). AMSTAR2 is an updated version of the original AMSTAR, which is a validated tool for assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews(Shea et al., 2009, 2007). The tool consists of 16 items evaluating the methodological quality of different steps during the process of conducting a meta-analysis. Item 1,3,5,6 and 10-16 will be scored as either \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019. Item 2, 4 and 7-9 will be scored as either \u2018yes\u2019, \u2018partial yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019. Each study will be assigned an overall rating of either high, moderate, low or critically low using the criteria defined in the AMSTAR2 guidelines (Shea et al., 2017). The AMSTAR2 authors define 7 of the 16 items as being critical and these items therefore have a larger impact on the overall rating. The critical domains are: item 1 regarding protocol registration, item 4 regarding search strategy, item 7 regarding exclusion of studies, item 9 regarding risk of bias in included studies, item 11 regarding the method of meta-analysis, item 13 regarding the consideration of risk of bias when interpreting the results and item 15 regarding the assessment of publication bias (Shea et al., 2017). The information used to answer each AMSTAR2 question will also be extracted as variables.\n\nFurthermore, the following variables not covered by AMSTAR2 will be extracted. These variables associated with methodological quality has previously been shown or hypothesized to affect study conclusions:\n\u2022\tsources of funding (not reported, none, yes \u2013 industry support, Yes \u2013 non-profit support) (Ebrahim et al., 2016; J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2008) \n\u2022\tjournal type (open access, subscription based, Cochrane) (J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2006) \n\u2022\tis one of the authors a content area expert, defined as either orthopedic specialist or author of an included study (yes, no) (Assendelft et al., 1995; G\u00f8tzsche and Ioannidis, 2012)\n\u2022\tinclusion criteria (Bolland and Grey, 2014; Ford et al., 2010; Goodyear-Smith et al., 2012; Linde and Willich, 2003)  \n\nLastly, we will conduct an explorative analysis of each included study to identify any methodological variables not described above that could explain the discordant conclusions. If any such variables are identified we will, if possible, extract these as quantitative variables.\n\nOutcomes and prioritization\nThe primary aim is to analyze the association between AMSTAR2 rating and study conclusions. \nThe secondary aim is to investigate the association between the critical AMSTAR2 items described above and study conclusions.\nThe tertiary aim is to identify methodological variables, not included in AMSTAR2, and analyze the effect on study conclusions.\n\nData synthesis\nWe do not expect the data for our outcomes or subgroup analyses to be normally distributed. Therefore, the Mann-Whitney test will be used for independent variables with two levels while the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance will be used for the independent variables with more than two levels. Furthermore, we will calculate Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient between the overall AMSTAR2 rating and study conclusions. We will conduct sensitivity analyses based on the number of included patients for each included study and the years covered by the included studies search strategy. \nSignificance will be defined as p-values &lt; 0.05. If we find a significant difference in conclusions for the AMSTAR2 ratings, we will perform pairwise comparisons for each combination of AMSTAR2 ratings. If the pairwise comparisons are performed, the significance level for these analyses will be corrected using the Holm-Bonferroni method. \nSome of the extracted variables does not allow for statistical testing. We will therefore provide a descriptive analysis of these variables using summary statistics. Means and standard deviations will be calculated for normally distributed variables while medians and interquartile ranges will be calculated for non-normally distributed variables. \nAll analyses will be performed using the statistical computing software R (2019).\n\nAnalysis of subgroups or subsets\nWe plan to investigate the association between study conclusions and the following variables: \n\u2022\tJournal type\n\u2022\tSources of funding\n\u2022\tOne of the authors is a content area expert\nFurthermore, if the data permits, we will perform relevant subgroup analyses on variables identified as potential methodological issues not covered by the AMSTAR2 tool. If multiple new variables are identified and subgroup analyses performed, the significance level will be corrected using the Holm-Bonferroni method. \n\nConflicts of interest\nNone\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Inge Petersen, Biostatistician at the University of Southern Denmark Open Patient data Explorative Network, for assisting in the development of the data analysis plan. \n\u2003\nReferences \nAls-Nielsen, B., Chen, W., Gluud, C., Kjaergard, L.L., 2003.

EMIS 2017 was a cross-sectional survey of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men in 50 countries between 18 October 2017 and 31 January 2018. The study was conducted by Sigma Research at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) in association with the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin. The EMIS 2017 study is described in detail at https://www.esticom.eu/Webs/ESTICOM/EN/emis-2017/survey-report/EMIS_2017_REPORT_ECDC.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1\n\nQ6: Specify whether this data is open or publicly available.\n\u2022\tThe data is not openly accessible. \n \nQ7: How can the data be accessed? Provide a persistent identifier or link if the data are available online, or give a description of how you obtained the dataset.\n\u2022\tEMIS data for scientific articles can only be requested by members of the EMIS network. This network includes people involved in the development and dissemination of EMIS 2017 or the preparation and oversight of the national reports. The authors of the current study were involved in the oversight of the national report on EMIS 2017 for Ireland.\n Q8: Specify the date of download and/or access.\n\u2022\tThe raw data has not been accessed yet. Permission to use this data was granted on November 29th 2019 but it will not be transferred until a data transfer agreement has been signed by a legal representative of NUI Galway and returned to SIGMA research. When this is signed and processed by SIGMA research, Dr. Chris Noone will be given access to the raw data. Summary data for the Irish EMIS 2017 dataset was published on October 3rd 2017 and is available in the national report here: http://sigmaresearch.org.uk/files/local/EMIS-2017_National-Report_IE_Main.pdf\n\n Q9: If the data collection procedure is well documented, provide a link to that information. If the data collection procedure is not well documented, describe, to the best of your ability, how data were collected.\n\u2022\tParticipants in this survey were men who have sex with men who were over the age of sexual consent in their country. Convenience sampling was employed, and the survey was promoted through traditional media, social media, dating apps, and NGO websites. 2,083 men provided data for the Irish EMIS 2017 dataset.\n\u2022\tData collection for the full EMIS 2017 dataset is available in the overall report here: https://www.esticom.eu/Webs/ESTICOM/EN/emis-2017/survey-report/EMIS_2017_REPORT_ECDC.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1. Additional detail specific to Ireland is available here: http://sigmaresearch.org.uk/files/local/EMIS-2017_National-Report_IE_Main.pdf\n\n\n\nQ10: Some studies offer codebooks to describe their data. If such a codebook is publicly available, link to it here or upload the document. If not, provide other available documentation. Also provide guidance on what parts of the codebook or other documentation are most relevant.\n\u2022\tThe EMIS 2017 Variable Manual is available at http://sigmaresearch.org.uk/files/EMIS-2017-Variable-Manual.pdf\nThe following variables will be used in this study:\nIdentity\nAge (Q007)\nEthnic minority (Q403)\nName of ethnic group (Q404+Q405)\nEver diagnosed with HIV (Q057)\nSexual identity (Q029)\nMental Health\nPHQ4: anxiety/depression () (Q327-Q330)\nSocial Support\nCurrent partnerships status (Q034)\nSocial support (Q382-Q389)\nProximal Stressors\nInternalised homonegativity (Q390-Q396)\nOutness (Q030)\nDistal Stressors\nAbuse intimidated recency (Q397)\nAbuse insults recency (Q398)\nAbuse violence recency (Q399)\n\n\nPart 3: Variables\nQ11: If you are going to use any manipulated variables, identify them here. Describe the variables and the levels or treatment arms of each variable (note that this is not applicable for observational studies and meta-analyses). If you are collapsing groups across variables this should be explicitly stated, including the relevant formula.\n\u2022\tThis is an observational study. \n\nQ12: If you are going to use any measured variables, identify them here. Describe both outcome measures as well as predictors and covariates and label them accordingly. If you are using a scale (a set of items that have an underlying latent construct) or an index (a set of items that directly indicate a value or quantity), state the construct the scale/index represents, which items the scale/index will consist of, how these items will be aggregated, and whether this aggregation is based on a recommendation from the study codebook or validation research. If you are using any categorical variables, state how you will code them in the statistical analyses.\n\u2022\tAs mentioned above, the EMIS 2017 Variable Manual is available at http://sigmaresearch.org.uk/files/EMIS-2017-Variable-Manual.pdf. Here the variables which will be used are described in detail along with details of any recoding.\n\nIdentity\nAge (Q007): The values of this variable indicate age in years. Cases indicating 90 years or more are treated as outliers and have this variable missing (ie. are coded -1). This will be recoded to a categorical variable (1 = less than 25; 2 = 25-32; 3 = 33-39, 4 = 40+) and used as a grouping variable for exploratory multi-group SEM analyses.\n\nEthnic minority (Q403) &amp; Name of ethnic group (Q404+Q405): Participants indicate in Q403 whether they are a member of an ethnic minority group or not and then write their ethnicity in response to Q404 if they indicated being part of a majority group or to Q405 if they indicated being part of a minority group. These responses will be coded according to the broad categories used in the Irish census A. White (including Irish, Irish traveller and any other White background), B. Black or Black Irish (including African or any other Black background), C. Asian or Asian Irish and D. Other (including mixed and any other ethnicities). This will be used as a grouping variable for exploratory multi-group SEM analyses.\n\nEver diagnosed with HIV (Q057): The values of this variable indicate either not having been diagnosed with HIV (0) or having been diagnosed with HIV (1). This will be used as a grouping variable for exploratory multi-group SEM analyses.\n\nSexual identity (Q029): Participants could identify as gay or homosexual (81%), bisexual (13%), and straight or heterosexual (1%). They could also indicate that they use a different term (&lt;1%) or that they don\u2019t use a term (5%). Since the vast majority identified as homosexual or bisexual, the analysis will focus exclusively on these participants. A new variable will be computed which will indicate whether participants identify as homosexual (0) or bisexual (1). This will be an observed exogenous variable in the model.\n\nMental Health\nPHQ4: anxiety/depression (Q327-Q330): Participants responded to 4 questions regarding symptoms of anxiety or depression. A 4-point likert scale was used to describe their experiences of these symptoms (1=not at all, 2=some days, 3=more than half the days,4=nearly every day). Q327 and Q328 will be used as indicators for a latent endogenous variable representing anxiety symptoms. Q329 and Q330 will be used as indicators for a latent endogenous variable representing depression symptoms.\n\nSocial Support\nSocial support (Q382-Q389): Q382 to Q389 form two 4-item sub-scales of the Social Provisions Scale (Cutrona &amp; Russel, 1987), reliable alliance and social integration respectively. However, recent psychometric evidence suggests that these items load better onto a general support factor than onto these specific factors (Perera, 2016). Therefore, they will be used here as indicators of a general social support latent variable.\n\nProximal Stressors\nInternalised homonegativity (Q390-Q396) &amp; Outness (Q030): Participants responded to 7 questions related to internalised homophobia and a question regarding outness. These questions were all phrased in a way which indicates one\u2019s comfort with their sexual identity. The scale on Q030 will be reversed so that higher scores on all of these items indicate less proximal stress. These items will be used here as indicators of a general proximal stressors latent variable.\n\nDistal Stressors\nAbuse intimidated recency (Q397), Abuse insults recency (Q398) &amp; Abuse violence recency (Q399): Participants indicated how recently they had been intimidated, insulted and assaulted. They responded to an 8-point likert scale (1=Within the last 24 hours, 2=Within the last 7 days, 3=Within the last 4 weeks, 4=Within the last 6 months, 5=Within the last 12 months, 6=Within the last 5 years, 7=More than 5 years ago, 8=Never). These items will be recoded to approximate interval-level data by reducing the response set to (0 = more than a year ago/never, 1 = within the last 12 months, 2 = within the last 6 months, 3 = within the last month). It is assumed that more recent experiences will have a greater effect on individuals. These three recoded items will be used here as indicators of a general distal stressors latent variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ13: Which units of analysis (respondents, cases, etc.) will be included or excluded in your study? Taking these inclusion/exclusion criteria into account, indicate the (expected) sample size of the data you\u2019ll be using for your statistical analyses (to the best of your knowledge). In the next few questions, you will be asked to refine this sample size estimation based on your judgments about missing data and outliers.\n\u2022\tThe unit of analysis is individual participants. 2,083 eligible participants based in Ireland took part in EMIS 2017. Only those who identify as homosexual (n = 1,689) or bisexual (n = 250) will be included in this study. 113 men who identified as heterosexual, as an unspecified other identity or who did not identify with any particular identify label will be excluded. Therefore, the sample size is 1,939.\n\nQ14: What do you know about missing data in the data set (e.g., overall missingness rate, information about differential dropout)? How will you deal with incomplete or missing data? Based on this information, provide a new expected sample size.\n\u2022\tFrom the summary report, it is apparent that between 0 and 8% of data is missing for the variables relevant to this study. In addition, some of the items were only presented to random sub-samples. Missing data will be handled using maximum likelihood estimation so the effective sample size will remain 1,939.\n\nQ15: How will you define what a statistical outlier is in your data and what will you do when you encounter them? If you plan to remove outliers, provide a new expected sample size. Note that this will be the definitive expected sample size for your study and you will use this number to do any power analyses.\n\u2022\tThe data has already been cleaned by SIGMA research. Other secondary analyses of EMIS data have not removed outliers beyond this. We will follow this practice for univariate outliers. For multivariate outliers, we will carry out a sensitivity analysis where these are removed. We will identify multivariate outliers using the Mahalanobis Distance method and this will be achieved using the check_outliers function from the performance R package (L\u00fcdecke, Makowski, &amp; Waggoner, 2019). We will use the default threshold of considering the 2.5% most extreme values as outliers.\n\nQ16: Are there sampling weights available with this data set? If so, are you using them and how?\n\u2022\tThere are no sampling weights for this dataset. We will not create sampling weights as there is currently no reliable information on the demographics of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men in Ireland.\n\nPart 4: Knowledge of data\nQ17: List the publications, conference presentations (papers, posters), and working papers (in prep, unpublished, preprints) you have worked on that are based on the data set. Describe which variables you have previously analyzed and which information you used in these analyses. Limit yourself to variables that are relevant to the current study. If the dataset is longitudinal, include information about what wave of data was previously analyzed.\n\tImportantly, some of your team members may have used this dataset and others may not have. It is therefore important to specify the relevant work from every co-author separately. If possible, mention other researchers\u2019 work with this dataset that is relevant to the current preregistration.\n\u2022\tDescriptive summaries of this data have been presented in a national report (Casey, O\u2019Donnell, Brady &amp; Igoe, 2019). Four other studies using the Irish EMIS 2017 data focusing on different topics (chemsex, PrEP, sexual health of bisexual men and alcohol dependency) are currently being prepared.\n\nQ18: What prior knowledge do you have at the time of preregistration about trends in the data set you will be working with? For example, are you aware of summary statistics or the statistical distribution of variables, or do you know about correlations between variables? Your prior knowledge could stem from working with the data first-hand, from reading previously published research, or from codebooks. Also provide any relevant knowledge of different subsets of the data (e.g., a different wave than you will be using). Finally, provide information about your prior knowledge for every author separately.\n\u2022\tNone of the authors have had access to the raw data yet. The only summary data which the authors have had access to is that which has been published in the national report. This report only included descriptive and univariate analyses. The codebook does not provide information about trends in the data.\n\nPart 5: Analyses\nQ19: For each hypothesis, describe the statistical model you will use to test the hypothesis. Include the type of model (e.g., ANOVA, multiple regression, SEM) and the specification of the model (this includes each variable that will be included as predictor, outcome, or covariate). Specify any interactions and post-hoc analyses and remember that any test not included here must be noted as an exploratory test in the final article.\n\u2022\tThe data will first be described using means, standard deviations and correlation coefficients, where appropriate. Each of the research questions will be answered using structural equation modelling. The analyses will be conducted in R Studio using the psych package to describe the data and the lavaan package for structural equation modelling. The analyses will be visualised using Ggplot2. \n\u2022\tThe specific structural model which will be tested can be seen below in Figure 1. The exogenous variable representing sexual identity will be recoded from Q029 to a binary variable with homosexual identity as the reference and bisexual identity as the comparator. The distal stressors latent variable will include Q397, Q398 and Q399 as indicators. The social support latent variable will include Qs 382-389 as indicators. The proximal stressors latent variable will include Q030 and Qs 390-396 as indicators. The endogenous variables will be separate latent variables for depression and anxiety symptoms respectively indicated by the relevant items on the PHQ-4 (Qs 327-330). \n\u2022\tThe code for this SEM analysis in lavaan syntax is presented here:\nMinorityStress_model&lt;-\u2018#measurement models\nSocialSupport =~ Q382 + Q383 + Q384 + Q385 + Q386 + Q387 + Q388 + Q389\nDistalStressors =~ Q397 + Q398 + Q399\nProximalStressors =~ Q030 + Q390 + Q391 + Q392 + Q393 + Q394 + Q395 + Q396\nAnxiety =~ Q327 + Q328\nDepression =~ Q329 + Q330\n#structural model\nAnxiety ~ SocialSupport + DistalStressors + ProximalStressors + SexualIdentity\nDepression ~ SocialSupport + DistalStressors + ProximalStressors + SexualIdentity\nSocialSupport ~ SexualIdentity\nDistalStressors ~ SexualIdentity\nProximalStressors ~ SexualIdentity\u2019\nMinorityStress_SEM&lt;-sem(MinorityStress_model,data_coded,missing = \"ML\")\nMinorityStress_SEMFIT&lt;-summary(MinorityStress_SEM, fit.measures=TRUE)\n\u2022\tMaximum likelihood will be used as the estimation method. We will take a strictly confirmatory approach to testing this model, so no model modifications will be made. \n\n \nQ20: If applicable, specify a predicted effect size or a minimum effect size of interest for all the effects tested in your statistical analyses.\n\u2022\tThe minimum effect size of interest for this study is a canonical correlation of r = .10. \n\nQ21: Present the statistical power available to detect the predicted effect size(s) or the smallest effect size(s) of interest. Use the sample size after updating for missing data and outliers. \n\u2022\tUsing a sample size calculator available online, we estimate that we will have at least 88% power to detect the smallest effect size of interest for this study (see Figure 2; Soper, 2019). This calculator is based on formulas developed by Westland (2010). It is available at https://danielsoper.com/statcalc/references.aspx?id=89\n \n\nQ22: What criteria will you use to make inferences? Describe the information you will use (e.g. specify the p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, Bayes factors, specific model fit indices), as well as cut-off criteria, where appropriate. Will you be using one- or two-tailed tests for each of your analyses? If you are comparing multiple conditions or testing multiple hypotheses, will you account for this, and if so, how?\n\u2022\tThe minority stress model will be supported if the RMSEA value is below .06 and the TLI is above .90. We will conclude that parameter estimates are non-zero if their corresponding p value is less than .001. The hypotheses will be supported if the parameter estimates are in the expected direction and above the smallest effect size of interest (b = .01).\n\nQ23: What will you do should your data violate assumptions, your model not converge, or some other analytic problem arises?\n\u2022\tBased on the summary information available in the national EMIS report, we don\u2019t expect any ceiling or floor effects. There may be multivariate outliers and these will be detected and removed for a sensitivity analysis (see Q15 and Q24).\n\nQ24: Provide a series of decisions about evaluating the strength, reliability, or robustness of your focal hypothesis test. This may include within-study replication attempts, additional covariates, cross-validation efforts (out-of-sample replication, spilt/hold-out sample), applying weights, selectively applying constraints in an SEM context (e.g., comparing model fit statistics), overfitting adjustment techniques used (e.g., regularization approaches such as ridge regression), or some other simulation / sampling / bootstrapping method.\n\u2022\tWe will run a sensitivity analysis with multivariate outliers removed to see if the hypothesis tests are robust to their influence.\n\nQ25: If you plan to explore your data set to look for unexpected differences or relationships, you can describe those tests here, or add them to the final paper under a heading that clearly differentiates this exploratory part of your study from the confirmatory part.\n\u2022\tUsing multi-group SEM, we will explore the extent to which the relationships in the minority stress theory model vary as a function of age, HIV status and race/ethnicity.\n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"summary": "Secondary data analysis pre-registration template (van den Akker et al., 2019)\n\nPart 1: Study information\nQ1: Provide the working title of your study.\n\u2022\tThe Effects of Minority Stress on Depression and Anxiety Symptoms among Men who have Sex with Men in Ireland\n\nQ2: Name the authors of this preregistration.\n\u2022\tChris Noone (NUI Galway)\n\u2022\tDaniel McCartney (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine)\n\u2022\tMick Quinlan (Gay Health Network)\n\nQ3: List each research question included in this study.\n\u2022\tRQ1: What is the relationship between sexual identity and mental health outcomes?\n\u2022\tRQ2: What is the relationship between experiencing distal minority stressors and mental health outcomes?\n\u2022\tRQ3: What is the relationship between experiencing proximal minority stressors and mental health outcomes?\n\u2022\tRQ4: What is the relationship between experiencing social support and mental health outcomes?\n\u2022\tThese research questions pertain to propositions within Minority Stress Theory.\n\n\n\n\nQ4: For each of the research questions listed in the previous section, provide one or more specific and testable hypotheses, and make it clear whether the hypotheses are directional (e.g., A &gt; B) or non-directional (e.g., A \u2260 B).

EMIS 2017 was a cross-sectional survey of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men in 50 countries between 18 October 2017 and 31 January 2018. The study was conducted by Sigma Research at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) in association with the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin. The EMIS 2017 study is described in detail at https://www.esticom.eu/Webs/ESTICOM/EN/emis-2017/survey-report/EMIS_2017_REPORT_ECDC.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1\n\nQ6: Specify whether this data is open or publicly available.\n\u2022\tThe data is not openly accessible. \n \nQ7: How can the data be accessed? Provide a persistent identifier or link if the data are available online, or give a description of how you obtained the dataset.\n\u2022\tEMIS data for scientific articles can only be requested by members of the EMIS network. This network includes people involved in the development and dissemination of EMIS 2017 or the preparation and oversight of the national reports. The authors of the current study were involved in the oversight of the national report on EMIS 2017 for Ireland.\n Q8: Specify the date of download and/or access.\n\u2022\tThe raw data has not been accessed yet. Permission to use this data was granted on November 29th 2019 but it will not be transferred until a data transfer agreement has been signed by a legal representative of NUI Galway and returned to SIGMA research. When this is signed and processed by SIGMA research, Dr. Chris Noone will be given access to the raw data. Summary data for the Irish EMIS 2017 dataset was published on October 3rd 2017 and is available in the national report here: http://sigmaresearch.org.uk/files/local/EMIS-2017_National-Report_IE_Main.pdf\n\n Q9: If the data collection procedure is well documented, provide a link to that information. If the data collection procedure is not well documented, describe, to the best of your ability, how data were collected.\n\u2022\tParticipants in this survey were men who have sex with men who were over the age of sexual consent in their country. Convenience sampling was employed, and the survey was promoted through traditional media, social media, dating apps, and NGO websites. 2,083 men provided data for the Irish EMIS 2017 dataset.\n\u2022\tData collection for the full EMIS 2017 dataset is available in the overall report here: https://www.esticom.eu/Webs/ESTICOM/EN/emis-2017/survey-report/EMIS_2017_REPORT_ECDC.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1. Additional detail specific to Ireland is available here: http://sigmaresearch.org.uk/files/local/EMIS-2017_National-Report_IE_Main.pdf\n\n\n\nQ10: Some studies offer codebooks to describe their data. If such a codebook is publicly available, link to it here or upload the document. If not, provide other available documentation. Also provide guidance on what parts of the codebook or other documentation are most relevant.\n\u2022\tThe EMIS 2017 Variable Manual is available at http://sigmaresearch.org.uk/files/EMIS-2017-Variable-Manual.pdf\nThe following variables will be used in this study:\nIdentity\nAge (Q007)\nEthnic minority (Q403)\nName of ethnic group (Q404+Q405)\nEver diagnosed with HIV (Q057)\nSexual identity (Q029)\nMental Health\nPHQ4: anxiety/depression () (Q327-Q330)\nSocial Support\nCurrent partnerships status (Q034)\nSocial support (Q382-Q389)\nProximal Stressors\nInternalised homonegativity (Q390-Q396)\nOutness (Q030)\nDistal Stressors\nAbuse intimidated recency (Q397)\nAbuse insults recency (Q398)\nAbuse violence recency (Q399)\n\n\nPart 3: Variables\nQ11: If you are going to use any manipulated variables, identify them here. Describe the variables and the levels or treatment arms of each variable (note that this is not applicable for observational studies and meta-analyses). If you are collapsing groups across variables this should be explicitly stated, including the relevant formula.\n\u2022\tThis is an observational study. \n\nQ12: If you are going to use any measured variables, identify them here. Describe both outcome measures as well as predictors and covariates and label them accordingly. If you are using a scale (a set of items that have an underlying latent construct) or an index (a set of items that directly indicate a value or quantity), state the construct the scale/index represents, which items the scale/index will consist of, how these items will be aggregated, and whether this aggregation is based on a recommendation from the study codebook or validation research. If you are using any categorical variables, state how you will code them in the statistical analyses.\n\u2022\tAs mentioned above, the EMIS 2017 Variable Manual is available at http://sigmaresearch.org.uk/files/EMIS-2017-Variable-Manual.pdf. Here the variables which will be used are described in detail along with details of any recoding.\n\nIdentity\nAge (Q007): The values of this variable indicate age in years. Cases indicating 90 years or more are treated as outliers and have this variable missing (ie. are coded -1). This will be recoded to a categorical variable (1 = less than 25; 2 = 25-32; 3 = 33-39, 4 = 40+) and used as a grouping variable for exploratory multi-group SEM analyses.\n\nEthnic minority (Q403) &amp; Name of ethnic group (Q404+Q405): Participants indicate in Q403 whether they are a member of an ethnic minority group or not and then write their ethnicity in response to Q404 if they indicated being part of a majority group or to Q405 if they indicated being part of a minority group. These responses will be coded according to the broad categories used in the Irish census A. White (including Irish, Irish traveller and any other White background), B. Black or Black Irish (including African or any other Black background), C. Asian or Asian Irish and D. Other (including mixed and any other ethnicities). This will be used as a grouping variable for exploratory multi-group SEM analyses.\n\nEver diagnosed with HIV (Q057): The values of this variable indicate either not having been diagnosed with HIV (0) or having been diagnosed with HIV (1). This will be used as a grouping variable for exploratory multi-group SEM analyses.\n\nSexual identity (Q029): Participants could identify as gay or homosexual (81%), bisexual (13%), and straight or heterosexual (1%). They could also indicate that they use a different term (&lt;1%) or that they don\u2019t use a term (5%). Since the vast majority identified as homosexual or bisexual, the analysis will focus exclusively on these participants. A new variable will be computed which will indicate whether participants identify as homosexual (0) or bisexual (1). This will be an observed exogenous variable in the model.\n\nMental Health\nPHQ4: anxiety/depression (Q327-Q330): Participants responded to 4 questions regarding symptoms of anxiety or depression. A 4-point likert scale was used to describe their experiences of these symptoms (1=not at all, 2=some days, 3=more than half the days,4=nearly every day). Q327 and Q328 will be used as indicators for a latent endogenous variable representing anxiety symptoms. Q329 and Q330 will be used as indicators for a latent endogenous variable representing depression symptoms.\n\nSocial Support\nSocial support (Q382-Q389): Q382 to Q389 form two 4-item sub-scales of the Social Provisions Scale (Cutrona &amp; Russel, 1987), reliable alliance and social integration respectively. However, recent psychometric evidence suggests that these items load better onto a general support factor than onto these specific factors (Perera, 2016). Therefore, they will be used here as indicators of a general social support latent variable.\n\nProximal Stressors\nInternalised homonegativity (Q390-Q396) &amp; Outness (Q030): Participants responded to 7 questions related to internalised homophobia and a question regarding outness. These questions were all phrased in a way which indicates one\u2019s comfort with their sexual identity. The scale on Q030 will be reversed so that higher scores on all of these items indicate less proximal stress. These items will be used here as indicators of a general proximal stressors latent variable.\n\nDistal Stressors\nAbuse intimidated recency (Q397), Abuse insults recency (Q398) &amp; Abuse violence recency (Q399): Participants indicated how recently they had been intimidated, insulted and assaulted. They responded to an 8-point likert scale (1=Within the last 24 hours, 2=Within the last 7 days, 3=Within the last 4 weeks, 4=Within the last 6 months, 5=Within the last 12 months, 6=Within the last 5 years, 7=More than 5 years ago, 8=Never). These items will be recoded to approximate interval-level data by reducing the response set to (0 = more than a year ago/never, 1 = within the last 12 months, 2 = within the last 6 months, 3 = within the last month). It is assumed that more recent experiences will have a greater effect on individuals. These three recoded items will be used here as indicators of a general distal stressors latent variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ13: Which units of analysis (respondents, cases, etc.) will be included or excluded in your study? Taking these inclusion/exclusion criteria into account, indicate the (expected) sample size of the data you\u2019ll be using for your statistical analyses (to the best of your knowledge). In the next few questions, you will be asked to refine this sample size estimation based on your judgments about missing data and outliers.\n\u2022\tThe unit of analysis is individual participants. 2,083 eligible participants based in Ireland took part in EMIS 2017. Only those who identify as homosexual (n = 1,689) or bisexual (n = 250) will be included in this study. 113 men who identified as heterosexual, as an unspecified other identity or who did not identify with any particular identify label will be excluded. Therefore, the sample size is 1,939.\n\nQ14: What do you know about missing data in the data set (e.g., overall missingness rate, information about differential dropout)? How will you deal with incomplete or missing data? Based on this information, provide a new expected sample size.\n\u2022\tFrom the summary report, it is apparent that between 0 and 8% of data is missing for the variables relevant to this study.

If you plan to remove outliers, provide a new expected sample size. Note that this will be the definitive expected sample size for your study and you will use this number to do any power analyses.\n\u2022\tThe data has already been cleaned by SIGMA research. Other secondary analyses of EMIS data have not removed outliers beyond this. We will follow this practice for univariate outliers. For multivariate outliers, we will carry out a sensitivity analysis where these are removed. We will identify multivariate outliers using the Mahalanobis Distance method and this will be achieved using the check_outliers function from the performance R package (L\u00fcdecke, Makowski, &amp; Waggoner, 2019). We will use the default threshold of considering the 2.5% most extreme values as outliers.\n\nQ16: Are there sampling weights available with this data set? If so, are you using them and how?\n\u2022\tThere are no sampling weights for this dataset. We will not create sampling weights as there is currently no reliable information on the demographics of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men in Ireland.\n\nPart 4: Knowledge of data\nQ17: List the publications, conference presentations (papers, posters), and working papers (in prep, unpublished, preprints) you have worked on that are based on the data set. Describe which variables you have previously analyzed and which information you used in these analyses. Limit yourself to variables that are relevant to the current study.

Will you be using one- or two-tailed tests for each of your analyses? If you are comparing multiple conditions or testing multiple hypotheses, will you account for this, and if so, how?\n\u2022\tThe minority stress model will be supported if the RMSEA value is below .06 and the TLI is above .90. We will conclude that parameter estimates are non-zero if their corresponding p value is less than .001. The hypotheses will be supported if the parameter estimates are in the expected direction and above the smallest effect size of interest (b = .01).\n\nQ23: What will you do should your data violate assumptions, your model not converge, or some other analytic problem arises?\n\u2022\tBased on the summary information available in the national EMIS report, we don\u2019t expect any ceiling or floor effects. There may be multivariate outliers and these will be detected and removed for a sensitivity analysis (see Q15 and Q24).\n\nQ24: Provide a series of decisions about evaluating the strength, reliability, or robustness of your focal hypothesis test. This may include within-study replication attempts, additional covariates, cross-validation efforts (out-of-sample replication, spilt/hold-out sample), applying weights, selectively applying constraints in an SEM context (e.g., comparing model fit statistics), overfitting adjustment techniques used (e.g., regularization approaches such as ridge regression), or some other simulation / sampling / bootstrapping method.\n\u2022\tWe will run a sensitivity analysis with multivariate outliers removed to see if the hypothesis tests are robust to their influence.\n\nQ25: If you plan to explore your data set to look for unexpected differences or relationships, you can describe those tests here, or add them to the final paper under a heading that clearly differentiates this exploratory part of your study from the confirmatory part.\n\u2022\tUsing multi-group SEM, we will explore the extent to which the relationships in the minority stress theory model vary as a function of age, HIV status and race/ethnicity.\n\n"}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/8j3ey/children/?format=json", "meta":
