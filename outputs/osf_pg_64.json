{"data": [{"id": "jzg8v", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Backlash against gender-deviating children", "description": "Gender backlash is typically characterized as social and economic penalties for men and women when they do not conform to prescriptive and proscriptive gender stereotypes (Sullivan, Moss-Racusin, &amp; Williams, 2018; Prentice &amp; Carranza, 2002). Importantly, these gender stereotypes dictate how men and women should and must behave\u2014women must be communal (supportive, nurturing), while men must be agentic (independent, possess leadership qualities). Research suggests that when women take on leadership roles, communicate with an assertive demeanor, and exhibit self-promoting behavior, they are perceived less favorably than men (Rudman &amp; Glick, 2008; Bosak, Rudman, Kulich, &amp; Kinahan, 2016; Infanger, Rudman, &amp; Sczesny, 2016; Rudman, Moss-Racusin, Phelan, &amp; Nauts, 2012). Although dominant women are perceived as high in competence, they are viewed as unlikable, suggesting that women who act in accordance with gender stereotypes are viewed as incompetent, but likable (Rudman &amp; Glick, 2008; Bosak et al., 2016). This emphasizes the gender paradox women face\u2014 when women are dominant, they are viewed as unlikable, but when they are communal, they are viewed as incompetent, but likable. While most research has focused on backlash against women, Heilman and Wallen (2009) found that men are penalized as much as women when they do not conform to gender stereotypes. Research demonstrates that men are viewed as less competent when they are other-advocating rather than self-advocating in a work environment, when they violate gender stereotypes, and when they display feminine qualities (Bosac et al., 2016, Moss-Racusin &amp; Johnson, 2016, Moss-Racusin, 2014, Rudman &amp; Glick, 2008). Specifically, one study found that men who exemplify more feminine characteristics are less likely to receive financial rewards because they are viewed unfavorably by adults (Rudman &amp; Glick, 2008). This pressure to be both strong and unemotional influences men\u2019s mental and physical health, suggesting that backlash drastically deters men from counter-stereotypic behaviors (Levant &amp; Pollack, 1995). In general, it appears that backlash effects are stronger for men than women (men face penalties for pre- and proscriptions and women may only face effects from violating proscriptions). While backlash effects are robust in the adult literature, only one study to date has focused on backlash against children who violate gender stereotypes. Sullivan and colleges (2018) sought to explore how adults perceive children who violate gender stereotypes. Consistent with adult research, they found that there were a large number of prescriptive and descriptive traits for boys and girls governing how children are supposed to behave. Importantly, when displaying feminine characteristics, boys were rated as significantly less likable than girls and their traits were perceived as undesirable. Additionally, they found that political orientation and sexist beliefs both predicted backlash in term of likability, willingness to interact with the children, and perceptions of the children\u2019s parents. While this study explored perceptions of gender deviating kids, it remains unknown how adults perceive parental responses to children\u2019s gender deviant behavior. In study 1, we found that parents were viewed as incompetent and unlikable when they punished their children for gender deviance. In addition, both girls and boys were rated as likable even when they behaved in counter stereotypic ways. However, it remains unclear if the salience of children\u2019s gender deviant behavior was apparent. Therefore, we hope to explore if the inclusion of more specific behavior will influence adult\u2019s perception of parents when they punish gender deviance. In all three conditions, the children will exhibit gender deviant behavior and the parents will either affirm the behavior (affirmation), confront the child (backlash), or not respond (control).", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-09T15:55:29.112900", "date_modified": "2020-04-09T15:41:19.951336", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "55d569c3784a535fc729006e5d18e1b2c3a09cf59aa779a247ce474c68e399eed51b9c4de9b3587b80b0d1ee1b3de125aa4c676cffba3bc3a5f91348bc2dd9f0c61668e4f5f8c3f5d97159362d051c7f98ab407927ec03ba8306f76d471b9a399af3eac7d96eb36166e991bf992ac16b9cd13c5aeb81b819f760b4a5db89a3dfb80a22925a40af455fea3db2ebfa3bb8", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-09T15:55:29.080226", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Conor O'Dea, Jonah Brenner"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Original hypotheses prior to Study 1: \n\u2022\tMain effects\no\tHypothesis 1: Consistent with backlash literature, we predict that parents will be viewed more favorably for reprimanding their children for gender deviant behavior (higher in likeability, competence, and appropriateness) and viewed more negatively for affirming their children\u2019s gender deviant behavior (lower in likeability, competence, and appropriateness).\no\tHypothesis 2: In keeping with findings from Sullivan et al.

Although dominant women are perceived as high in competence, they are viewed as unlikeable, suggesting that women who act in accordance with gender stereotypes are viewed as incompetent, but likeable (Rudman &amp; Glick, 2008; Bosak et al., 2016). This emphasizes the gender paradox women face\u2014 when women are dominant, they are viewed as unlikable, but when they are communal, they are viewed as incompetent, but likeable. While most research has focused on backlash against women, Heilman and Wallen (2009) found that men are penalized as much as women when they do not conform to gender stereotypes. Research demonstrates that men are viewed as less competent when they are other-advocating rather than self-advocating in a work environment, when they violate gender stereotypes, and when they display feminine qualities (Bosac et al., 2016, Moss-Racusin &amp; Johnson, 2016, Moss-Racusin, 2014, Rudman &amp; Glick, 2008). Specifically, one study found that men who exemplify more feminine characteristics are less likely to receive financial rewards because they are viewed unfavorably by adults (Rudman &amp; Glick, 2008). This pressure to be both strong and unemotional influences men\u2019s mental and physical health, suggesting that backlash drastically deters men from counter-stereotypic behaviors (Levant &amp; Pollack, 1995). In general, it appears that backlash effects are stronger for men than women (men face penalties for pre- and proscriptions and women may only face effects from violating proscriptions). While backlash effects are robust in the adult literature, only one study to date has focused on backlash against children who violate gender stereotypes. Sullivan and colleges (2018) sought to explore how adults perceive children who violate gender stereotypes. Consistent with adult research, they found that there were a large number of prescriptive and descriptive traits for boys and girls governing how children are supposed to behave. Importantly, when displaying feminine characteristics, boys were rated as significantly less likeable than girls and their traits were perceived as undesirable. Additionally, they found that political orientation and sexist beliefs both predicted backlash in term of likeability, willingness to interact with the children, and perceptions of the children\u2019s parents. While this study explored perceptions of gender deviating kids, it remains unknown how adults perceive parental responses to children\u2019s gender deviant behavior. In study 1, we found that parents were viewed as incompetent and unlikable when they punished their children for gender deviance. In addition, both girls and boys were rated as likable even when they behaved in counter stereotypic ways. However, it remains unclear if the salience of children\u2019s gender deviant behavior was apparent. Therefore, we hope to explore if the inclusion of more specific behavior will influence adult\u2019s perception of parents when they punish gender deviance. In all three conditions, the children will exhibit gender deviant behavior and the parents will either affirm the behavior (affirmation), confront the child (backlash), or not respond (control).", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-09T15:41:19.057805", "date_modified": "2020-04-09T15:34:17.210956", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "5215212c679275ef2eddbf4653ecac3b3d6c01a16b182928a61fa670e74a66cc3c6c606a39ce24841edd61c55782a2711087641f1576416cff975ae3a056f7f48bf1f2a51163288b5286af440c374c10f45f4a3822469b9a3a47fdffde5b109c7aa0ec108af531eb15f777f2a1652c38409e87b9b81233be8b86370d462f4bd5dd6a725c666b4d836fc2d221e4a493fd", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-09T15:41:19.038472", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Conor O'Dea, Jonah Brenner"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Original hypotheses prior to Study 1: \n\u2022\tMain effects\no\tHypothesis 1: Consistent with backlash literature, we predict that parents will be viewed more favorably for reprimanding their children for gender deviant behavior (higher in likeability, competence, and appropriateness) and viewed more negatively for affirming their children\u2019s gender deviant behavior (lower in likeability, competence, and appropriateness).\no\tHypothesis 2: In keeping with findings from Sullivan et al.

This review is currently in the process of searching for articles, and two of the studies have been coded (relevant data has been extracted), but the data has yet to be analyzed. A final round of searching for manuscripts will be completed by June, 2020. The contacts for this article are Lisa Scott (lisa_scott@byu.edu) and Dr. Timothy B. Smith (tim_smith@byu.edu). This review and all team members are affiliated with Brigham Young University. Review team members include: Lisa Scott, Timothy B. Smith, Derek Griner, Kristina Hansen, Melissa Jones, Austin Davis, Loriana Goulding, Jarom Hickenlooper, Tatyana Brenes, Abena Yirenya Tawiah and Parker Jarman. All funding for this project was provided by Brigham Young University. The authors have no known conflicts of interest.\n\nThis meta-analysis will evaluate (1) the degree to which clients perceive their therapists as demonstrating cultural humility, and (2) the magnitude of the association between perceived therapist cultural humility and clients\u2019 experiences and outcomes in treatment. Articles will be collected by searching through Google Scholar. We are searching for all articles that include the Cultural Humility Scale (Hook et al., 2013) from 2013 until now. \n\nInclusion criteria have been outlined and followed in the gathering of articles. Only studies conducted in the United States or Canada have been included. Studies were included if they were written in English, Spanish, Portugese, French or Chinese. This was decided based on the research teams\u2019 language abilities. Studies that include mental health professionals have been included. \u201cMental health professional\u201d is defined as physicians, psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, psychologists and counselors (and graduate students and interns in those disciplines). This definition does not include career/vocational counselors, substance abuse counselors, school counselors or school psychologists. Studies have been included that include a mix of professionals, as long as at least 70% of the professionals were mental health professionals as defined in the above way. The services included were any service intended to evaluate mental health and/or enhance mental health in some way. Therapists could have been vignette descriptions or actual therapists. Clients could have been seen individually, as a couple, as a family or in a group. Clients must have had a diagnosis as found in the DSM-5 or ICD-10, or have the likely possibility of such a condition, excluding substance abuse or career struggles. Only quantitative research designs have been included, and case studies and single-N studies have been excluded. Articles were included if they were either journal articles, book chapters, books, dissertations, or conference presentations. \n\nThe independent and potential dependent variables were also outlined in the inclusion criteria. The independent variable was client-perceived cultural humility of the counselor. Possible dependent variables include therapist judgement of client severity, diagnosis, prognosis or the experience of abuse and/or trauma (controlling for symptoms/severity in some way), therapist judgement of client attributes, characteristics or behaviors, therapist treatment recommendations (controlling for symptoms/severity), client perceptions of working alliance, and client-reported counseling outcomes or termination of treatment (when the independent variable is an indicator of therapist bias). The main outcome being evaluated is the correlation between therapist cultural humility and client experiences of therapy process and outcome.  No additional outcomes will be evaluated. \n\nReferences:\nHook, J. N., Davis, D. E., Owen, J., Worthington Jr, E. L., &amp; Utsey, S. O. (2013).

This review is currently in the process of searching for articles, and two of the studies have been coded (relevant data has been extracted), but the data has yet to be analyzed. A final round of searching for manuscripts will be completed by June, 2020. The contacts for this article are Lisa Scott (lisa_scott@byu.edu) and Dr. Timothy B. Smith (tim_smith@byu.edu). This review and all team members are affiliated with Brigham Young University. Review team members include: Lisa Scott, Timothy B. Smith, Derek Griner, Kristina Hansen, Melissa Jones, Austin Davis, Loriana Goulding, Jarom Hickenlooper, Tatyana Brenes, Abena Yirenya Tawiah and Parker Jarman. All funding for this project was provided by Brigham Young University. The authors have no known conflicts of interest.\n\nThis meta-analysis will evaluate (1) the degree to which clients perceive their therapists as demonstrating cultural humility, and (2) the magnitude of the association between perceived therapist cultural humility and clients\u2019 experiences and outcomes in treatment. Articles will be collected by searching through Google Scholar. We are searching for all articles that include the Cultural Humility Scale (Hook et al., 2013) from 2013 until now. \n\nInclusion criteria have been outlined and followed in the gathering of articles. Only studies conducted in the United States or Canada have been included. Studies were included if they were written in English, Spanish, Portugese, French or Chinese. This was decided based on the research teams\u2019 language abilities. Studies that include mental health professionals have been included. \u201cMental health professional\u201d is defined as physicians, psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, psychologists and counselors (and graduate students and interns in those disciplines). This definition does not include career/vocational counselors, substance abuse counselors, school counselors or school psychologists. Studies have been included that include a mix of professionals, as long as at least 70% of the professionals were mental health professionals as defined in the above way. The services included were any service intended to evaluate mental health and/or enhance mental health in some way. Therapists could have been vignette descriptions or actual therapists. Clients could have been seen individually, as a couple, as a family or in a group. Clients must have had a diagnosis as found in the DSM-5 or ICD-10, or have the likely possibility of such a condition, excluding substance abuse or career struggles. Only quantitative research designs have been included, and case studies and single-N studies have been excluded. Articles were included if they were either journal articles, book chapters, books, dissertations, or conference presentations. \n\nThe independent and potential dependent variables were also outlined in the inclusion criteria. The independent variable was client-perceived cultural humility of the counselor. Possible dependent variables include therapist judgement of client severity, diagnosis, prognosis or the experience of abuse and/or trauma (controlling for symptoms/severity in some way), therapist judgement of client attributes, characteristics or behaviors, therapist treatment recommendations (controlling for symptoms/severity), client perceptions of working alliance, and client-reported counseling outcomes or termination of treatment (when the independent variable is an indicator of therapist bias). The main outcome being evaluated is the correlation between therapist cultural humility and client experiences of therapy process and outcome.  No additional outcomes will be evaluated. \n\nReferences:\nHook, J. N., Davis, D. E., Owen, J., Worthington Jr, E. L., &amp; Utsey, S. O. (2013).

Lack of sleep, new social roles, emotional stressors, and neurobiological changes for both mothers and fathers all impact parents\u2019 health and well-being. If health suffers after a baby arrives in the home, at what point, if ever, does health recover? Do parental support policies, such as maternity leave, paternity leave, or subsidized childcare, improve outcomes? These questions are difficult to answer due to limits in longitudinal data collection. It is hard to track large numbers of parents over time consistently, particularly in conjunction with external variation in family support policies. To examine how these policies affect health, we need detailed, consistent, longitudinal health data matched to births that happen in different policy periods. \n\nU.S. Department of Defense (DoD) administrative records provide a novel opportunity to explore the impacts of family support policies. The DoD is the world\u2019s largest employer, with rich data covering a significant portion of the U.S. population. It offers active-duty service members paid caregiver leave and subsidized childcare, though the quantity and availability of both have varied over time. As such, the DoD presents a unique chance to study the effects of several policies on repeated, consistent measures of health including inpatient and outpatient medical care, physical health, mental health, and substance use.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-09T20:43:54.979009", "date_modified": "2020-04-08T19:04:59.472905", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Olivia Healy &amp; Jennifer Heissel"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "e52fc2364ab7c0fbf9df2b2abb2d9461263b624c471d959eb08ac4af53bdf94f6e422c4e2b856f626123a930e367e82ea6973fe6d45657c6c4cc1679904d7038016e9083b93e60b57badce71358eba56fe5d99bc39c1dd6d5406fb72dcdb73389e277926cec7ae895049ad48282221f3763c561c60194f576df7f7d5f65c84cc8c00cf5426204770b05a961fa88f5266", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-09T20:43:54.954533", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Preregistration Template from AsPredicted.org", "registered_meta": {"data": {"extra": [], "value": "It's complicated.

In particular, we will conduct the analyses described above, but with proficiency added as an additional moderating factor. Given that the two measures of proficiency (self-reported and objective) have their own strengths and weaknesses, we will conduct analyses separately for each measure.

Also, only participants aged 18 to 45 years will be included in our final sample. Participants with mean reaction times or accuracy rates that are more than 3 standard deviations from the sample mean for at least one condition will also be excluded. For the reaction times analysis, only correct responses will be included in the analysis. Also, responses that are faster than 200 milliseconds will be considered as mistakes and will be excluded from the analysis for reaction times and accuracy. These inclusion/exclusion criteria are the same as those used in Nook, Lindquist, &amp; Zaki (2015)."}, "dependent": {"extra": [], "value": "Task design. This study uses an adapted version of the task reported in in Nook, Lindquist &amp; Zaki (2015). On each trial, participants first see a facial expression of emotion and then either a L1 emotion word (i.e., a Swedish emotion word such as \u201cilska\u201d), a L2 emotion word (i.e., an English emotion word such as \u201cangry\u201d) or another picture of a facial expression of emotion. On half of the trials, the emotions expressed by the two stimuli are the same (i.e., they are congruent), and on half of the trials, the emotions are not the same (i.e., they are incongruent). The participants\u2019 task is to determine whether both stimuli refer to the same emotion or to different emotions. Participants push one of two buttons on each trial to indicate whether the emotions expressed in the two stimuli match or do not match as fast as they can. \n\nDependent variables.\n-\tReaction time. The reaction time of participants\u2019 responses will be averaged across trials in each condition, and these will serve as the study\u2019s primary dependent variables.\n-\tSensitivity (d\u2019). Rather than computing the proportion of trials on which the participant provided the \u201ccorrect\u201d response in each condition, we will utilize signal detection methods to quantify how accurately individuals perceived emotions expressed in each condition (Green &amp; Swets, 1966). Following the procedures outlined in Nook, Lindquist, &amp; Zaki (2015), sensitivity will be defined as z(hit rate) \u2013 z(false alarm rate) in each \u201ccontext\u201d condition. \n-\tSelf-reported L2 (English) proficiency. At the end of the study, participants indicated their level of English proficiency through a self-report based on five questions (general proficiency, written understanding, oral understanding, written production, and oral production) on a scale from 1 to 10 compared to a native English speaker. Self-reported proficiency will be defined as the averaged scores of the five questions where lower scores will indicate lower proficiency, and higher scores will indicate higher proficiency. \n-\tL2 (English) written receptive vocabulary. Participants also completed the LexTALE task (Lemh\u00f6fer &amp; Broersma, 2012 ), which is an objective measurement of receptive vocabulary in English. Although it is more objective than self-reported proficiency, it only covers one aspect of language skills, namely written understanding. The LexTALE score will therefore also be used as a measure of English profeiciency, alongside the self-reported measure described above. The LexTALE task consists of 60 strings of letters, of which 40 are words in English, and 20 are not. The participant\u2019s task is to determine whether the string of letters is an actual word in English or not. The score, which consists of the percentage of correct answers taking the unequal proportion of words and nonwords into account, will be computed according to instructions accompanying the test, namely: ((number of words correct/40*100) + (number of nonwords correct/20*100)) / 2. \n-\tAlexithymia. Alexithymia is a trait in which people have difficulty experiencing and perceiving emotions and is often measured with the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20: Bagby, Parker, &amp; Taylor, 1994). An overall score and three subscale scores (i.e., Difficulty Identifying Feelings: DIF; Difficulty Describing Feelings: DDF; Externally-Oriented Thinking: EOT) can be computed. Participants filled out a Swedish version of the scale (Simonsson-Sarnecki, Lundh, T\u00f6restad, Bagby, Tayler, &amp; Parker, 2001) at the end of the study. Following Nook et al. (2015), analyses will focus on the sum of the difficulty identifying feelings and difficulty describing feelings subscales.  \n"}, "conditions": {"extra": [], "value": "The current study employs a 2 [congruence: incongruent vs. congruent] x 3 [context: L1 word vs. L2 word vs. face] design. All conditions for the current study are manipulated within-subjects, as illustrated by the task description above. Since this is a within group design, participants will be exposed to all conditions. "}, "hypothesis": {"extra": [], "value": "Constructionist theories of emotion posit that language is an important part of emotion perception. Such theories suggest that without labels (i.e., emotion words), we experience and perceive emotions in terms of low-granularity dimensions like valence (i.e., positive vs. negative) and arousal (i.e., high or low activation), but perceptions of discrete emotions become difficult (e.g., Barrett, 2016, 2017; Lindquist, Gendron, Barrett, &amp; Dickerson, 2014). According to constructionist frameworks, emotion words draw to mind emotion concepts (i.e., what we know about a specific emotion type), and these concepts are integral to experiencing and perceiving discrete emotions. In other words, emotion words provide a context in which we perceive and interpret our environment due to their underlying emotion concepts (Lindquist, Satpute, &amp; Gendron, 2015).\n\nIn line with this argument, Nook, Lindquist &amp; Zaki (2015) showed that priming emotion concepts by providing individuals with emotion words led to faster and more \u201caccurate\u201d interpretation of facial expressions. Namely, participants were faster and more accurate at identifying the emotion expressed in a facial expression when the expression was paired with an emotion word, than when it was paired with another facial expression. These results support the notion that emotion words contribute to emotion perception by priming emotion concepts that speed and shape emotion perception.  As such, language appears to provide a context for the perception of facial movements as discrete facial expressions of emotion.\n\nHowever, this prior study investigated the perception of emotions using words in the participants' first language only, but people also engage in social interactions in which they must interpret others\u2019 facial expressions in the context of their second language. For instance, individuals must infer the emotions experienced by conversation partners speaking another language when they are engaging in international education, international politics, or even while touring a foreign country. Theoretically, second-language (L2) emotion words should still be associated with an individual\u2019s internal emotion concepts, but they may be less strongly connected to emotion concepts than first-language (L1) emotion words. Indeed, studies in related areas show that emotion words in a L2 are perceived as less emotional than emotion words in a L1 (e.g., Caldwell-Harris, 2014; Dewaele, 2010; Pavlenko, 2005) and that moral decision-making in a L2 leads to more utilitarian decisions compared to decision-making in a L1 (an effect known as the Foreign Language effect), potentially because L2 emotion words less strongly activate underlying emotion conceptual information  (Corey et al., 2017; Costa et al., 2014; Costa, Vives, &amp; Corey, 2017; Dylman &amp; Champoux-Larsson, 2020). \n\nHowever, it has not been empirically tested whether emotion perception is affected in L1 vs. L2 contexts. If L2 emotion words indeed are less strongly connected to underlying emotion concepts than L1 emotion words, this could lead to poorer and/or slower understanding of facial expressions in L2 contexts. Clearly, this can have important implications for professional, personal, and societal exchanges occurring in a second language.\n\nConsequently, the current study sought to test three research questions: \n\nResearch question 1) Do the findings of Nook, Lindquist &amp; Zaki (2015) replicate in an adult population in Sweden, in which L1 (i.e., Swedish) emotion words more strongly facilitate emotion perception than facial expressions? We hypothesize that these findings will indeed replicate: Native Swedish speakers will categorize facial expressions of emotion faster and more accurately when they are paired with a Swedish emotion word than when they are paired with a facial expression of emotion.\n\nResearch question 2) Do L1 emotion words more strongly facilitate emotion perception than L2 emotion words? We hypothesize that native Swedish speakers will categorize facial expressions of emotion faster and more accurately when they are paired with L1 (i.e., Swedish) emotion words than when they are paired with L2 (i.e., English) emotion words.\n\nResearch question 3) Do L2 emotion words more strongly facilitate emotion perception for individuals with higher L2 proficiency? We hypothesize that native Swedish speakers who are more fluent in English will categorize facial expressions of emotion faster and more accurately when they are paired with L2 (i.e., English) emotion words than native Swedish speakers who are less fluent in English.\n"}, "study_type": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment"}, "study_type_other": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"data": "Yes, we already collected the data.", "name": "First and second language as contexts for emotion perception", "other": "Alexithymia. Participants also filled out the Swedish version of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (20 items: TAS-20) and their score will be used to explore whether it affects their performance on the task (i.e., on reaction times and sensitivity scores).  Following Nook et al. (2015), analyses will focus on the sum of the difficulty identifying feelings and difficulty describing feelings subscales.  ", "sample": "A power analysis based on the smallest key effect in Nook, Lindquist and Zaki (2015) was used to determine the sample size. The effect size (Cohen\u2019s d ) in this paper for the effect of context on sensitivity score (d\u2019) was .255. A sample of 123 participants is necessary to replicate this within-person effect at 80% power. However, due to disruptions caused by COVID-19, we were only able to collect 115 participants before data collection was suspended. This provides us with 77% power to detect effects of this size. Given that this approximates conventional thresholds for power (and that we are .999% powered to detect medium within-person effect sizes with this sample size), we decided to cease data collection and preregister our analyses before conducting them. ", "analyses": "Research question 1) Replicating Nook, Lindquist, &amp; Zaki (2015) in native Swedish speakers. \n\nReaction time. First, a 2 [congruence] x 3 [context: L1 word, L2 word, face] repeated-measures ANOVA will be used to analyze how this study\u2019s primary independent variables influence participants\u2019 reaction times. If significant effects emerge, we will use follow-up paired-sample t-tests to analyze reaction time differences across each condition. Additionally, we will replicate the Nook, Lindquist, &amp; Zaki (2015) 2 [congruence] x 2 [context: L1 word, face] ANOVA that only analyzes reaction time data from the face and L1 word contexts to test if a significant interaction emerges within these conditions. \n\nSensitivity (d\u2019). Similarly, a repeated-measures one-way ANOVA will be used to test whether d\u2019 differs significantly across the three context conditions [L1 word, L2 word, face]. A follow-up paired-sample t-test will be used to specifically compare the L1 word and face condition, as was done in Nook, Lindquist, &amp; Zaki (2015).\n\nResearch question 2) Comparing L1 and L2 emotion words. \n\nReaction time. Results of the omnibus 2 x 3 ANOVA and follow-up t-tests described above also inform this research question. However, a follow-up 2 [congruence] x 2 [context: L1 word, L2 word] ANOVA that only analyzes reaction time data from the L1 and L2 word contexts will also be used to test if a significant interaction emerges within these conditions. \n\nSensitivity (d\u2019). Similarly, the repeated-measures one-way ANOVA testing whether d\u2019 differs significantly across the three context conditions described above also informs this research question. However, a follow-up paired-sample t-test will be used to specifically compare the L1 and L2 word conditions. \n\nResearch question 3) The influence of proficiency.\n\nProficiency (i.e., the mean score of the five self-reported proficiency measurements described above and the LexTALE score) will be investigated to determine whether they moderate the influence of English (L2) words on reaction time and sensitivity. In particular, we will conduct the analyses described above, but with proficiency added as an additional moderating factor. Given that the two measures of proficiency (self-reported and objective) have their own strengths and weaknesses, we will conduct analyses separately for each measure. For example, we will add self-reported English proficiency as a factor in the ANOVA analyzing sensitivity, and we hypothesize that proficiency will interact with context, such that the difference in sensitivity between L1 and L2 word conditions is larger for individuals who are less proficient in English.  \n", "outliers": "Data from participants reporting having English as one of their L1, and/or Swedish as a L2 will be excluded from the analyses. English will also be considered to be a first language if its acquisition is reported to have started before age 4, which will also lead to the exclusion of those participants, even if they report English as a L2. Also, only participants aged 18 to 45 years will be included in our final sample. Participants with mean reaction times or accuracy rates that are more than 3 standard deviations from the sample mean for at least one condition will also be excluded. For the reaction times analysis, only correct responses will be included in the analysis. Also, responses that are faster than 200 milliseconds will be considered as mistakes and will be excluded from the analysis for reaction times and accuracy. These inclusion/exclusion criteria are the same as those used in Nook, Lindquist, &amp; Zaki (2015).", "dependent": "Task design. This study uses an adapted version of the task reported in in Nook, Lindquist &amp; Zaki (2015). On each trial, participants first see a facial expression of emotion and then either a L1 emotion word (i.e., a Swedish emotion word such as \u201cilska\u201d), a L2 emotion word (i.e., an English emotion word such as \u201cangry\u201d) or another picture of a facial expression of emotion. On half of the trials, the emotions expressed by the two stimuli are the same (i.e., they are congruent), and on half of the trials, the emotions are not the same (i.e., they are incongruent). The participants\u2019 task is to determine whether both stimuli refer to the same emotion or to different emotions. Participants push one of two buttons on each trial to indicate whether the emotions expressed in the two stimuli match or do not match as fast as they can. \n\nDependent variables.\n-\tReaction time. The reaction time of participants\u2019 responses will be averaged across trials in each condition, and these will serve as the study\u2019s primary dependent variables.\n-\tSensitivity (d\u2019). Rather than computing the proportion of trials on which the participant provided the \u201ccorrect\u201d response in each condition, we will utilize signal detection methods to quantify how accurately individuals perceived emotions expressed in each condition (Green &amp; Swets, 1966). Following the procedures outlined in Nook, Lindquist, &amp; Zaki (2015), sensitivity will be defined as z(hit rate) \u2013 z(false alarm rate) in each \u201ccontext\u201d condition. \n-\tSelf-reported L2 (English) proficiency. At the end of the study, participants indicated their level of English proficiency through a self-report based on five questions (general proficiency, written understanding, oral understanding, written production, and oral production) on a scale from 1 to 10 compared to a native English speaker. Self-reported proficiency will be defined as the averaged scores of the five questions where lower scores will indicate lower proficiency, and higher scores will indicate higher proficiency. \n-\tL2 (English) written receptive vocabulary. Participants also completed the LexTALE task (Lemh\u00f6fer &amp; Broersma, 2012 ), which is an objective measurement of receptive vocabulary in English. Although it is more objective than self-reported proficiency, it only covers one aspect of language skills, namely written understanding. The LexTALE score will therefore also be used as a measure of English profeiciency, alongside the self-reported measure described above. The LexTALE task consists of 60 strings of letters, of which 40 are words in English, and 20 are not. The participant\u2019s task is to determine whether the string of letters is an actual word in English or not. The score, which consists of the percentage of correct answers taking the unequal proportion of words and nonwords into account, will be computed according to instructions accompanying the test, namely: ((number of words correct/40*100) + (number of nonwords correct/20*100)) / 2. \n-\tAlexithymia. Alexithymia is a trait in which people have difficulty experiencing and perceiving emotions and is often measured with the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20: Bagby, Parker, &amp; Taylor, 1994). An overall score and three subscale scores (i.e., Difficulty Identifying Feelings: DIF; Difficulty Describing Feelings: DDF; Externally-Oriented Thinking: EOT) can be computed. Participants filled out a Swedish version of the scale (Simonsson-Sarnecki, Lundh, T\u00f6restad, Bagby, Tayler, &amp; Parker, 2001) at the end of the study. Following Nook et al. (2015), analyses will focus on the sum of the difficulty identifying feelings and difficulty describing feelings subscales.  \n", "conditions": "The current study employs a 2 [congruence: incongruent vs. congruent] x 3 [context: L1 word vs. L2 word vs. face] design. All conditions for the current study are manipulated within-subjects, as illustrated by the task description above. Since this is a within group design, participants will be exposed to all conditions. ", "hypothesis": "Constructionist theories of emotion posit that language is an important part of emotion perception. Such theories suggest that without labels (i.e., emotion words), we experience and perceive emotions in terms of low-granularity dimensions like valence (i.e., positive vs. negative) and arousal (i.e., high or low activation), but perceptions of discrete emotions become difficult (e.g., Barrett, 2016, 2017; Lindquist, Gendron, Barrett, &amp; Dickerson, 2014). According to constructionist frameworks, emotion words draw to mind emotion concepts (i.e., what we know about a specific emotion type), and these concepts are integral to experiencing and perceiving discrete emotions. In other words, emotion words provide a context in which we perceive and interpret our environment due to their underlying emotion concepts (Lindquist, Satpute, &amp; Gendron, 2015).\n\nIn line with this argument, Nook, Lindquist &amp; Zaki (2015) showed that priming emotion concepts by providing individuals with emotion words led to faster and more \u201caccurate\u201d interpretation of facial expressions. Namely, participants were faster and more accurate at identifying the emotion expressed in a facial expression when the expression was paired with an emotion word, than when it was paired with another facial expression. These results support the notion that emotion words contribute to emotion perception by priming emotion concepts that speed and shape emotion perception.  As such, language appears to provide a context for the perception of facial movements as discrete facial expressions of emotion.\n\nHowever, this prior study investigated the perception of emotions using words in the participants' first language only, but people also engage in social interactions in which they must interpret others\u2019 facial expressions in the context of their second language.

On the basis of the finding that testing prevents later forgetting without affecting memory recovery, we investigate immediate effects of taking a test on retrievability of a tested item. In experiment, participants recall studied items, then perform a retest of the studied items (test condition) and a non-episodic-memory task (distractor condition), and immediately afterward re-recall the items. The test condition should elicit more item losses than the distractor condition, whereas there are no condition differences in the number of item gains. These results would suggest that taking a test on a target item facilitates forgetting of the very same item for a short interval of time, a possible reason for the late appearance of the testing effect.\n\n(Because I deleted the pre-registered project by erroneous operation, I then re-registered the same project.)", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-09T12:44:00.292216", "date_modified": "2020-04-09T12:47:32.083122", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Toshihiro Wakebe"], "year": "2019"}, "analytics_key": "6e3aea5758d5f4f876047e5901180411181331b5033d8711a01b2427153515c9fc6761383e7f3be905768c5b4243e2c54812c0a298aacce3e7a98585cfb1c2307dfd498c781a5be27610cbdac2f8f74e4ecd92bc20c26ebf863457cdbefaa9874bf4f7664ed970e8565fb3ef1a9f14e205f5a20509a42fceab823b1bfcda532bf9678777b5b7cb53e6659e2befa308ed", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-09T12:44:00.270604", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Toshihiro Wakebe"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "For a short period of time, testing does not affect the number of gain items but also does not reduce the number of loss items, thus producing less robust testing effects on an immediate test."}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.
