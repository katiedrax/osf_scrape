We designed our experiment in such a way that we can tease the effects of these two motivations apart. We have two treatments in which misrepresentation is possible and two in which it is not possible. For both these pairs of treatments, in one of them only the total stated contributions of all interaction partners are relayed the group members after decisions are made, so reputation concerns are less important.

Afterwards, participants will complete questionnaires assessing demographic information, past and current pain experiences (MPQ-DV), pain catastrophizing (PCS), repetitive negative thinking (PTQ), and dispositional mindfulness (MAAS, AAQ-II, CHIME-SF). Participants will also rate their affective experience in the present moment via 14 emotional adjectives to serve as a baseline measure. A thermode (3 x 3 cm) will be positioned on the non-dominant lower arm just above the wrist to enable delivery of the heat stimuli. \n\nBaseline measurements: To familiarise participants with the experimental heat stimuli, three heat stimuli will be presented on the non-dominant lower arm and participants will be asked to rate them in terms of pleasantness, intensity, pain, and fear (PE2). Subsequently, they will follow a short relaxation exercise to ensure that the potential effects induced by the mindfulness exercise are specific effects of mindfulness rather than the relaxation component of mindfulness. Afterwards, participants will again rate their affective experience to test for changes induced by the relaxation exercise.\n\nExperimental phase: The thermode will be positioned on the dominant lower arm. Participants will be instructed to listen carefully to the recording and follow the instructions. They will be told that they will have to answer questions about the recordings later in the experiment. Subsequently, participants will listen to the induction tapes via headphone while they receive 7 pain stimuli on the dominant lower arm. Each stimulus will have a duration of 4 seconds, with a 32\u00b0C baseline temperature, a 46\u00b0C peak temperature, and a 7\u00b0C/s temperature change rate. The stimuli will be administered throughout a period of 10 minutes to enable a simultaneous presentation of mindfulness-based instructions that optimally matches the administration schedule. Upon completion, participants will rate their pain experience during the pain induction using the questionnaire developed by the lab of Prins and colleagues (PE1) as well as items on pleasantness, intensity, pain and fear (PE2). Moreover, participants will complete the affect questionnaire again. To check whether the manipulation was successful, participants will complete a subset of items based on the CHIME.\n\nAfter the experiment: The thermode will be removed and the participant will be thanked for participation. They will be reminded to complete the questionnaires that will be sent to them via e-mail two weeks later. Finally, participants will be given contact details for different counseling services.\n\nTwo weeks after the experimental session:  Participants will receive an e-mail, asking them again to rate their remembered pain experience and affect during the pain induction in the experimental session using the 4 items on pleasantness, intensity, pain, and fear (PE2) as well as the affect questionnaire.

In the context of the pain induction, participants will be encouraged to experience the painful sensation (present moment awareness) with an open mindset (acceptance). They will be asked to label the process (\u2018this is painful\u2019) to promote defusion. In the absence of any stimuli, participants will be able to \u2018rest\u2019 in awareness (self as context).

Moreover, it will be pointed out that the task is not to reach any particular goal and that participants do not have to change anything during the exercise. Instructions will be synchronised with stimulus presentation to enable an optimal guidance.\n\nDistraction induction\nParticipants in the distraction group will not receive instructions about how to cope with the pain. Instead, they will be provided with recordings of two fairytales through headphones, pre-recorded by the same voice as the mindfulness instructions."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q15": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Pain Experience. Pain experience of the experimental heat stimuli will serve as the primary outcome variable. This will be assessed via two self-report questionnaires. The first questionnaire (PE1), developed by Goubert and colleagues (2004), measures 4 different aspects of pain: sensory pain, affective pain, attention to the pain, and general anxiety. Its 20 items will be rated on 11-point Likert scales. This questionnaire will be completed directly after the experimental pain induction. The second questionnaire (PE2), adopted from Prins and colleagues (2014), assesses pleasantness, intensity, pain and fear on an 11-point Likert scale. This questionnaire will be completed after the test stimuli (baseline), after the experimental pain induction (post-assessment) and at 2-weeks follow-up to test for changes of pain experience over time. At the follow-up assessment point, participants will be additionally asked about the frequency and intrusiveness of their memory of the experimental heat pain. \n\nState Affect. To assess state affect as our secondary outcome variable, we designed a questionnaire based on the circumplex model of emotions. The questionnaire consists of 14 emotion adjectives (e.g. energetic, relaxed, angry, down) of varying valence and arousal adapted from Yik and colleagues (Yik, Russell, &amp; Steiger, 2011). Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = not at all to 5  = very much. Separate scores for positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) will be calculated by summing up the respective item scores.\n\nPain Catastrophizing. To assess participants\u2019 dispositional pain catastrophizing as a moderator variable, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS; Sullivan, Bishop, &amp; Pivik, 1995; van Damme et al., 2000) will be used. The questionnaire asks participants to reflect on past painful experiences and rate the degree to which they endorsed each of the 13 thoughts or feelings during pain (e.g. \u201cI become afraid that the pain may get worse\u201d) in a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = not at all to 4 = all the time.  The PCS has shown good reliability and validity in non-clinical populations (van Damme, Crombez, Bijttebier, Goubert, &amp; van Houdenhove, 2002).\n\nRepetitive negative thinking. As a second moderator variable, repetitive negative thinking will be assessed using the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ; Ehring et al., 2011). The 15-item questionnaire is scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = never to 4 = almost always with higher scores reflecting higher levels of repetitive negative thinking. The Dutch version of the PTQ evidenced good internal consistency and validity (Ehring, Raes, Weidacker, &amp; Emmelkamp, 2012).\n\nDispositional Mindfulness. To measure individual differences in dispositional mindfulness, three questionnaires will be administered. To assess their open awareness of and attention to the present moment, participants will complete the Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS; Brown &amp; Ryan, 2003). Its 15 items (e.g. \u201cI could be experiencing some emotion and not be conscious of it until sometime later\u201d) are rated on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = almost always to 6 = almost never with higher scores indicating higher levels of mindfulness. The MAAS evidenced strong psychometric properties (Brown &amp; Ryan, 2003). \nTo measure participants\u2019 psychological flexibility, the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II; Bond et al., 2011) will be used. Its 10 items are rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = never true to 7 = always true with a higher score indicating higher acceptance and less experiential avoidance (Bond et al., 2011). The AAQ-II has shown strong psychometric properties (Jacobs, Kleen, Groot, &amp; A-Tjak, 2008).\nTo provide a measure of all mindfulness aspects, we will additionally include the Short Form of the Comprehensive Inventory of Mindfulness Experiences (CHIME-SF; Cladder-Micus et al., 2019). It consists of eight subscales: inner awareness, outer awareness, acting with awareness, acceptance, decentering/nonreactivity, openness, relativity, and insight. The 24-item questionnaire is scored on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = almost never to 6 = almost always with higher scores on each subscale representing higher levels of mindfulness skills. The CHIME-SF evidenced strong reliability and validity in clinical and non-clinical samples (Cladder-Micus et al., 2019). \n\nPast and current pain experience. To control for effects of pain present before the start of the experiment, past and current pain experience will be measured using an adapted version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire for the Dutch language (MPV-DV; Vanderiet, Adriaensen, Carton, &amp; Vertommen, 1987) that we adopted from the original study by Prins et al. (2014).  \n\nManipulation check. To check whether the mindfulness manipulation was successful, we constructed a questionnaire adapted from the Comprehensive Inventory of Mindfulness Experiences (CHIME and CHIME-A; Cladder-Micus et al., 2019; Johnson, Burke, Brinkman, &amp; Wade, 2017), the Self-Compassion Scale (Neff, 2003) and the mindfulness induction transcript itself. The scale consists of 10 items, with at least one item for the CHIME subscales decentering/nonreactivity, inner awareness, acting with awareness, openness and acceptance. Items were chosen based on their suitability as a state measure of mindfulness and their fit with respect to the mindfulness manipulation."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q16": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Regarding the state affect questionnaire, separate scores for positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) will be calculated by summing up the respective item scores."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q17": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "A series of ANOVAs with baseline self-report measures (PE2, PA, NA, MPQ-DV, PCS, PTQ, MAAS, AAQ-II, CHIME-SF) as dependent variable and group (mindfulness vs. distraction) as between-subjects factor will be performed to check for pre-existing differences between the groups. If a significant difference is detected, the corresponding variable will be included as a covariate in the subsequent analyses. To check if the mindfulness manipulation was successful, another ANOVA with manipulation check scores as dependent variable and group (mindfulness vs. distraction) as between-subjects factor will be conducted. To test whether the relaxation exercise had an effect on self-reported affect, an ANOVA with affect scores after the relaxation exercise as dependent variable and group (mindfulness vs. distraction) as between-subjects factor will be performed. \n\nFor the main analysis testing whether pain catastrophizing moderates the effect of mindfulness on pain experience (Hypothesis 1), a multivariate general linear model will be used, with self-reported pain experience (PE1: sensory pain, affective pain, and general anxiety) as dependent variable, and group (mindfulness vs. distraction), pain catastrophizing and the interaction between the two variables as between-subjects factors.

Participants will be tested individually according to the following procedure:\n\nPreparatory phase: Upon arrival in the lab, participants will be randomly allocated to the mindfulness or distraction induction. Afterwards, participants will complete questionnaires assessing demographic information, past and current pain experiences (MPQ-DV), pain catastrophizing (PCS), repetitive negative thinking (PTQ), and dispositional mindfulness (MAAS, AAQ-II, CHIME-SF). Participants will also rate their affective experience in the present moment via 14 emotional adjectives to serve as a baseline measure. A thermode (3 x 3 cm) will be positioned on the non-dominant lower arm just above the wrist to enable delivery of the heat stimuli. \n\nBaseline measurements: To familiarise participants with the experimental heat stimuli, three heat stimuli will be presented on the non-dominant lower arm and participants will be asked to rate them in terms of pleasantness, intensity, pain, and fear (PE2). Subsequently, they will follow a short relaxation exercise to ensure that the potential effects induced by the mindfulness exercise are specific effects of mindfulness rather than the relaxation component of mindfulness. Afterwards, participants will again rate their affective experience to test for changes induced by the relaxation exercise.\n\nExperimental phase: The thermode will be positioned on the dominant lower arm. Participants will be instructed to listen carefully to the recording and follow the instructions. They will be told that they will have to answer questions about the recordings later in the experiment. Subsequently, participants will listen to the induction tapes via headphone while they receive 7 pain stimuli on the dominant lower arm. Each stimulus will have a duration of 4 seconds, with a 32\u00b0C baseline temperature, a 46\u00b0C peak temperature, and a 7\u00b0C/s temperature change rate. The stimuli will be administered throughout a period of 10 minutes to enable a simultaneous presentation of mindfulness-based instructions that optimally matches the administration schedule. Upon completion, participants will rate their pain experience during the pain induction using the questionnaire developed by the lab of Prins and colleagues (PE1) as well as items on pleasantness, intensity, pain and fear (PE2). Moreover, participants will complete the affect questionnaire again. To check whether the manipulation was successful, participants will complete a subset of items based on the CHIME.\n\nAfter the experiment: The thermode will be removed and the participant will be thanked for participation. They will be reminded to complete the questionnaires that will be sent to them via e-mail two weeks later. Finally, participants will be given contact details for different counseling services.\n\nTwo weeks after the experimental session:  Participants will receive an e-mail, asking them again to rate their remembered pain experience and affect during the pain induction in the experimental session using the 4 items on pleasantness, intensity, pain, and fear (PE2) as well as the affect questionnaire. They will also rate their pain at the present moment as well as frequency and intrusiveness of their pain memory in the past week. Upon completion of the questionnaires, participants will receive a debriefing sheet and will be compensated for their efforts.", "q6.uploader": [], "q10.question": "Recruitment: Participants will be recruited via poster advertisement around the university campus of KU Leuven, social media, such as the Facebook page advertising experiments conducted in our faculty (Psychology and Educational Sciences), the departmental Experimental Management System (EMS) as well as via word of mouth. Interested participants will be informed about the experimental procedure, the estimated duration of the study and participant reimbursement. \n\nExclusion Criteria: Participants meeting at least one of the following criteria will be excluded from participation: (1) below 16 years of age; (2) current pain of at least moderate intensity based on the McGill Pain Questionnaire; (3) weekly practice of some form of meditation; (4) cardiovascular disease; (5) insufficient knowledge of the Dutch language.\n\nCompensation: As compensation for their efforts, participants will receive 1 course credit or a monetary reward of 8\u20ac per hour.", "q10.uploader": [], "q14.question": "Mindfulness induction\nParticipants in the mindfulness group will listen to pre-recorded instructions described by Prins et al. (2014), presented through headphones. The manipulation aims to cultivate four processes that are essential in mindfulness therapies: contact with the present moment, acceptance, defusion and self as context. In the context of the pain induction, participants will be encouraged to experience the painful sensation (present moment awareness) with an open mindset (acceptance). They will be asked to label the process (\u2018this is painful\u2019) to promote defusion. In the absence of any stimuli, participants will be able to \u2018rest\u2019 in awareness (self as context). At the beginning and every time their thoughts drift away, participants will be instructed to direct their attention to the breathing and bodily sensations. Participants will be reminded to incorporate a gentle and mild attitude towards their experience even when drifting away. Moreover, it will be pointed out that the task is not to reach any particular goal and that participants do not have to change anything during the exercise. Instructions will be synchronised with stimulus presentation to enable an optimal guidance.\n\nDistraction induction\nParticipants in the distraction group will not receive instructions about how to cope with the pain. Instead, they will be provided with recordings of two fairytales through headphones, pre-recorded by the same voice as the mindfulness instructions.", "q14.uploader": [], "q15.question": "Pain Experience. Pain experience of the experimental heat stimuli will serve as the primary outcome variable. This will be assessed via two self-report questionnaires. The first questionnaire (PE1), developed by Goubert and colleagues (2004), measures 4 different aspects of pain: sensory pain, affective pain, attention to the pain, and general anxiety. Its 20 items will be rated on 11-point Likert scales. This questionnaire will be completed directly after the experimental pain induction. The second questionnaire (PE2), adopted from Prins and colleagues (2014), assesses pleasantness, intensity, pain and fear on an 11-point Likert scale. This questionnaire will be completed after the test stimuli (baseline), after the experimental pain induction (post-assessment) and at 2-weeks follow-up to test for changes of pain experience over time. At the follow-up assessment point, participants will be additionally asked about the frequency and intrusiveness of their memory of the experimental heat pain. \n\nState Affect. To assess state affect as our secondary outcome variable, we designed a questionnaire based on the circumplex model of emotions. The questionnaire consists of 14 emotion adjectives (e.g. energetic, relaxed, angry, down) of varying valence and arousal adapted from Yik and colleagues (Yik, Russell, &amp; Steiger, 2011). Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = not at all to 5  = very much. Separate scores for positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) will be calculated by summing up the respective item scores.\n\nPain Catastrophizing. To assess participants\u2019 dispositional pain catastrophizing as a moderator variable, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS; Sullivan, Bishop, &amp; Pivik, 1995; van Damme et al., 2000) will be used. The questionnaire asks participants to reflect on past painful experiences and rate the degree to which they endorsed each of the 13 thoughts or feelings during pain (e.g. \u201cI become afraid that the pain may get worse\u201d) in a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = not at all to 4 = all the time.  The PCS has shown good reliability and validity in non-clinical populations (van Damme, Crombez, Bijttebier, Goubert, &amp; van Houdenhove, 2002).\n\nRepetitive negative thinking. As a second moderator variable, repetitive negative thinking will be assessed using the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ; Ehring et al., 2011). The 15-item questionnaire is scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = never to 4 = almost always with higher scores reflecting higher levels of repetitive negative thinking. The Dutch version of the PTQ evidenced good internal consistency and validity (Ehring, Raes, Weidacker, &amp; Emmelkamp, 2012).\n\nDispositional Mindfulness. To measure individual differences in dispositional mindfulness, three questionnaires will be administered. To assess their open awareness of and attention to the present moment, participants will complete the Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS; Brown &amp; Ryan, 2003). Its 15 items (e.g. \u201cI could be experiencing some emotion and not be conscious of it until sometime later\u201d) are rated on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = almost always to 6 = almost never with higher scores indicating higher levels of mindfulness. The MAAS evidenced strong psychometric properties (Brown &amp; Ryan, 2003). \nTo measure participants\u2019 psychological flexibility, the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II; Bond et al., 2011) will be used. Its 10 items are rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = never true to 7 = always true with a higher score indicating higher acceptance and less experiential avoidance (Bond et al., 2011). The AAQ-II has shown strong psychometric properties (Jacobs, Kleen, Groot, &amp; A-Tjak, 2008).\nTo provide a measure of all mindfulness aspects, we will additionally include the Short Form of the Comprehensive Inventory of Mindfulness Experiences (CHIME-SF; Cladder-Micus et al., 2019). It consists of eight subscales: inner awareness, outer awareness, acting with awareness, acceptance, decentering/nonreactivity, openness, relativity, and insight. The 24-item questionnaire is scored on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = almost never to 6 = almost always with higher scores on each subscale representing higher levels of mindfulness skills. The CHIME-SF evidenced strong reliability and validity in clinical and non-clinical samples (Cladder-Micus et al., 2019). \n\nPast and current pain experience. To control for effects of pain present before the start of the experiment, past and current pain experience will be measured using an adapted version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire for the Dutch language (MPV-DV; Vanderiet, Adriaensen, Carton, &amp; Vertommen, 1987) that we adopted from the original study by Prins et al. (2014).  \n\nManipulation check. To check whether the mindfulness manipulation was successful, we constructed a questionnaire adapted from the Comprehensive Inventory of Mindfulness Experiences (CHIME and CHIME-A; Cladder-Micus et al., 2019; Johnson, Burke, Brinkman, &amp; Wade, 2017), the Self-Compassion Scale (Neff, 2003) and the mindfulness induction transcript itself. The scale consists of 10 items, with at least one item for the CHIME subscales decentering/nonreactivity, inner awareness, acting with awareness, openness and acceptance. Items were chosen based on their suitability as a state measure of mindfulness and their fit with respect to the mindfulness manipulation.", "q15.uploader": [], "q16.question": "Regarding the state affect questionnaire, separate scores for positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) will be calculated by summing up the respective item scores.", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "A series of ANOVAs with baseline self-report measures (PE2, PA, NA, MPQ-DV, PCS, PTQ, MAAS, AAQ-II, CHIME-SF) as dependent variable and group (mindfulness vs. distraction) as between-subjects factor will be performed to check for pre-existing differences between the groups. If a significant difference is detected, the corresponding variable will be included as a covariate in the subsequent analyses. To check if the mindfulness manipulation was successful, another ANOVA with manipulation check scores as dependent variable and group (mindfulness vs. distraction) as between-subjects factor will be conducted. To test whether the relaxation exercise had an effect on self-reported affect, an ANOVA with affect scores after the relaxation exercise as dependent variable and group (mindfulness vs. distraction) as between-subjects factor will be performed. \n\nFor the main analysis testing whether pain catastrophizing moderates the effect of mindfulness on pain experience (Hypothesis 1), a multivariate general linear model will be used, with self-reported pain experience (PE1: sensory pain, affective pain, and general anxiety) as dependent variable, and group (mindfulness vs. distraction), pain catastrophizing and the interaction between the two variables as between-subjects factors. To examine whether repetitive negative thinking also moderates the effect of mindfulness on pain experience (Hypothesis 2), a similar multivariate general linear model will be performed, with pain experience (PE1) as dependent variable, and group (mindfulness vs. distraction), repetitive negative thinking and the interaction of the two variables as between-subjects factors. As an additional test of both hypotheses, the same multivariate general linear model analyses will be performed, this time with the pain experience PE2 scores (pleasantness, intensity, pain, and fear) at post-intervention as dependent variables.", "q17.uploader": []}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecaaaa", "text": "Medicine and Health Sciences"}, {"id": "584240d954be81056cecaa2b", "text":

For example, the recent 2009 H1N1 swine flu infected approximately 1.4 billion people across the globe and killed between 151,700 and 575,400 people (Centers for Disease Protection and Control (CDPC)), n.d.). Moreover, the most severe pandemic in recent history that infected one third of the world population \u2013 which also involved the H1N1 virus \u2013 occurred in 1918 and resulted in the death of approximately 50 million people (CDPC, n.d.). The current COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, with hundreds to thousands of deaths daily, and it is highly unlikely going to be the last pandemic to emerge. Evidently, pandemics raise scientific challenges, cause major human suffering, and impose significant economic damage (The World Health Organization (WHO), 2007, 2020), requiring a multidisciplinary approach to devise holistic interventions. Health authorities actively adopt a variety of measures found to be effective in controlling pandemics, including issuing facts and precautionary measures (e.g., limiting mobility and promoting social distancing and good respiratory etiquette, such as coughing into a tissue) (Bell, 2004; Dorfan &amp; Woody, 2011; Yang &amp; Chu, 2018). Most of the relevant behaviours and perceptions are social in nature and are implicated by social factors. For example, people are more likely to be influenced by and accept advice from people they trust (Koenig, Cl\u00e9ment, &amp; Harris, 2004; Sniezek &amp; Van Swol, 2001; Van Swol, 2011). Social psychology as a discipline should therefore be in a good position to contribute to tackling the challenges posed by pandemics; however, little (if any) research currently exists to provide guidance about the relevance and priorities for the discipline for understanding and managing pandemics. To this end, this Delphi study will recruit a panel of experts whom will provide their expert opinion on the relevance of social psychological theory and research for understanding and managing pandemics and identifying and reaching consensus (if possible) about research priorities (for the field of social psychology). The study therefore effectively employs a consolidated approach to identifying research priorities for social psychology. \n\nThe aim of this study is to garner expert opinion on: \n(1) how social psychological theory and/or research can contribute to inform knowledge and management of pandemics; (2) what research topics social psychology/social psychologists should prioritise to (further) inform knowledge and management of pandemics; and (3) what strategies social psychology/social psychologists should implement to conduct research that will (further) inform knowledge and management of pandemics. \n\n\nMETHODS\n\nDesign\n\nA modified e-Delphi method will be employed (for an overview, e.g., see Hsu &amp; Sandford, 2007; Keeney, Hasson, &amp; McKenna, 2011). The method involves consulting a panel of experts (panel members) about their views on a topic, in at least two survey rounds (up to three sequential rounds will be used in this study), to measure opinions and/or establish whether consensus is possible. Each round is refined based on the results from the previous round. The method it is typically used for topics wherein there is little or no existing knowledge or empirical evidence to inform theory, policy, and practice. \n\nThe responses to the open-ended questions will be collated and categorised into themes (items), through the use of content analysis, and become part of the survey tool used for subsequent Delphi rounds. Panel members will rate their level of agreement with each close-ended question on 5-point Likert-type scales. Descriptive data analyses of the panel members\u2019 responses to the close-ended questions will be employed (i.e., measures of central tendency and level of dispersion). Consensus will be deemed to have been achieved if at least 70% of the panel members score either strongly disagree/disagree or agree/strongly agree on an item. Items that achieve consensus in a round will not be included in subsequent rounds. In the second and (possibly) third round, panel members will receive the panel\u2019s previous responses and be asked to re-evaluate their original responses to items for which consensus was not achieved.\n\n\nParticipants\n\nPanel members will comprise (full) professors of psychology who categorise themselves as social psychologists and/or one of their main areas of expertise as situated in the field of social psychology. This will be ascertained through the identification of participants (see below) and through the following yes/no answer questions to be included in the first survey round: (1) Are you a (full) professor in psychology?; (2) Do you categorise yourself as a social psychologist and/or does one of your main areas of expertise lie in the field of social psychology?\n\nNo exclusion criteria regarding age, gender or location will be applied. Potential panel members have primarily been identified based on their occupation of leadership roles on editorial boards of prominent social psychology journals and executive committees of prominent social psychology societies/associations. Efforts have been made to identify experts beyond the West (i.e., USA and Europe) to include a diverse panel of experts based in other continents of the world. Potential panel members will be invited to take part in the study via e-mail. E-mail addresses will be obtained through internet searches or by requesting the contact details from the respective potential panel member\u2019s university affiliations. Panel members who decline participation will be asked to suggest a colleague(s) with similar background to replace them. Both purposive and snowball sampling will therefore be employed. Approximately 150-200 potential panel members will be sent the invitation to partake in the study. However, due to the well-known non-response and attrition rates associated with Delphi studies, it is not possible to provide a reliable indication of how many will respond to the e-mail (e.g., Hsu &amp; Sandford, 2007).\n\n\nMaterials and Data Analysis\n\nTwo close-ended and three open-ended questions that have been developed for the purposes of this study will be employed in the first Delphi round. \n\nPanel members will rate their level of agreement with each close-ended question on 5-point Likert-type scales (1 = Strongly disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Undecided, 4 = Agree, 5 = Strongly agree). The close-ended questions are as follows: (1) Social psychological theory and/or research can make a significant contribution to knowledge about pandemics; and (2) Social psychological theory and/or research can have a significant impact on how pandemics are managed. \n\nThe open-ended questions are as follows: (1) How can social psychological theory and/or research contribute to inform knowledge and management of pandemics?; (2) What research topics should social psychology/social psychologists prioritise to (further) inform knowledge and management of pandemics?; and (3) What strategies should social psychology/social psychologists implement to conduct research that will (further) inform knowledge and management of pandemics?\n\nThe responses to the open-ended questions will be collated and categorised into themes (items), through the use of content analysis, and become part of the survey tool used for subsequent Delphi rounds. Descriptive data analyses of the panel members\u2019 responses to the close-ended questions will be employed (i.e., measures of central tendency and level of dispersion).

Items that achieve consensus in a round will not be included in subsequent rounds. In the second and (possibly) third round, panel members will receive the panel\u2019s previous responses and be asked to re-evaluate their original responses to items for which consensus was not achieved.\n\nProcedure \n\nPotential panel members will be invited to partake in the study via e-mail. This e-mail will include an explanatory statement about the study, a link to the first survey round (hosted on the survey platform www.qualtrics.com), and relevant time-frames. The potential panel members will also be informed that \u00a310 will be donated to the WHO COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for each expert panel member that completes all rounds of the Delphi. Those who decline participation will be encouraged to recommend a colleague(s) with the appropriate expertise to replace them. Potential panel members will be given ten days to complete the first survey round \u2013 a reminder e-mail will be sent after four and seven days; potential panel member who do not respond before the deadline will not be invited to any further rounds of the study. \n\nThe first survey will first present panel members with an information sheet outlining what participants will be asked to do, what the study concerns, how long it typically takes to complete the study, what will happen to their data, and points of contact. They will be informed that participation is voluntary and quasi-anonymous; however, panel members can choose to have their name included in the supplementary materials of any presentations/reports of the study findings (i.e., to communicate the expertise of the panel members). Likewise, the information sheet emphasises that the data the participants submit may be used for academic dissemination (e.g., conference presentations and publications). Additionally, participants are informed of their right to withdraw from the study, how they can do this, and what will happen to their data if they choose to do this. Next, potential panel members will be presented a consent form to complete if they wish to participate. They will subsequently be asked to provide demographic data (e.g., their name, age, gender, country of residence, year PhD was obtained, area(s) of expertise, and e-mail address). The remainder of the survey contains the close-ended and open-ended questions, brief instructions on how to complete the survey and what will happen after completion (i.e., that another round (or summary of the final results if last round) will be sent approximately five to ten days after the preceding round terminated to allow the researcher to analyse and collate the data). The subsequent survey rounds will also contain this information. \n\nThe same procedure as for the first round will adopted for the second and (possibly) third round, with some modifications. That is, no information sheet or consent form will be included in these rounds (as only panel members who provided their informed consent and completed the first round will be included) and the study items to be included are wholly dependent on the outcome of preceding rounds. As such, in the second and (possibly) third round, panel members will receive an e-mail containing a link to the next survey in which they will be asked to review the items summarised by the researchers based on the responses in the preceding round; they will be asked to re-evaluate their original responses in light of the results from the previous round. Open-ended questions in rounds two and (possibly) three will also ask panel members to provide recommendations regarding any additions, clarifications, alterations, and/or deletions of items and for any other comments/suggestions. A summary of each round will be fed back to the panel members. The only demographic data participants will be asked to provide in the second and (possibly) third round pertain to their name and e-mail address, to allow the researchers to track their responses. The survey can be completed over several sessions to allow panel members to review their answers before final submission of responses"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"summary": "BACKGROUND\n \nPandemics have sporadically occurred over the course of human history and have varied in their impact on the human population.

A Delphi study for identifying research priorities", "description": "BACKGROUND\n \nPandemics have sporadically occurred over the course of human history and have varied in their impact on the human population. For example, the recent 2009 H1N1 swine flu infected approximately 1.4 billion people across the globe and killed between 151,700 and 575,400 people (Centers for Disease Protection and Control (CDPC)), n.d.). Moreover, the most severe pandemic in recent history that infected one third of the world population \u2013 which also involved the H1N1 virus \u2013 occurred in 1918 and resulted in the death of approximately 50 million people (CDPC, n.d.). The current COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, with hundreds to thousands of deaths daily, and it is highly unlikely going to be the last pandemic to emerge. Evidently, pandemics raise scientific challenges, cause major human suffering, and impose significant economic damage (The World Health Organization (WHO), 2007, 2020), requiring a multidisciplinary approach to devise holistic interventions. Health authorities actively adopt a variety of measures found to be effective in controlling pandemics, including issuing facts and precautionary measures (e.g., limiting mobility and promoting social distancing and good respiratory etiquette, such as coughing into a tissue) (Bell, 2004; Dorfan &amp; Woody, 2011; Yang &amp; Chu, 2018). Most of the relevant behaviours and perceptions are social in nature and are implicated by social factors. For example, people are more likely to be influenced by and accept advice from people they trust (Koenig, Cl\u00e9ment, &amp; Harris, 2004; Sniezek &amp; Van Swol, 2001; Van Swol, 2011). Social psychology as a discipline should therefore be in a good position to contribute to tackling the challenges posed by pandemics; however, little (if any) research currently exists to provide guidance about the relevance and priorities for the discipline for understanding and managing pandemics. To this end, this Delphi study will recruit a panel of experts whom will provide their expert opinion on the relevance of social psychological theory and research for understanding and managing pandemics and identifying and reaching consensus (if possible) about research priorities (for the field of social psychology). The study therefore effectively employs a consolidated approach to identifying research priorities for social psychology. \n\nThe aim of this study is to garner expert opinion on: \n(1) how social psychological theory and/or research can contribute to inform knowledge and management of pandemics; (2) what research topics social psychology/social psychologists should prioritise to (further) inform knowledge and management of pandemics; and (3) what strategies social psychology/social psychologists should implement to conduct research that will (further) inform knowledge and management of pandemics. \n\n\nMETHODS\n\nDesign\n\nA modified e-Delphi method will be employed (for an overview, e.g., see Hsu &amp; Sandford, 2007; Keeney, Hasson, &amp; McKenna, 2011). The method involves consulting a panel of experts (panel members) about their views on a topic, in at least two survey rounds (up to three sequential rounds will be used in this study), to measure opinions and/or establish whether consensus is possible. Each round is refined based on the results from the previous round. The method it is typically used for topics wherein there is little or no existing knowledge or empirical evidence to inform theory, policy, and practice. \n\nThe responses to the open-ended questions will be collated and categorised into themes (items), through the use of content analysis, and become part of the survey tool used for subsequent Delphi rounds. Panel members will rate their level of agreement with each close-ended question on 5-point Likert-type scales. Descriptive data analyses of the panel members\u2019 responses to the close-ended questions will be employed (i.e., measures of central tendency and level of dispersion). Consensus will be deemed to have been achieved if at least 70% of the panel members score either strongly disagree/disagree or agree/strongly agree on an item. Items that achieve consensus in a round will not be included in subsequent rounds. In the second and (possibly) third round, panel members will receive the panel\u2019s previous responses and be asked to re-evaluate their original responses to items for which consensus was not achieved.\n\n\nParticipants\n\nPanel members will comprise (full) professors of psychology who categorise themselves as social psychologists and/or one of their main areas of expertise as situated in the field of social psychology. This will be ascertained through the identification of participants (see below) and through the following yes/no answer questions to be included in the first survey round: (1) Are you a (full) professor in psychology?; (2) Do you categorise yourself as a social psychologist and/or does one of your main areas of expertise lie in the field of social psychology?\n\nNo exclusion criteria regarding age, gender or location will be applied. Potential panel members have primarily been identified based on their occupation of leadership roles on editorial boards of prominent social psychology journals and executive committees of prominent social psychology societies/associations. Efforts have been made to identify experts beyond the West (i.e., USA and Europe) to include a diverse panel of experts based in other continents of the world. Potential panel members will be invited to take part in the study via e-mail. E-mail addresses will be obtained through internet searches or by requesting the contact details from the respective potential panel member\u2019s university affiliations. Panel members who decline participation will be asked to suggest a colleague(s) with similar background to replace them. Both purposive and snowball sampling will therefore be employed. Approximately 150-200 potential panel members will be sent the invitation to partake in the study. However, due to the well-known non-response and attrition rates associated with Delphi studies, it is not possible to provide a reliable indication of how many will respond to the e-mail (e.g., Hsu &amp; Sandford, 2007).\n\n\nMaterials and Data Analysis\n\nTwo close-ended and three open-ended questions that have been developed for the purposes of this study will be employed in the first Delphi round. \n\nPanel members will rate their level of agreement with each close-ended question on 5-point Likert-type scales (1 = Strongly disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Undecided, 4 = Agree, 5 = Strongly agree). The close-ended questions are as follows: (1) Social psychological theory and/or research can make a significant contribution to knowledge about pandemics; and (2) Social psychological theory and/or research can have a significant impact on how pandemics are managed. \n\nThe open-ended questions are as follows: (1) How can social psychological theory and/or research contribute to inform knowledge and management of pandemics?; (2) What research topics should social psychology/social psychologists prioritise to (further) inform knowledge and management of pandemics?; and (3) What strategies should social psychology/social psychologists implement to conduct research that will (further) inform knowledge and management of pandemics?\n\nThe responses to the open-ended questions will be collated and categorised into themes (items), through the use of content analysis, and become part of the survey tool used for subsequent Delphi rounds. Descriptive data analyses of the panel members\u2019 responses to the close-ended questions will be employed (i.e., measures of central tendency and level of dispersion). Consensus will be deemed to have been achieved if at least 70% of the panel members score either strongly disagree/disagree or agree/strongly agree on an item. Items that achieve consensus in a round will not be included in subsequent rounds. In the second and (possibly) third round, panel members will receive the panel\u2019s previous responses and be asked to re-evaluate their original responses to items for which consensus was not achieved.\n\nProcedure \n\nPotential panel members will be invited to partake in the study via e-mail. This e-mail will include an explanatory statement about the study, a link to the first survey round (hosted on the survey platform www.qualtrics.com), and relevant time-frames. The potential panel members will also be informed that \u00a310 will be donated to the WHO COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for each expert panel member that completes all rounds of the Delphi. Those who decline participation will be encouraged to recommend a colleague(s) with the appropriate expertise to replace them. Potential panel members will be given ten days to complete the first survey round \u2013 a reminder e-mail will be sent after four and seven days; potential panel member who do not respond before the deadline will not be invited to any further rounds of the study. \n\nThe first survey will first present panel members with an information sheet outlining what participants will be asked to do, what the study concerns, how long it typically takes to complete the study, what will happen to their data, and points of contact. They will be informed that participation is voluntary and quasi-anonymous; however, panel members can choose to have their name included in the supplementary materials of any presentations/reports of the study findings (i.e., to communicate the expertise of the panel members). Likewise, the information sheet emphasises that the data the participants submit may be used for academic dissemination (e.g., conference presentations and publications). Additionally, participants are informed of their right to withdraw from the study, how they can do this, and what will happen to their data if they choose to do this. Next, potential panel members will be presented a consent form to complete if they wish to participate. They will subsequently be asked to provide demographic data (e.g., their name, age, gender, country of residence, year PhD was obtained, area(s) of expertise, and e-mail address). The remainder of the survey contains the close-ended and open-ended questions, brief instructions on how to complete the survey and what will happen after completion (i.e., that another round (or summary of the final results if last round) will be sent approximately five to ten days after the preceding round terminated to allow the researcher to analyse and collate the data). The subsequent survey rounds will also contain this information. \n\nThe same procedure as for the first round will adopted for the second and (possibly) third round, with some modifications. That is, no information sheet or consent form will be included in these rounds (as only panel members who provided their informed consent and completed the first round will be included) and the study items to be included are wholly dependent on the outcome of preceding rounds. As such, in the second and (possibly) third round, panel members will receive an e-mail containing a link to the next survey in which they will be asked to review the items summarised by the researchers based on the responses in the preceding round; they will be asked to re-evaluate their original responses in light of the results from the previous round. Open-ended questions in rounds two and (possibly) three will also ask panel members to provide recommendations regarding any additions, clarifications, alterations, and/or deletions of items and for any other comments/suggestions. A summary of each round will be fed back to the panel members. The only demographic data participants will be asked to provide in the second and (possibly) third round pertain to their name and e-mail address, to allow the researchers to track their responses. The survey can be completed over several sessions to allow panel members to review their answers before final submission of responses.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-03-27T19:37:46.527450", "date_modified": "2020-03-30T09:28:28.945586", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["COVID-19", "Delphi Method", "Social Psychology"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Sammyh Khan"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "0ef1e3dbf99369fff251d7c79ddcd0a05397f53e01c4656f8800d91ceb81d4659c212a94e0bf386fee2465508237615318c6e9d48c06c405c7ae7dc6ddfdb6335b2e32f173d9b684ed1ad0a9597e93f43ecdf8bf19d2c755f322b948a8c314cfbb48c6a87e1203bafd1cae6dccf1690ee86b6ad4def9937eb8de9154a3e858dcff7019c5d195242c354f52a129eed96b", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-03-27T19:37:46.498873", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Open-Ended Registration", "registered_meta": {"summary": {"extra": [], "value": "The purpose of the present research is to gauge expert derived opinion and (if possible) reach consensus regarding the relevance of social psychological theory and research for understanding and managing pandemics, and identifying research priorities (for the field of social psychology).

For left fusiform prior to \u2018pop-out\u2019 the power calculation was for an effect size of 0.91 (0.66 * 1.39) and SD of 0.048 on the mean difference of 0.0462 requiring 15 patients with a power of 0.9 and alpha of 0.05, or 20 patients with alpha=0.01. The same calculation for the right fusiform gyrus gives a sample size of 13 patients for an effect size of 1.26 and alpha=0.01 (or a difference of 0.0595 with an SD of the difference of 0.046). Based on these calculations we propose to recruit 30 patients for at least 26 completers, with a primary endpoint of change in activity in the fusiform/posterior lateral temporal lobes. Drop-outs may be replaced at the discretion of the investigator.\n\nWe aim to recruit up to n=30 patients for n=26 completers for the additional case-control cohort involving PD patients without psychosis, as we intend to match the PD psychosis sample size.

For the visual pop-out task, ROI endpoints will be calculated as the mean fit (beta) of the BOLD response to the task parameters within each hemisphere of the predefined brain region: inferior posterior aspect of the ventral visual system defined as a cluster peak in the fusiform gyrus extend into the lateral temporal cortex and occipital lobe, based on our experimental hypotheses derived from Meppelink et al., (2009).
