Feasibility and acceptability of a staff intervention for inpatient services", "description": "Therapeutic alliance, or the relationship between professional and service user, has the greatest impact on treatment outcomes in mental health, over and above the specific mode or model of therapy (Duncan et al., 2010; Wampold, 2001). Particularly in child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS), the alliance between the child or family and staff on inpatient units is the key predictor of positive outcomes from admission (Green et al., 2007; Karver 2006; Shirk and Karver, 2003). Working in partnership with family members is essential to inpatient provision, although often complicated by the family\u2019s own history with services and complex family dynamics (Gross &amp; Goldin, 2008).\nYoung people identify that relationships with staff can ease the experience of the admission (Street &amp; Svanberg, 2003a; 2003b) and they especially appreciate professionalism and expertise in the context of reciprocal engagement; making a \u2018human connection\u2019 (Sischy, 2006). The relationship between staff members and young people can contribute towards a therapeutic milieu that aids recovery even when young people struggle to access direct interventions, i.e. one-to-one therapy (Sergeant, 2009). Despite its importance, poor alliance is the main factor for ending therapeutic treatment (Garcia and Weisz, 2002), with various challenges to its development. Staff members suffer high levels of burnout (Johnson et al, 2012) and there are difficulties maintaining a skilled and sufficient workforce (Nixon, 2006). It is therefore essential that front-line professionals are well supported in managing these relationships (Ellis, 2016) in a way that is acceptable and feasible to them and the service. \nWhen working with young people especially, there is a need to navigate issues of power and control (Colton &amp; Pistrang, 2004) and manage the \u2018push and pull\u2019 of working with adolescents who have disrupted ways of relating to people due to their early relationships (Cross, 2016). The alliance is difficult for young people who have been maltreated (Eltz and Shirk, 1995) and the developmental trend toward increasing autonomy from adults can represent an additional obstacle (DiGiuseppe, Linscott, &amp; Jilton, 1996). \nNursing staff are best placed to provide caring relationships, but interactions are often not therapeutic or guided by the psychological theory of relationships (Cameron, Kapur &amp; Campbell, 2005). There has been some progress in the adult service research field, with indications that clinical supervision can protect against staff burnout (Edwards et al., 2006) and psychologically-informed case discussions can enhance positive feelings towards service users and reduce staff self-blame (Berry et al., 2009). Team-based training to develop staff skills using psychological models can even improve service user engagement (Caruso et al., 2013). However, there is currently no well-evidenced intervention to support nursing staff to develop and manage the most important part of their work (Hartley, Raphael, Lovell, Berry, 2019). Moreover, prior preliminary work in the adult field has not taken into account the specific challenges of the CAMHS context outlined above, does not involve relationships with the wider family (\u2018carers\u2019) and has not been developed with stakeholder involvement at its heart.\n\nWe therefore have created a theoretically-driven, tailored and stakeholder-informed intervention that will support the development and maintenance of helpful therapeutic relationships between nursing staff, young people and carers within inpatient CAMHS. the purpose of the current study will be to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of this staff-based intervention.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-17T13:18:20.591509", "date_modified": "2020-04-17T10:40:31.392355", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Samantha Hartley"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "2bd107fb02c8a80c1e0f981158900028c33eebe05007141772ebbfe5906d0745b0ace6b0f8bc0d6383a4b337dae736e302cc9dda9b617a33353a20318b12195edb6c20a0ad2bd9b73fca206bde6ba9c09ca408b7f4db0e8773fa56bdaadc9450cef0bc24ebbeee8f95b80cf00f45ff3250a4b3310d29fa796731dc91389389379753774fe3b2b0d345081499a64b4c60", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-17T13:18:20.570704", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Samantha Hartley"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "The aims of the current study are to:\n1.\tAssess the feasibility of the intervention\n2.\tAssess the acceptability of the intervention\n3.\tAssess the feasibility of the research design\nThe secondary aims are to:\n4.\tExplore appropriate outcome measures for use in a pilot trial \n\nWe hypothesise that the intervention will be acceptable and feasible to deliver to nursing staff in an inpatient child and adolescent mental health service.

To increase consistency among the reviewers, teams of four researchers were generated who reviewed the results of the excluded articles and the doubts were resolved by consensus. We resolved disagreement on study selection and data extraction was also resolve by consensus and discussion with other reviews if needed. \nData Charting Process: A data-charting form was jointly developed by the team to determine which variables to extract.  Each reviewer independently charted the data, and all the group discussed the results and continuously update the data charting form in an iterative process. Data form eligible studies were charted using a tool designed for this study. The tool captured the relevant information on key study characteristics detailed information on all metrics used to estimate/describe the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Any disagreements in the final evaluation were resolved through discussion by the team. We extracted data from the main publication and also any referenced published protocols and supplemental materials.  \nData items: We abstract data on article characteristics (e.g, authors, Origen, objectives, purpose), innate and adaptive immune response, cell counts, markers, cytokine storm, T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes and antibodies. The final version of the charting form was included in the Additional file. \nSynthesis of Results: We grouped the studies by type and items of research. The results were presented in a narrative format, tables, and diagrams. \n", "q17.uploader": []}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecaaaa", "text": "Medicine and Health Sciences"}], [{"id":
