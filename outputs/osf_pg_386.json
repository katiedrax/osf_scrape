The study follows a relational concept of polarization, which has been previously understood as affective polarization between partisans in US politics (Iyengar, Sood, & Lelkes, 2012; Westwood et al., 2018) or a more general hostility based on simplification of complex social relations into a dominant antagonistic conflict defining society in terms of \u201cUs\u201d vs. \u201cThem\u201d (McCoy, Rahman, & Somer, 2018; McCoy & Somer, 2019). Polarization influences non-political domains of people\u2019s lives (). and weakens discursive norms of democratic deliberation (Strickler, 2018). Even though there has been discussion about increasing tensions among Czech public, we do not know which factors actually play role in possible affective polarization (in terms of negative affect towards other people in society) or antagonization of social relations in the context of the Czech Republic. The main RQ: What factors contribute to negative mutual relationship among public in the Czech Republic? The main hypothetical sources of polarization in the study are: 1) Political partisanship \u2013 as assumed by the research on polarization in the US (Iyengar, Sood, & Lelkes, 2012; Westwood et al., 2018) 2) Attitudes about immigration \u2013 as assumed by the research on new political cleavage in European politics (Hooghe & Marks, 2018) 3) Values \u2013 authoritarian and libertarian values are assumed to cause so call cultural backlash and thus contribute to political conflict and hostility (Norris and Inglehart, 2019). 4) Frequency of talking about politics \u2013 which might be, according to recent study by Klar, Krupnikov, abd Ryan (2018), the actual force driving negative affect towards partisans in the US."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: Partisanship will significantly influence people\u2019s preferences.

The study follows a relational concept of polarization, which has been previously understood as affective polarization between partisans in US politics (Iyengar, Sood, & Lelkes, 2012; Westwood et al., 2018) or a more general hostility based on simplification of complex social relations into a dominant antagonistic conflict defining society in terms of \u201cUs\u201d vs. \u201cThem\u201d (McCoy, Rahman, & Somer, 2018; McCoy & Somer, 2019). Polarization influences non-political domains of people\u2019s lives (). and weakens discursive norms of democratic deliberation (Strickler, 2018). Even though there has been discussion about increasing tensions among Czech public, we do not know which factors actually play role in possible affective polarization (in terms of negative affect towards other people in society) or antagonization of social relations in the context of the Czech Republic. The main RQ: What factors contribute to negative mutual relationship among public in the Czech Republic? The main hypothetical sources of polarization in the study are: 1) Political partisanship \u2013 as assumed by the research on polarization in the US (Iyengar, Sood, & Lelkes, 2012; Westwood et al., 2018) 2) Attitudes about immigration \u2013 as assumed by the research on new political cleavage in European politics (Hooghe & Marks, 2018) 3) Values \u2013 authoritarian and libertarian values are assumed to cause so call cultural backlash and thus contribute to political conflict and hostility (Norris and Inglehart, 2019). 4) Frequency of talking about politics \u2013 which might be, according to recent study by Klar, Krupnikov, abd Ryan (2018), the actual force driving negative affect towards partisans in the US.", "q16": "H1: Partisanship will significantly influence people\u2019s preferences. Individuals will prefer to talk to people who match a liked political party and reject those who match a disliked party, all else constant. H2: Attitudes to immigration will significantly influence people\u2019s preference. Individuals will prefer to talk to people with a similar attitude to immigration and reject those with a different attitude, all else constant. H3: Individuals will prefer less to talk to other people who like to talk about politics more frequently, all else constant. H3a: Individuals will prefer to talk less to other people who like to talk about politics and vote for individual\u2019s disliked parties compared to voters of liked parties. H3b: Individuals will prefer to talk less to other people with different attitudes on immigration who like to talk about politics compared to those with similar attitudes on immigration. H4: Polarization is driven neither by partisanship nor attitudes but by a more fundamental concept of values. Individuals will prefer to talk less to people with different values.", "q17": "The study is based on a conjoint experiment. In the experiment respondents will be asked to choose between two different people the one they would prefer to talk to. They will also rate the two people on feeling thermometers.

The sample will be a non-probability sample (quotas on gender, education, age, region, size of municipality). Representative of the Czech population. Two different outcome variables are: a discrete choice between two personalities and rating of these personalities on feeling thermometers. The outcome variables will be analyzed using logistic regression and OLS respectively. First, the outcome variables will be regressed on the profile attributes as they are presented in the experiment \u2013 with the exception of party vote which will be recoded according to evaluation of the party by participants in a pre-test (liked/disliked). The regression models will also add interaction terms party vote * talk about politics and immigration attitude * talk about politics.

inter-ethnic clashes affect inter- and intra-ethnic cooperation? And does such violence spur religious fundamentalism? We approach these questions by studying the 2010 inter-ethnic clashes in Southern Kyrgyzstan. Following the toppling of Kyrgyzstan\u2019s long-term president Bakiyev in April 2010, protests broke out throughout the country. In Osh, a city almost equally split between Kyrgyz and Uzbek residents, these protests quickly assumed an ethnic dimension and turned into violent clashes, which left at least 400 people dead.

Support for Climate Action under Weak International Institutions.'' The main goal of the experiment it to understand how different information about winning and losing sectors in the UK and Germany affect support for ambitious climate action among UK respondents. The survey will be fielded to a sample of (initially) 400 respondents through Amazon MTurk end of May 2019. The survey experiment features five experimental conditions, one control group and four experimental groups. Assignment to group is random. The control group is provided with basic information about the UK's climate action commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement as well as associated costs and benefits. All respondents receive this information. The four treatment conditions provide information about winning and losing sectors in the UK and Germany. Specifically, the ``domestic winners'' (T1) treatment highlights benefits from climate action for the UK energy sector; the ``domestic losers'' (T2) treatment emphasizes losses for the UK transportation sector; the ``foreign winners'' (T3) treatment points out benefits for the German transportation section; the ``foreign losers'' treatment (T4) sector highlights losses for the German fossil fuel energy sector."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "We formulate several baseline expectations about the treatment effects in our survey experiment.

(2) Relative to the control group, we expect support for UK climate action to be higher for respondents who received the UK winners treatment (T1); we expect it to be lower for those who received the UK losers treatment (T2).

Support for Climate Action under Weak International Institutions.'' The main goal of the experiment it to understand how different information about winning and losing sectors in the UK and Germany affect support for ambitious climate action among UK respondents. The survey will be fielded to a sample of (initially) 400 respondents through Amazon MTurk end of May 2019. The survey experiment features five experimental conditions, one control group and four experimental groups. Assignment to group is random. The control group is provided with basic information about the UK's climate action commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement as well as associated costs and benefits. All respondents receive this information. The four treatment conditions provide information about winning and losing sectors in the UK and Germany. Specifically, the ``domestic winners'' (T1) treatment highlights benefits from climate action for the UK energy sector; the ``domestic losers'' (T2) treatment emphasizes losses for the UK transportation sector; the ``foreign winners'' (T3) treatment points out benefits for the German transportation section; the ``foreign losers'' treatment (T4) sector highlights losses for the German fossil fuel energy sector.", "q16": "We formulate several baseline expectations about the treatment effects in our survey experiment. (1) We expect support for ambitious climate action to be fairly low in the control group across all outcomes, but particularly so for UK climate action. (2) Relative to the control group, we expect support for UK climate action to be higher for respondents who received the UK winners treatment (T1); we expect it to be lower for those who received the UK losers treatment (T2). Effects for respondents receiving the foreign winners (T3) and foreign losers (T4) treatment should be smaller in size, possibly indistinguishable from the control group mean for UK climate action. (3) We expect support for German climate action to be higher for the foreign winners treatment (T3) and smaller for the German losers treatment (T4) relative to the control group.", "q17": "The hypotheses will be tested using simple, two-tailed difference-in-means with appropriate multiple comparisons adjustments.
