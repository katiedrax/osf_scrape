For this breast cancer subtype, endocrine treatment represents the mainstay of systemic treatment for both early and metastatic disease. However, a subset of patients will develop endocrine resistance, manifesting as relapse or progression. Side effects of endocrine treatment are well described, including thromboembolic problems, stroke, menopausal symptoms, and tiredness (fatigue). For many who receive systemic therapy the relative benefits may be small and not outweigh the associated costs of side effects. Although recent advances in transcriptomics research have given us a glimpse into the heterogeneity within subgroups, it is not possible to precisely predict a tumor\u2019s response to therapy. Obesity is a risk factor for ER positive breast cancer and correlates with poor prognosis of breast cancer. However, the mechanism of how obesity correlates with endocrine treatment resistance remains unclear. In this project, by use of metabolomics approaches, we will examine steroid hormone metabolomics in breast tumor tissue and serum obtained from a regional breast cancer biobank. We aim to identify novel biomarkers for predicting endocrine treatment resistance and treatment-induced side-effects in both non-obese and obese breast cancer patients.
