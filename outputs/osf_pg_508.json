Meeus, Susan Branje"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "According to social learning theory, adolescents learn social behaviors by observing and mimicking others who model specific social behaviors (Bandura, 1977; Hoffman, 2008). This might imply that adolescents' prosocial behavior may be induced via parents, siblings, and best friends who model such behaviors. Adolescents' prosocial behaviors are a range of behaviors that are intended to benefit others, such as helping and sharing (Carlo, 2001;  Hastings, Utendale, &amp; Sullivan, 2007). Close relationships provide a unique context in which reciprocity of prosocial behaviors may occur (Brown, 2004). Moreover, prosocial behavior is necessary for maintaining healthy close relationships (Padilla-Walker, Fraser, Black, &amp; Bean, 2015), and adolescents are more prone to show prosocial behaviors towards family and friends (Amato, 1990). Even more specifically, high-quality relationships were found to be related to adolescents\u2019 prosocial behavior (Laible, 2007; Markiewicz, Doyle, &amp; Brendgen, 2001; Padilla-Walker &amp; Christensen, 2011). For example, adolescents\u2019 perception of adequate support was associated with prosocial behavior (Gagn\u00e9, 2003; Laible, 2007; Nelson et al., 2015). In turn, adolescents\u2019 prosocial behavior might also be a predictor of parent and peer relationship quality. Adolescents\u2019prosocial behavior has been found related to the quality of friendships and affective behavior towards best friends (Markiewicz et al., 2001), and to later parenting (especially for maternal warmth) (Carlo, Mestre, Samper, Tur, &amp; Armenta, 2011). Regarding the influence between parenting and adolescents\u2019 prosocial behavior, this effect might be stronger between mothers and their children, then between fathers and adolescents (Hastings, McShane, Parker, &amp; Ladha, 2007; Hastings, Utendale, William, et al., 2007). However, this theory has been substantiated with limited empirical evidence, especially concerning the reciprocal associations of parents, siblings, and best friends on adolescents\u2019 prosocial behavior.\n\n\nMoreover, most developmental studies examined associations on the between-person level. This reflects, for instance, whether adolescents who perceive more support become more prosocial than other adolescents but does not necessarily reflect whether adolescents become more prosocial than before when they perceive more support than before. From a transactional perspective, it would be more logical to assess the reciprocity within dyads, such as dynamic processes between autonomy support, emotional support, and prosocial behavior within dyads. Therefore, it is necessary to separate the between-dyad variance from the within-dyad variance to gain an understanding of how these constructs are linked to adolescents' prosocial behavior (Hamaker, Kuiper, &amp; Grasman, 2015). \n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Primary hypotheses on the within-level. \n1.\tWithin dyads, we expect bidirectional associations between increased adolescents\u2019 prosocial behavior and increased prosocial behavior from fathers, mothers, siblings, or best friends, both concurrently and longitudinally across 1-year intervals.\n2.\tWithin dyads, we expect bidirectional associations between increased perceived autonomy and emotional support from fathers, mothers, siblings, and best friends and increased adolescents\u2019 prosocial behavior, both concurrently and longitudinally across 1-year intervals.

To test the pattern of missing data, Little's Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) test will be applied in SPSS, this will be indicated by \u2265 \u03b1 .05. We will use Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) in the main analyses if there is any missing data. Furthermore, we will check normality, skewness, and kurtosis if the values of skewness and kurtosis for the outcome variable are smaller than 2 times its standard error than there is no indication that the data is not highly skewed. If the data meet the assumptions, then Maximum Likelihood estimation will be used. Otherwise, Maximum Likelihood with Robust standard errors will be used. We will calculate descriptive statistics and (intraclass) correlations. \t\n\nThe intraclass correlation (ICC) will be calculated in order to investigate whether there is variance on the between-dyads level and the within-dyads level. Here, the ICC will indicate whether the variance is due to between-dyads differences and not due to fluctuations over-time within dyads. It is preferable to use random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM), when we find an intra-class correlation of \u2265 .10 (Kline, 2011; Maas &amp; Hox, 2005). In order to test our hypotheses, we will use a random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) which separates the observed score on a within-person level from between-person levels of our variables of interest. This is achieved by adding a random intercept for all the variables: prosocial behavior, autonomy support, and emotional support. In total 4 models will be examined, a model per support provider, viz: 1) adolescents perception on autonomy support from mothers, adolescents perception on emotional support from mothers, mother-reported prosocial behavior and adolescent-reported prosocial behavior; 2) adolescents perception on autonomy support from fathers, adolescents perception on emotional support from fathers, father-reported prosocial behavior and adolescent-reported prosocial behavior; 3) adolescents perception on autonomy support from siblings, adolescents perception on emotional support from siblings, sibling-reported prosocial behavior and adolescent-reported prosocial behavior; 4) adolescents perception on autonomy support from best friends, adolescents perception on emotional support from best friends, best friend-reported prosocial behavior and adolescent-reported prosocial behavior. The following steps will be applied to each model.\n\nFirst, a model with fully constrained autoregressive effects and cross-lagged effects is compared to a model with freely estimated autoregressive effects and cross-lagged effects, in order to test whether the factor structure is time-invariant. Then we will compare the model with the fit indices described below. In multigroup analyses, parameters will be constrained for males and females to assess the moderating effect of gender (Hamaker, 2018). Next, the significant associations will be combined in a final model in order to examine the reciprocal links from mothers, fathers, siblings, and best friends on adolescent's prosocial behavior. We will apply a sensitive test to the final model, where we will run the model with only complete cases.

J. Meeus, Susan Branje", "q3": "According to social learning theory, adolescents learn social behaviors by observing and mimicking others who model specific social behaviors (Bandura, 1977; Hoffman, 2008). This might imply that adolescents' prosocial behavior may be induced via parents, siblings, and best friends who model such behaviors. Adolescents' prosocial behaviors are a range of behaviors that are intended to benefit others, such as helping and sharing (Carlo, 2001;  Hastings, Utendale, &amp; Sullivan, 2007). Close relationships provide a unique context in which reciprocity of prosocial behaviors may occur (Brown, 2004). Moreover, prosocial behavior is necessary for maintaining healthy close relationships (Padilla-Walker, Fraser, Black, &amp; Bean, 2015), and adolescents are more prone to show prosocial behaviors towards family and friends (Amato, 1990). Even more specifically, high-quality relationships were found to be related to adolescents\u2019 prosocial behavior (Laible, 2007; Markiewicz, Doyle, &amp; Brendgen, 2001; Padilla-Walker &amp; Christensen, 2011). For example, adolescents\u2019 perception of adequate support was associated with prosocial behavior (Gagn\u00e9, 2003; Laible, 2007; Nelson et al., 2015). In turn, adolescents\u2019 prosocial behavior might also be a predictor of parent and peer relationship quality. Adolescents\u2019prosocial behavior has been found related to the quality of friendships and affective behavior towards best friends (Markiewicz et al., 2001), and to later parenting (especially for maternal warmth) (Carlo, Mestre, Samper, Tur, &amp; Armenta, 2011). Regarding the influence between parenting and adolescents\u2019 prosocial behavior, this effect might be stronger between mothers and their children, then between fathers and adolescents (Hastings, McShane, Parker, &amp; Ladha, 2007; Hastings, Utendale, William, et al., 2007). However, this theory has been substantiated with limited empirical evidence, especially concerning the reciprocal associations of parents, siblings, and best friends on adolescents\u2019 prosocial behavior.\n\n\nMoreover, most developmental studies examined associations on the between-person level. This reflects, for instance, whether adolescents who perceive more support become more prosocial than other adolescents but does not necessarily reflect whether adolescents become more prosocial than before when they perceive more support than before. From a transactional perspective, it would be more logical to assess the reciprocity within dyads, such as dynamic processes between autonomy support, emotional support, and prosocial behavior within dyads. Therefore, it is necessary to separate the between-dyad variance from the within-dyad variance to gain an understanding of how these constructs are linked to adolescents' prosocial behavior (Hamaker, Kuiper, &amp; Grasman, 2015). \n", "q4": "Primary hypotheses on the within-level. \n1.\tWithin dyads, we expect bidirectional associations between increased adolescents\u2019 prosocial behavior and increased prosocial behavior from fathers, mothers, siblings, or best friends, both concurrently and longitudinally across 1-year intervals.\n2.\tWithin dyads, we expect bidirectional associations between increased perceived autonomy and emotional support from fathers, mothers, siblings, and best friends and increased adolescents\u2019 prosocial behavior, both concurrently and longitudinally across 1-year intervals.

The items were rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to (not at all true) to 7 (very true). A sample item is: \u201cI'm willing to help others.\"\n\nAutonomy support. Adolescents reported on perceived autonomy support from parents, siblings, and best friends with the 7-item subscale \"balanced relatedness\" of the Dutch version of Adolescent Intimacy Revisited (Shulman, Laursen, Kalman, &amp; Karpovsky, 1997). The items were rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 1(strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). An example item is: \u201cMy best friend respects my ideas.\u201d\n\nEmotional Support. Adolescents reported on perceived emotional support from parents, siblings, and best friends with the Dutch version of the 8-item subscale \u201csupport\u201d from the Network of Relationships Inventory (Furman &amp; Buhrmester, 1985).

To test the pattern of missing data, Little's Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) test will be applied in SPSS, this will be indicated by \u2265 \u03b1 .05. We will use Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) in the main analyses if there is any missing data. Furthermore, we will check normality, skewness, and kurtosis if the values of skewness and kurtosis for the outcome variable are smaller than 2 times its standard error than there is no indication that the data is not highly skewed. If the data meet the assumptions, then Maximum Likelihood estimation will be used. Otherwise, Maximum Likelihood with Robust standard errors will be used. We will calculate descriptive statistics and (intraclass) correlations. \t\n\nThe intraclass correlation (ICC) will be calculated in order to investigate whether there is variance on the between-dyads level and the within-dyads level. Here, the ICC will indicate whether the variance is due to between-dyads differences and not due to fluctuations over-time within dyads. It is preferable to use random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM), when we find an intra-class correlation of \u2265 .10 (Kline, 2011; Maas &amp; Hox, 2005). In order to test our hypotheses, we will use a random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) which separates the observed score on a within-person level from between-person levels of our variables of interest. This is achieved by adding a random intercept for all the variables: prosocial behavior, autonomy support, and emotional support. In total 4 models will be examined, a model per support provider, viz: 1) adolescents perception on autonomy support from mothers, adolescents perception on emotional support from mothers, mother-reported prosocial behavior and adolescent-reported prosocial behavior; 2) adolescents perception on autonomy support from fathers, adolescents perception on emotional support from fathers, father-reported prosocial behavior and adolescent-reported prosocial behavior; 3) adolescents perception on autonomy support from siblings, adolescents perception on emotional support from siblings, sibling-reported prosocial behavior and adolescent-reported prosocial behavior; 4) adolescents perception on autonomy support from best friends, adolescents perception on emotional support from best friends, best friend-reported prosocial behavior and adolescent-reported prosocial behavior. The following steps will be applied to each model.\n\nFirst, a model with fully constrained autoregressive effects and cross-lagged effects is compared to a model with freely estimated autoregressive effects and cross-lagged effects, in order to test whether the factor structure is time-invariant. Then we will compare the model with the fit indices described below. In multigroup analyses, parameters will be constrained for males and females to assess the moderating effect of gender (Hamaker, 2018). Next, the significant associations will be combined in a final model in order to examine the reciprocal links from mothers, fathers, siblings, and best friends on adolescent's prosocial behavior. We will apply a sensitive test to the final model, where we will run the model with only complete cases.
