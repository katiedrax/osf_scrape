Once this has been tallied, we will perform differences of means analyses across treatments. 2) Express their pre-stated preferences: Prior to the group deliberation round, we ask participants whether they would prefer to repeat the activity the final time under the cooperative or competitive scheme. With Professor Karpowitz's software, we will then be able to compare the content of participants' comments against their privately stated preferences. 3) Be influential in group decision-making: We ask participants who was the most influential member of their group. We will compare whether men and women are more or less influential across treatment conditions using difference-of-means tests. 4) Feel comfortable with the group dynamic process: At the completion of the task, we ask participants whether they are satisfied with their group discussion, whether their voice was heard, etc. We will perform differences of means analyses across treatment groups on these dependent variables."}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q27": {"extra": [], "value": "Combination of researchers and directors of the Marriott School programs"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q30": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q38": {"extra": {}, "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "The effects of group composition on long-term group dynamics", "q2": "Jessica Preece | Christopher Karpowitz | Olga Bogach Stoddard", "q3": "20150812AA", "q4": "08/13/2015 - 20:46", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to any research activities", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "8/20/15", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "No", "q15": "What is the effect of group gender composition on men and women's 1) group behavior dynamics, 2) individual confidence and self-efficacy, and 3) attitudes toward their group experience and the overall academic program.

Lab Protocol: There are a number of analysis that we will perform on the data we collect during the laboratory portion of the study. Namely, we will analyze whether assignment to the treatment condition makes men and women more likely to 1) Speak: Professor Karpowitz has developed software that captures the speaking time of each participant in group deliberation. Once this has been tallied, we will perform differences of means analyses across treatments. 2) Express their pre-stated preferences: Prior to the group deliberation round, we ask participants whether they would prefer to repeat the activity the final time under the cooperative or competitive scheme. With Professor Karpowitz's software, we will then be able to compare the content of participants' comments against their privately stated preferences. 3) Be influential in group decision-making: We ask participants who was the most influential member of their group. We will compare whether men and women are more or less influential across treatment conditions using difference-of-means tests. 4) Feel comfortable with the group dynamic process: At the completion of the task, we ask participants whether they are satisfied with their group discussion, whether their voice was heard, etc. We will perform differences of means analyses across treatment groups on these dependent variables.", "q18": "", "q19": "", "q20": "Yes", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "", "q25": "", "q26": "Other (describe in text box below)", "q27": "Combination of researchers and

socially disadvantaged minority groups in India - the religious minorities and lower-caste groups.

These sessions will be publicly screened in one set of polling stations and privately to individuals in another set of polling stations. The screenings will take place in both an intra-party and inter-party electoral environment, in the 2015 primary elections of the ruling party, and 2016 general elections.

The treatment arm consists of public and private screenings of \u201cMeet the Candidate\u201d sessions and surveys in primary and general elections, and assesses the role of public information in affecting voter attitudes and behavior.

This field experiment, conducted in Uganda during the 2015 primary and 2016 general elections, will systematically assess the conditions under which information about candidates and government performance affects voter behavior. We examine two different methods of providing information: debate-like \u201cMeet the Candidate\u201d sessions and a scorecard. \u201cMeet the Candidate\u201d sessions include video-recorded candidate statements on a set of questions related to policy preferences. These sessions will be publicly screened in one set of polling stations and privately to individuals in another set of polling stations. The screenings will take place in both an intra-party and inter-party electoral environment, in the 2015 primary elections of the ruling party, and 2016 general elections. Thus, we examine systematically two factors that we hypothesize will affect the effect of information on voter behavior: the political environment and the public vs. private nature of information provision. The treatment arm consists of public and private screenings of \u201cMeet the Candidate\u201d sessions and surveys in primary and general elections, and assesses the role of public information in affecting voter attitudes and behavior. Conducting two types of screenings \u2013 public and private \u2013 will illuminate the role of public information in affecting voter attitudes and behavior.", "q16": "Hypotheses are described in detail in the PAP.

after state elections (Dates for the election have not been officially announced, but it will likely take place in September and October of 2015). The project is part of a broader comparative project funded by the Experiments in Governance and Politics (EGAP). For more information on this broader project, please see here. The project seeks to assess the role of information dissemination on the selection of political candidates by voters. It builds on a series of recent field experiments about this question that have been conducted around the world over the past decade (Humphreys and Weinstein, 2010; Banerjee et al., 2011; de Figueiredo, Hidalgo and Kasahara, 2011; Chong et al., 2011; Casey, Glennerster and Bidwell, 2015).1 The goal of these field experiments is to understand whether providing voters with information about candidates leads them to choose \"better\" politicians. In India, our focus is on whether voters choose candidates with fewer criminal charges once we directly provide them with a summary of criminal charges against each candidate in the constituency.2 3 In this project we are not only interested in the effect of information, but also the identity of those delivering the information about politicians. In particular, we vary the identity of the individual providing information to the voter. The study will take place in 600 polling booths across the state of Bihar, North India, ahead of much-anticipated state-level elections scheduled for October-November of 2015 (in several phases). State assembly elections are organized every five years, unless a government is dissolved early, and set the stage for considerable electoral battles among the main political parties. Because states play a key role in the Indian federal system regarding the distribution of benefits (Chandra, 2004), and because regional parties have increasingly become important in India, state assembly elections are now often seen as the most important elections in India. there are several important reasons why it makes sense for a field experiment on information and accountability to focus on the state of Bihar. Bihar is often seen \u2013 along with the eastern part of the adjacent state of Uttar Pradesh \u2013 as a hotbed for \"criminal politics\" and corruption in the country (Witsoe, 2005; Berenschot, 2008; Michelutti, 2010; Vaishnav, 2012). According to Vaishnav (2012), \"on a percentage basis, Bihar sends the largest number of politicians facing pending criminal indictments to its state assembly of any state in India.\" As can be ascertained from publicly available electoral affidavits, this alarming trend is not specific to a single party. In the last assembly elections in 2010, all the main political parties in Bihar fielded candidates facing major criminal charges in the Assembly elections, with the then ruling JD(U)/BJP coalition topping the list with 72 such nominees. An informational intervention with a stated objective to decrease the number of winning candidates facing criminal charges is thus particularly relevant to the political context of Bihar, as several local civil society organizations \u2013 especially the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) \u2013 have in the past attempted to mount awareness campaigns that echo our efforts in this proposal. A field experiment of the type we describe in this proposal allows us to build on these efforts and test what various types of informational interventions, and the various types of politically relevant individuals that may be the bearers of this information, can do to increase accountability against \"criminal types.\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "See section 5 of attached PAP"},

the election have not been officially announced, but it will likely take place in September and October of 2015). The project is part of a broader comparative project funded by the Experiments in Governance and Politics (EGAP). For more information on this broader project, please see here. The project seeks to assess the role of information dissemination on the selection of political candidates by voters. It builds on a series of recent field experiments about this question that have been conducted around the world over the past decade (Humphreys and Weinstein, 2010; Banerjee et al., 2011; de Figueiredo, Hidalgo and Kasahara, 2011; Chong et al., 2011; Casey, Glennerster and Bidwell, 2015).1 The goal of these field experiments is to understand whether providing voters with information about candidates leads them to choose \"better\" politicians. In India, our focus is on whether voters choose candidates with fewer criminal charges once we directly provide them with a summary of criminal charges against each candidate in the constituency.2 3 In this project we are not only interested in the effect of information, but also the identity of those delivering the information about politicians. In particular, we vary the identity of the individual providing information to the voter. The study will take place in 600 polling booths across the state of Bihar, North India, ahead of much-anticipated state-level elections scheduled for October-November of 2015 (in several phases). State assembly elections are organized every five years, unless a government is dissolved early, and set the stage for considerable electoral battles among the main political parties. Because states play a key role in the Indian federal system regarding the distribution of benefits (Chandra, 2004), and because regional parties have increasingly become important in India, state assembly elections are now often seen as the most important elections in India. there are several important reasons why it makes sense for a field experiment on information and accountability to focus on the state of Bihar. Bihar is often seen \u2013 along with the eastern part of the adjacent state of Uttar Pradesh \u2013 as a hotbed for \"criminal politics\" and corruption in the country (Witsoe, 2005; Berenschot, 2008; Michelutti, 2010; Vaishnav, 2012). According to Vaishnav (2012), \"on a percentage basis, Bihar sends the largest number of politicians facing pending criminal indictments to its state assembly of any state in India.\" As can be ascertained from publicly available electoral affidavits, this alarming trend is not specific to a single party. In the last assembly elections in 2010, all the main political parties in Bihar fielded candidates facing major criminal charges in the Assembly elections, with the then ruling JD(U)/BJP coalition topping the list with 72 such nominees. An informational intervention with a stated objective to decrease the number of winning candidates facing criminal charges is thus particularly relevant to the political context of Bihar, as several local civil society organizations \u2013 especially the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) \u2013 have in the past attempted to mount awareness campaigns that echo our efforts in this proposal. A field experiment of the type we describe in this proposal allows us to build on these efforts and test what various types of informational interventions, and the various types of politically relevant individuals that may be the bearers of this information, can do to increase accountability against \"criminal types.\"", "q16": "See section 5 of attached PAP", "q17": "See section 5 of

"Under what conditions are economic development interventions likely to improve stability? How can economic development programming be done in a way that addresses deep-seated social and political frustrations that drive young people into insurgencies? Promoting stability has become the primary, underlying aim of nearly all major development donors operating in fragile and conflict afflicted states. Youth play a critical role in this dynamic as they are both the large recruitment pool for potential violent spoilers -- representing a significant proportion of the population in many developing countries --and will eventually take positions of power and influence in their society. Nowhere are the issues of youth and stability more salient than in Afghanistan. The nation is currently experiencing a significant \"youth bulge\" (nearly 70% of the population is 35 years and under according to UNDP), which, combined with unemployment and social fragmentation, has raised concerns for a significant increase in insurgent recruitment and violence. Many aid actors see employment generation as the best bet for promoting stability in Afghanistan and other fragile states. The underlying assumption is that employment will reduce people's likelihood to be recruited into or resort to political violence by providing them with incentives to disengage with violent movements. However, a number of studies have begun to question the prominence of youth joblessness in explaining their role in violent movements. Evidence of the causal relationship between youth employment and stability remains almost non-existent, resulting in policy and program decision that are based on untested assumptions. The purpose of this research is to test the causal linkages between employment and support for political violence among youth in Southern Afghanistan. The insights and recommendations generated will contribute to improving the effectiveness of investments in youth employment and stability in Afghanistan and similar fragile states."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Specifically, the research will test the following hypotheses drawn from political science theory on the determinants of violence: H1: If young people gain vocational skills, they will a) be more likely to find employment thereby improve their economic conditions and social status, and b) be less likely to support political violence and insurgent groups to address their social status-related grievances. H2: If young people gain critical life skills such as critical thinking, dispute resolution and effective communication, they will be more likely to engage in pro-social behaviors, develop social networks, and less likely to get involved in political violence and insurgent movements. H3: If young men have their immediate financial needs met, then they will be less likely to be manipulated by financial incentives to support political violence and insurgent groups. Given that the study sample for this project includes about 25% women and at least 50% displaced individuals--refugees, internally displaced, and/or returnees--living in Kandahar, we would also like to examine the following secondary hypotheses: H4: Participants who undergo the INVEST program, which includes a gender based violence and human rights component, are less likely to support domestic and gender based violence. H5: The displaced (refugees and returnees) are more likely to support political violence compared to the natives of Kandahar. H6: The displaced, because of their vulnerability, are more likely to be targeted for recruitment by the insurgency. H7: Increased interaction between the displaced and local natives of Kandahar through the INVEST program leads to less anti-refugee attitudes among the natives. The quantities of interest to be estimated are participants' employment status, economic engagement, attitudes towards violence and armed insurgency, household violence, participation in illicit activities, contact with recruiters and recruitment activities, and community engagement. We will also measure and analyze the roles of the following potential mediating factors: social status, displacement status, self efficacy, and social connections."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "The research will be conducted as a rigorous, theory-based impact evaluation of INVEST, Mercy Corps' vocational training program which consists of three types of interventions: TVET bundle (3-month vocational training courses + \"Ready to Earn Clubs\" + Gender Based Violence and Human Rights half-day training), Soft-skills training, and unconditional cash transfers (UCT). This program will target vulnerable youth populations, including Afghan refugees returning from Pakistan now based in and around Kandahar City and the three neighboring districts of Dand, Daman and Arghandab. A randomized impact evaluation using a fractional factorial design will be used to estimate the causal effects of these three intervention types on the quantities of interest. To measure these outcomes, we will employ a mixed-methods approach that intentionally combines panel survey data, behavioral games, in-depth, semi-structured interviews, and the opportunity for participants to apply for a grant to start a community development project. Given the sensitive nature of some of these outcomes, we will use indirect survey questioning techniques."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Afghanistan"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "3000

How can economic development programming be done in a way that addresses deep-seated social and political frustrations that drive young people into insurgencies? Promoting stability has become the primary, underlying aim of nearly all major development donors operating in fragile and conflict afflicted states. Youth play a critical role in this dynamic as they are both the large recruitment pool for potential violent spoilers -- representing a significant proportion of the population in many developing countries --and will eventually take positions of power and influence in their society. Nowhere are the issues of youth and stability more salient than in Afghanistan. The nation is currently experiencing a significant \"youth bulge\" (nearly 70% of the population is 35 years and under according to UNDP), which, combined with unemployment and social fragmentation, has raised concerns for a significant increase in insurgent recruitment and violence. Many aid actors see employment generation as the best bet for promoting stability in Afghanistan and other fragile states. The underlying assumption is that employment will reduce people's likelihood to be recruited into or resort to political violence by providing them with incentives to disengage with violent movements. However, a number of studies have begun to question the prominence of youth joblessness in explaining their role in violent movements. Evidence of the causal relationship between youth employment and stability remains almost non-existent, resulting in policy and program decision that are based on untested assumptions. The purpose of this research is to test the causal linkages between employment and support for political violence among youth in Southern Afghanistan. The insights and recommendations generated will contribute to improving the effectiveness of investments in youth employment and stability in Afghanistan and similar fragile states.", "q16": "Specifically, the research will test the following hypotheses drawn from political science theory on the determinants of violence: H1: If young people gain vocational skills, they will a) be more likely to find employment thereby improve their economic conditions and social status, and b) be less likely to support political violence and insurgent groups to address their social status-related grievances. H2: If young people gain critical life skills such as critical thinking, dispute resolution and effective communication, they will be more likely to engage in pro-social behaviors, develop social networks, and less likely to get involved in political violence and insurgent movements. H3: If young men have their immediate financial needs met, then they will be less likely to be manipulated by financial incentives to support political violence and insurgent groups. Given that the study sample for this project includes about 25% women and at least 50% displaced individuals--refugees, internally displaced, and/or returnees--living in Kandahar, we would also like to examine the following secondary hypotheses: H4: Participants who undergo the INVEST program, which includes a gender based violence and human rights component, are less likely to support domestic and gender based violence. H5: The displaced (refugees and returnees) are more likely to support political violence compared to the natives of Kandahar. H6: The displaced, because of their vulnerability, are more likely to be targeted for recruitment by the insurgency. H7: Increased interaction between the displaced and local natives of Kandahar through the INVEST program leads to less anti-refugee attitudes among the natives. The quantities of interest to be estimated are participants' employment status, economic engagement, attitudes towards violence and armed insurgency, household violence, participation in illicit activities, contact with recruiters and recruitment activities, and community engagement. We will also measure and analyze the roles of the following potential mediating factors: social status, displacement status, self efficacy, and social connections.", "q17": "The research will be conducted as a rigorous, theory-based impact evaluation of INVEST, Mercy Corps' vocational training program which consists of three types of interventions: TVET bundle (3-month vocational training courses + \"Ready to Earn Clubs\" + Gender Based Violence and Human Rights half-day training), Soft-skills training, and unconditional cash transfers (UCT). This program will target vulnerable youth populations, including Afghan refugees returning from Pakistan now based in and around Kandahar City and the three neighboring districts of Dand, Daman and Arghandab. A randomized impact evaluation using a fractional factorial design will be used to estimate the causal effects of these three intervention types on the quantities of interest. To measure these outcomes, we will employ a mixed-methods approach that intentionally combines panel survey data, behavioral games, in-depth, semi-structured interviews, and the opportunity for participants to apply for a grant to start a community development project. Given the sensitive nature of some of these outcomes, we will use indirect survey questioning techniques.", "q18": "Afghanistan", "q19": "3000 participants", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes",
