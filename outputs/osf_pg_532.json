First of all, different degrees of transitivity influence which auxiliar is selected: Prototypical transitive sentences select \"haben\". Prototypical intransitive sentences select \"sein\" if the sentence is telic or contains a motion verb. Between the prototypes of intransitivity and transitivity, variation is possible, e.g., if the object is ambiguous between patient and instrument (e.g., Ich bin/habe vor 20 Jahren ein schwarzes Pferd geritten \u2018I used to ride a black horse twenty years ago\u2019). The influence of transitivity, telicity and motion verb semantics has been studied in corpora, e.g., by Gillmann (2016). Roehm et al. (2013) studied the influence of telicity on the auxiliar selection with respect to degree achievements (e.g. rosten, \u2018to rust\u2019) in an EEG study. However, to my knowledge, a psycholinguistic study examining the influence of transitivity on the auxiliar selection in German has not been carried out so far. \nThis study examines the influence of transitivity with the help of a sentence maze task. By studying the influence of transitivity, prototypicality effects should be visible, as the influence of transitivity seems to be organised between two prototypes (transitive vs. intransitive sentences) (Gillmann 2016: 302-305). Within a sentence maze task, participants are asked to build a sentence bit by bit. For each chunk of a sentence, participants choose between two options. Within the task, the verbs \"fahren\" 'to drive', \"reiten\" 'to ride' and \"fliegen\" 'to fly' are used in sentences with different degrees of transitivity: transitive (object is used as a patient), ambiguous I (object is ambiguous between patient and instrument), ambiguous II (sentence element is ambiguous between object and adverbial) and intransitive (no object). The participants have to choose between \"haben\" and \"sein\" as auxiliar for the main verbs (e.g., gefahren haben/sein). The test sentences are subordinate clauses so that the auxiliar is at the end of each sentence. "}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "1. reaction times\n\nReaction times are low for prototypical intransitivity. For prototypical intransitivity, they are higher because the sentence is more complex than the intransitive sentence that does not contain an object. It is expected that ambigII elicits similar reaction times as transitive sentences. In contrast, ambigI is expected to elicit the highest reactions times. This hypotheses are based on the results of the prestudy (see data_prestudy_prototypicality.csv for the data and prestudy_prototypicality.R for the code analysing the data statistically). \nBefore analysing the data of the prestudy, a different pattern was expected: Reaction times were expected to be low for prototypical transitivity and prototypical intransitivity. For sentences in the periphery (ambiguous I and II), reaction times were expected to be high as both forms are theoretically possible (see https://osf.io/p5myx for the preregistration of the prestudy). \n\nIf the pattern of the prestudy is also visible in the main study, ambiguousII does not seem to be perceived as ambiguous (see also response behaviour) as the comparable reaction times to transitive sentences demonstrate. The reaction times elicited by transitive and ambiguousII sentences being higher than the reaction times elicited by intransitive sentences could be due to the higher complexity of these sentences compared to the intransitive test sentences. The increased reaction times of ambiguousI could be an indicator for variants:  The choice between an entrenched form and a form that is unlikely to be produced should be carried out fast whereas the choice between variants takes longer as two forms with equal function exist.\n\n2. preference in response behaviour\n\nThe choice between \"haben\" and \"sein\" depends on the transitivity of the sentences: In transitive sentences, only \"haben\" is possible. \"Sein\" is used in intransitive sentences if the verb is telic or refers to a motion. As the test verbs within the study are motion verbs, only \"sein\" should be chosen in the intransitive sentences. The opposite is expected for transitive sentences. Hence, no variation in response behaviour is expected for the prototypical transitive and intransitive sentences. The same is expected for ambiguousII based on the prestudy. For ambiguousI, variation in reponse behaviour is hypothesised. Based on the prestudy, a preference for \"sein\" over \"haben\" is expected with respect to ambiguousI. Originally, it was hypothesised that sentences in the periphery between the prototypes would show variation in response behaviour. For ambiguousI, a  preference for \"haben\" was expected, for ambiguousII a preference for \"sein\". \n\nIn the preregistration of the prestudy, it was also expected that participants might show a different response behaviour depending on the test verbs for the ambiguous-constructions, e.g. \"sein\" might be preferred for \"reiten\" 'to ride' in the ambiguous-I-condition, but \"haben\" for \"fahren\" 'to drive' in the same condition. This could be observed for \"reiten\" in the prestudy. As \"reiten\" not only elicited a different response behavior but also differing reaction times from the other test items, \"reiten\" will not be included into the confirmatory analysis, but only into the exploratory analysis (see Analysis Plan)."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled trials."}, "q6": {"extra": [], "value": ["For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to which they have been assigned."]}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q8": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "A within subject design is used with two factors (transitivity and inflection) with four (transitive, ambiguous I, ambiguous II, intransitive) and two levels (weak, strong), respectively. Within the levels of transitivity, three test words are used. Only two will be used in the confirmatory analysis, see statistical models. All three test words will be used in the exploratory analysis. The participants can choose between the auxiliaries \"hat\" and \"ist\" for each test word. The answer (hat/ist) as well as the reaction times are used for data analysis. \nNouns belonging to the so-called weak declension class in German are used within filler sentences. Here, participants have to choose between weak and strong genitive endings. These items are used as test items in a study on the influence of schemata on variation. Additionally, filler sentences with similar content as the test sentences are used. The whole study design distracts participants form the research interest, as participants always have to choose between two forms. Within the study, participants have to detect grammatical, semantic and orthographic deviations. \nTo test the design, forms containing errors in gender marking (der.Mask Kurier.Mask 'courier'/*die.Fem Lieferant.Mask 'delivery man') and in orthography (Schule/*Schuhle \u2018school\u2019) are included into the study as well as variants (Fahrrad fahren/fahrradfahren \u2018to ride a bike\u2019; fehlerlos/fehlerfrei \u2018without mistakes\u2019). For the two errors, a fast and clearly distributed response behaviour is expected. For the two variants, slow reaction times and an inconsistent response behaviour are hypothesised. Hence, the items allow to test, whether the design can elicit differences in reaction times in general. The design will only be tested if the test items show no differences in reaction times. \n\nIf the design needs to be tested, the following mixed linear model will be used: RT ~ Variante + (1+Variante|participant)+(1|item). Variante is the manipulated variable that contains two levels: Variante (fehlerlos/fehlerfrei; Fahrradfahren, Fahrrad fahren) and kVariante (Schule/*Schuhle; der Kurier/*die Lieferant). For the response behaviour, a generalized mixed linear model will be used: preferred form ~ Variante + (1+Variante|participant)+(1|item).\n\nPsychoPy3, version 3.1.5, (Peirce 2019) is used to implement the study. \n\nTest items\nThe verbs \"fahren\" \u2018to drive\u2019, \"reiten\" \u2018to ride\u2019 and \"fliegen\" \u2018to fly\u2019 are used as test items as they can be used with different degrees of transitivity. They are used in the following sentences:\n\nTransitive (object that is used as patient)\n\nEr sah, wie die Mutter die Kinder zur Schule gefahren hat/*ist.\nHe saw that the mother drove the children to the school.\n\nIch nehme an, dass der Pilot die Passagiere zum n\u00e4chstgelegenen Flughafen geflogen hat/*ist.\nI guess that the pilot flew the passengers to the closest airport.\n\nIch gehe davon aus, dass das M\u00e4dchen das Pferd zur Koppel geritten hat/*ist.\nI guess that the girl rode the horse to the paddock.\n\nAmbiguous I (object ambiguous between patient and instrument)\n\nEr erz\u00e4hlte mir, dass seine Tante eine Zeit lang ein Cabrio gefahren hat/ist.\nHe told me that his aunt drove a convertible for some time.\n\nIch kann kaum glauben, dass meine Schwester neulich einen Helikopter geflogen hat/ist.\nI cannot believe that my sister flew a helicopter the other day.\n\nMir wurde erz\u00e4hlt, dass mein Onkel fr\u00fcher ein schwarzes Pferd geritten hat/ist.\nI was told that my uncle rode a black horse in the past.\n\nAmbiguous II (ambiguous between object and adverbial)\n\nIn den Nachrichten sagten sie, dass der neue Fahrer die Strecke in Rekordzeit gefahren ist/hat.\nThey said in the news that the new driver drove the circuit in record time.\n\nIn der Zeitung stand, dass der Pilot die Distanz in Bestzeit geflogen ist/hat.\nI read in the newspapers that the pilot flew the distance in minimum time.\n\nIm Radio hie\u00df es, dass der Reiter den Parcours fehlerlos geritten ist/hat.\nThey said in the radio that the jockey rode the course without any mistakes.\n\nIntransitive (no object)\n\nIch ging davon aus, dass die Oma am Sonntag zur Kur gefahren ist/*hat.\nI thought that grandmother drove to the clinic on Sunday.\n\nIch wusste nicht, dass mein Bruder am Mittwoch in die USA geflogen ist/*hat.\nI did not know that my brother flew to the US on Wednesday.\n\nMeine Oma erz\u00e4hlte, dass sie in den Siebzigern regelm\u00e4\u00dfig durch den Schwarzwald geritten ist/*hat.\nMy grandmother told me that she was frequently horseback riding through the black forest in the seventies.\n\nThe test sentences were tested for their semantic plausibility. Except for one sentence, all test sentences were rated plausible (at least 3 on a scale from 1 (not plausible) to 5 (plausible), see the attached file (test sentences.csv) for details). Only the test sentence \"Mir wurde erz\u00e4hlt, dass mein Onkel fr\u00fcher ein schwarzes Pferd geritten hat\" had to be changed slightly. Originally, \"w\u00e4hrend des Studiums\" ('during his studies\u2018) was used instead of \"fr\u00fcher\" (\u2018in the past\u2019). As the rated plausibility of this sentence was rather low (2,7), \"w\u00e4hrend des Studiums\" was changed to \"fr\u00fcher\" so that the test sentence is more similar to the other test sentences containing \"reiten\" as test verb. Another slight change had to be made in the sentence containing \"Parcours\" ('course'): within the semantic pausibility test, the form \"Parkour\" was used which is normally not used in the context of horse back riding.\n\nThe attached file (stimulus file.csv) gives an overview over the stimuli and the filler items.

First of all, different degrees of transitivity influence which auxiliar is selected: Prototypical transitive sentences select \"haben\". Prototypical intransitive sentences select \"sein\" if the sentence is telic or contains a motion verb. Between the prototypes of intransitivity and transitivity, variation is possible, e.g., if the object is ambiguous between patient and instrument (e.g., Ich bin/habe vor 20 Jahren ein schwarzes Pferd geritten \u2018I used to ride a black horse twenty years ago\u2019). The influence of transitivity, telicity and motion verb semantics has been studied in corpora, e.g., by Gillmann (2016). Roehm et al. (2013) studied the influence of telicity on the auxiliar selection with respect to degree achievements (e.g. rosten, \u2018to rust\u2019) in an EEG study. However, to my knowledge, a psycholinguistic study examining the influence of transitivity on the auxiliar selection in German has not been carried out so far. \nThis study examines the influence of transitivity with the help of a sentence maze task. By studying the influence of transitivity, prototypicality effects should be visible, as the influence of transitivity seems to be organised between two prototypes (transitive vs. intransitive sentences) (Gillmann 2016: 302-305). Within a sentence maze task, participants are asked to build a sentence bit by bit. For each chunk of a sentence, participants choose between two options. Within the task, the verbs \"fahren\" 'to drive', \"reiten\" 'to ride' and \"fliegen\" 'to fly' are used in sentences with different degrees of transitivity: transitive (object is used as a patient), ambiguous I (object is ambiguous between patient and instrument), ambiguous II (sentence element is ambiguous between object and adverbial) and intransitive (no object). The participants have to choose between \"haben\" and \"sein\" as auxiliar for the main verbs (e.g., gefahren haben/sein). The test sentences are subordinate clauses so that the auxiliar is at the end of each sentence. ", "q4": "1. reaction times\n\nReaction times are low for prototypical intransitivity. For prototypical intransitivity, they are higher because the sentence is more complex than the intransitive sentence that does not contain an object. It is expected that ambigII elicits similar reaction times as transitive sentences. In contrast, ambigI is expected to elicit the highest reactions times. This hypotheses are based on the results of the prestudy (see data_prestudy_prototypicality.csv for the data and prestudy_prototypicality.R for the code analysing the data statistically). \nBefore analysing the data of the prestudy, a different pattern was expected: Reaction times were expected to be low for prototypical transitivity and prototypical intransitivity. For sentences in the periphery (ambiguous I and II), reaction times were expected to be high as both forms are theoretically possible (see https://osf.io/p5myx for the preregistration of the prestudy). \n\nIf the pattern of the prestudy is also visible in the main study, ambiguousII does not seem to be perceived as ambiguous (see also response behaviour) as the comparable reaction times to transitive sentences demonstrate. The reaction times elicited by transitive and ambiguousII sentences being higher than the reaction times elicited by intransitive sentences could be due to the higher complexity of these sentences compared to the intransitive test sentences. The increased reaction times of ambiguousI could be an indicator for variants:  The choice between an entrenched form and a form that is unlikely to be produced should be carried out fast whereas the choice between variants takes longer as two forms with equal function exist.\n\n2. preference in response behaviour\n\nThe choice between \"haben\" and \"sein\" depends on the transitivity of the sentences: In transitive sentences, only \"haben\" is possible. \"Sein\" is used in intransitive sentences if the verb is telic or refers to a motion. As the test verbs within the study are motion verbs, only \"sein\" should be chosen in the intransitive sentences. The opposite is expected for transitive sentences. Hence, no variation in response behaviour is expected for the prototypical transitive and intransitive sentences. The same is expected for ambiguousII based on the prestudy. For ambiguousI, variation in reponse behaviour is hypothesised. Based on the prestudy, a preference for \"sein\" over \"haben\" is expected with respect to ambiguousI. Originally, it was hypothesised that sentences in the periphery between the prototypes would show variation in response behaviour. For ambiguousI, a  preference for \"haben\" was expected, for ambiguousII a preference for \"sein\". \n\nIn the preregistration of the prestudy, it was also expected that participants might show a different response behaviour depending on the test verbs for the ambiguous-constructions, e.g. \"sein\" might be preferred for \"reiten\" 'to ride' in the ambiguous-I-condition, but \"haben\" for \"fahren\" 'to drive' in the same condition. This could be observed for \"reiten\" in the prestudy. As \"reiten\" not only elicited a different response behavior but also differing reaction times from the other test items, \"reiten\" will not be included into the confirmatory analysis, but only into the exploratory analysis (see Analysis Plan).", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

In the prestudy, 6 of 32 participants (19  %) had to be excluded due to missing meta data, response behaviour indicating a lack of concentration and reaction times above 3 sd of the mean reaction times for the level of a category (e.g., transitive).  However, participants were not excluded from counties in which \"sein\" is selected for position verbs. Hence, more data are collected in order to ensure that the targeted sample size of 50 is reached. The targeted 170 participants are also due to a study on schemata and frequency influencing the processing of masculine nouns belonging to the so called weak declension. The test items for the study on schemata and frequency are used as fillers in this study. For the study on schemata and frequency, 125 participants are needed, so that a total sample of 170 participants needs to be collected.

Within the levels of transitivity, three test words are used. Only two will be used in the confirmatory analysis, see statistical models. All three test words will be used in the exploratory analysis. The participants can choose between the auxiliaries \"hat\" and \"ist\" for each test word. The answer (hat/ist) as well as the reaction times are used for data analysis. \nNouns belonging to the so-called weak declension class in German are used within filler sentences. Here, participants have to choose between weak and strong genitive endings. These items are used as test items in a study on the influence of schemata on variation. Additionally, filler sentences with similar content as the test sentences are used. The whole study design distracts participants form the research interest, as participants always have to choose between two forms. Within the study, participants have to detect grammatical, semantic and orthographic deviations. \nTo test the design, forms containing errors in gender marking (der.Mask Kurier.Mask 'courier'/*die.Fem Lieferant.Mask 'delivery man') and in orthography (Schule/*Schuhle \u2018school\u2019) are included into the study as well as variants (Fahrrad fahren/fahrradfahren \u2018to ride a bike\u2019; fehlerlos/fehlerfrei \u2018without mistakes\u2019). For the two errors, a fast and clearly distributed response behaviour is expected. For the two variants, slow reaction times and an inconsistent response behaviour are hypothesised. Hence, the items allow to test, whether the design can elicit differences in reaction times in general. The design will only be tested if the test items show no differences in reaction times. \n\nIf the design needs to be tested, the following mixed linear model will be used: RT ~ Variante + (1+Variante|participant)+(1|item). Variante is the manipulated variable that contains two levels: Variante (fehlerlos/fehlerfrei; Fahrradfahren, Fahrrad fahren) and kVariante (Schule/*Schuhle; der Kurier/*die Lieferant). For the response behaviour, a generalized mixed linear model will be used: preferred form ~ Variante + (1+Variante|participant)+(1|item).\n\nPsychoPy3, version 3.1.5, (Peirce 2019) is used to implement the study. \n\nTest items\nThe verbs \"fahren\" \u2018to drive\u2019, \"reiten\" \u2018to ride\u2019 and \"fliegen\" \u2018to fly\u2019 are used as test items as they can be used with different degrees of transitivity. They are used in the following sentences:\n\nTransitive (object that is used as patient)\n\nEr sah, wie die Mutter die Kinder zur Schule gefahren hat/*ist.\nHe saw that the mother drove the children to the school.\n\nIch nehme an, dass der Pilot die Passagiere zum n\u00e4chstgelegenen Flughafen geflogen hat/*ist.\nI guess that the pilot flew the passengers to the closest airport.\n\nIch gehe davon aus, dass das M\u00e4dchen das Pferd zur Koppel geritten hat/*ist.\nI guess that the girl rode the horse to the paddock.\n\nAmbiguous I (object ambiguous between patient and instrument)\n\nEr erz\u00e4hlte mir, dass seine Tante eine Zeit lang ein Cabrio gefahren hat/ist.\nHe told me that his aunt drove a convertible for some time.\n\nIch kann kaum glauben, dass meine Schwester neulich einen Helikopter geflogen hat/ist.\nI cannot believe that my sister flew a helicopter the other day.\n\nMir wurde erz\u00e4hlt, dass mein Onkel fr\u00fcher ein schwarzes Pferd geritten hat/ist.\nI was told that my uncle rode a black horse in the past.\n\nAmbiguous II (ambiguous between object and adverbial)\n\nIn den Nachrichten sagten sie, dass der neue Fahrer die Strecke in Rekordzeit gefahren ist/hat.\nThey said in the news that the new driver drove the circuit in record time.\n\nIn der Zeitung stand, dass der Pilot die Distanz in Bestzeit geflogen ist/hat.\nI read in the newspapers that the pilot flew the distance in minimum time.\n\nIm Radio hie\u00df es, dass der Reiter den Parcours fehlerlos geritten ist/hat.\nThey said in the radio that the jockey rode the course without any mistakes.\n\nIntransitive (no object)\n\nIch ging davon aus, dass die Oma am Sonntag zur Kur gefahren ist/*hat.\nI thought that grandmother drove to the clinic on Sunday.\n\nIch wusste nicht, dass mein Bruder am Mittwoch in die USA geflogen ist/*hat.\nI did not know that my brother flew to the US on Wednesday.\n\nMeine Oma erz\u00e4hlte, dass sie in den Siebzigern regelm\u00e4\u00dfig durch den Schwarzwald geritten ist/*hat.\nMy grandmother told me that she was frequently horseback riding through the black forest in the seventies.\n\nThe test sentences were tested for their semantic plausibility. Except for one sentence, all test sentences were rated plausible (at least 3 on a scale from 1 (not plausible) to 5 (plausible), see the attached file (test sentences.csv) for details). Only the test sentence \"Mir wurde erz\u00e4hlt, dass mein Onkel fr\u00fcher ein schwarzes Pferd geritten hat\" had to be changed slightly. Originally, \"w\u00e4hrend des Studiums\" ('during his studies\u2018) was used instead of \"fr\u00fcher\" (\u2018in the past\u2019). As the rated plausibility of this sentence was rather low (2,7), \"w\u00e4hrend des Studiums\" was changed to \"fr\u00fcher\" so that the test sentence is more similar to the other test sentences containing \"reiten\" as test verb. Another slight change had to be made in the sentence containing \"Parcours\" ('course'): within the semantic pausibility test, the form \"Parkour\" was used which is normally not used in the context of horse back riding.\n\nThe attached file (stimulus file.csv) gives an overview over the stimuli and the filler items.

task"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Eleonore Schmitt"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "The influence of schemata on the inflection of masculine nouns in German has been well examined in corpora (K\u00f6pcke 1995, 2000a, 2000b, 2005, Sch\u00e4fer 2016). Prototypically, polysyllabic nouns stressed on the penultimate syllable ending with schwa and referring to human beings belong to the so-called weak declension class. Variation can be observed if a noun diverges from the formal (polysyllabic, stress on the penultimate syllable, schwa) or semantic (referring to human beings) features: These nouns vary between weak and strong forms. The strong declension class is the type frequent class concerning masculine nouns. \nAdditionally to the schema, token frequency influences whether a noun that is part of the type infrequent weak declension will stay in this class or chance to the type frequent class: Nouns with high token frequency show stable declension, nouns with low token frequency tend to vary between strong and weak forms (Sch\u00e4fer 2016).\n\nTo my knowledge, psycholinguistic studies concerning this topic are missing so far. Psycholinguistic studies on declension in German examine, e.g., the processing of regular and irregular plural forms (Penke and Krause 2002; Sonnenstuhl and Huth 2002) but do not examine effects of schemata. An exception to this is Schmitt (2019). Here, effects of schemata are examined with the help of a self-paced reading task using pseudo nouns. Schmitt (2019) could not measure differences between reading times for weak and strong genitive endings of the pseudo noun \"Schettose\" which perfectly matches the schema of the weak masculine class and thus should facilitate the processing of weak endings. An effect of schemata is therefore not observable in reading times. However, participants had a clear preference for the weak ending in the production task within the study. Hence, there seems to be conflicting evidence for effects of schemata. \n\nThis study examines effects of schema with the help of a sentence maze task. Within a sentence maze, participants are ask to build a sentence bit by bit. For each chunk of a sentence, participants choose between two options. In this task, participants choose between strong and weak genitive forms of real existing nouns (des Kollegen/des Kolleges 'the colleague.GEN'). The nouns belong to the schema to different extents: Nouns that match the schema completely are compared to nouns in the periphery of the schema. Additionally, nouns that are similar to the nouns in the periphery of the schema but do not belong to the weak declension class are included into the study. The animacy of the test nouns is held constant as all test nouns refer to human beings. The test nouns have a relative token frequency of max. 2 hits per million token."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "1. reaction times\n\nReaction times are fast for nouns in the periphery, but slow for nouns that prototypically match the schema and for nouns that are part of the strong declension class.This hypothesis is based on the results of a prestudy (see https://osf.io/eahgf for the preregistration of the prestudy, data_prestudy_schema_sentence.csv for the data and prestudy_schema_sentence.R for the code analysing the data). The difference between nouns in the periphery and the other test nouns is likely due to token frequency. The influence of token frequency was tried to be controlled (see study design), however, slight differences between the nouns could not be avoided. \nOriginally, it was hypothesised that the reaction times are fast for nouns that prototypically match the schema or do not belong to the weak declension class. In contrast, they were expected to be slow for nouns that are in the periphery of the schema. \n\nIf faster reaction times for the nouns in the periphery of the schema can be observed in the main study, this can be interpreted as an indicator for token frequencies having an higher impact on reaction times than schemata (see also Exploratory Analysis testing the influene of token frequency). If the opposite is true, the slightly differing token frequencies of the test nouns do not seem to have influenced the reaction times but differences in schematicity: As two forms are theoretically possible for nouns in the periphery of the schema, the reaction times are higher than for nouns where only one entrenchend form exists.\n\n2. preference in response behaviour\n\nThe choice between strong (-s) and weak (-n) endings depends on the form of the nouns: If the noun is compliant with the schema, -n is preferred. Nouns that do not belong to the weak declension class will show a preference for -s. Based on the prestudy, a preference for -n is hypothesised for the nouns in the periphery. As the participants see the new and less frequent ending next to the old and more frequent ending, they choose the more familiar and thus more frequent one. Originally, it was hypothesised that participants will vary between choosing -n and -s with respect to nouns  in the periphery of the schema."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled trials."}, "q6": {"extra": [], "value": ["For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to which they have been assigned."]}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q8": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "A within subject design is used with two factors (schematicity and inflection) with three levels (prototype of the schema, periphery of the schema, not belonging to the weak class) and two levels (weak, strong), respectively. Per level of schematicity, three test words are used. The participants can choose between the weak (-n) and the strong genitive form (-s) for the test words. The answer (-n/-s) as well as the reaction times are used for data analysis. Filler sentences are used with different degrees of transitivity where participants need to choose the auxiliary (ist/hat). These items are used as test items for a study on effects of prototypicality on variation. Additionally, filler sentences with similar content as the test sentences are used. The whole study design distracts participants from the research interest, as participants always have to choose between two forms. Within the study, participants have to detect grammatical, semantic and orthographic deviations. \n\nTo test the design, forms containing errors in gender marking (der.Mask Kurier.Mask 'courier'/*die.Fem Lieferant.Mask 'delivery man')  and in orthography (Schule/*Schuhle \u2018school\u2019) are included into the study as well as variants (Fahrrad fahren/fahrradfahren \u2018to ride a bike\u2019; fehlerlos/fehlerfrei \u2018without mistakes\u2019).  For the two errors, a fast and clearly distributed response behaviour is expected. For the two variants, slow reaction times and an inconsistent response behaviour are hypothesised. Hence, the items allow to test, whether the design can elicit differences in reaction times in general. The design will only be tested if the test items show no differences in reaction times. \n\nIf the design needs to be tested, the following mixed linear model will be used: RT ~ Variante + (1+Variante|participant)+(1|item). Variante is the manipulated variable that contains two levels: Variante (fehlerlos/fehlerfrei; Fahrradfahren, Fahrrad fahren) and kVariante (Schule/*Schuhle; der Kurier/*die Lieferant). For the response behaviour, a generalized mixed linear model will be used: preferred form ~ Variante + (1+Variante|participant)+(1|item).\n\nPsychoPy3, version 3.1.5, (Peirce 2019) is used to implement the study. \n\nTest items\n\nPrototype of the schema: Kollege \u2018colleague\u2019, Neffe \u2018nephew\u2018, Sch\u00fctze \u2018marksman\u2018\n\nPeriphery of the schema: Graf \u2018count\u2019, Held \u2018hero\u2019, Zar \u2018tsar\u2019\n\nNot belonging to the weak declension class: Dieb \u2018thief\u2019, Freund \u2018friend\u2019, Vogt  \u2018reeve\u2019\n\nIn order to avoid frequency effects, nouns are used that have a frequency of up to two hits per million tokens in 2018. The reported frequencies are based on the word frequencies provided by the Digital Dictionary of the German Language (Digitales W\u00f6rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache, Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften). However, there are slight differences in frequency within the test words. Two nouns that prototypically match the schema have a relative frequency of 0.4 (\"des Sch\u00fctzen\") and 0.6 (\"des Kollegen\") hits per million tokens but \"des Neffen\" is less frequent (0.05 hits per million tokens). The words that are in the periphery of the schema have a frequency of 0.4 to 0.5 hits per million tokens. One of the words not belonging to the weak class is similar frequent (\"des Freundes\", 0.3 hits per million tokens), but the other two are less frequent (up to 0.04 hits per million tokens). Hence, the nouns not belonging to the weak declension class tend to be less frequent than the other test words. However, \"des Neffen\", belonging to prototype of the schema, is comparable infrequent. All in all, the token frequencies of the test words are on a comparable level. Nonetheless, they seem to have an influence on reaction times (see Hypotheses and Exploratory Analysis). See the attachment (test nouns.csv) for an overview over the test words and their relative frequencies.\n \nThe frequency of the forms is estimated using the word frequencies provided by the Digital Dictionary of the German Language (Digitales W\u00f6rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache, Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften). Test nouns are searched in the genitive singular (with the more frequently used ending). In order to avoid false positives, determiners are used in the search (e.g. @des @Kollegen \u2018the colleague\u2019).\n\nThe test words are used in the following sentences:\n\nIch nehme an, dass die Arbeit meines Kollegen/*Kolleges wertgesch\u00e4tzt wird.\nI guess that the work of my colleague is acknowledged.\n\nIch habe gesehen, wie der Pfeil des Sch\u00fctzen/*Sch\u00fctzes ins Schwarze traf.\nI saw that the shooter\u2019s arrow hit the mark.\n\nMein Freund war nicht da, weil er zum Geburtstag seines Neffen/*Neffes gegangen ist.\nMy friend was not there because he went to his nephew\u2019s birthday.\n\nMein Neffe mag Superman nicht, weil ihm der Anzug des Helden/Helds nicht gef\u00e4llt.\nMy nephew does not like superman because he does not like the hero\u2019s suit. \n\nSie konnte nicht fassen, dass das Anwesen des Grafen/Grafs so gro\u00df ist wie ein Schloss.\nShe could not believe that the count\u2019s estate is as big as a castle.\n\nIhm war nicht bewusst, dass die Macht des Zaren/Zars einmal derart gro\u00df gewesen ist.\nHe did not know that the power of the tsar had once been so great. \n\nEr f\u00e4hrt nochmal zur\u00fcck, weil er die Jacke seines Freundes/*Freunden aus Versehen eingesteckt hat und dieser sie auf der Arbeit ben\u00f6tigt.\nHe drives back again because he accidentally took the jacket of his friend and his friend needs the jacket at work.\n\nDer Krimi-Fan ahnt schon fr\u00fch, dass der Plan des Diebes/*Dieben zu simpel ist und nicht klappt.\nThe fan of thrillers will know early on that the thief\u2019s plan is too simple and will not work.\n\nEr macht einen Ausflug, um die Burg des Vogts/*Vogten zu betrachten.\nHe arranged an excursion so that he could see the reeve\u2019s fort. \n\nThe sentences were tested for their semantic plausibility. All test items were rated plausible: at least 3 on a scale from 1 (not plausible) to 5 (plausible), see the attachment (test sentences.csv) for details. Only one sentence was slightly modified after the semantic plausibility test. Originally, instead of \"wertgesch\u00e4tzt\" \"gewertsch\u00e4tzt\" was used.\n\nThe attached file (stimulus file.csv) gives an overview over the stimuli and the filler items.

Prototypically, polysyllabic nouns stressed on the penultimate syllable ending with schwa and referring to human beings belong to the so-called weak declension class. Variation can be observed if a noun diverges from the formal (polysyllabic, stress on the penultimate syllable, schwa) or semantic (referring to human beings) features: These nouns vary between weak and strong forms. The strong declension class is the type frequent class concerning masculine nouns. \nAdditionally to the schema, token frequency influences whether a noun that is part of the type infrequent weak declension will stay in this class or chance to the type frequent class: Nouns with high token frequency show stable declension, nouns with low token frequency tend to vary between strong and weak forms (Sch\u00e4fer 2016).\n\nTo my knowledge, psycholinguistic studies concerning this topic are missing so far. Psycholinguistic studies on declension in German examine, e.g., the processing of regular and irregular plural forms (Penke and Krause 2002; Sonnenstuhl and Huth 2002) but do not examine effects of schemata. An exception to this is Schmitt (2019). Here, effects of schemata are examined with the help of a self-paced reading task using pseudo nouns. Schmitt (2019) could not measure differences between reading times for weak and strong genitive endings of the pseudo noun \"Schettose\" which perfectly matches the schema of the weak masculine class and thus should facilitate the processing of weak endings. An effect of schemata is therefore not observable in reading times. However, participants had a clear preference for the weak ending in the production task within the study. Hence, there seems to be conflicting evidence for effects of schemata. \n\nThis study examines effects of schema with the help of a sentence maze task. Within a sentence maze, participants are ask to build a sentence bit by bit. For each chunk of a sentence, participants choose between two options. In this task, participants choose between strong and weak genitive forms of real existing nouns (des Kollegen/des Kolleges 'the colleague.GEN'). The nouns belong to the schema to different extents: Nouns that match the schema completely are compared to nouns in the periphery of the schema. Additionally, nouns that are similar to the nouns in the periphery of the schema but do not belong to the weak declension class are included into the study. The animacy of the test nouns is held constant as all test nouns refer to human beings. The test nouns have a relative token frequency of max. 2 hits per million token.", "q4": "1. reaction times\n\nReaction times are fast for nouns in the periphery, but slow for nouns that prototypically match the schema and for nouns that are part of the strong declension class.This hypothesis is based on the results of a prestudy (see https://osf.io/eahgf for the preregistration of the prestudy, data_prestudy_schema_sentence.csv for the data and prestudy_schema_sentence.R for the code analysing the data). The difference between nouns in the periphery and the other test nouns is likely due to token frequency. The influence of token frequency was tried to be controlled (see study design), however, slight differences between the nouns could not be avoided. \nOriginally, it was hypothesised that the reaction times are fast for nouns that prototypically match the schema or do not belong to the weak declension class. In contrast, they were expected to be slow for nouns that are in the periphery of the schema. \n\nIf faster reaction times for the nouns in the periphery of the schema can be observed in the main study, this can be interpreted as an indicator for token frequencies having an higher impact on reaction times than schemata (see also Exploratory Analysis testing the influene of token frequency). If the opposite is true, the slightly differing token frequencies of the test nouns do not seem to have influenced the reaction times but differences in schematicity: As two forms are theoretically possible for nouns in the periphery of the schema, the reaction times are higher than for nouns where only one entrenchend form exists.\n\n2. preference in response behaviour\n\nThe choice between strong (-s) and weak (-n) endings depends on the form of the nouns: If the noun is compliant with the schema, -n is preferred. Nouns that do not belong to the weak declension class will show a preference for -s. Based on the prestudy, a preference for -n is hypothesised for the nouns in the periphery. As the participants see the new and less frequent ending next to the old and more frequent ending, they choose the more familiar and thus more frequent one. Originally, it was hypothesised that participants will vary between choosing -n and -s with respect to nouns  in the periphery of the schema.", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Per level of schematicity, three test words are used. The participants can choose between the weak (-n) and the strong genitive form (-s) for the test words. The answer (-n/-s) as well as the reaction times are used for data analysis. Filler sentences are used with different degrees of transitivity where participants need to choose the auxiliary (ist/hat). These items are used as test items for a study on effects of prototypicality on variation. Additionally, filler sentences with similar content as the test sentences are used. The whole study design distracts participants from the research interest, as participants always have to choose between two forms. Within the study, participants have to detect grammatical, semantic and orthographic deviations. \n\nTo test the design, forms containing errors in gender marking (der.Mask Kurier.Mask 'courier'/*die.Fem Lieferant.Mask 'delivery man')  and in orthography (Schule/*Schuhle \u2018school\u2019) are included into the study as well as variants (Fahrrad fahren/fahrradfahren \u2018to ride a bike\u2019; fehlerlos/fehlerfrei \u2018without mistakes\u2019).  For the two errors, a fast and clearly distributed response behaviour is expected. For the two variants, slow reaction times and an inconsistent response behaviour are hypothesised. Hence, the items allow to test, whether the design can elicit differences in reaction times in general. The design will only be tested if the test items show no differences in reaction times. \n\nIf the design needs to be tested, the following mixed linear model will be used: RT ~ Variante + (1+Variante|participant)+(1|item). Variante is the manipulated variable that contains two levels: Variante (fehlerlos/fehlerfrei; Fahrradfahren, Fahrrad fahren) and kVariante (Schule/*Schuhle; der Kurier/*die Lieferant). For the response behaviour, a generalized mixed linear model will be used: preferred form ~ Variante + (1+Variante|participant)+(1|item).\n\nPsychoPy3, version 3.1.5, (Peirce 2019) is used to implement the study. \n\nTest items\n\nPrototype of the schema: Kollege \u2018colleague\u2019, Neffe \u2018nephew\u2018, Sch\u00fctze \u2018marksman\u2018\n\nPeriphery of the schema: Graf \u2018count\u2019, Held \u2018hero\u2019, Zar \u2018tsar\u2019\n\nNot belonging to the weak declension class: Dieb \u2018thief\u2019, Freund \u2018friend\u2019, Vogt  \u2018reeve\u2019\n\nIn order to avoid frequency effects, nouns are used that have a frequency of up to two hits per million tokens in 2018. The reported frequencies are based on the word frequencies provided by the Digital Dictionary of the German Language (Digitales W\u00f6rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache, Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften). However, there are slight differences in frequency within the test words. Two nouns that prototypically match the schema have a relative frequency of 0.4 (\"des Sch\u00fctzen\") and 0.6 (\"des Kollegen\") hits per million tokens but \"des Neffen\" is less frequent (0.05 hits per million tokens). The words that are in the periphery of the schema have a frequency of 0.4 to 0.5 hits per million tokens. One of the words not belonging to the weak class is similar frequent (\"des Freundes\", 0.3 hits per million tokens), but the other two are less frequent (up to 0.04 hits per million tokens). Hence, the nouns not belonging to the weak declension class tend to be less frequent than the other test words. However, \"des Neffen\", belonging to prototype of the schema, is comparable infrequent. All in all, the token frequencies of the test words are on a comparable level. Nonetheless, they seem to have an influence on reaction times (see Hypotheses and Exploratory Analysis). See the attachment (test nouns.csv) for an overview over the test words and their relative frequencies.\n \nThe frequency of the forms is estimated using the word frequencies provided by the Digital Dictionary of the German Language (Digitales W\u00f6rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache, Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften). Test nouns are searched in the genitive singular (with the more frequently used ending). In order to avoid false positives, determiners are used in the search (e.g. @des @Kollegen \u2018the colleague\u2019).\n\nThe test words are used in the following sentences:\n\nIch nehme an, dass die Arbeit meines Kollegen/*Kolleges wertgesch\u00e4tzt wird.\nI guess that the work of my colleague is acknowledged.\n\nIch habe gesehen, wie der Pfeil des Sch\u00fctzen/*Sch\u00fctzes ins Schwarze traf.\nI saw that the shooter\u2019s arrow hit the mark.\n\nMein Freund war nicht da, weil er zum Geburtstag seines Neffen/*Neffes gegangen ist.\nMy friend was not there because he went to his nephew\u2019s birthday.\n\nMein Neffe mag Superman nicht, weil ihm der Anzug des Helden/Helds nicht gef\u00e4llt.\nMy nephew does not like superman because he does not like the hero\u2019s suit. \n\nSie konnte nicht fassen, dass das Anwesen des Grafen/Grafs so gro\u00df ist wie ein Schloss.\nShe could not believe that the count\u2019s estate is as big as a castle.\n\nIhm war nicht bewusst, dass die Macht des Zaren/Zars einmal derart gro\u00df gewesen ist.\nHe did not know that the power of the tsar had once been so great. \n\nEr f\u00e4hrt nochmal zur\u00fcck, weil er die Jacke seines Freundes/*Freunden aus Versehen eingesteckt hat und dieser sie auf der Arbeit ben\u00f6tigt.\nHe drives back again because he accidentally took the jacket of his friend and his friend needs the jacket at work.\n\nDer Krimi-Fan ahnt schon fr\u00fch, dass der Plan des Diebes/*Dieben zu simpel ist und nicht klappt.\nThe fan of thrillers will know early on that the thief\u2019s plan is too simple and will not work.\n\nEr macht einen Ausflug, um die Burg des Vogts/*Vogten zu betrachten.\nHe arranged an excursion so that he could see the reeve\u2019s fort. \n\nThe sentences were tested for their semantic plausibility. All test items were rated plausible: at least 3 on a scale from 1 (not plausible) to 5 (plausible), see the attachment (test sentences.csv) for details. Only one sentence was slightly modified after the semantic plausibility test. Originally, instead of \"wertgesch\u00e4tzt\" \"gewertsch\u00e4tzt\" was used.\n\nThe attached file (stimulus file.csv) gives an overview over the stimuli and the filler items. The file contains the following columns:\n\nStimulus_Art: \nunique coding for each stimulus \t\n\nVerwendung: \ncoding for the test nouns, levels: Schema, Peripherie, nichtschwach\ncoding for the items testing the design, levels: nVariante (no variant), Variante (variant)\ncoding for the test auxiliaries, levels: trans,ambigI,ambigII, intrans  (not relevant for this study) \n\nItem: \nnaming the test items in their base form (test nouns; main verbs (not relevant for this study))\n\nEvaluation: \n\"ev\" highlights the items evaluating the concentration of the participants (if over 10 % of the items have been answered wrong, participant will be excluded)\t\n\nakzeptierteForm: \nstating which of the forms is expected to be accepted (only for test items), levels: n/s/both; ist/hat/both (not relevant for this study)\n\nElement_richtig: \nstating the correct element \n\nElement_Alternative: \nstating the alternative\n\nBlock: \nblock in which the item is presented\t\n\nPositionimBlock: \nposition within the block\n\nElementA: \nstating ElementA (presented at the left)\n\nElementA_pr\u00e4f: \nstating whether ElementA is preferred over ElementB; levels: j (yes), n (no)\n\nElementB: \nstating ElementB (presented at the right)\n\nElementB_pr\u00e4f: \nstating whether ElementB is preferred over ElementA;  levels: j (yes), n (no)\n\ncorrectKey: \ncorrect response key (based on ElementA_pr\u00e4f and ElementB_pr\u00e4f); levels: f (Element A preferred); j (Element B preferred)\n\nFurther explanation for \"correctKey\": For items which are considered variants, \"correctKey\" was not specified. For these items \"ElementA_pr\u00e4f\" and \"ElementB_pr\u00e4f\" are both coded with j. Note that some filler items (like \"dass/das\"; \"seid/seit\") are not variants but are often confused so that both forms were coded as acceptable.\n\nFurther explanation to \"Element_richtig\" and \"Element_Alternative\": These columns are not used for the analysis of the data. Their only purpose is to help the user to spot the correct and alternative forms in the design more easily. For items that are considered variants, \"Element_richtig\" and \"Element_Alternative\" are also stated. The variants were assigned randomly to \"Element_richtig\" and \"Element_Alterantive\", as both forms are equally likely to be accepted. They are only used in these columns so that the test sentences can be read completely. In the relevant columns (ElementA_pr\u00e4f/ElementB_pr\u00e4f, correctKey), these items are coded as variants (ElementA_pr\u00e4f and ElementB_pr\u00e4f are coded with j; correctKey is not specified).", "q8.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e15d8d257341902a88054aa", "file_name": "test nouns.csv", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/bhxpz/files/osfstorage/5e15d8d257341902a88054aa", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e15d8d257341902a88054aa"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "17606047abc7afc16cb800f003447980037545bd685e27c41ead74a71586cae9"}}, {"file_id": "5e15d8d157341902a88054a5", "file_name": "stimulus file.csv", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/bhxpz/files/osfstorage/5e15d8d157341902a88054a5", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e15d8d157341902a88054a5"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "178af567cbc420aa731d1fbed40236884dfaae709d2d84aa6c88e5877f07d8ab"}}, {"file_id": "5e15d8d257341902a88054a8", "file_name": "test sentences.csv", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/bhxpz/files/osfstorage/5e15d8d257341902a88054a8", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e15d8d257341902a88054a8"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "f09b09e8718f6799aaccccef59e31e207e936f05de51d391047b788e19630f65"}}], "q12.question": "Participants will be recruited by asking teachers at German universities to distribute the study among their students.

Similarly, depressive illness and depressive symptoms have also been found to adversely affect maternal-foetal attachment. However, it is not clear if depressive symptoms significantly exacerbate the association between childhood trauma and poorer quality foetal attachment during pregnancy.

Higher scores are indicative of more pronounced depressive symptoms. \nLastly, maternal adverse childhood experiences (independent variable) were assessed using the World Health Organisation's Adverse Childhood Experiences - International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ), which contains 19 items pertaining to the experiences of traumatic events, including physical and emotional neglect and abuse.
