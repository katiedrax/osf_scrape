testimony of a rape victim when it was presented chronologically or with the rape event first. Participants\u2019 evaluations (i.e., whether the events described in the testimony depicted rape or consensual sex) were measured every second as they watched the video of the victim testifying by moving a slider along a scale. Using this design, we investigated how participants evaluated the overall testimony by recording the position of the slider at the end of the video. We also investigated how participants evaluated specific events described in this testimony (i.e., the rape event), by recording the position of the slider during certain parts of the video. Contrary to our predictions, participants in both testimony conditions did not differ in how they evaluated the overall testimony. However, participants who watched the testimony where the rape event was presented first evaluated this event as more depictive of rape compared to those who watched the testimony presented in a chronological order. This result suggests that participants who watched the rape event first testimony may be thinking about this information differently, compared to those who watched the chronological testimony (Sherman, Lee, Bessenoff, &amp; Frost, 1998).\n\nAdditionally, the results of this study showed that the order in which the testimony was presented to participants influenced the variability in their responses regarding whether the events described by the victim were evaluated as rape or consensual sex. When the testimony was presented chronologically, participants moved the slider less often and less extremely between perceiving the testimony as depicting consensual sex or rape. In contrast, participants were far less consistent when the rape event was presented first in the testimony \u2013 that is, participants were much more variable in their responses using the slider. We interpret this difference in variation through the lens of the story model, which suggests that when events are presented chronologically in a trial, jurors find it easier to mentally organise these events into a story structure (Pennington &amp; Hastie, 1988). Therefore, participants\u2019 evaluations may have converged in the chronological testimony as the events were presented in a story format. This format may have allowed participants to make better sense of the testimony as it would have helped them mentally organise the described events into a coherent story (Pennington &amp; Hastie, 1988). In contrast, participants who watched the testimony where the rape event (or the logical end to the story) was presented first may have been unable to organise the events into a coherent story. This lack of coherence may have led participants to feeling less certain as to whether the described events depicted rape or consensual sex. These unexpected results require further research to understand how participants are evaluating the events described in the victim\u2019s testimony. \n\nThe aim of the current study is the replicate the pattern of results revealed in the first study by asking participants to evaluate whether the events described by the victim depict rape or consensual sex (i.e., by responding with the same slider used in the first study). Further, we will investigate whether presenting the rape event first will cause participants to think about this event differently to those who watch the same testimony presented in chronological order. According to the Encoding Flexibility Model (Sherman et al., 1998), perceivers thoroughly encode the details of information that is inconsistent with their schemas. In contrast, perceivers tend to only remember the overall gist of information that is consistent with their schemas. Thus, we will assess participants\u2019 memory of the specific details disclosed in the victim\u2019s testimony to test whether they encode the rape event as schema consistent or inconsistent information.  \n\nThis study will also investigate whether presenting the rape event first in the victim\u2019s testimony will influence how participants mentally organise the events described by the victim. Research shows that mock jurors are more persuaded when legal counsels present their evidence in a chronological order, as it organises this information for the juror into a coherent story (Pennington &amp; Hastie, 1988).
