A solar lighting system consists of solar panels and portable batteries. During the day, the solar panels are used to charge the batteries. At night, the vendors who are served by a given solar lighting system can use their individual battery to charge two bright LED lights. The solar lighting system is partially funded from grant money provided by researchers. However, each vendor must pay a small monthly fee to the company for supplying the company. Since some vendors in a treatment marketplace may refuse to sign up to solar lighting, the provision of a solar lighting system will be considered an ``intent to treat.'' Based on previous experience, however, we expect the vast majority of street vendors within any given marketplace to sign up to the solar lighting system. Vendors also have the option of discontinuing their participation in the study at anytime. The solar lighting intervention is implemented in collaboration with a local non-governmental organization, Nidan. The solar technology is provided by a local service company, Power Green. The sample for the study comprises a sub-sample of 51 marketplaces in Patna, the capital city of Bihar, and the nearby town of Hajibur. Our NGO partner NIDAN has extensive experience working with these marketplaces and compiled the list of marketplaces based on its own survey conducted in 2010. We exclude marketplaces that have a reliable electricity connection or are too small for the solar lighting systems, which each serve 24 vendors at a time. These marketplaces are representative of the diversity of the vendor population living in the state of Bihar, though we are not aware of comprehensive national India data with which to compare our study population. Since some of the marketplaces are very large, we break them into natural clusters of vendors to increase the statistical power of the analysis. A natural cluster is defined as a group of geographically concentrated vendors who are in competition with each other for customers. We use natural clusters, instead of arbitrary subgroups of vendors, to avoid spillovers between treated and untreated clusters. We expect to provide solar lighting to 720 street vendors in 30 treated vendor clusters. We will survey a random sample of 500 of these vendors as our treatment group and another random sample of 500 street vendors from other clusters as a control group. Our goal is to have 40-50 control clusters, depending on feasibility. While the study unit is a firm, the randomization is clustered at the marketplace level. We use simple randomization to assign marketplaces to either treatment or control status using a random number generator. The rollout of the panels will begin in February 2014. Power Green will assume responsibility for the on-site installation and maintenance of the panels throughout the project implementation period of 12 months. Following the conclusion of the study in January 2015, vendors in the treatment group will be allowed to continue utilizing the lighting systems if they so wish.

As a rule, what a candidate \u201csays in today\u2019s campaign is an uncertain guide to his actions after he takes office,\u201d as Enelow and Munger (1993) put it. Without track records, campaign promises become even more uncertain guides to post-election behavior. Drawing from Downs (1957) and spatial theory, Enelow and Munger conceptualize credibility as a type of reliability, which they define as a measure of whether policy statements made during a campaign can be used to predict post-election policy. This definition of the credibility of a politician is similar to the social psychology literature\u2019s conception of source credibility, which has been long associated with expertise and trustworthiness (see, for instance, a vast literature including Hovland and Weiss, 1951; Dholakia and Sternthal 1977; Wiener and Mowen, 1986; and Pornpitakpan, 2004, among many others). According to Pornpitakpan, expertise refers to the \u201cextent to which a speaker is perceived to be capable of making correct assertions\u201d whereas trustworthiness refers to \u201cthe degree to which an audience perceives the assertions made by a communicator to be ones that the speaker considers valid\u201d (244). On one hand, as one group of scholars has hypothesized (see Keefer and Vlaicu, 2008; Robinson and Verdier, 2013; Hanusch and Keefer, 2012), a politician can overcome this \u201ccredibility deficit\u201d through long-term investments in building up a reputation of trustworthiness and expertise, which can be established by expending resources to reach out to voters, keeping his word, pursuing sound policies, and allowing voters to monitor their performance. However, this strategy requires integrity, skill, luck, and most importantly, time. On the other hand, a politician can also close this credibility deficit by outsourcing the task to an intermediary who already has credibility in a given population (relying on local-level patrons) and by supplying resources to these patrons and voters before the election even happens (buying votes). This latter strategy could be especially effective in many cases, according to the high-discount-rate view of clientelism. Those who subscribe to this view state that voters\u2014especially poor ones\u2014are extremely skeptical of the value of promised programs when they are voting because they are uncertain that these programs will actually come into being and/or will actually help them in practice. In other words, they expect to receive much fewer benefits from programs in actuality than the politician promoting them promises. As such, voters are often willing to decide their votes on the basis of minor gifts given to them before the election rather than a candidate\u2019s policy promises (see, for example, Brusco, Nazareno and Stokes, 2004; Scott, 1969). This situation relates directly to Latin America, especially Brazil, which has seen a rapid decrease in clientelist practices (e.g., vote buying and patronage) in the North and Northeast over the past ten years, as Brazilian democracy has become more established and its parties and politicians (especially Luiz In\u00e1cio \u201cLula\u201d da Silva and his Partido dos Trabalhadores) have established a certain degree of credibility. In other words, these scholars would argue that politicians had to rely on intermediaries and clientelism to overcome a credibility deficit in the North and Northeast when Brazil was a young democracy, but that certain left-wing programmatic (policy-oriented, as opposed to clientelism- or patronage-oriented) politicians, such as Lula, were able to eventually establish solid reputations of expertise and trustworthiness after a certain amount of time. Once politicians like Lula were able to establish credibility, they were able to compete with clientelist parties in the North and Northeast, leading to clientelism\u2019s decline in these areas. The problem, however, is that even if Lula and his party gained a significant amount of credibility over the last ten years, a number of other things also happened at the same time that could also have led to a decline in clientelism in North and Northeast Brazil. For instance, an increase in the credibility of parties\u2019 programmatic promises coincided with a rise in income among nordestinos (northeasterners), which might, in turn, have led to an increase in the credibility of the parties\u2019 policy promises. As such, many possible causes could be endogenous to one another, making it very difficult to disentangle these causes from one another and determine which one explains the most. As a result, I intend to determine whether credibility makes voters more likely to select programmatic options experimentally manipulating the credibility (or reliability, in Enelow and Munger\u2019s words) of a hypothetical political candidate and seeing whether this manipulation affects voters\u2019 willingness to support a programmatic candidate.\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"My dependent variable is the likelihood that a given voter votes for a given political candidate (the candidate whose credibility will be varied during the experiment).

The first prompt would introduce a hypothetical situation in which respondents would have to vote for the mayor of Austin out of two fictitious options. Upon indicating that he/she had read the prompt, the respondent would then advance to a page with two blocks of text. On one half of the screen would be a piece of text explaining that one candidate has stated that he feels that public transportation services are important for Austin and would make improving them his number one priority in office. In other words, this candidate would make a neutral pledge without any indication of either credibility or a lack thereof. On the other half of the screen would appear text indicating that the second candidate was promising to implement a bus fare policy that he says would save the respondent $10 per month if he was elected. The order in which these candidates are shown would be randomized (i.e., it would be random which candidate would be Candidate A and which candidate would be Candidate B). The respondent would then select who he/she would vote for. After the treatment was assigned, several other questions would be asked to the participants.

The main hypotheses and sub-hypotheses are the following: 1) Political violence is used to signal certain candidate traits that are desirable to voters. 1a) Political violence is used to signal that candidates are willing and able to provide private goods to voters (or co-ethnics in particular). 1b) Political violence is used to signal that candidates are more likely to be strong and/or effective leaders across a range of issues (e.g. public goods provision, security, managing the bureaucracy, etc.). 1c) Political violence only signals positive traits to co-ethnic voters. 2) Political violence is used to coerce or intimidate voters in order to influence whether they vote and who they vote for. 2a) Voters see past violence on the part of candidates as predictive of future violent behavior. 2b) Violence increases the likelihood of voting for a candidate because of fear of retaliation. 2c) Violence decreases turnout among supporters of opposing candidates (mainly non-co-ethnics). 3) Political violence is used to generate support among co-ethnics because members of an ethnic group receive some expressive benefit from violence against a hated out-group. 4) Political violence is used to increase the salience of particular ethnic identities or cleavages. 5) Political violence is used to increase publicity or name recognition. 6) Political violence is used to impress and increase support among party leaders. 7) Political violence occurs as a side effect of heated ethnic campaign rhetoric that is useful in rallying co-ethnic support. 8a) Voters are more accepting of violence on the part of co-ethnic candidates than non-co-ethnic candidates. 8b) Voters are more likely to believe non-co-ethnics to be responsible for political violence than co-ethnics. 9) Violence that is framed as defensive is viewed more positively than violence that is framed as offensive, particularly among co-ethnics. 10) Voters prefer co-ethnic candidates. 10a) Voters prefer co-ethnic candidates because they believe they are more likely to deliver targeted goods. 10b) Voters prefer co-ethnic candidates because they believe they are more likely to be strong and/or effective leaders across a range of issues (e.g. public goods provision, security, managing the bureaucracy, etc.). A previous version of the survey experiment generated evidence against hypotheses 1b, 2b, 2c, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and generated evidence for hypotheses 1a, 2a, 8a, 10a, and 10b. The upcoming study will attempt to replicate the initial findings as well as test new hypotheses (7, 8b, 9) that were generated as a result of the initial survey experiment and qualitative research.\""}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "\"I plan to test the above hypotheses with a survey experiment that contains three experiments. The first is a conjoint analysis that randomly varies different characteristics of two prospective candidates, including their ethnicity, their record of public goods provision, and their history of violence. Follow-up questions will ask which candidate respondents prefer and their level of support (ranging from 1 to 10) for each. This experiment will test which factors (ethnicity, record of public goods provision, history of violence) are most important in Kenyans\u2019 voting decisions and whether there are interactions between these factors. Analysis will be done using difference of means between different treatment conditions (i.e. different combinations of characteristics). For example, I will conduct difference of means for the candidate support outcome between candidates with and without a history of violence; between candidates with different records of public goods provision; between candidates that are or are not ethnic matches with the respondent; and possibly between candidates with different interactions of characteristics (e.g. between violent and non-violent co-ethnic candidates). The second experiment\u2014which will test hypotheses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10\u2014randomly varies a description of a potential candidate for office with respect to the candidate\u2019s ethnicity and history of violence in order to see how violence (and its interaction with ethnicity) shapes voters\u2019 perceptions of candidates for office. In particular, respondents are randomly assigned to hear about a candidate with four possible histories of violence: a candidate with no history of violence; a candidate whose last election was characterized by ethnic violence (with no information about who was responsible); a candidate who provided youths with weapons in order to attack other tribes; and a candidate who provided youths with weapons in order to defend against attacks from other tribes. In addition, the ethnicity of the candidate is randomly assigned, so that some candidates are respondents\u2019 co-ethnics while others are not. All analysis of the experiments\u2019 outcomes will be done using difference of means between the different treatment conditions. If Hypothesis 1a is true, candidates in at least one of the conditions in which they are attributed with violence (offensive or defensive) should have significantly higher mean values on questions 28-31. If Hypothesis 1c is true, this may only be the case for co-ethnic candidates. If Hypothesis 1b is true, candidates in at least one of the conditions in which they are attributed with violence (offensive or defensive) should have significantly higher mean values on at least some of questions 32-33 and 38-48. If Hypothesis 1c is true, this may only be the case for co-ethnic candidates. If Hypothesis 2a is true, candidates in the conditions in which they are attributed with violence (and perhaps the condition in which their last election was characterized by unattributed violence) should have significantly higher mean values on at least some of questions 34-37. If Hypothesis 2b is true, candidates in the conditions in which they are attributed with violence should have significantly higher mean values on at least some of questions 24a, 25a, and 27, and answers to questions 24b and 25b should indicate some fear of retaliatory violence as a rationale. If Hypothesis 2c is true, candidates in the conditions in which they are attributed with violence should have a significantly lower mean value on question 23a (but only for non-co-ethnics), and answers to question 24b should indicate some fear of violence as a rationale. If Hypothesis 4 is true, respondents in any of the violence conditions (and, most strongly, the co-ethnic candidate, defensive violence condition) should have a higher mean value on trust in their own tribe (q52), feel more a member of their tribe than Kenyan (q54), agree more with Statement 1 than Statement 2 on question 55, and have a higher mean value on question 58. They should have a lower mean value of trust in other tribes (q53). If Hypothesis 5 is true, respondents should be more likely to remember the name of the candidate in the vignette (q49). If Hypothesis 6 is true, candidate in the conditions in which they are attributed with violence should have a significantly higher mean value on question 26 (support of party leaders). If Hypothesis 8a is true, co-ethnic candidates in the violence conditions should have higher mean values on questions 24a, 25a, and 27 than non-co-ethnic candidates in the violence conditions. If Hypothesis 8b is true, non-co-ethnic candidates in each violence condition should be held more responsible for violence than co-ethnic candidates in that violence condition (q50). If Hypothesis 9 is true, candidates in the defensive violence condition should have higher mean values on questions 24a, 25a, and 27 than candidates in the offensive violence condition, especially for co-ethnic candidates. If Hypothesis 10 is true, co-ethnic candidates should have higher mean values on questions 24a, 25a, and 27 than non-co-ethnic candidates, especially for co-ethnic candidates. If Hypothesis 10a is true, co-ethnic candidates should have significantly higher mean values on questions 28-31 than non-co-ethnic candidates. If Hypothesis 10b is true, co-ethnic candidates should have significantly higher mean values on questions at least some of questions 32-33 and 38-48 than non-co-ethnic candidates. The third and final experiment\u2014meant to test Hypothesis 7\u2014is another candidate vignette that varies whether the candidate uses combative ethnic rhetoric, as well as whether the candidate\u2019s rhetoric has been implicated in triggering violence in the past. The candidate is always the respondent\u2019s co-ethnic. Again, all analysis of this experiment\u2019s outcomes will be done using difference of means. If Hypotheses 7 is true, the mean value on questions 59a and 60a across treatment conditions should be in the following decreasing order: 1) rhetoric only 2) rhetoric+violence 3) no rhetoric or violence 4) violence only; the mean value on question 62 should be higher for the rhetoric only treatment than in the control group (no rhetoric or violence); and the respondent be more likely to agree with the statement in question 64.\""}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e30985ee71ef80099189745", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/d8m52/providers/osfstorage/5e30985ee71ef80099189745", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/d8m52/providers/osfstorage/5e30985ee71ef80099189745", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/d8m52/providers/osfstorage/5e30985ee71ef80099189745?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/d8m52/providers/osfstorage/5e30985ee71ef80099189745"}, "attributes": {"etag": "18f889e4143eb427721f6b511e172dde68c4d0dccc6bc1a39eb3b178d89a63ed", "kind": "file", "name": "20140228AA_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e30985ee71ef80099189745", "size": 155021, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "e81cf868ab61a6f805cb319f444c460f", "sha256": "c0cbb9ac4f6f14f48745b1024b66a21dc78d0c42f9d2ae2b28992b24e445b674"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 155021, "modified": "2020-01-28T20:23:58.369518+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "d8m52", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20140228AA_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-01-28T20:23:58+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "d8m52", "sha256": "c0cbb9ac4f6f14f48745b1024b66a21dc78d0c42f9d2ae2b28992b24e445b674", "viewUrl": "/project/jrx86/files/osfstorage/5e309865af75930094bdf121/", "selectedFileName": "20140228AA_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20140228AA_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": {}, "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "The Logic of Violence in Political Competition", "q2": "Steven Rosenzweig", "q3": "20140228AA", "q4": "02/28/2014 - 01:19", "q5": "", "q6": "No", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to assignment of treatment", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "3/6/14", "q12": "", "q13": "", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "The goal of the project is to understand why political violence occurs in the course of electoral competition.

mediation and conflict resolution. The program began in 2007, and operates in five of Sierra Leone's 13 districts. We are conducting a randomized controlled trial to analyze how this intervention affects individuals and communities on a wide range of outcomes including psychological wellbeing, social capital formation, economic cooperation, and conflict within the community. The cornerstone of the Fambul Tok program is a reconciliation bonfire ceremony, which is organized to facilitate the airing of wartime grievances. Victims share their stories and perpetrators seek---and on many occasions receive---forgiveness for crimes committed during the nation's thirteen-year civil war. The ceremony is combined with traditional and religious rituals, including prayers, dancing, and a `cleansing' ceremony. The intervention is targeted at the level of a section, which are contiguous clusters of up to ten villages. Thus, several villages participate in a joint ceremony. The program also involves a number of communal activities which are designed to build social capital and encourage community members to work together. First, the ceremony is preceded by three months of community sensitization. During this period, Fambul Tok establishes a Reconciliation Committee, through which community members and leaders work with the NGO in planning and publicizing the ceremony. In addition, Fambul Tok helps establish communal farms, where labor and output are shared, on land set aside by the community as a pledge towards reconciliation; a `Peace Tree', that provides a focal point for the community to gather and resolve disputes; and a `Peace Mothers' group, that seeks to promote women's economic activities and facilitate discussion of atrocities perpetrated during the war. The Fambul Tok treatment could in principle have positive or negative effects. For example, it could be therapeutic for victims to share their accounts of trauma or forgive their perpetrators, which could in turn improve individual well-being, strengthen social networks with community members, lower conflict and lead to greater economic cooperation. Conversely, the reconciliation process could cause individuals to relive traumatic memories, lower their willingness to work with other villagers, and reduce their willingness to contribute to community public goods. Whether the net effect is positive or negative is an empirical question, which the field experiment aims to answer."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1. The Fambul Tok program was implemented according to stated objectives. H2. Fambul Tok affects levels of forgiveness among respondents who were hurt during the war. H3. Fambul Tok affects individual psychological wellbeing. H4. Fambul Tok affects individual attitudes towards ex-combatants. H5. Fambul Tok affects individual attitudes towards war. H6. Fambul Tok affects individual attitudes towards gender. H7. Fambul Tok affects incidence of conflict and crime within the community and between communities. H8.

Fambul Tok affects the extent to which individuals contribute to public goods. H15. Fambul Tok affects market activity and economic cooperation within the community. H16. Fambul Tok affects household economic welfare. Fambul Tok's impact may vary based on household and village-level characteristics. Since the reconciliation ceremony specifically targets individuals who were victims and perpetrators of violence, ex-combatants and those who experienced more violence during the civil war may be differentially affected by the intervention. Similarly, the program may exert varying effects by gender, both because female war experiences differed owing to factors such as gender-based violence, and because aspects of the program, such as the `Peace Mothers' group, are designed specifically to focus on women's issues. In addition, since the intervention aims to affect the community as a whole, it is plausible that entire villages that experienced higher levels of violence will respond differently to the intervention. Finally, the program's impact may differ based on the degree to which members of the village participated in the ceremony. This, in turn is likely to vary based on proximity to the ceremony location, which was almost always the section headquarter village. We therefore test for interaction effects based on the following sub-groups: 1. Ex-combatants: self-reported ex-combatants, as well as respondents who reported being abducted and made to carry a gun. 2. Individual exposure to violence based on whether the respondent was beaten, raped, maimed, abducted; or saw violence. 3. Village-level exposure to violence, based on the following measures: buildings burned, rebel attacks, and rebel base in the village. 4. Gender. 5. Distance from section headquarter village. We will utilize a simple indicator of whether the village is the section headquarter, and also utilize geospatial measures of distance where they are available."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "We evaluate the program via a randomized field experiment. First, Fambul Tok identified 160 sections that were willing to receive the treatment---32 sections in each of five different districts in Sierra Leone. These sections represent communities that (a) were severely affected by conflict, and (b) saw possible benefits from the Fambul Tok intervention. The experimental design required half (80 sections) to receive the Fambul Tok treatment, with the other half acting as a control group. Sections were matched based on an optimal greedy algorithm and within pairs, assigned randomly into treatment and control status by means of a public lottery. Two rounds of surveys were conducted in each village, a baseline prior to the intervention and an endline after the intervention. Both rounds included a household survey of 12 respondents aged 24 and above, who were randomly sampled in-field. A village-level survey was also conducted in both rounds. Based on this experimental design, the most general empirical strategy that we use to estimate the impact of the intervention on mean outcomes is a cross-sectional specification where individual-level outcomes are regressed on the treatment dummy, section-pair fixed effects, and a set of individual and village level controls. The section-pair fixed effects account for section-level matching in the allocation of treatment. In addition we will also report some specifications with language-group fixed effects, to account for the high degree of linguistic heterogeneity in Sierra Leone. For indicators that were collected in both the baseline and endline, we exploit the panel structure by looking at the impact of the treatment on a change in outcomes using a difference-in-differences specification with individual and village controls.

In addition, Fambul Tok helps establish communal farms, where labor and output are shared, on land set aside by the community as a pledge towards reconciliation; a `Peace Tree', that provides a focal point for the community to gather and resolve disputes; and a `Peace Mothers' group, that seeks to promote women's economic activities and facilitate discussion of atrocities perpetrated during the war. The Fambul Tok treatment could in principle have positive or negative effects. For example, it could be therapeutic for victims to share their accounts of trauma or forgive their perpetrators, which could in turn improve individual well-being, strengthen social networks with community members, lower conflict and lead to greater economic cooperation. Conversely, the reconciliation process could cause individuals to relive traumatic memories, lower their willingness to work with other villagers, and reduce their willingness to contribute to community public goods. Whether the net effect is positive or negative is an empirical question, which the field experiment aims to answer.", "q16": "H1. The Fambul Tok program was implemented according to stated objectives. H2. Fambul Tok affects levels of forgiveness among respondents who were hurt during the war. H3. Fambul Tok affects individual psychological wellbeing. H4. Fambul Tok affects individual attitudes towards ex-combatants. H5. Fambul Tok affects individual attitudes towards war. H6. Fambul Tok affects individual attitudes towards gender. H7. Fambul Tok affects incidence of conflict and crime within the community and between communities. H8. Fambul Tok affects conflict resolution, including whether conflicts are resolved satisfactorily and how they are resolved. H9. Fambul Tok affects the entrenchment of traditional sources of power. H10. Fambul Tok affects the level of trust among community members. H11. Fambul Tok affects social divisions and the inclusion of groups that have traditionally been marginalized. H12. Fambul Tok affects the strength of networks within the community. H13. Fambul Tok affects the strength of group membership. H14. Fambul Tok affects the extent to which individuals contribute to public goods. H15. Fambul Tok affects market activity and economic cooperation within the community. H16. Fambul Tok affects household economic welfare. Fambul Tok's impact may vary based on household and village-level characteristics. Since the reconciliation ceremony specifically targets individuals who were victims and perpetrators of violence, ex-combatants and those who experienced more violence during the civil war may be differentially affected by the intervention. Similarly, the program may exert varying effects by gender, both because female war experiences differed owing to factors such as gender-based violence, and because aspects of the program, such as the `Peace Mothers' group, are designed specifically to focus on women's issues. In addition, since the intervention aims to affect the community as a whole, it is plausible that entire villages that experienced higher levels of violence will respond differently to the intervention. Finally, the program's impact may differ based on the degree to which members of the village participated in the ceremony. This, in turn is likely to vary based on proximity to the ceremony location, which was almost always the section headquarter village. We therefore test for interaction effects based on the following sub-groups: 1. Ex-combatants: self-reported ex-combatants, as well as respondents who reported being abducted and made to carry a gun. 2. Individual exposure to violence based on whether the respondent was beaten, raped, maimed, abducted; or saw violence. 3. Village-level exposure to violence, based on the following measures: buildings burned, rebel attacks, and rebel base in the village. 4. Gender. 5. Distance from section headquarter village. We will utilize a simple indicator of whether the village is the section headquarter, and also utilize geospatial measures of distance where they are available.", "q17": "We evaluate the program via a randomized field experiment. First, Fambul Tok identified 160 sections that were willing to receive the treatment---32 sections in each of five different districts in Sierra Leone. These sections represent communities that (a) were severely affected by conflict, and (b) saw possible benefits from the Fambul Tok intervention. The experimental design required half (80 sections) to receive the Fambul Tok treatment, with the other half acting as a control group. Sections were matched based on an optimal greedy algorithm and within pairs, assigned randomly into treatment and control status by means of a public lottery. Two rounds of surveys were conducted in each village, a baseline prior to the intervention and an endline after the intervention. Both rounds included a household survey of 12 respondents aged 24 and above, who were randomly sampled in-field. A village-level survey was also conducted in both rounds. Based on this experimental design, the most general empirical strategy that we use to estimate the impact of the intervention on mean outcomes is a cross-sectional specification where individual-level outcomes are regressed on the treatment dummy, section-pair fixed effects, and a set of individual and village level controls. The section-pair fixed effects account for section-level matching in the allocation of treatment. In addition we will also report some specifications with language-group fixed effects, to account for the high degree of linguistic heterogeneity in Sierra Leone. For indicators that were collected in both the baseline and endline, we exploit the panel structure by looking at the impact of the treatment on a change in outcomes using a difference-in-differences specification with individual and village controls. Although our main results are based on comparison of means, we will also test for a change in distributions across treatment and control, such as with the Kolmogorov--Smirnov test.", "q18": "", "q19":

Motivating hypothesis for the individual-level experiments The first research problem this study addresses is to test preconceptions of the behavioral social science literature about the power of decentral, social norm enforcement in public goods dilemmas in a field setting with real-world social incentives. The study critically examines whether the existing body of evidence from laboratory experiments holds up in field settings. Hypothesis 1.1: On average, social incentives lead to more pro-social behavior in cooperation and accountability dilemmas among covillagers. B. Heterogeneity of treatment effects Plausible causal mechanisms are thinkable that could lead to a rejection of or a null finding on Hypothesis 1.1 if social incentives have contrary effects across different subsets of the population. These mechanisms are investigated by exploring heterogeneity in responses to social incentives across individuals. Details are provided in a separate research design document. B.1 Potential causes of adverse effects of social incentives on pro-social behavior Potential mechanisms that could explain adverse effects of social incentives on pro-social behavior: (1) Compensating differential: If social sanctions are not strong enough to impose prohibitive costs on norm violators, less vulnerable individuals may increase selfish behavior up to a point that compensates them for the anticipated sanctions and reputational consequences of violating a social norm. (2) Fear of anti-social punishment or perverse sanctioning behavior, especially fear of raising suspicion. (3) Adverse incentives arising from risk-sharing and redistribution practices within villages. (4) Social rewards for self-interested behavior B.2 Social integration and social vulnerability as sources of heterogeneity It will be assessed whether individuals\u2019 position in the village-level social network can explain heterogeneous effects of social incentives within villages. Details are described in the research design document. B.3 Other sources of heterogeneity Existing claims in the literature about the effects of social position, migrant status, and cultural differences on pro-social behavior among co-villagers will be re-evaluated on the data from this study and it will be assessed whether these results, if they can be replicated, can be attributed to the effect of social incentives. C. Village-level comparisons The second research question to be addressed by this study is whether decentral enforcement capacity in a village can explain why the quality of village-level governance varies across otherwise similar villages within the same administrative district in rural Tanzania. The village-level average effect of social incentives on cooperation and accountability in the individual-level experiments is used as a measure of decentral enforcement capacity in the villlage. The following primary hypotheses are tested: Hypothesis 2.1: There is a positive relationship between the average effect of social incentives on contributions in the public goods game and village-level collective action capacity, conditional on the village-level average contributions in the stranger/anonymous condition of the public goods game. Hypothesis 2.2: There is a positive relationship between the average effect of social incentives on public goods provision in the accountability game and village-level governance outcomes, conditional on the village-level average contribution decisions in the stranger/anonymous condition of the public goods game and the average proposed appropriation of group resources in the stranger/anonymous condition of the group sharing game. Additionally, the village-level comparisons aim to test the conjecture that external and internal enforcement of cooperation and compliance with rules in the village are substitutes and that external enforcement is inefficient compared to internal enforcement. The prediction is that the greater a community's ability to enforce norms and contributions decentrally, the less will the village government rely on external enforcement. Hypothesis 2.3: There is a negative relationship between decentral enforcement capacity in a village (measured as the average effect of social incentives on contributions in the public goods game) and the village government's reliance on external enforcement, conditional on contributions in the stranger/anonymous condition.\""}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "\"Hypothesis 1.1 will be tested by estimating the interaction effect of the covillager and ex-post identifiability treatments on subjects' decisions in each of the three experiments. Given the dependency of observations across treatments within subjects and across subjects within villages, this quantity of interest will be estimated through a multi-level mixed-effects regression of the decisions in the behavioral games on the covillager and ex-post-identifiability treatments and their interaction term, clustered by village and subject. Predictors for subject-specific random effects will include age, gender, and a measure of risk aversion (the subject's decision in a lottery choice game). While the order of the treatments is fully randomized within subjects and will therefore not bias the coefficient estimates, it may nonetheless be the case that order effects are responsible for a substantive part of the variability in the data, in which case it would be efficient to also control for whether an observation stems from a subject's second, third or fourth game may be included. If inspection of the data suggests that the sharing decisions (contributions in the public goods games, or sharing proposals in the other two games) are censored at zero and 100%, then a multi-level mixed-effects Tobit model would be the most appropriate specification. Hypothesis 1.1 would be rejected by a significant negative coefficient on the interaction term of the covillager and ex-post identifiability treatments and would be confirmed by a significant positive coefficient. If the coefficient is not significantly different from zero, the result would be inconclusive. Heterogeneity of the within-subject effects will be analyzed using a series of regressions with the within-subject effects as dependent variable and the respective individual characteristics as explanatory variables.
