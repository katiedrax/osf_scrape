Some of these studies have even found that exposure to relevant information can affect policy preferences regarding ideal levels of foreign aid and immigration (Gilens 2001; Grigorieff et al. 2018). While the insights from this literature are valuable, many of the studies do not explicitly provide opposing arguments in their stimuli (e.g., fictitious news articles). In such cases, the causal effect estimates are arguably inflated, because in less complex information environments, people may be more likely to be influenced by exposure to new facts. Conversely, when facing complex information environments such as those presented in many real news articles, people may be more likely to default to their original policy positions. In this current study, which is about public attitudes toward universal basic income (UBI), my research design addresses the foregoing issue. Subjects in the control group will see a news article that includes an explanation of UBI and arguments for and against UBI. For more information on my research design, please see Section C3 and the associated PAP (separate document). My main research questions are listed below.

Maya Hernandez"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Adolescence is a dynamic time in development which is associated with enhanced opportunities and vulnerabilities due to vast physical, psychological, and social changes. A rising prevalence of depression and anxiety among adolescents in the U.S., with approximately 22% with severe impairments (Bose, 2017; NIMH, 2019), has evoked growing concerns around causes for this rise, especially considering the digital age. Adolescents are the largest adopters of technology, with approximately 95% having access to a mobile device, 71% using one or more social media platforms, and 45% claiming to be online \u201calmost constantly\u201d (Pew Research Center, 2018). While many studies have shown associations between screen time and poor mental health outcomes (K\u0131rcaburun et al., 2018; Lemola et al., 2015; McBride, 2017; Sampasa-Kanyinga &amp; Lewis, 2015; Stiglic &amp; Viner, 2019; Twenge &amp; Campbell, 2018; Twenge et al., 2018), recent reviews of the literature show mixed and inconsistencies in these findings (Best et al., 2014; Odgers, 2018; Rideout, 2018; Sarmiento et al., 2018; Wartella et al., 2016). \n\nA recent rigorous analysis of large-scale datasets by Orben and Przybylski (2019) revealed associations between screen time and wellbeing in adolescents suggesting small effects sizes which can be comparable to many other possible and unrelated correlates to mental health outcomes in adolescents. This posits a greater consideration that must be made in statistical inferences in efforts to address the complex nature in the rise of internalizing behaviors such as depressive and anxiety symptoms in youth. \n\nMany established lines of research investigating predictors, beyond individual factors such as screen time (Odgers, 2018) and cognitive functioning (Shortt &amp; Spence, 2006), to poor mental health outcomes in adolescents include family (Sander &amp; McCarty, 2005) and peer factors (Garland &amp; Fitzgerald, 1998; MacPhee &amp; Andrews, 2006), school functioning (Juvonen et al., 2000; Fr\u00f6jd et al., 2008), neighborhood (Aneshensel &amp; Sucoff, 1996) and community factors (Huynh &amp; Fuligni, 2010). This multi-level perspective echoes the social ecological framework (Bronfenbrenner &amp; Morris, 2006; Stokols, 2018), which recognizes the interplay of the various ecologies, proximal and distal to the individual, on mental health during this developmental period. The objective of this study is to investigate the social ecological factors associated with adolescent mental health in the digital age. Using a multimodal baseline dataset from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (Volkow et al., 2017), we will be able to characterize correlates to mental health outcomes of a diverse U.S. adolescent cohort, inclusive of the various ecological factors. The aims of this study are threefold: (1) to evaluate the associations between screen time and internalizing behaviors, (2) to evaluate the associations between multi-level ecological factors previously identified as risk factors for increases in internalizing behaviors among adolescents, and (3) explore differences in these associations stratified by socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups.

A rising prevalence of depression and anxiety among adolescents in the U.S., with approximately 22% with severe impairments (Bose, 2017; NIMH, 2019), has evoked growing concerns around causes for this rise, especially considering the digital age. Adolescents are the largest adopters of technology, with approximately 95% having access to a mobile device, 71% using one or more social media platforms, and 45% claiming to be online \u201calmost constantly\u201d (Pew Research Center, 2018). While many studies have shown associations between screen time and poor mental health outcomes (K\u0131rcaburun et al., 2018; Lemola et al., 2015; McBride, 2017; Sampasa-Kanyinga &amp; Lewis, 2015; Stiglic &amp; Viner, 2019; Twenge &amp; Campbell, 2018; Twenge et al., 2018), recent reviews of the literature show mixed and inconsistencies in these findings (Best et al., 2014; Odgers, 2018; Rideout, 2018; Sarmiento et al., 2018; Wartella et al., 2016). \n\nA recent rigorous analysis of large-scale datasets by Orben and Przybylski (2019) revealed associations between screen time and wellbeing in adolescents suggesting small effects sizes which can be comparable to many other possible and unrelated correlates to mental health outcomes in adolescents. This posits a greater consideration that must be made in statistical inferences in efforts to address the complex nature in the rise of internalizing behaviors such as depressive and anxiety symptoms in youth. \n\nMany established lines of research investigating predictors, beyond individual factors such as screen time (Odgers, 2018) and cognitive functioning (Shortt &amp; Spence, 2006), to poor mental health outcomes in adolescents include family (Sander &amp; McCarty, 2005) and peer factors (Garland &amp; Fitzgerald, 1998; MacPhee &amp; Andrews, 2006), school functioning (Juvonen et al., 2000; Fr\u00f6jd et al., 2008), neighborhood (Aneshensel &amp; Sucoff, 1996) and community factors (Huynh &amp; Fuligni, 2010). This multi-level perspective echoes the social ecological framework (Bronfenbrenner &amp; Morris, 2006; Stokols, 2018), which recognizes the interplay of the various ecologies, proximal and distal to the individual, on mental health during this developmental period. The objective of this study is to investigate the social ecological factors associated with adolescent mental health in the digital age. Using a multimodal baseline dataset from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (Volkow et al., 2017), we will be able to characterize correlates to mental health outcomes of a diverse U.S. adolescent cohort, inclusive of the various ecological factors. The aims of this study are threefold: (1) to evaluate the associations between screen time and internalizing behaviors, (2) to evaluate the associations between multi-level ecological factors previously identified as risk factors for increases in internalizing behaviors among adolescents, and (3) explore differences in these associations stratified by socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups. ", "q4": "Aim 1: Evaluate the relation between screen time and internalizing behaviors in early adolescence. \n\nH1a: Greater screen time in early adolescence will have small positive association to increases in internalizing behaviors. \nH1b: The positive association between screen time and internalizing behaviors will be stronger (moderated) among females. \n\nAim 2: Evaluate social ecological factors previously known to be associated with poor mental health outcomes/internalizing behaviors\n\nH2a: Poor family dynamics will be associated with increases in internalizing behaviors. \nH2b: Poor peer relationships will be associated with increases in internalizing behaviors. \nH2c: Poor school functioning will be associated with increases in internalizing behaviors. \nH2d: Lower levels of neighborhood safety will be associated with increases in internalizing behaviors. \nH2e: Heightened levels of perceived discrimination will be associated with increases in internalizing behaviors. \n\n\nAim 3 (Exploratory): Explore unique SES and racial/ethnic group differences on the associations between multi-level ecological factors and poor mental health outcomes in adolescents. ", "q5": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment. This includes surveys, \u201cnatural experiments,\u201d and regression discontinuity designs.", "q6": ["No blinding is involved in this study."], "q7": "", "q9": "", "q10": "Registration prior to analysis of the data", "q11": "The proposed data analysis will approach the currently available baseline cross-sectional data (2.0.1) of this 10-year longitudinal dataset with a more holistic approach to understanding correlates and trends of development and wellbeing across a diverse group of US adolescents. This in efforts to promote research with an open-science framework. To ensure the blinding of patterns and summary statistics of variable of interest beyond demographic information, we will be utilizing the Data Exploration Analysis Portal (DEAP) which has taken measures to prevent post hoc hypothesis testing. Exploratory analysis will be conducted to investigate differences in mental health outcomes stratified by SES and racial/ethnic groups. \n\nTo my knowledge there have not been studies published yet looking at direct relations between screen time and internalizing behaviors using this dataset, alongside the interplay of multi-level ecological variables related to mental health outcomes in adolescence.", "q13": "The sample size for the baseline data of this adolescent cohort is 11,875. Parent/caregiver data is also collected, thus the sample size of adults in this study are 11,875 individuals at baseline data collection. This number is expected to decrease when accounting for missing data, which will be analyzed after pre-registration. ", "q14": "This sample size was over sampled with the anticipated attrition rates (10%) in a 10-year longitudinal study of this magnitude. To capture the national diversity of the adolescent population in the U.S., a multi-stage probability sampling design of schools around each study site was conducted. There was an oversampling of African American and other races and relative under-sampling of Caucasian and Hispanics in order to achieve a more optimal racial/ethnic distribution in this cohort of adolescents (Garavan et al., 2018).", "q15": "N/A", "q20": "", "q21": "", "q22": "", "q23": "", "q24": "", "q25": "References \n\nAneshensel, C.
