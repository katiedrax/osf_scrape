To examine these questions, I will conduct a survey experiment on Qualtrics simulating elections for governor with an online population of Latino voting-age respondents accessed through the online research firm Cint. In this experiment, I will present respondents with a series of four unique candidate-choice tasks.

In order to characterize the economic impact of the medical device tax passed in tandem with the ACA, this project will estimate several basic economic parameters. First, the project estimates the pass-through of taxes from device manufacturers to device buyers. Next, the demand for medical devices will be estimated using data on prices and quantities from hospitals around the US before the implementation of the tax. Finally, this project will use methods from the Industrial Organization literature to estimate markups on medical devices. These economic primitives will be used to describe the economic incidence of the medical device tax.", "q17": "The economic incidence of the medical device tax will be quantified using a differences in differences approach to measuring price changes around the implementation of the tax. Some device classes are exempt from the tax while nearly identical devices are taxable. For instance, medical grade tubing used for enteral feeding is exempt while most medical tubing used for non-enteral purposes is taxable.

Public health depends on the widespread availability of accurate scientific information. The proliferation of conspiracy theories and other misinformation about health, medicine, and science have therefore created a significant challenge for public health officials. These theories often fill the void created by a lack of public understanding of a scientific or health issue and often persist and even gain credibility despite clear evidence to the contrary as they circulate in public discourse and through social networks. For instance, many people in Brazil --- the center of the recent Zika and yellow fever (YF) epidemics --- seemingly do not understand the causes of these viruses, the reasons for their spread, or the consequences they can have for people\u2019s health. Rumors and unsupported reports have blamed the mosquito-borne diseases and public health consequences on genetically modified mosquitoes, larvicides, and prenatal vaccines. The spread of these conspiracy theories could threaten public health efforts to prevent Zika and YF by dissuading people from protecting themselves, undermining efforts to enlist the public\u2019s help in preventing the spread of these diseases, and reducing support for responses to the outbreaks by public health officials. Public health officials have employed a variety of messaging strategies to inform the public and counter these false beliefs. However, the effectiveness of realistic health messaging interventions addressing misperceptions have only been evaluated in a limited number of cases. How should public health officials respond? In previous research, we examined the influence of corrective information, which we adapted from the Pan-American Health Organization, about the Zika virus on factual beliefs, opinions, and intended behavior (we also tested two other types of messages not discussed here). Results indicated that the corrective message failed to reduce conspiracy beliefs about the causes of Zika relative to a control condition; moreover, the correction actually reduced factual knowledge about the true causes and consequences of Zika relative to control. One possible explanation for these results is that corrective information reduced respondents\u2019 confidence in their understanding of disease epidemics or scientific issues more generally, which caused them to express lower levels of agreement with nearly all claims. The present study has two objectives. First, we examine the generalizability of our previous results by replicating the Zika experiment on a second sample and by conducting a similar experiment on another epidemic currently plaguing Brazil: YF. Second, to test the theoretical explanation discussed above, we include a series of \u201cplacebo\u201d belief outcomes in the new Zika and YF experiments in order to examine whether our corrective treatment reduces agreement with facts that are unrelated to the information provided in the treatments. (Both the Zika and YF experiments will have the same design, which we discuss below. The design compares a myths-and-facts style correction to a placebo condition that represents the no information baseline.)"}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "We will test the hypotheses below, which were pre-registered before our previous Zika study, for both Zika and YF. For consistency, we maintain the same hypothesis numbers as the previous study. (From the prior study, we exclude hypothesis H1b about over-time effects since the present study includes only one wave; hypothesis H4a/H4b, which predicted heterogeneous treatment effects that were not observed in the previous study; and research questions RQ1-3, which pertain to over-time effects and treatments that were not tested in this study and heterogeneous treatment effects that were not observed in the previous study.) Specifically, we will again test our original hypothesis that a message correcting myths and providing facts (which we refer to below as a \u201cmyths and facts message\u201d) will reduce beliefs in myths about the Zika/YF virus and correspondingly increase accuracy of respondents\u2019 beliefs about the true causes of Zika/YF and their effects on health relative to a placebo condition (H1a). This expectation is consistent with Nyhan and Reifler (2015), who argue that causal explanations for events are more effective than denials alone. In this case, the myths and facts condition both debunks myths about a communicable disease and instead explains how the disease is spread (i.e., by the Aedes aegypti mosquito) and its effects (e.g., that Zika is responsible for the increase in neurological problems observed among infants). If this myths and facts message is effective at reducing belief in myths about GMO mosquitoes, larvicides, and TDAP (Zika arm) and the YF vaccine and propolis alternative (YF arm), it should also have corresponding effects on support for these policies (H2) and increase respondents\u2019 intention to protect themselves from the Aedes aegypti mosquito (H3). We also test the following hypotheses, which extend our findings from the earlier study: H5a: A myths and facts message will decrease respondents\u2019 belief in factual claims about Zika/YF, including those that are unrelated to the content of the treatment message (we specify which outcome measures we define as unrelated below). H5b: A myths and facts message will decrease respondents\u2019 confidence in their ability to find the truth behind medical and health disputes."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "We will randomize participants into either the Zika or YF arms of the study and then into one of two experimental conditions in a between-subjects design. In both arms, the treatment (myths and facts) condition will be compared to the placebo (control) condition. We will test the effectiveness of a myths and facts message about Zika/YF versus the placebo condition on beliefs about Zika/YF (both knowledge of how the diseases are actually transmitted and belief in myths about the diseases), support for policies to prevent their spread, and intention to engage in preventive and protective behaviors. (See the statistical analysis section below for details.) Respondents and data collection The procedure to be used: We will field a survey containing both the Zika and YF experiments to a targeted sample size of 2,000 by the online survey vendor SSI. Prior to beginning the study, participants will be provided with a description of the survey and reminded that participation in the study is voluntary and that they are free to withdraw at any time. Participants will then be asked to indicate whether or not they agree to participate in the survey. Each participant will be randomly assigned to the Zika placebo condition, the Zika myths and facts condition, and YF placebo condition, or the YF myths and facts condition. Respondents will receive a full debriefing at the conclusion of the study. SSI will not provide any identifiable information to the investigators about the study participants, nor will we ask about any identifying information. The nature of data to be obtained: We will collect individual-level survey data, including questions about demographic/political characteristics, political and health knowledge, beliefs and self-reported intended behavior. Respondents will also be asked in what state or district they live. Dates of administration The study will be made available to respondents on May 16, 2018 and kept in the field until the target sample size has been reached. Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants All residents of Brazil age 18 or older are eligible to participate in the study. Participants must be members of the SSI panel to be selected for inclusion. Respondents from the prior study will be excluded. Primary and secondary outcome measures The wording of all of the outcome measures are provided below. We will construct scales for the following outcome measures listed below: [Zika study] -Zika knowledge: Infected by bite, neurological effects, infected by sex, not infected by casual contact, weak immune systems, infected during pregnancy, pregnant women, donated blood, paralysis -Zika conspiracy theories: GMO mosquitoes, larvicides causing microcephaly, vaccines causing microcephaly -Policy opinions: Release genetically modified mosquitoes, government recommendation of Tdap vaccine, use larvicides in water, government inspections -Behavioral intentions: Intend to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, use mosquito spray/repellent, use screens or close windows to keep mosquitoes out If three or more of the questions used for each scale load on the same factor using principal components factor analysis, we will consider the composite measure as the outcome measure of interest. If they do not, we will examine them separately, though we may also estimate the total effects on average belief accuracy. (Note: Though we will analyze the component questions of our primary outcome measure using principal component factor analysis, we will construct any combined outcome measure as a mean for ease of interpretation.) We may also conduct exploratory analyses of individual outcome questions even when the scale is the primary outcome of interest.

All factual belief measures are coded such that higher values = greater perceptions of accuracy (though we may reverse-code these for expositional purposes in some cases). To test H1a, H2, and H3, we will estimate models of the following form (in pseudo Stata code) separately for the Zika and YF studies. The models will include all belief outcomes above (H1a), all policy preference outcomes (H2), and all behavioral intent outcomes (H3). reg Y mythsandfacts, robust To test H5a, we distinguish between belief outcomes that are related and unrelated to the information provided in our experimental treatments, respectively. We use the subset of unrelated items to test H5a. In both studies, these items are: [Zika study:] -Unrelated: neurological effects, infected by sex, not infected by casual contact, weak immune systems, infected during pregnancy, pregnant women, donated blood, paralysis [YF study:] -Unrelated: same type of mosquito, symptoms, can be fatal, government recommendation, increasingly common in cities, children's immune systems, Pharma hoax We will estimate a model of the same form above. To test H5b, we will use an adapted version of the epistemic political efficacy scale (Pingree 2011), which focuses on knowledge about health and medicine. If all three questions in this scale load on the same factor using principal components factor analysis, we will consider the composite measure as the outcome measure of interest. If they do not, we will examine them separately. (Note: Though we will analyze the component questions of our primary outcome measure using principal component factor analysis, we will construct any combined outcome measure as a mean for ease of interpretation.) We may also conduct exploratory analyses of individual outcome questions even when the scale is the primary outcome of interest. We will estimate a model of the same form above. Notes: -Per Franco et al. (N.d.), all estimates of experimental effects will be unweighted even if SSI provides survey weights for respondents. -For interaction terms, scales, and moderators, if results are consistent using a median/tercile split or indicators rather than a continuous scale, we may present the latter in the main text for ease of exposition and include the continuous scale results in an appendix. We will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from the models described below. We will also use tercile indicators to test whether the linearity assumption holds for interactions per Hainmueller et al (N.d.) and replace the continuous interactions in our models with them if it does not. -We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models, including treatment effects by subgroup and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. -We will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from any interaction models. In some cases, we may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity. If so, we will verify that we can reject the null of no difference in treatment effects in a more complex interactive model reported in an appendix when possible. -Don\u2019t know responses will be considered missing data for the factual belief outcome measures. -We will also compute and report summary statistics for our samples.

Public health depends on the widespread availability of accurate scientific information. The proliferation of conspiracy theories and other misinformation about health, medicine, and science have therefore created a significant challenge for public health officials. These theories often fill the void created by a lack of public understanding of a scientific or health issue and often persist and even gain credibility despite clear evidence to the contrary as they circulate in public discourse and through social networks. For instance, many people in Brazil --- the center of the recent Zika and yellow fever (YF) epidemics --- seemingly do not understand the causes of these viruses, the reasons for their spread, or the consequences they can have for people\u2019s health. Rumors and unsupported reports have blamed the mosquito-borne diseases and public health consequences on genetically modified mosquitoes, larvicides, and prenatal vaccines. The spread of these conspiracy theories could threaten public health efforts to prevent Zika and YF by dissuading people from protecting themselves, undermining efforts to enlist the public\u2019s help in preventing the spread of these diseases, and reducing support for responses to the outbreaks by public health officials. Public health officials have employed a variety of messaging strategies to inform the public and counter these false beliefs. However, the effectiveness of realistic health messaging interventions addressing misperceptions have only been evaluated in a limited number of cases. How should public health officials respond? In previous research, we examined the influence of corrective information, which we adapted from the Pan-American Health Organization, about the Zika virus on factual beliefs, opinions, and intended behavior (we also tested two other types of messages not discussed here). Results indicated that the corrective message failed to reduce conspiracy beliefs about the causes of Zika relative to a control condition; moreover, the correction actually reduced factual knowledge about the true causes and consequences of Zika relative to control. One possible explanation for these results is that corrective information reduced respondents\u2019 confidence in their understanding of disease epidemics or scientific issues more generally, which caused them to express lower levels of agreement with nearly all claims. The present study has two objectives. First, we examine the generalizability of our previous results by replicating the Zika experiment on a second sample and by conducting a similar experiment on another epidemic currently plaguing Brazil: YF. Second, to test the theoretical explanation discussed above, we include a series of \u201cplacebo\u201d belief outcomes in the new Zika and YF experiments in order to examine whether our corrective treatment reduces agreement with facts that are unrelated to the information provided in the treatments. (Both the Zika and YF experiments will have the same design, which we discuss below. The design compares a myths-and-facts style correction to a placebo condition that represents the no information baseline.)", "q16": "We will test the hypotheses below, which were pre-registered before our previous Zika study, for both Zika and YF. For consistency, we maintain the same hypothesis numbers as the previous study. (From the prior study, we exclude hypothesis H1b about over-time effects since the present study includes only one wave; hypothesis H4a/H4b, which predicted heterogeneous treatment effects that were not observed in the previous study; and research questions RQ1-3, which pertain to over-time effects and treatments that were not tested in this study and heterogeneous treatment effects that were not observed in the previous study.) Specifically, we will again test our original hypothesis that a message correcting myths and providing facts (which we refer to below as a \u201cmyths and facts message\u201d) will reduce beliefs in myths about the Zika/YF virus and correspondingly increase accuracy of respondents\u2019 beliefs about the true causes of Zika/YF and their effects on health relative to a placebo condition (H1a). This expectation is consistent with Nyhan and Reifler (2015), who argue that causal explanations for events are more effective than denials alone. In this case, the myths and facts condition both debunks myths about a communicable disease and instead explains how the disease is spread (i.e., by the Aedes aegypti mosquito) and its effects (e.g., that Zika is responsible for the increase in neurological problems observed among infants). If this myths and facts message is effective at reducing belief in myths about GMO mosquitoes, larvicides, and TDAP (Zika arm) and the YF vaccine and propolis alternative (YF arm), it should also have corresponding effects on support for these policies (H2) and increase respondents\u2019 intention to protect themselves from the Aedes aegypti mosquito (H3). We also test the following hypotheses, which extend our findings from the earlier study: H5a: A myths and facts message will decrease respondents\u2019 belief in factual claims about Zika/YF, including those that are unrelated to the content of the treatment message (we specify which outcome measures we define as unrelated below). H5b: A myths and facts message will decrease respondents\u2019 confidence in their ability to find the truth behind medical and health disputes.", "q17": "We will randomize participants into either the Zika or YF arms of the study and then into one of two experimental conditions in a between-subjects design. In both arms, the treatment (myths and facts) condition will be compared to the placebo (control) condition. We will test the effectiveness of a myths and facts message about Zika/YF versus the placebo condition on beliefs about Zika/YF (both knowledge of how the diseases are actually transmitted and belief in myths about the diseases), support for policies to prevent their spread, and intention to engage in preventive and protective behaviors. (See the statistical analysis section below for details.) Respondents and data collection The procedure to be used: We will field a survey containing both the Zika and YF experiments to a targeted sample size of 2,000 by the online survey vendor SSI. Prior to beginning the study, participants will be provided with a description of the survey and reminded that participation in the study is voluntary and that they are free to withdraw at any time. Participants will then be asked to indicate whether or not they agree to participate in the survey. Each participant will be randomly assigned to the Zika placebo condition, the Zika myths and facts condition, and YF placebo condition, or the YF myths and facts condition. Respondents will receive a full debriefing at the conclusion of the study. SSI will not provide any identifiable information to the investigators about the study participants, nor will we ask about any identifying information. The nature of data to be obtained: We will collect individual-level survey data, including questions about demographic/political characteristics, political and health knowledge, beliefs and self-reported intended behavior. Respondents will also be asked in what state or district they live. Dates of administration The study will be made available to respondents on May 16, 2018 and kept in the field until the target sample size has been reached. Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants All residents of Brazil age 18 or older are eligible to participate in the study. Participants must be members of the SSI panel to be selected for inclusion. Respondents from the prior study will be excluded. Primary and secondary outcome measures The wording of all of the outcome measures are provided below. We will construct scales for the following outcome measures listed below: [Zika study] -Zika knowledge: Infected by bite, neurological effects, infected by sex, not infected by casual contact, weak immune systems, infected during pregnancy, pregnant women, donated blood, paralysis -Zika conspiracy theories: GMO mosquitoes, larvicides causing microcephaly, vaccines causing microcephaly -Policy opinions: Release genetically modified mosquitoes, government recommendation of Tdap vaccine, use larvicides in water, government inspections -Behavioral intentions: Intend to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, use mosquito spray/repellent, use screens or close windows to keep mosquitoes out If three or more of the questions used for each scale load on the same factor using principal components factor analysis, we will consider the composite measure as the outcome measure of interest. If they do not, we will examine them separately, though we may also estimate the total effects on average belief accuracy. (Note: Though we will analyze the component questions of our primary outcome measure using principal component factor analysis, we will construct any combined outcome measure as a mean for ease of interpretation.) We may also conduct exploratory analyses of individual outcome questions even when the scale is the primary outcome of interest.

All factual belief measures are coded such that higher values = greater perceptions of accuracy (though we may reverse-code these for expositional purposes in some cases). To test H1a, H2, and H3, we will estimate models of the following form (in pseudo Stata code) separately for the Zika and YF studies. The models will include all belief outcomes above (H1a), all policy preference outcomes (H2), and all behavioral intent outcomes (H3). reg Y mythsandfacts, robust To test H5a, we distinguish between belief outcomes that are related and unrelated to the information provided in our experimental treatments, respectively. We use the subset of unrelated items to test H5a. In both studies, these items are: [Zika study:] -Unrelated: neurological effects, infected by sex, not infected by casual contact, weak immune systems, infected during pregnancy, pregnant women, donated blood, paralysis [YF study:] -Unrelated: same type of mosquito, symptoms, can be fatal, government recommendation, increasingly common in cities, children's immune systems, Pharma hoax We will estimate a model of the same form above. To test H5b, we will use an adapted version of the epistemic political efficacy scale (Pingree 2011), which focuses on knowledge about health and medicine. If all three questions in this scale load on the same factor using principal components factor analysis, we will consider the composite measure as the outcome measure of interest. If they do not, we will examine them separately. (Note: Though we will analyze the component questions of our primary outcome measure using principal component factor analysis, we will construct any combined outcome measure as a mean for ease of interpretation.) We may also conduct exploratory analyses of individual outcome questions even when the scale is the primary outcome of interest. We will estimate a model of the same form above. Notes: -Per Franco et al. (N.d.), all estimates of experimental effects will be unweighted even if SSI provides survey weights for respondents. -For interaction terms, scales, and moderators, if results are consistent using a median/tercile split or indicators rather than a continuous scale, we may present the latter in the main text for ease of exposition and include the continuous scale results in an appendix. We will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from the models described below. We will also use tercile indicators to test whether the linearity assumption holds for interactions per Hainmueller et al (N.d.) and replace the continuous interactions in our models with them if it does not. -We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models, including treatment effects by subgroup and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. -We will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from any interaction models. In some cases, we may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity. If so, we will verify that we can reject the null of no difference in treatment effects in a more complex interactive model reported in an appendix when possible. -Don\u2019t know responses will be considered missing data for the factual belief outcome measures. -We will also compute and report summary statistics for our samples. We will also collect and may report response timing data as a proxy for respondent attention. -The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity. -Where applicable, regression results for binary dependent variables will be verified for robustness using probit.

In an original theory of \u201ctrading favors,\u201d I argue that groups of voters organize and trade their collective votes for preferential access to public services. In particular, local community associations provide a platform for voters to increase their bargaining power towards politicians, and I focus on characteristics of community involvement with the association, leadership characteristics, and political relationships between community leaders and local politicians. As a test of my theory, I seek to understand how rural residents perceive the impact of different community features on the multiple outcomes of public service access, connections with influential political representatives for access to services, bloc voting, and individual clientelism.

The pre-analysis plan for the project associated with this metaketa can be found here: http://egap.org/registration/4480. Conjoint experiments have a complex design that is difficult to implement in rural field settings with low education or illiterate populations. To overcome these challenges, I created pictogram booklets with five varying features of a community association.

In an original theory of \u201ctrading favors,\u201d I argue that groups of voters organize and trade their collective votes for preferential access to public services. In particular, local community associations provide a platform for voters to increase their bargaining power towards politicians, and I focus on characteristics of community involvement with the association, leadership characteristics, and political relationships between community leaders and local politicians. As a test of my theory, I seek to understand how rural residents perceive the impact of different community features on the multiple outcomes of public service access, connections with influential political representatives for access to services, bloc voting, and individual clientelism. I conduct a conjoint experiment that is embedded in the endline survey of the EGAP Metaketa III: Natural Resources initiative.

Public Service Access 1. Communities with strong participation in the association are more likely to have better public service access. 2. Communities with responsive association leadership are more likely to have better public service access. 3. Communities where the association leader endorses a political candidate are more likely to have better public service access. 4. Communities with high competition for leadership are more likely to have better public service access. 5. Communities with constant leadership are more likely to have better public service access. 6.

Communities with high competition and constant leadership (INTERACTION EFFECT) are more likely to have better public service access. Political Representative 8.

Communities with responsive association leadership are more likely to have a political representative to get resources for them. 10. Communities where the association leader endorses a political candidate are more likely to have a political representative to get resources for them. 11.

In Japan, if even some subgroups support repression (e.g. supporters of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party), this would add nuance to current theories of the high costs of repression in democracies. Our experiment is also unique in the sense that we consider both nationalist and non- nationalist scenarios. For both scenarios, we consider all the possible outcomes described above: (1) costless repression for both a democracy and an autocracy (or even \u201cpopular\u201d repression), (2) repression that is costly only in a democracy, (3) costly repression only in an autocracy, or (4) costly repression in both an autocracy and democracy. Although we may observe similar repression costs for both scenarios, it is possible that some citizens in both or either countries may find it easier to support or oppose the government\u2019s repression in either scenario. This leads to twelve possible combinations in terms of treatment effects, summarized in Table 1. See full pre-analysis plan for more detail.", "q17": "Our research design takes the form of a survey experiment administered in the form of a vignette to 3000 respondents in both China and Japan (6,000 respondents total). The experiment considers whether there are indeed costs to each type of repression, whether the costs of repression differ by type (nationalist and economic), whether the costs of repression differ by regime of interest (China and Japan), and whether the costs of repression differ amongst different groups of respondents. We test for costs of repression by calculating difference-in-means in our treatment group minus our control group. Differential costs of repression by type are estimated by comparing the magnitude of our treatment effect estimates in each of our treatment arms \u2013 nationalist and economic. Differential costs of repression by regime are estimated by comparing the magnitude of our treatment effects estimates in each of our surveys \u2013 China and Japan. Finally, we look for the existence of heterogenous treatment effects across a battery of pre- treatment covariates by regressing our outcome variable on treatments conditional upon the data representing the covariate of interest, as well as using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART).
