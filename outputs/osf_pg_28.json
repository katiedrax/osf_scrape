For instance, we may consider the kinds of inhibition strategies that children use (e.g., touching the stickers vs. looking away from them; searching for distractions; self-soothing or regulating behaviors, etc.). One possibility is that children who use these strategies are more successful compared to those who do not. \n\n\nNote: data collection is under-way, but no data has been analyzed or looked at. "}, "sample": {"extra": [], "value": "108 children will be tested, with an even number of children assigned to each of three conditions: self, in-group and out-group (36 participants per condition). "}, "analyses": {"extra": [], "value": "Descriptive statistics: We will compare the relative frequencies and means of children\u2019s responses across age and condition using logistic and linear regression models. We will additionally examine whether these frequencies and means differ by gender. We do not have any predictions with respect to gender; assuming no gender differences, we will not further consider this as a covariate. \n\nEffect of condition on performance: To test our main hypothesis about the impact of distance on children\u2019s behavior, we will test for condition differences across the six tasks (sharing predict, saving predict, free-will, sharing action, saving action, DCCS). We will use binomial logistic and linear regression models with children\u2019s performance on each of these tasks as the respective outcome, and condition as a predictor. We will also include age (in months) as a covariate. We will additionally examine whether the interaction between condition and age explains additional variance (i.e., whether the impact of distance changes with age). To compare differences across conditions, we will use R\u2019s emmeans package to compare performance between pairs of conditions (i.e., self versus in-group; self versus out-group; in-group versus out-group). Our predictions for individual tasks follow the predictions outlined above. \n\nEffect of perceived distance/likeability (etc.) on performance: We will additionally examine whether participants\u2019 judgments of the character they pretended to be have an impact on individual children\u2019s behavior. Specifically, we will examine whether children\u2019s responses to the distance measures (concentric circles, sharing, character evaluations) predict their performance on the socio-cognitive tasks. We will examine this relation using logistic and linear regression models with performance on the socio-cognitive tasks as the outcome variable and character evaluation, condition and age as predictors (additionally examining whether the interactions between these variables explain additional variance). Here, our predictions follow those outlined in Section 1. \n\nInter-task correlations: We will examine whether children\u2019s behavior on the different socio-cognitive tasks correlate with one another, independent of age. We will examine whether children\u2019s responses to the different distance measures correlate with one another (e.g., does perceived distance from the character predict whether children share with the character). \n\nPrediction-Action differences: We will compute difference scores between children\u2019s predictions and actions for sharing and future saving. We will examine whether this prediction-action difference changes with age and/or is predicted by condition. We expect that this difference will lessen with age, as children may become more aware of their own actions. Additionally, this difference may be greatest in the self condition, given that predicting someone else\u2019s behavior may allow children to think more abstractly. \n\nWe will also consider the correlation between children\u2019s predictions and actions (for sharing and saving), and whether the relation between children\u2019s predictions and actions differs as a function of condition. One possibility is that distance (particularly the out-group condition) may lead children to more accurately predict behavior. In contrast, in the self condition (and perhaps also the in-group condition), children may be overly optimistic about their behaviors (therefore predicting better performance than their actual performance). \n"}, "outliers": {"extra": [], "value": "Children who fail to answer any questions, and children who fail to finish the experiment, will be excluded from the data. Children who do not correctly answer all trials on the pre-switch of the DCCS will be excluded from analyses for the DCCS. Likewise, children who do not complete one of the measures (but do complete other measures) will be excluded from analyses including that measure but not others.  "}, "dependent": {"extra": [], "value": "All children will respond to six tasks: three prediction tasks and three action tasks. Children will always complete the prediction tasks first. Within each block, the three tasks will be presented in a counterbalanced order. For the prediction tasks, children are asked to predict how they, an in-group child, or an out-group child (between-subjects) will behave. For the action tasks, children are asked to complete three tasks while being themselves, pretending to be an in-group child, or pretending to be an out-group child (between-subjects). Finally, children in the in-group and out-group conditions will complete a series of tasks examining their perceptions of the in-group and out-group characters (distance measures). \n\nPrediction tasks (presented in counterbalanced order):\nFree-will: Children will be presented with two desirable items (an iPad and an ice cream sundae). For each item, children will be asked whether they (or the person they are pretending to be) have to play with/eat the item, or whether they can choose not to play with/eat the item. Responses will be scored in a binary manner: \u201cchoose not to\u201d=1 or \u201chave to\u201d=0.\nSharing prediction: Children will be told that they will later complete a sharing game. Children will be  asked to predict how they (or the child they are pretending to be) will share resources between themselves and another child on this task. Children are presented with cards that show different resource distributions ranging from sharing 0-5 stickers on a zero-sum basis between themselves and the other child (e.g., 0-5, 1-4, 2-3, etc.). Responses will be coded as the number of stickers children predict sharing with another child. \nSaving prediction: Children will be told that they (or the child they are pretending to be) will later receive a sheet of dinosaur stickers and will have the option to immediately put their stickers on a small, blank sheet of paper, or to save their stickers and wait until the experimenter gets a \u201creally cool dinosaur paper\u201d from another room. Children will be asked to predict whether they will save \u201cjust one of the stickers, a few of the stickers, most of the stickers, or all of the stickers\u201d to put onto the dinosaur scene. These responses will be numerically coded: \u201cjust one of the stickers\u201d=1, \u201ca few stickers\u201d=2, \u201cmost of the stickers\u201d=3, \u201call of the stickers\u201d=4. \n\nAction tasks (counterbalanced):\nSharing action: Five stickers will be placed on the table in front of the child. Children will be asked to decide how many stickers to keep for themselves and how many stickers to give to another child who they are told will participate later. Responses will be scored from 0-5, indicating the number of stickers children share with the other kid. \nSaving action: Children will be given a sheet of dinosaur stickers and a small, blank piece of paper (\u00bc of a sheet). They will be told they can put the stickers on the blank paper, or they can save their stickers and wait until the experimenter gets a \u201creally cool dinosaur paper\u201d for the stickers from another room. Then, the experimenter will leave for one minute to retrieve the dinosaur paper. The number of stickers that children put on the blank paper will be recorded. \nExecutive Functioning: The Dimensional Change Card Sort (DCCS) will be used to assess executive functioning. Children will be told that it\u2019s time to play a card game. Instructions will follow Zelazo (2006). All children will complete the original version. Children who pass this version (at least 5 of 6 cards sorted correctly) will complete the border trials. Children\u2019s performance will be scored as the number of correct trials during the pre-switch, post-switch, and border trials. Performance will additionally be coded as a binary variable (pass/fail) for post-switch and border trials. Passing post-switch=at least 4/6 correct; passing border trial = at least 9/12 correct (following Zelazo, 2006). \n\nDistance measures\nConcentric circles: Children will be given a piece of paper with five concentric circles and a stick figure in the middle of the center-most circle. Children will be told that they are the stick figure in the middle, and things similar to them go close to them in the inner circles, and things different from them go further away in the outer circles. Then, children will be asked to draw where the in-group or out-group child they were pretending to be should go. Children's responses will be coded as the marked distance from the center of the circle (0-5, with high number = more distant). Additionally, the type of drawing done will be recorded using the following categories: a shape (e.g., a line, another circle, a scribble) or a person (e.g., a stick figure or drawing of a face or person). \nSharing: Five stickers will be placed in front of the child, and they will be asked how many stickers they want to keep for themselves, and how many they want to give to the child they were pretending to be (stickers for themselves will be placed in front of them, and stickers for Julia(n) or Zulia(n) will be placed in a cup). Responses will be scored with a discrete numerical value, 0-5, indicating the number of stickers they shared with the other kid on a zero-sum basis. \nCharacter evaluations: Children will be asked several questions about Julia(n) or Zulia(n) regarding how nice/smart/strong they are, as well as how much knowledge they have. Children will be asked to provide responses using a scale comprising three circles that increase in size (small circle = \u201cnot very,\u201d  medium circle = \u201ca little,\u201d large circle = \u201cvery\u201d or \u201ca lot.\u201d Responses will be coded as: \u201cnot\u201d = 1, \u201ca little\u201d = 2, and \u201cvery\u201d / \u201ca lot\u201d=3. We will examine the relation between these judgments.

Past work has explored the impact of psychological distancing on children\u2019s executive functioning by assigning them to complete tasks either as themselves or while pretending to be a fictional character (e.g., White &amp; Carlson, 2016; White, Prager, Schaefer, Kross, Duckworth, &amp; Carlson, 2017). Other research has explored the impact of psychological distancing on children\u2019s future thinking by assigning children to answer questions about themselves or about a similar or dissimilar peer (Lee &amp; Atance, 2016). Together, this work leaves open questions about the range of tasks that psychological distancing may impact, as well as whether psychological distance differentially affects children\u2019s predictions versus actions. Moreover, past research raises questions about the extent to which children benefit from distance specifically, or by other factors that may at times accompany distance, such as the perceived ability (i.e., competence) of another person and the ease of pretending to be this person.  \n\nIn the present study, psychological distance will be operationalized in the social domain (i.e., social distance). Participants will complete a battery of socio-cognitive tasks. Between-subjects, participants will be assigned to a Self condition in which children make predictions about their own behavior and act as themselves; an \u201cIn-group\u201d (someone who lives near the child and speaks their same language) condition in which children make predictions about an in-group child\u2019s behavior and pretend to be an in-group child); or an \u201cOut-group\u201d (someone who lives far away from the child and speaks a different language). condition in which children make predictions about an out-group child\u2019s behavior and pretend to be an out-group child. All children will complete six tasks. Three tasks will involve predicting future behavior. The other three tasks will involve children actually completing the tasks. \n\nThe main questions regard the effect of distance (self, in-group, out-group) on performance across the various tasks assessing free-will beliefs, sharing, future saving, and executive functioning. Additional questions regard whether this effect differs depending on if children are predicting behavior or acting/pretending. Critically, the included tasks show improved performance over the tested age range and have been shown to exhibit self-other differences. There are two central hypotheses being considered: \n\nH1: Increased psychological distance will improve task performance: the more distant children are from their own perspective (self), the greater their performance will be on the various tasks (i.e., greater perceived free will; greater saving for the future; increased prosociality; increased executive functioning). Thus, within age groups, children in the out-group condition will perform better than children in the in-group condition, who will perform better than children in the self-condition. This prediction is general to tasks involving prediction and tasks involving pretending.  \n\nH2: The impact of psychological distance depends on factors such as perceived competence or liking. If someone more similar is perceived as more competent or is liked more, then children in the in-group condition, but not children in the out-group condition, may show improved performance across both predictions and actions. \n\nH3: The impact of psychological distance on task performance will depend on ease of pretense. If it is easier for children to pretend to be someone more similar to them, then children may show improved performance in the in-group condition but not the out-group condition. Because this latter prediction is specific to pretense, it should not affect predictions. Thus, one possibility is that children will show improved predictions in both the in-group and out-group condition, but only show improved action in the in-group condition. \n\nIn addition to effects of the psychological distancing condition, a secondary aim of this study is to examine the relation between the included socio-cognitive tasks. Past work demonstrates self-other differences on all of these tasks, suggesting children\u2019s behaviors across these tasks may be related. Therefore, we predict there may be a positive correlation between children\u2019s behaviors on free-will, sharing, future thinking, and executive functioning, independent of age.\n"}, "study_type": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment"}, "study_type_other": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"data": "It's complicated. We have already collected some data but explain in Question 8 why readers may consider this a valid pre-registration nevertheless.", "name": "Psychological Distance (PD)", "other": "For the future saving action task, we may additionally consider children\u2019s behaviors during the time they are waiting to receive the dinosaur sheet. For instance, we may consider the kinds of inhibition strategies that children use (e.g., touching the stickers vs. looking away from them; searching for distractions; self-soothing or regulating behaviors, etc.). One possibility is that children who use these strategies are more successful compared to those who do not. \n\n\nNote: data collection is under-way, but no data has been analyzed or looked at. ", "sample": "108 children will be tested, with an even number of children assigned to each of three conditions: self, in-group and out-group (36 participants per condition). ", "analyses": "Descriptive statistics: We will compare the relative frequencies and means of children\u2019s responses across age and condition using logistic and linear regression models. We will additionally examine whether these frequencies and means differ by gender. We do not have any predictions with respect to gender; assuming no gender differences, we will not further consider this as a covariate. \n\nEffect of condition on performance: To test our main hypothesis about the impact of distance on children\u2019s behavior, we will test for condition differences across the six tasks (sharing predict, saving predict, free-will, sharing action, saving action, DCCS). We will use binomial logistic and linear regression models with children\u2019s performance on each of these tasks as the respective outcome, and condition as a predictor. We will also include age (in months) as a covariate. We will additionally examine whether the interaction between condition and age explains additional variance (i.e., whether the impact of distance changes with age). To compare differences across conditions, we will use R\u2019s emmeans package to compare performance between pairs of conditions (i.e., self versus in-group; self versus out-group; in-group versus out-group). Our predictions for individual tasks follow the predictions outlined above. \n\nEffect of perceived distance/likeability (etc.) on performance: We will additionally examine whether participants\u2019 judgments of the character they pretended to be have an impact on individual children\u2019s behavior. Specifically, we will examine whether children\u2019s responses to the distance measures (concentric circles, sharing, character evaluations) predict their performance on the socio-cognitive tasks. We will examine this relation using logistic and linear regression models with performance on the socio-cognitive tasks as the outcome variable and character evaluation, condition and age as predictors (additionally examining whether the interactions between these variables explain additional variance). Here, our predictions follow those outlined in Section 1. \n\nInter-task correlations: We will examine whether children\u2019s behavior on the different socio-cognitive tasks correlate with one another, independent of age. We will examine whether children\u2019s responses to the different distance measures correlate with one another (e.g., does perceived distance from the character predict whether children share with the character). \n\nPrediction-Action differences: We will compute difference scores between children\u2019s predictions and actions for sharing and future saving. We will examine whether this prediction-action difference changes with age and/or is predicted by condition. We expect that this difference will lessen with age, as children may become more aware of their own actions. Additionally, this difference may be greatest in the self condition, given that predicting someone else\u2019s behavior may allow children to think more abstractly. \n\nWe will also consider the correlation between children\u2019s predictions and actions (for sharing and saving), and whether the relation between children\u2019s predictions and actions differs as a function of condition. One possibility is that distance (particularly the out-group condition) may lead children to more accurately predict behavior. In contrast, in the self condition (and perhaps also the in-group condition), children may be overly optimistic about their behaviors (therefore predicting better performance than their actual performance). \n", "outliers": "Children who fail to answer any questions, and children who fail to finish the experiment, will be excluded from the data. Children who do not correctly answer all trials on the pre-switch of the DCCS will be excluded from analyses for the DCCS. Likewise, children who do not complete one of the measures (but do complete other measures) will be excluded from analyses including that measure but not others.  ", "dependent": "All children will respond to six tasks: three prediction tasks and three action tasks. Children will always complete the prediction tasks first. Within each block, the three tasks will be presented in a counterbalanced order. For the prediction tasks, children are asked to predict how they, an in-group child, or an out-group child (between-subjects) will behave. For the action tasks, children are asked to complete three tasks while being themselves, pretending to be an in-group child, or pretending to be an out-group child (between-subjects). Finally, children in the in-group and out-group conditions will complete a series of tasks examining their perceptions of the in-group and out-group characters (distance measures). \n\nPrediction tasks (presented in counterbalanced order):\nFree-will: Children will be presented with two desirable items (an iPad and an ice cream sundae). For each item, children will be asked whether they (or the person they are pretending to be) have to play with/eat the item, or whether they can choose not to play with/eat the item. Responses will be scored in a binary manner: \u201cchoose not to\u201d=1 or \u201chave to\u201d=0.\nSharing prediction: Children will be told that they will later complete a sharing game. Children will be  asked to predict how they (or the child they are pretending to be) will share resources between themselves and another child on this task. Children are presented with cards that show different resource distributions ranging from sharing 0-5 stickers on a zero-sum basis between themselves and the other child (e.g., 0-5, 1-4, 2-3, etc.). Responses will be coded as the number of stickers children predict sharing with another child. \nSaving prediction: Children will be told that they (or the child they are pretending to be) will later receive a sheet of dinosaur stickers and will have the option to immediately put their stickers on a small, blank sheet of paper, or to save their stickers and wait until the experimenter gets a \u201creally cool dinosaur paper\u201d from another room. Children will be asked to predict whether they will save \u201cjust one of the stickers, a few of the stickers, most of the stickers, or all of the stickers\u201d to put onto the dinosaur scene. These responses will be numerically coded: \u201cjust one of the stickers\u201d=1, \u201ca few stickers\u201d=2, \u201cmost of the stickers\u201d=3, \u201call of the stickers\u201d=4. \n\nAction tasks (counterbalanced):\nSharing action: Five stickers will be placed on the table in front of the child. Children will be asked to decide how many stickers to keep for themselves and how many stickers to give to another child who they are told will participate later. Responses will be scored from 0-5, indicating the number of stickers children share with the other kid. \nSaving action: Children will be given a sheet of dinosaur stickers and a small, blank piece of paper (\u00bc of a sheet). They will be told they can put the stickers on the blank paper, or they can save their stickers and wait until the experimenter gets a \u201creally cool dinosaur paper\u201d for the stickers from another room. Then, the experimenter will leave for one minute to retrieve the dinosaur paper. The number of stickers that children put on the blank paper will be recorded. \nExecutive Functioning: The Dimensional Change Card Sort (DCCS) will be used to assess executive functioning. Children will be told that it\u2019s time to play a card game. Instructions will follow Zelazo (2006). All children will complete the original version. Children who pass this version (at least 5 of 6 cards sorted correctly) will complete the border trials. Children\u2019s performance will be scored as the number of correct trials during the pre-switch, post-switch, and border trials. Performance will additionally be coded as a binary variable (pass/fail) for post-switch and border trials. Passing post-switch=at least 4/6 correct; passing border trial = at least 9/12 correct (following Zelazo, 2006). \n\nDistance measures\nConcentric circles: Children will be given a piece of paper with five concentric circles and a stick figure in the middle of the center-most circle. Children will be told that they are the stick figure in the middle, and things similar to them go close to them in the inner circles, and things different from them go further away in the outer circles. Then, children will be asked to draw where the in-group or out-group child they were pretending to be should go. Children's responses will be coded as the marked distance from the center of the circle (0-5, with high number = more distant). Additionally, the type of drawing done will be recorded using the following categories: a shape (e.g., a line, another circle, a scribble) or a person (e.g., a stick figure or drawing of a face or person). \nSharing: Five stickers will be placed in front of the child, and they will be asked how many stickers they want to keep for themselves, and how many they want to give to the child they were pretending to be (stickers for themselves will be placed in front of them, and stickers for Julia(n) or Zulia(n) will be placed in a cup). Responses will be scored with a discrete numerical value, 0-5, indicating the number of stickers they shared with the other kid on a zero-sum basis. \nCharacter evaluations: Children will be asked several questions about Julia(n) or Zulia(n) regarding how nice/smart/strong they are, as well as how much knowledge they have. Children will be asked to provide responses using a scale comprising three circles that increase in size (small circle = \u201cnot very,\u201d  medium circle = \u201ca little,\u201d large circle = \u201cvery\u201d or \u201ca lot.\u201d Responses will be coded as: \u201cnot\u201d = 1, \u201ca little\u201d = 2, and \u201cvery\u201d / \u201ca lot\u201d=3. We will examine the relation between these judgments. If these items cluster together (Cronbach\u2019s alpha), we will consider collapsing responses into one evaluation score (e.g., the average of responses). \nDrawing: Children will be asked to draw a picture of themselves and of Julia(n) or Zulia(n).

Epidemiological studies have reported that 20% of people over 20 years old suffer from rotator cuff tears, while 25% of people over 50 years old suffer from rotator cuff tears, which is the main cause of shoulder joint pain and dysfunction and greatly affects patients\u2019 work efficiency and quality of life. An epidemiological study in the United States reports that 4.5 million people are hospitalized every year for Rotator cuff tears. The rotator cuff is composed of supraspinatus muscle, infraspinatus muscle, subscapularis muscle and teres minor muscle. It starts from the shoulder rib and attaches around the humeral head, forming a sleeve like structure at the anatomical neck of the humeral head. The function of the rotator cuff is to support and stabilize the shoulder and humeral joint, maintain the sealing function of the shoulder joint cavity, maintain the synovial fluid to nourish the articular cartilage, and prevent the secondary osteoarthritis. The treatment principle of rotator cuff tears is to reduce pain and improve the function of shoulder joint. The most common actions taken at present to relieve the symptoms of rotator cuff tears include steroid injections, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physical therapy, exercise therapy, manual therapy, ultrasound therapy and acupuncture. In practice, people with rotator cuff tears seldom receive a single intervention in isolation. Acupuncture and manual therapy usually delivered together as components of a physical therapy intervention, are commonly used in the management of rotator cuff tears. Acupuncture is commonly used for musculoskeletal disorders, and it has been suggested as a meaningful nonsurgical intervention for managing shoulder pain and dysfunction. Manual therapy is also commonly used in the management of rotator cuff tears. Manual therapy includes any clinician-applied movement of the joints and other structures, for example mobilization (of which several types exist) or manipulation. The aims of both types of interventions are to improve function, promote healing, increase joint range, strengthen weakened muscles and correct imbalance in the stabilizing function of the rotator cuff. The mechanism of acupuncture treatment has not been fully elucidated. Some studies have pointed out that the mechanism of acupuncture and moxibustion treatment may be related to the local effect, which refers to the release of neuropeptide and other substances by stimulating the sensory nerve endings of skin and muscle tissue. The research shows that acupuncture can promote the release of \u03b2-endorphin and increase the concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine in brain tissue, so as to reduce the sensitivity of tissue to pain and improve joint activity. Manual therapy can stimulate peripheral mechanoreceptors and inhibit nociceptors to reducing pain, and can enhance exchange between synovial \ufb02uid and cartilage matrix to increasing joint mobility. Previous systematic reviews have not assessed acupuncture and manual therapy for rotator cuff tears together. Consequently, we decided to conduct a systematic review based on the best currently available evidence and methodology to evaluate whether acupuncture and manual therapy is effect and safety for pain and function of rotator cuff tears.

2019 (COVID-19) is a new, rapidly emerging zoonotic infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (WHO 2020). The current COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on the 11th of March 2020, and has caused 1,696,588 cases and 105,952 deaths worldwide (dated: 12 April 2020) (WHO 2020a; WHO 2020b). Although there are similarities with historic coronavirus epidemics, with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) responsible for 813 and 858 deaths respectively, the scale and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented challenges to health facilities and healthcare workers all over the world (WHO 2007; WHO 2019).\n\nWith a preliminary hospitalization rate of 12.3 patients per 100,000 population in the United States, COVID-19 has taken a toll on healthcare capacity, and especially on intensive care unit (ICU) capacity (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020). Early reports of the case fatality rate suggest it ranges between of 0.7-4%, with higher rates also reported (WHO 2020; WHO 2020b). However, these numbers should be interpreted with great care due to the data pertaining to the early emergency response, which due to shortage of test kits has led to selective testing of patients with severe disease and underreporting of cases, and delays from confirmation of a case to death (Kim 2020). The median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be 5\u00a0days, with 97.5% of cases developing symptoms within 11.5 days of infection (Lauer 2020). Clinical signs and symptoms include fever (87.9%), dry cough (67.7%), fatigue (38.1%), sputum production (33.4%), shortness of breath (18.6%), sore throat (13.9%), headache (13.6%), myalgia or arthralgia (14.8%), chills (11.4%), nausea or vomiting (5.0%), nasal congestion (4.8%), diarrhea (3.7%), hemoptysis (0.9%) and conjunctival congestion (0.8%) (WHO 2020). Of the reported cases, 80% is estimated to have a mild or asymptomatic course of infection, and an estimated 5% of cases are admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock and/or multiple organ failure (Team 2020; WHO 2020). A risk factor for developing infection and progressing to severe disease is old age, with people aged &gt;80 at highest risk of mortality. Other risk factors are hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, compromised immune status, cancer and obesity (Chen 2020; Huang 2020; Liang 2020; WHO 2020; Wu 2020).\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense, single stranded RNA virus with a large RNA genome. Although not much is known about the specific mechanisms underlying severe disease in COVID-19, there are indications that the virus is capable of inducing an excessive immune reaction in the host, with highly activated but decreased numbers of CD4+\u00a0and CD8+\u00a0T cells detected in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients (Xu 2020). Preliminary reports into the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 have further indicated the observed decrease in human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activity may play a role in causing the rapid deterioration of patient lung function (Tolouian 2020; van de Veerdonk 2020). ACE2 is a protein which functions as the receptor facilitating entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell, and is most abundant on type II alveolar cells in the lungs. Under physiological conditions, ACE2 hydrolyzes the active bradykinin metabolite des-Arg9\u00a0bradykinin (DABK), which prevents fluid extravasation and leukocyte recruitment to the lung. The accumulation of DABK is postulated to increase permeability of pulmonary capillaries leading to angioedema and ultimately respiratory failure, which can have fatal consequences for COVID-19 patients.\n\nDescription of the intervention\nConvalescent plasma, convalescent serum and hyperimmune immunoglobulin prepared from convalescent plasma, are interventions which have historically been used to treat conditions when no vaccine or pharmacological interventions are available. Diphtheria, pneumococcal pneumonia, hepatitis A and B, mumps, polio, measles and rabies are conditions where convalescent plasma has successfully been applied (Eibl 2008).\n\nConvalescent plasma has been shown to potentially have clinical benefit for patients with influenza and SARS in a recent systematic review of the literature (Mair-Jenkins 2015). This systematic review included observational studies and RCTs investigating the use of convalescent plasma, serum or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for treating severe acute respiratory infections of laboratory-confirmed or suspected viral etiology, and included investigations with patients of any age and sex. Control interventions consisted of sham therapy, no therapy and placebo. The authors concluded that, although included studies were generally small and of low quality, with a moderate to high risk of bias, the use of convalescent plasma may reduce mortality and appears safe (Mair-Jenkins 2015). The authors also suggests the effectiveness of convalescent plasma in reducing hospital length of stay is dependent on early administration of the therapy, and use as prophylaxis is more likely to be beneficial than treating severe disease. However, the optimal timing of convalescent plasma therapy is unknown. The optimal dosage of convalescent plasma therapy is also unknown.\n\nThe currently available evidence regarding the effect of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for treating severe acute respiratory infections can be considered conflicting. Especially studies investigating effectiveness of convalescent plasma for influenza have been contradictory, with some randomized controlled trials showing effectiveness (Hung 2013), and other trials not being able to show benefit of convalescent plasma over placebo (Beigel 2019; Beigel 2017; Davey 2019).\n\nAnd, although convalescent plasma is generally regarded to be a safe and well-tolerated therapy, side effects can occur. Limited information is available about specific side effects of convalescent plasma, but chills and a possible case of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) have been reported (Chun 2016). Plasma transfusions are further known to carry the risk of transfusion transmitted infections, allergic transfusion reactions and transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) Especially TACO and TRALI are important to consider, because the COVID-19 patients with poor prognosis and high co-morbidity burden who might be eligible for experimental treatment with convalescent plasma therapy, are at an increased risk of these adverse effects.\n\nHow the intervention might work\nConvalescent plasma contains pathogen-specific neutralizing immunoglobulins which can neutralize viral particles, and treatment with convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulins confers passive immunity to patients who receive it. The duration of conferred protection can differ depending on the timing of administration, it ranging from weeks to months after treatment (Casadevall 2020).\n\nBy neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 particles, early treatment with convalescent plasma is postulated to increase the patient\u2019s own capacity to clear the initial inoculum (Casadevall 2020). This could lead to a reduction in mortality and less progression of hospitalized patients to the ICU. Convalescent plasma is further hypothesized to reduce the length of ICU stay in critically ill patients, thus helping lift pressure from global healthcare systems and increasing ICU capacity.\n\nPreliminary evidence in humans and rhesus macaques has shown that reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is not likely, with most (but not all) patients who recovered from COVID-19 producing sufficient amounts of neutralizing antibodies to protect against reinfection (Bao 2020; Wu 2020a). This implies convalescent plasma from patients following SARS-CoV-2 infection is capable of conferring passive immunity. A recently reported case series also indicated sufficient neutralizing antibody titers in convalescent plasma to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in 5 COVID-19 patients, who all recovered after treatment (Shen 2020). It is important to note, however, that there are indications that the severity of infection has an impact on antibody titers, with less severe disease leading to lower neutralizing antibody response (Amanna 2007). And, research in other coronavirus species has shown that immunity may not be long-lasting, with 2-3 years of protection estimated from work with SARS and MERS (Payne 2016; Mo 2006).\n\nWhy it is important to do this review\nThere is a clear, urgent medical need for more information to guide clinical decision-making for COVID-19 patients. Pharmacological interventions have not yet proven to be effective, and current\u00a0treatment consists of supportive care with oxygen supply in mild cases and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in severe cases. A vaccine could aid in inducing immunity in the population and preventing transmission to those who are at risk for severe disease, but no vaccine is currently available, although multiple candidate vaccines are in development. Until these vaccines are available and distributed, convalescent plasma is a potentially life-saving addition to the current treatment regimen for critically ill COVID-19 patients. Convalescent plasma, and hyperimmune immunoglobulin to a certain extent, can be prepared and made rapidly available by blood banks and hospitals when enough potential donors have recovered from the infection, using readily available materials and methods (Bloch 2020). However, its safety and efficacy are not well characterised yet, and there are costs associated with pursuing the use of convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19.\n\nA multitude of clinical trials investigating the safety and effectiveness of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulins have been announced, and their results will need to be interpreted with care. Thus, there needs to be a thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding the use of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19, and an extensive review of the available literature is required.\n\nObjectives\nTo assess whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulinsconvalescent plasma transfusion is beneficial and safe in the treatment of people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)."}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": ["No blinding is involved in this study."]}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "not applicable"}, "q6": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "We will conduct a systematic rapid review.

When RCT data are available, we will use the common methods recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019), as specified in the following description of the methods.\n\nIf there is insufficient evidence (very low-quality evidence or no evidence) available from RCTs to answer this review's questions we will include prospective controlled non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), including quasi-randomised controlled trials (e.g. assignment to treatment by alternation or by date of birth), controlled before-and-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. In that case, we will use the methods proposed in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions for the inclusion of NRSIs in systematic reviews (Reeves 2017).\n\nIf there is insufficient evidence (very low-quality evidence or no evidence) available from RCTs and NRSIs we will include prospective observational studies with a control group and will adapt the methods for the inclusion of NRSIs in systematic reviews as specified by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions as well (Reeves 2017).\n\nIf there is no evidence from RCTs, NRSIs, and prospective observational studies, we will include prospective non-comparative study designs (e.g. case series). In that case, we will follow the common suggestions specified in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019), as far as possible, and apply methodology outlined in the following protocol sections. We will only consider studies including 1\u00a0or more participants with COVID-19.\n\nWe will include full-text publications, abstract publications, and results published in study registries, if sufficient information is available on study design, characteristics of participants, interventions and outcomes. There will be no limitation with respect to the length of follow-up.\n\nTypes of participants: \nWe will include individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, with no age, gender or ethnicity restrictions.\n\nWe will exclude trials including populations with other coronavirus diseases (SARS or MERS).\u00a0We will also exclude trials including populations with mixed virus diseases (e.g. influenza), unless the trial authors provide subgroup data for people with COVID-19.\u00a0\n\nTypes of interventions:\nWe will include the following main comparison for studies with a control arm.\n\nConvalescent plasma versus standard care or placebo\nConvalescent plasma therapy versus control treatment, for example, drug treatments (e.g. but not limited to hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir ). Cointerventions will be allowed, but must be comparable between intervention groups\nConvalescent plasma therapy versus hyperimmune globulin\nHyperimmune globulin versus standard care or placebo\nHyperimmune globulin versus control treatment, for example, drug treatments (e.g. but not limited to hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir). Cointerventions will be allowed, but must be comparable between intervention groups\nWe are not expecting a large body of evidence as informed by scoping of this topic area. However, if we encounter an unexpected larger volume, we may be decide during conduct to limit the review to a subset of comparisons, for feasibility.\n\nTypes of outcome measures\nWe will evaluate core outcomes as pre-defined by the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials Initiative for Covid-19 patients (COMET 2020).\nPrimary outcomes: \nAll-cause mortality at hospital discharge\nTime to death\n\nSecondary outcomes: \nNumber of participants with grade 3 and grade 4 adverse events, including potential relationship between intervention and adverse reaction (e.g. transfusion\u2010related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion\u2010transmitted infection, transfusion\u2010associated circulatory overload (TACO), transfusion\u2010associated dyspnoea (TAD), acute transfusion reactions)\nNumber of participants with serious adverse events\nImprovement of clinical symptoms, assessed through need for respiratory support at up to 7 days; 8 to 15 days; 16 to 30 days\nOxygen by mask or nasal prongs\nOxygen by NIV or high flow\nIntubation and mechanical ventilation\nMechanical ventilation\nECMO.\nIf doable resources permit, we will also include the following secondary outcomes:\u00a0\n\n30-day and 90-day mortality\nAdmission on the intensive care unit\nLength of stay on the intensive care unit\nTime to discharge from hospital\nTiming of outcome measurement\nFor time-to-event outcomes, such as mortality, discharge from hospital, and improvement of clinical symptoms, we will include outcome measures representing the longest follow-up time available.\n\nAll other outcome categories will be included for the observational periods which were reported in the study publications. We will include those adverse events occurring during active treatment as well as long-term adverse events. If sufficient data are available, we will group the measurement time points of eligible outcomes, for example, adverse events and serious adverse events, into those measured directly after treatment (up to 7 days after treatment), medium-term outcomes (15 days\u00a0after treatment) and longer-term outcomes (over 30 days\u00a0after treatment).\n\nSearch methods for identification of studies\nWe will adapt search strategies from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Lefebvre 2019).\u00a0 We will search for studies in all languages in order to limit language bias. However, we\u00a0will prioritise articles in\u00a0languages that our review team can accommodate (these are: English, Dutch, German, French, Italian, Malay, Spanish). We will not seek for translators via Cochrane Task Exchange for this version of the review. We will tag all references\u00a0in additional languages as \"awaiting classification\" and will seek for translators via Cochrane Task Exchange in an update of this review.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nElectronic searches\nSearch strategies for electronic databases will be adapted from those suggested in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Lefebvre 2019). In this emerging field, we expect that at least the abstract will be in English. In case of studies published in other languages, we will involve Cochrane Task Exchange to identify people within Cochrane to translate these studies.\n\nAs publication bias might influence all subsequent analyses and conclusions, we will search all potential relevant trial registries in detail to detect ongoing as well as completed studies, but not yet published studies. Nowadays, it is mandatory to provide results at least in the study registry. In case results are not published elsewhere, we will extract and analyse these data.\n\nWe will search the following databases and sources, from 2019 onwards:\n\nDatabases of medical literature:\nWHO COVID-19 Global Research Database (https://search.bvsalud.org/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/advanced/?lang=en),\u00a0see file attached\nMEDLINE (Ovid, 2019\u00a0to present),\u00a0see file attached\nEmbase (Ovid, 2019\u00a0to present),\u00a0see file attached\nPubMed (for epublications ahead of print only),\u00a0see file attached\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article Database (downloaded April 13, 2020), see file attached\n\nStudy registries and registry platforms to identify ongoing studies and results of completed studies:\nCochrane COVID-19 Study Register (https://covid-19.cochrane.org/),\u00a0see file attached\nClinicalTrials.gov - Covid-19 Subset,\u00a0see file attached\nWHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) -\u00a0Covid-19 Subset,\u00a0see file attached\n\nData collection\nSelection of studies\nTwo review authors will independently screen the results of the search strategies for eligibility for this review by reading the abstracts using Covidence software (Covidence 2016). We will code the abstracts as either 'retrieve' or 'do not retrieve'. In the case of disagreement or if it is unclear whether we should retrieve the abstract or not, we will obtain the full-text publication for further discussion. Two review authors will assess the full-text articles of selected studies. If the two review authors are unable to reach a consensus, we will consult a third review author to reach a final decision Lefebvre 2019.\n\nWe will document the study selection process in a flow chart, as recommended in the PRISMA statement (Moher 2009), and will show the total numbers of retrieved references and the numbers of included and excluded studies. We will list all articles that we excluded after full-text assessment and their reasons for exclusion in a 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table.\n\nData extraction and management\nAll extractions and assessments will be performed by one author.\u00a0A second author will\u00a0verify the accuracy and (where applicable) the plausibility of extractions and assessment.\n\nOne review author\u00a0will assess eligible studies obtained in the process of study selection (as described above) for methodological quality and risk of bias.\u00a0\n\nOne review author\u00a0will extract data using a standardised data extraction form developed in Covidence (Covidence). Data extraction will be conducted according to the guidelines proposed by Cochrane. If the review authors are unable to reach a consensus, we will consult a third review author.\u00a0\n\nWe will collate multiple reports of one study so that the study, and not the report, is the unit of analysis.\n\nWe will extract the following information.\n\nGeneral information: author, title, source, publication date, country, language, duplicate publications\nQuality assessment: (as specified in the Assessment of risk of bias in included studies section)\nStudy characteristics: trial design,\u00a0setting and dates, source of participants, inclusion/exclusion criteria, comparability of groups, treatment cross-overs, compliance with assigned treatment, length of follow-up\nParticipant characteristics: age, gender, ethnicity, number of participants recruited/allocated/evaluated, disease, severity of disease, additional diagnoses, previous treatments (e.g. experimental drug therapies, oxygen therapy, ventilation)\nInterventions: convalescent plasma therapy or hyperimmune globulin therapy, concomitant therapy, duration of follow-up\nFor studies including a control group: comparator (type)\nOutcomes:\u00a0\nPrimary outcomes:\nAll-cause mortality at hospital discharge\nTime to death\nSecondary outcomes:\nNumber of participants with grade 3 and grade 4 adverse events, including potential relationship between intervention and adverse reaction (e.g. transfusion\u2010related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion\u2010transmitted infection, transfusion\u2010associated circulatory overload (TACO), transfusion\u2010associated dyspnoea (TAD), acute transfusion reactions)\nNumber of participants with serious adverse events\nImprovement of clinical symptoms, assessed through need for respiratory support at up to 7 days; 8 to 15 days; 16 to 30 days\n30-day and 90-day mortality\nAdmission on the intensive care unit\nLength of stay on the intensive care unit\nTime to discharge from hospital\n\nAssessment of risk of bias in included studies\nRandomised controlled trials\nWe will use the Risk of Bias 2.0 (RoB 2) tool to analyse the risk of bias in the underlying study results (Sterne 2019). Of interest for this review is the effect of the assignment to the intervention (the ITT effect) and we will perform all assessments with RoB 2 on this effect. The outcomes that will be addressed are those specified for inclusion in the GRADE Summary of Findings tables. Accordingly, the outcomes will be prioritised based on close communication with patient representatives.\n\nOne review author will\u00a0assess the risk of bias for each study result.\u00a0A second author will\u00a0verify the accuracy and the plausibility. In case discrepancies among their judgements arise or they are unable to reach consensus, we will consult a third review author\u00a0to reach a final decision. We will assess the following types of bias as outlined in Chapter 8 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019).\n\nBias arising from the randomisation process.\nBias due to deviations from the intended interventions.\nBias due to missing outcome data.\nBias in measurement of the outcome.\nBias in selection of the reported result.\nTo address these types of bias we will used the signalling questions recommended in RoB 2 and make a judgement using the following options:\n\n'yes': if there is firm evidence that the question is fulfilled in the study (i.e. the study is at low or high risk of bias for the given the direction of the question)\n'probably yes': a judgement has been made that the question is fulfilled in the study (i.e. the study is at low or high risk of bias given the direction of the question).\n'no': if there is firm evidence that the question is unfilled in the study (i.e. the study is at low or high risk of bias for the given the direction of the question)\n'probably no': a judgement has been made that the question is unfilled in the study (i.e. the study is at low or high risk of bias given the direction of the question)\n'no information' if the study report does not provide sufficient information to allow any judgement\nWe will use the algorithms proposed by RoB 2 to assigns each domain one of the following levels of bias:\n\nLow risk of bias\nSome concerns\nHigh risk of bias\nSubsequently we will derive a risk of bias rating for each prespecified outcome in each study in accordance with the following suggestions:\n\n'Low risk of bias': The trial is judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains for this result\n'Some concerns': The trial is judged to raise some concerns in at least one domain for this result, but not to be at high risk of bias for any domain\n'High risk of bias': The trial is judged to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain for the result OR the trial is judged to have some concerns for multiple domains in a way that substantially lowers confidence in the results.\nNon-randomised controlled studies\nAs reported in the Types of studies section, we will include non-randomised studies if there is insufficient evidence from RCTs.\n\nOne review author\u00a0will\u00a0assess eligible studies for methodological quality and risk of bias (using the Risk Of Bias in Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool) (Sterne 2019). A second author will\u00a0verify the accuracy and the plausibility. The quality assessment strongly depends upon information on the design, conduct and analysis of the trial. The two review authors will resolve any disagreements regarding the quality assessments by consulting a third review author until they reach a consensus.\n\nWe will assess the following domains of bias.\n\nBias due to confounding\nBias in selection of participants into the study\nBias in classification of interventions\nBias due to deviations from intended interventions\nBias due to missing data\nBias in measurement of outcomes\nBias in selection of the reported result\nFor every criterion we will make a judgement using one of five response options.\n\nYes\nProbably yes\nProbably no\nNo\nNo information\nNon-controlled prospectively planned trials\nAs specified in the Types of studies section we will only include non-controlled prospective studies if we do not identify any controlled studies.\n\nOne review author\u00a0will assess eligible studies for methodological quality and risk of bias (using the 'Risk of bias' assessment criteria for observational studies tool provided by the Cochrane Childhood Cancer Group (seeTable 1).\u00a0A second author will\u00a0verify the accuracy and the plausibility. Any 'Risk of bias' judgements will be performed and presented per outcome per study.\n\nThe quality assessment strongly depends upon information on the design, conduct and analysis of the trial. The two review authors will resolve any disagreements regarding the quality assessments by discussion, in case they do not reach a consensus they will consult a third review author.\n\nWe will assess the following domains of bias.\n\nInternal validity\nUnrepresentative study group (selection bias)\nIncomplete outcome assessment/follow\u2010up (attrition bias)\nOutcome assessors unblinded to investigated determinant (detection bias)\nImportant prognostic factors or follow\u2010up not taken adequately into account (confounding)\nExternal validity\nPoorly defined study group (reporting bias)\nPoorly defined follow\u2010up (reporting bias)\nPoorly defined outcome (reporting bias)\nPoorly defined risk estimates (analyses)\nFor every criterion, we will make a judgement using one of three response options.\n\nHigh risk of bias\nLow risk of bias\nUnclear risk of bias\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Covid-19 Convalescent Plasma Search Plan.pdf"}, "nodeId": "hd372", "sha256": "d0f04d428107f77fab8b6bb5e6ee5bcd40b719ccbf09f1762929dc7fb8ed0cd4", "viewUrl": "/project/dwf53/files/osfstorage/5e999976d697350570bdb419/", "selectedFileName": "Covid-19 Convalescent Plasma Search Plan.pdf"}, {"data": {"name": "'Risk of bias' assessment criteria for observational studies.pdf"}, "nodeId": "hd372", "sha256": "550c2f2cc53656f266f15a877caf5cb9a978c90538673b51a76977cdc0d77d04", "viewUrl": "/project/dwf53/files/osfstorage/5e999975d697350570bdb417/", "selectedFileName": "'Risk of bias' assessment criteria for observational studies.pdf"}, {"data": {"name": "References.pdf"}, "nodeId": "hd372", "sha256": "4dadb880d12777c6d2f7edcaa0ce6816f2f41a645780efccea920559e27260ab", "viewUrl": "/project/dwf53/files/osfstorage/5e999975d697350570bdb415/", "selectedFileName": "References.pdf"}], "value": ""}}}, "q11": {"extra": [], "value": "not applicable"}, "q12": {"extra": [], "value": "not applicable"}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "not applicable"}, "q14": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "not applicable"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q15": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Randomised controlled trials\nFor continuous outcomes, we will record the mean, standard deviation and total number of participants in both the treatment and control groups. For dichotomous outcomes, we will record the number of events and total number of participants in both the treatment and control groups.\nFor continuous outcomes using the same scale we will perform analyses using the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes measured with different scales we will perform analyses using the standardised mean difference (SMD).\n\nIf available, we will extract and report hazard ratios (HRs) for time-to-event outcomes (overall survival, progression-free survival). If HRs are not available, we will make every effort to estimate as accurately as possible the HR using the available data and a purpose-built method based on the Parmar and Tierney approach (Parmar 1998; Tierney 2007) in an update of this review. If sufficient studies provide HRs, we will use HRs rather than RRs or MDs in a meta-analysis.\nFor dichotomous outcomes, we will report the pooled risk ratio (RR) with a 95% CI (Deeks 2019). If the number of observed events is small (less than 5% of sample per group), and if trials had balanced treatment groups, we plan to report the Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI (Deeks 2019).\nFor cluster-randomised trials, we will extract and report direct estimates of the effect measure (e.g. RR with a 95% CI) from an analysis that accounts for the clustered design. We will obtain statistical advice to ensure the analysis is appropriate. If appropriate analyses are not available, we will make every effort to approximate the analysis following the recommendations in Chapter 6 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019b) in an update of this review.\n\nNon-randomised controlled studies\nFor dichotomous outcomes, if available we plan to extract and report the RR with a 95% CI from statistical analyses adjusting for baseline differences (such as Poisson regressions or logistic regressions) or the ratio of RRs (i.e. the RR postintervention/risk ratio pre-intervention).\n\nFor continuous variables, if available, we plan to extract and report the absolute change from a statistical analysis adjusting for baseline differences (such as regression models, mixed models or hierarchical models), or the relative change adjusted for baseline differences in the outcome measures (i.e. the absolute postintervention difference between the intervention and control groups, as well as the absolute pre-intervention difference between the intervention and control groups/the postintervention level in the control group) (European (accessed 29 June 2018)).\n\nUncontrolled studies\nFor uncontrolled studies we will not carry out an analysis using quantitative data from indirect controls, as we are aware of the difficulties of indirect comparisons of participant groups with varying baseline characteristics, especially in the absence of individual patient data. Because authors of one-arm, non-comparative studies, often discuss their findings using information from other intervention and observational studies as implicit controls, we will discuss our findings extensively in the context of what is known about the outcome of 'comparable' patients receiving other experimental treatments but not convalescent plasma therapy or hyperimmune globulin therapy. We will not combine the data but provide information from individual studies within tables.\n\nUnit of analysis issues\nStudies with multiple treatment groups\nAs recommended in Chapter 6 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019b), for studies with multiple treatment groups we will combine arms as long as they can be regarded as subtypes of the same intervention.\n\nWhen arms can not be pooled this way, we will compare each arm with the common comparator separately. For pair-wise meta-analysis, we will split the \u2018shared\u2019 group into two or more groups with smaller sample size, and include two or more (reasonably independent) comparisons. For this purpose, for dichotomous outcomes, both the number of events and the total number of patients will be divided up, and for continuous outcomes, the total number of participants will be divided up with unchanged means and SDs.\n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q16": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q17": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "not applicable\n\nAssessment of heterogeneity\nWe will assess heterogeneity of treatment effects between trials using a Chi2 test with a significance level at P &lt; 0.1. We will use the I2 statistic to quantify possible heterogeneity (I2 statistic &gt; 30% to signify moderate heterogeneity, I2 statistic &gt; 75% to signify considerable heterogeneity; Deeks 2019). If heterogeneity is above 80%, we will explore potential causes through sensitivity and subgroup analyses. If we cannot find a reason for heterogeneity, we will not perform a meta-analysis, but will comment on results from all studies and present these in tables.\n\n \n\nAssessment of reporting biases\nAs mentioned above, we will search trial registries to identify completed trials which have not been published elsewhere, to minimise or determine publication bias.\n\nIn an update of this review, we intend to explore potential publication bias by generating a funnel plot and statistically testing this by conducting a linear regression test (Sterne 2019) for\u00a0meta-analyses involving at least 10 trials. We will consider P &lt; 0.1 as significant for this test.\n\nData synthesis\nIf the clinical and methodological characteristics of individual studies are sufficiently homogeneous, we will pool the data in meta-analysis. We will perform analyses according to the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks 2019). We will not conduct meta-analyses that involve both RCTs and non-RCTs. We will conduct separate meta-analyses for each comparison.\n\nWe will use the Review Manager 5 software for analyses (Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5)). One review author will enter the data into the software, and a second review author will check the data for accuracy.\n\nWe will use the random-effects model for all analyses as we anticipate that true effects will be related but will not be the same for included studies. If we cannot perform a meta-analysis, we will comment on the results as a narrative with the results from all studies presented in tables.\n\nFor RCTs, when meta-analysis is feasible, we will use the random-effects model for pooling the data. For binary outcomes, we will base the estimation of the between-study variance using the Mantel-Haenszel method. We will use the inverse variance method for continuous outcomes, outcomes that include data from cluster-RCTs, or outcomes where HRs are available. If heterogeneity is found to be above 80%, and we identify a cause for the heterogeneity, we will explore this with subgroup analyses. If we cannot find a cause for the heterogeneity then we will not perform a meta-analysis, but comment on the results as a narrative with the results from all studies presented in tables.\n\nIf a meta-analysis is feasible for non-RCTs, controlled before-and-after studies, interrupted time series studies, and cohort studies, we will analyse the different types of studies separately. We will only analyse outcomes with adjusted effect estimates if these are adjusted for the same factors using the inverse-variance method as recommended in Chapter 24 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Reeves 2017).\n\nWe will not meta-analyse data from uncontrolled trials, as there might be no additional benefit in meta-analysing data without a control group. In the case of uncontrolled trials, we will report outcome data of each included trial within tables.\n\nIf data do not allow quantitative assessment, we will present outcome data individually per study within tables.\n\nSummary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence\nWe will use the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence for our primary outcomes. We will use GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool (GDT) software to create a 'Summary of findings' table (GRADEpro GDT 2015), as suggested in the\u00a0Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions\u00a0(Sch\u00fcnemann 2019).\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q21": {"extra": [], "value": "Chapter 6 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions suggests a number of potential sources for missing data (Higgins 2019b), which we will need to take into account: at study level, at outcome level and at summary data level.

The current COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on the 11th of March 2020, and has caused 1,696,588 cases and 105,952 deaths worldwide (dated: 12 April 2020) (WHO 2020a; WHO 2020b). Although there are similarities with historic coronavirus epidemics, with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) responsible for 813 and 858 deaths respectively, the scale and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented challenges to health facilities and healthcare workers all over the world (WHO 2007; WHO 2019).\n\nWith a preliminary hospitalization rate of 12.3 patients per 100,000 population in the United States, COVID-19 has taken a toll on healthcare capacity, and especially on intensive care unit (ICU) capacity (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020). Early reports of the case fatality rate suggest it ranges between of 0.7-4%, with higher rates also reported (WHO 2020; WHO 2020b). However, these numbers should be interpreted with great care due to the data pertaining to the early emergency response, which due to shortage of test kits has led to selective testing of patients with severe disease and underreporting of cases, and delays from confirmation of a case to death (Kim 2020). The median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be 5\u00a0days, with 97.5% of cases developing symptoms within 11.5 days of infection (Lauer 2020). Clinical signs and symptoms include fever (87.9%), dry cough (67.7%), fatigue (38.1%), sputum production (33.4%), shortness of breath (18.6%), sore throat (13.9%), headache (13.6%), myalgia or arthralgia (14.8%), chills (11.4%), nausea or vomiting (5.0%), nasal congestion (4.8%), diarrhea (3.7%), hemoptysis (0.9%) and conjunctival congestion (0.8%) (WHO 2020). Of the reported cases, 80% is estimated to have a mild or asymptomatic course of infection, and an estimated 5% of cases are admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock and/or multiple organ failure (Team 2020; WHO 2020). A risk factor for developing infection and progressing to severe disease is old age, with people aged &gt;80 at highest risk of mortality. Other risk factors are hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, compromised immune status, cancer and obesity (Chen 2020; Huang 2020; Liang 2020; WHO 2020; Wu 2020).\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense, single stranded RNA virus with a large RNA genome. Although not much is known about the specific mechanisms underlying severe disease in COVID-19, there are indications that the virus is capable of inducing an excessive immune reaction in the host, with highly activated but decreased numbers of CD4+\u00a0and CD8+\u00a0T cells detected in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients (Xu 2020). Preliminary reports into the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 have further indicated the observed decrease in human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activity may play a role in causing the rapid deterioration of patient lung function (Tolouian 2020; van de Veerdonk 2020). ACE2 is a protein which functions as the receptor facilitating entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell, and is most abundant on type II alveolar cells in the lungs. Under physiological conditions, ACE2 hydrolyzes the active bradykinin metabolite des-Arg9\u00a0bradykinin (DABK), which prevents fluid extravasation and leukocyte recruitment to the lung. The accumulation of DABK is postulated to increase permeability of pulmonary capillaries leading to angioedema and ultimately respiratory failure, which can have fatal consequences for COVID-19 patients.\n\nDescription of the intervention\nConvalescent plasma, convalescent serum and hyperimmune immunoglobulin prepared from convalescent plasma, are interventions which have historically been used to treat conditions when no vaccine or pharmacological interventions are available. Diphtheria, pneumococcal pneumonia, hepatitis A and B, mumps, polio, measles and rabies are conditions where convalescent plasma has successfully been applied (Eibl 2008).\n\nConvalescent plasma has been shown to potentially have clinical benefit for patients with influenza and SARS in a recent systematic review of the literature (Mair-Jenkins 2015). This systematic review included observational studies and RCTs investigating the use of convalescent plasma, serum or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for treating severe acute respiratory infections of laboratory-confirmed or suspected viral etiology, and included investigations with patients of any age and sex. Control interventions consisted of sham therapy, no therapy and placebo. The authors concluded that, although included studies were generally small and of low quality, with a moderate to high risk of bias, the use of convalescent plasma may reduce mortality and appears safe (Mair-Jenkins 2015). The authors also suggests the effectiveness of convalescent plasma in reducing hospital length of stay is dependent on early administration of the therapy, and use as prophylaxis is more likely to be beneficial than treating severe disease. However, the optimal timing of convalescent plasma therapy is unknown. The optimal dosage of convalescent plasma therapy is also unknown.\n\nThe currently available evidence regarding the effect of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for treating severe acute respiratory infections can be considered conflicting. Especially studies investigating effectiveness of convalescent plasma for influenza have been contradictory, with some randomized controlled trials showing effectiveness (Hung 2013), and other trials not being able to show benefit of convalescent plasma over placebo (Beigel 2019; Beigel 2017; Davey 2019).\n\nAnd, although convalescent plasma is generally regarded to be a safe and well-tolerated therapy, side effects can occur. Limited information is available about specific side effects of convalescent plasma, but chills and a possible case of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) have been reported (Chun 2016). Plasma transfusions are further known to carry the risk of transfusion transmitted infections, allergic transfusion reactions and transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) Especially TACO and TRALI are important to consider, because the COVID-19 patients with poor prognosis and high co-morbidity burden who might be eligible for experimental treatment with convalescent plasma therapy, are at an increased risk of these adverse effects.\n\nHow the intervention might work\nConvalescent plasma contains pathogen-specific neutralizing immunoglobulins which can neutralize viral particles, and treatment with convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulins confers passive immunity to patients who receive it. The duration of conferred protection can differ depending on the timing of administration, it ranging from weeks to months after treatment (Casadevall 2020).\n\nBy neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 particles, early treatment with convalescent plasma is postulated to increase the patient\u2019s own capacity to clear the initial inoculum (Casadevall 2020). This could lead to a reduction in mortality and less progression of hospitalized patients to the ICU. Convalescent plasma is further hypothesized to reduce the length of ICU stay in critically ill patients, thus helping lift pressure from global healthcare systems and increasing ICU capacity.\n\nPreliminary evidence in humans and rhesus macaques has shown that reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is not likely, with most (but not all) patients who recovered from COVID-19 producing sufficient amounts of neutralizing antibodies to protect against reinfection (Bao 2020; Wu 2020a). This implies convalescent plasma from patients following SARS-CoV-2 infection is capable of conferring passive immunity. A recently reported case series also indicated sufficient neutralizing antibody titers in convalescent plasma to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in 5 COVID-19 patients, who all recovered after treatment (Shen 2020). It is important to note, however, that there are indications that the severity of infection has an impact on antibody titers, with less severe disease leading to lower neutralizing antibody response (Amanna 2007). And, research in other coronavirus species has shown that immunity may not be long-lasting, with 2-3 years of protection estimated from work with SARS and MERS (Payne 2016; Mo 2006).\n\nWhy it is important to do this review\nThere is a clear, urgent medical need for more information to guide clinical decision-making for COVID-19 patients. Pharmacological interventions have not yet proven to be effective, and current\u00a0treatment consists of supportive care with oxygen supply in mild cases and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in severe cases. A vaccine could aid in inducing immunity in the population and preventing transmission to those who are at risk for severe disease, but no vaccine is currently available, although multiple candidate vaccines are in development. Until these vaccines are available and distributed, convalescent plasma is a potentially life-saving addition to the current treatment regimen for critically ill COVID-19 patients. Convalescent plasma, and hyperimmune immunoglobulin to a certain extent, can be prepared and made rapidly available by blood banks and hospitals when enough potential donors have recovered from the infection, using readily available materials and methods (Bloch 2020). However, its safety and efficacy are not well characterised yet, and there are costs associated with pursuing the use of convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19.\n\nA multitude of clinical trials investigating the safety and effectiveness of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulins have been announced, and their results will need to be interpreted with care. Thus, there needs to be a thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding the use of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19, and an extensive review of the available literature is required.\n\nObjectives\nTo assess whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulinsconvalescent plasma transfusion is beneficial and safe in the treatment of people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).", "q3": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies.", "q4": ["No blinding is involved in this study."], "q5": "not applicable", "q7": "not applicable", "q8": "Registration prior to accessing the data", "q9": "Systematic review of clinical trials.", "q11": "not applicable", "q12": "not applicable", "q13": "not applicable", "q18": "", "q19": "", "q20": "", "q21": "Chapter 6 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions suggests a number of potential sources for missing data (Higgins 2019b), which we will need to take into account: at study level, at outcome level and at summary data level.

When RCT data are available, we will use the common methods recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019), as specified in the following description of the methods.\n\nIf there is insufficient evidence (very low-quality evidence or no evidence) available from RCTs to answer this review's questions we will include prospective controlled non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), including quasi-randomised controlled trials (e.g. assignment to treatment by alternation or by date of birth), controlled before-and-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. In that case, we will use the methods proposed in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions for the inclusion of NRSIs in systematic reviews (Reeves 2017).\n\nIf there is insufficient evidence (very low-quality evidence or no evidence) available from RCTs and NRSIs we will include prospective observational studies with a control group and will adapt the methods for the inclusion of NRSIs in systematic reviews as specified by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions as well (Reeves 2017).\n\nIf there is no evidence from RCTs, NRSIs, and prospective observational studies, we will include prospective non-comparative study designs (e.g. case series). In that case, we will follow the common suggestions specified in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019), as far as possible, and apply methodology outlined in the following protocol sections. We will only consider studies including 1\u00a0or more participants with COVID-19.\n\nWe will include full-text publications, abstract publications, and results published in study registries, if sufficient information is available on study design, characteristics of participants, interventions and outcomes. There will be no limitation with respect to the length of follow-up.\n\nTypes of participants: \nWe will include individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, with no age, gender or ethnicity restrictions.\n\nWe will exclude trials including populations with other coronavirus diseases (SARS or MERS).\u00a0We will also exclude trials including populations with mixed virus diseases (e.g. influenza), unless the trial authors provide subgroup data for people with COVID-19.\u00a0\n\nTypes of interventions:\nWe will include the following main comparison for studies with a control arm.\n\nConvalescent plasma versus standard care or placebo\nConvalescent plasma therapy versus control treatment, for example, drug treatments (e.g. but not limited to hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir ). Cointerventions will be allowed, but must be comparable between intervention groups\nConvalescent plasma therapy versus hyperimmune globulin\nHyperimmune globulin versus standard care or placebo\nHyperimmune globulin versus control treatment, for example, drug treatments (e.g. but not limited to hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir). Cointerventions will be allowed, but must be comparable between intervention groups\nWe are not expecting a large body of evidence as informed by scoping of this topic area. However, if we encounter an unexpected larger volume, we may be decide during conduct to limit the review to a subset of comparisons, for feasibility.\n\nTypes of outcome measures\nWe will evaluate core outcomes as pre-defined by the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials Initiative for Covid-19 patients (COMET 2020).\nPrimary outcomes: \nAll-cause mortality at hospital discharge\nTime to death\n\nSecondary outcomes: \nNumber of participants with grade 3 and grade 4 adverse events, including potential relationship between intervention and adverse reaction (e.g. transfusion\u2010related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion\u2010transmitted infection, transfusion\u2010associated circulatory overload (TACO), transfusion\u2010associated dyspnoea (TAD), acute transfusion reactions)\nNumber of participants with serious adverse events\nImprovement of clinical symptoms, assessed through need for respiratory support at up to 7 days; 8 to 15 days; 16 to 30 days\nOxygen by mask or nasal prongs\nOxygen by NIV or high flow\nIntubation and mechanical ventilation\nMechanical ventilation\nECMO.\nIf doable resources permit, we will also include the following secondary outcomes:\u00a0\n\n30-day and 90-day mortality\nAdmission on the intensive care unit\nLength of stay on the intensive care unit\nTime to discharge from hospital\nTiming of outcome measurement\nFor time-to-event outcomes, such as mortality, discharge from hospital, and improvement of clinical symptoms, we will include outcome measures representing the longest follow-up time available.\n\nAll other outcome categories will be included for the observational periods which were reported in the study publications. We will include those adverse events occurring during active treatment as well as long-term adverse events. If sufficient data are available, we will group the measurement time points of eligible outcomes, for example, adverse events and serious adverse events, into those measured directly after treatment (up to 7 days after treatment), medium-term outcomes (15 days\u00a0after treatment) and longer-term outcomes (over 30 days\u00a0after treatment).\n\nSearch methods for identification of studies\nWe will adapt search strategies from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Lefebvre 2019).\u00a0 We will search for studies in all languages in order to limit language bias. However, we\u00a0will prioritise articles in\u00a0languages that our review team can accommodate (these are: English, Dutch, German, French, Italian, Malay, Spanish). We will not seek for translators via Cochrane Task Exchange for this version of the review. We will tag all references\u00a0in additional languages as \"awaiting classification\" and will seek for translators via Cochrane Task Exchange in an update of this review.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nElectronic searches\nSearch strategies for electronic databases will be adapted from those suggested in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Lefebvre 2019). In this emerging field, we expect that at least the abstract will be in English. In case of studies published in other languages, we will involve Cochrane Task Exchange to identify people within Cochrane to translate these studies.\n\nAs publication bias might influence all subsequent analyses and conclusions, we will search all potential relevant trial registries in detail to detect ongoing as well as completed studies, but not yet published studies. Nowadays, it is mandatory to provide results at least in the study registry. In case results are not published elsewhere, we will extract and analyse these data.\n\nWe will search the following databases and sources, from 2019 onwards:\n\nDatabases of medical literature:\nWHO COVID-19 Global Research Database (https://search.bvsalud.org/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/advanced/?lang=en),\u00a0see file attached\nMEDLINE (Ovid, 2019\u00a0to present),\u00a0see file attached\nEmbase (Ovid, 2019\u00a0to present),\u00a0see file attached\nPubMed (for epublications ahead of print only),\u00a0see file attached\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article Database (downloaded April 13, 2020), see file attached\n\nStudy registries and registry platforms to identify ongoing studies and results of completed studies:\nCochrane COVID-19 Study Register (https://covid-19.cochrane.org/),\u00a0see file attached\nClinicalTrials.gov - Covid-19 Subset,\u00a0see file attached\nWHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) -\u00a0Covid-19 Subset,\u00a0see file attached\n\nData collection\nSelection of studies\nTwo review authors will independently screen the results of the search strategies for eligibility for this review by reading the abstracts using Covidence software (Covidence 2016). We will code the abstracts as either 'retrieve' or 'do not retrieve'. In the case of disagreement or if it is unclear whether we should retrieve the abstract or not, we will obtain the full-text publication for further discussion. Two review authors will assess the full-text articles of selected studies. If the two review authors are unable to reach a consensus, we will consult a third review author to reach a final decision Lefebvre 2019.\n\nWe will document the study selection process in a flow chart, as recommended in the PRISMA statement (Moher 2009), and will show the total numbers of retrieved references and the numbers of included and excluded studies. We will list all articles that we excluded after full-text assessment and their reasons for exclusion in a 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table.\n\nData extraction and management\nAll extractions and assessments will be performed by one author.\u00a0A second author will\u00a0verify the accuracy and (where applicable) the plausibility of extractions and assessment.\n\nOne review author\u00a0will assess eligible studies obtained in the process of study selection (as described above) for methodological quality and risk of bias.\u00a0\n\nOne review author\u00a0will extract data using a standardised data extraction form developed in Covidence (Covidence). Data extraction will be conducted according to the guidelines proposed by Cochrane. If the review authors are unable to reach a consensus, we will consult a third review author.\u00a0\n\nWe will collate multiple reports of one study so that the study, and not the report, is the unit of analysis.\n\nWe will extract the following information.\n\nGeneral information: author, title, source, publication date, country, language, duplicate publications\nQuality assessment: (as specified in the Assessment of risk of bias in included studies section)\nStudy characteristics: trial design,\u00a0setting and dates, source of participants, inclusion/exclusion criteria, comparability of groups, treatment cross-overs, compliance with assigned treatment, length of follow-up\nParticipant characteristics: age, gender, ethnicity, number of participants recruited/allocated/evaluated, disease, severity of disease, additional diagnoses, previous treatments (e.g. experimental drug therapies, oxygen therapy, ventilation)\nInterventions: convalescent plasma therapy or hyperimmune globulin therapy, concomitant therapy, duration of follow-up\nFor studies including a control group: comparator (type)\nOutcomes:\u00a0\nPrimary outcomes:\nAll-cause mortality at hospital discharge\nTime to death\nSecondary outcomes:\nNumber of participants with grade 3 and grade 4 adverse events, including potential relationship between intervention and adverse reaction (e.g. transfusion\u2010related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion\u2010transmitted infection, transfusion\u2010associated circulatory overload (TACO), transfusion\u2010associated dyspnoea (TAD), acute transfusion reactions)\nNumber of participants with serious adverse events\nImprovement of clinical symptoms, assessed through need for respiratory support at up to 7 days; 8 to 15 days; 16 to 30 days\n30-day and 90-day mortality\nAdmission on the intensive care unit\nLength of stay on the intensive care unit\nTime to discharge from hospital\n\nAssessment of risk of bias in included studies\nRandomised controlled trials\nWe will use the Risk of Bias 2.0 (RoB 2) tool to analyse the risk of bias in the underlying study results (Sterne 2019). Of interest for this review is the effect of the assignment to the intervention (the ITT effect) and we will perform all assessments with RoB 2 on this effect. The outcomes that will be addressed are those specified for inclusion in the GRADE Summary of Findings tables. Accordingly, the outcomes will be prioritised based on close communication with patient representatives.\n\nOne review author will\u00a0assess the risk of bias for each study result.\u00a0A second author will\u00a0verify the accuracy and the plausibility. In case discrepancies among their judgements arise or they are unable to reach consensus, we will consult a third review author\u00a0to reach a final decision. We will assess the following types of bias as outlined in Chapter 8 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019).\n\nBias arising from the randomisation process.\nBias due to deviations from the intended interventions.\nBias due to missing outcome data.\nBias in measurement of the outcome.\nBias in selection of the reported result.\nTo address these types of bias we will used the signalling questions recommended in RoB 2 and make a judgement using the following options:\n\n'yes': if there is firm evidence that the question is fulfilled in the study (i.e. the study is at low or high risk of bias for the given the direction of the question)\n'probably yes': a judgement has been made that the question is fulfilled in the study (i.e. the study is at low or high risk of bias given the direction of the question).\n'no': if there is firm evidence that the question is unfilled in the study (i.e. the study is at low or high risk of bias for the given the direction of the question)\n'probably no': a judgement has been made that the question is unfilled in the study (i.e. the study is at low or high risk of bias given the direction of the question)\n'no information' if the study report does not provide sufficient information to allow any judgement\nWe will use the algorithms proposed by RoB 2 to assigns each domain one of the following levels of bias:\n\nLow risk of bias\nSome concerns\nHigh risk of bias\nSubsequently we will derive a risk of bias rating for each prespecified outcome in each study in accordance with the following suggestions:\n\n'Low risk of bias': The trial is judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains for this result\n'Some concerns': The trial is judged to raise some concerns in at least one domain for this result, but not to be at high risk of bias for any domain\n'High risk of bias': The trial is judged to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain for the result OR the trial is judged to have some concerns for multiple domains in a way that substantially lowers confidence in the results.\nNon-randomised controlled studies\nAs reported in the Types of studies section, we will include non-randomised studies if there is insufficient evidence from RCTs.\n\nOne review author\u00a0will\u00a0assess eligible studies for methodological quality and risk of bias (using the Risk Of Bias in Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool) (Sterne 2019). A second author will\u00a0verify the accuracy and the plausibility. The quality assessment strongly depends upon information on the design, conduct and analysis of the trial. The two review authors will resolve any disagreements regarding the quality assessments by consulting a third review author until they reach a consensus.\n\nWe will assess the following domains of bias.\n\nBias due to confounding\nBias in selection of participants into the study\nBias in classification of interventions\nBias due to deviations from intended interventions\nBias due to missing data\nBias in measurement of outcomes\nBias in selection of the reported result\nFor every criterion we will make a judgement using one of five response options.\n\nYes\nProbably yes\nProbably no\nNo\nNo information\nNon-controlled prospectively planned trials\nAs specified in the Types of studies section we will only include non-controlled prospective studies if we do not identify any controlled studies.\n\nOne review author\u00a0will assess eligible studies for methodological quality and risk of bias (using the 'Risk of bias' assessment criteria for observational studies tool provided by the Cochrane Childhood Cancer Group (seeTable 1).\u00a0A second author will\u00a0verify the accuracy and the plausibility. Any 'Risk of bias' judgements will be performed and presented per outcome per study.\n\nThe quality assessment strongly depends upon information on the design, conduct and analysis of the trial.

If sufficient studies provide HRs, we will use HRs rather than RRs or MDs in a meta-analysis.\nFor dichotomous outcomes, we will report the pooled risk ratio (RR) with a 95% CI (Deeks 2019). If the number of observed events is small (less than 5% of sample per group), and if trials had balanced treatment groups, we plan to report the Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI (Deeks 2019).\nFor cluster-randomised trials, we will extract and report direct estimates of the effect measure (e.g. RR with a 95% CI) from an analysis that accounts for the clustered design.

Because authors of one-arm, non-comparative studies, often discuss their findings using information from other intervention and observational studies as implicit controls, we will discuss our findings extensively in the context of what is known about the outcome of 'comparable' patients receiving other experimental treatments but not convalescent plasma therapy or hyperimmune globulin therapy.

We will use the I2 statistic to quantify possible heterogeneity (I2 statistic &gt; 30% to signify moderate heterogeneity, I2 statistic &gt; 75% to signify considerable heterogeneity; Deeks 2019). If heterogeneity is above 80%, we will explore potential causes through sensitivity and subgroup analyses. If we cannot find a reason for heterogeneity, we will not perform a meta-analysis, but will comment on results from all studies and present these in tables.\n\n \n\nAssessment of reporting biases\nAs mentioned above, we will search trial registries to identify completed trials which have not been published elsewhere, to minimise or determine publication bias.\n\nIn an update of this review, we intend to explore potential publication bias by generating a funnel plot and statistically testing this by conducting a linear regression test (Sterne 2019) for\u00a0meta-analyses involving at least 10 trials. We will consider P &lt; 0.1 as significant for this test.\n\nData synthesis\nIf the clinical and methodological characteristics of individual studies are sufficiently homogeneous, we will pool the data in meta-analysis. We will perform analyses according to the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks 2019). We will not conduct meta-analyses that involve both RCTs and non-RCTs. We will conduct separate meta-analyses for each comparison.\n\nWe will use the Review Manager 5 software for analyses (Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5)). One review author will enter the data into the software, and a second review author will check the data for accuracy.\n\nWe will use the random-effects model for all analyses as we anticipate that true effects will be related but will not be the same for included studies. If we cannot perform a meta-analysis, we will comment on the results as a narrative with the results from all studies presented in tables.\n\nFor RCTs, when meta-analysis is feasible, we will use the random-effects model for pooling the data. For binary outcomes, we will base the estimation of the between-study variance using the Mantel-Haenszel method. We will use the inverse variance method for continuous outcomes, outcomes that include data from cluster-RCTs, or outcomes where HRs are available. If heterogeneity is found to be above 80%, and we identify a cause for the heterogeneity, we will explore this with subgroup analyses. If we cannot find a cause for the heterogeneity then we will not perform a meta-analysis, but comment on the results as a narrative with the results from all studies presented in tables.\n\nIf a meta-analysis is feasible for non-RCTs, controlled before-and-after studies, interrupted time series studies, and cohort studies, we will analyse the different types of studies separately. We will only analyse outcomes with adjusted effect estimates if these are adjusted for the same factors using the inverse-variance method as recommended in Chapter 24 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Reeves 2017).\n\nWe will not meta-analyse data from uncontrolled trials, as there might be no additional benefit in meta-analysing data without a control group. In the case of uncontrolled trials, we will report outcome data of each included trial within tables.\n\nIf data do not allow quantitative assessment, we will present outcome data individually per study within tables.\n\nSummary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence\nWe will use the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence for our primary outcomes.

Epidemiological studies have reported that 20% of people over 20 years old suffer from rotator cuff tears, while 25% of people over 50 years old suffer from rotator cuff tears, which is the main cause of shoulder joint pain and dysfunction and greatly affects patients\u2019 work efficiency and quality of life. An epidemiological study in the United States reports that 4.5 million people are hospitalized every year for Rotator cuff tears. The rotator cuff is composed of supraspinatus muscle, infraspinatus muscle, subscapularis muscle and teres minor muscle. It starts from the shoulder rib and attaches around the humeral head, forming a sleeve like structure at the anatomical neck of the humeral head. The function of the rotator cuff is to support and stabilize the shoulder and humeral joint, maintain the sealing function of the shoulder joint cavity, maintain the synovial fluid to nourish the articular cartilage, and prevent the secondary osteoarthritis. The treatment principle of rotator cuff tears is to reduce pain and improve the function of shoulder joint. The most common actions taken at present to relieve the symptoms of rotator cuff tears include steroid injections, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physical therapy, exercise therapy, manual therapy, ultrasound therapy and acupuncture. In practice, people with rotator cuff tears seldom receive a single intervention in isolation. Acupuncture and manual therapy usually delivered together as components of a physical therapy intervention, are commonly used in the management of rotator cuff tears. Acupuncture is commonly used for musculoskeletal disorders, and it has been suggested as a meaningful nonsurgical intervention for managing shoulder pain and dysfunction. Manual therapy is also commonly used in the management of rotator cuff tears. Manual therapy includes any clinician-applied movement of the joints and other structures, for example mobilization (of which several types exist) or manipulation. The aims of both types of interventions are to improve function, promote healing, increase joint range, strengthen weakened muscles and correct imbalance in the stabilizing function of the rotator cuff. The mechanism of acupuncture treatment has not been fully elucidated. Some studies have pointed out that the mechanism of acupuncture and moxibustion treatment may be related to the local effect, which refers to the release of neuropeptide and other substances by stimulating the sensory nerve endings of skin and muscle tissue. The research shows that acupuncture can promote the release of \u03b2-endorphin and increase the concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine in brain tissue, so as to reduce the sensitivity of tissue to pain and improve joint activity. Manual therapy can stimulate peripheral mechanoreceptors and inhibit nociceptors to reducing pain, and can enhance exchange between synovial \ufb02uid and cartilage matrix to increasing joint mobility. Previous systematic reviews have not assessed acupuncture and manual therapy for rotator cuff tears together. Consequently, we decided to conduct a systematic review based on the best currently available evidence and methodology to evaluate whether acupuncture and manual therapy is effect and safety for pain and function of rotator cuff tears."}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": ["No blinding is involved in this study."]}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "No response"}, "q6": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "1.Types of studies We will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture treatment for pain and dysfunction caused by rotator cuff tears.
