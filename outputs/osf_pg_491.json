Theories of ethnic identity formation have largely converged in recent years: most work now occurs within a constructivist paradigm. And scholars have begun turning their attention to understanding specific constructivist mechanisms. In this project we propose examining the activation of different aspects of a person\u2019s ethnic identity to understand the extent to which individuals shift how they identify themselves. We use a lab-in-field experiment in Uganda to systematically induce attention to a new aspect of an individual\u2019s identity and then observe to what extent people shift and identify more with the newly activated identity. Uganda is home to many ethnic groups some of which are more similar than others. All ethnic groups in Uganda fall under three broader language families, Bantu, Nilotic, and Central Sudanic. Each family comes from a different area with different characteristics. Though identity in Uganda is primarily based on ethnicity, Ugandans are typically aware of the differences between language families and the common ancestry that ethnicities within each language family share. We examine whether and to what extent individuals shift within ethnicity and language family in their joint interactions. Our specific goal is test whether the introduction of certain institutions (described below) most often introduced by the state increase the likelihood that Ugandans shift their identity from their immediate ethnic group to their broader language family. To be more precise, we establish a context in which we can examine whether subjects will shift emphasis away from co-ethnics within their language family to individuals of a different ethnic group who are still within the same language family. We also consider whether those within the same language family (co-ethnic or not) are preferred to non-co-ethnics who are also not of the same language family. The motivation for this approach is rooted in much research, but summarized in Chandra (2012). We hope to learn which institutions are most effective at inducing the activation of a separate aspect of identity relative to not introducing such institutions as well as learning which of the institutional mechanisms is more successful than others. In the experiment, we allow the possibility of activation of the language family over ethnicity, but such activation is necessarily a short-term outcome. Although the interventions and effects in the experiment may not be lasting, they inform several different ideas within constructivist approaches as well as the larger literature on identity formation and change. In contrast to most work, however, we attempt to carefully control the conditions under which the activation of alternative identities occurs.\" \"The basic logic behind our experimental approach is to examine which factors activate given aspects of a person\u2019s identity repertoire. Accordingly, in our control group we establish a baseline level of favoritism for co-ethnics relative to non-co-ethnics without attempting to induce any shifts. The treatments then introduce various pieces of information through small group dialogue or objective identifying information to understand whether it activates other aspects of a person\u2019s identity and away from one\u2019s own ethnic group to other ethnic groups within one\u2019s language family. We describe the specific protocol in greater detail below, but we test the following hypotheses. H1: In the control group, subjects are more likely to show favoritism towards a co-ethnic compared to the two non-co-ethnics (e.g., Muganda should favor Muganda within Bantu family over Munyankole or Acholi). Subjects should not be any more likely to favor either of the non-coethnics in which one is of the same language family and one is not (e.g., Muganda should not favor Munyankole over Acholi even though Munyankole is of the same language family). H2: In treatment 1, subjects should favor non co-ethnics of their same language family at least as much as co-ethnics (e.g., Muganda should favor Munyankole at least as much as Muganda, because both are Bantu). Subjects should favor both the co-ethnic and the non-co-ethnic of the same language family over the non-co-ethnic of a different language family (e.g., Muganda should prefer both Muganda and Munyankole over Acholi). H3: In treatment 2, subjects should favor non co-ethnics of their same language family at least as much as co-ethnics (e.g., Muganda should favor Munyankole at least as much as Muganda, because both are Bantu). Subjects should favor both the co-ethnic and the non-co-ethnic of the same language family over the non-co-ethnic of a different language family (e.g., Muganda should prefer both Muganda and Munyankole over Acholi). Treatment 1 should have a stronger effect than treatment 2 given the more pronounced social pressure effect in treatment 1. H4: In treatment 3, subjects should favor non co-ethnics of their same language family at least as much as co-ethnics (e.g., Muganda should favor Munyankole at least as much as Muganda, because both are Bantu). Subjects should favor both the co-ethnic and the non-co-ethnic of the same language family over the non-co-ethnic of a different language family (e.g., Muganda should prefer both Muganda and Munyankole over Acholi). We expect the combined treatment should have the greatest effect of all treatments in activating language family as a salient identity.\" \"We will sample from within two locations in Uganda. One sample will consist of ethnic groups from the Bantu language family. The other sample will consist of ethnic groups from the Nilotic language family. The Bantu sample will primarily come from Kampala because of its high concentration of Bantu ethnicities, and the Nilotic sample will primarily come from Gulu for the same reason. Subjects from both samples will be randomly recruited from multi-ethnic neighborhoods within both cities. We have trained local Ugandan recruiters to go door-to-door and follow a protocol to produce a representative, random sample. Once recruited, subjects will come to a lab where they will participate in the experiment. At the lab, subjects will first fill out a pre-survey where they will provide their demographic information, including ethnicity and, in some conditions, language family. After filling out the pre-survey, subjects will enter a waiting room where they will then be placed into groups with confederates posing as subjects. Each group will consist of (1) the subject, (2) a co-ethnic confederate, and (3) two non co-ethnic confederates of which one is of the same language family and one is not. Confederates will either be of a Bantu or Nilotic ethnic group. To minimize the risk of group-specific effects, we hired a group of confederates and randomly select which confederates work on which days. Each confederate will participate in two extensive training sessions to ensure quality of group deliberation. After the group is formed, the subject and the confederates will move to the next room where they will wait for five minutes before all playing a form of the dictator game. During those five minutes, the confederates will initiate conversation and either the control or treatment will be introduced. In Habyarimana et al. (2009), they find that when co-ethnics are forced to discriminate in the dictator game (while being observed by their co-ethnics) that they will discriminate in favor of their co-ethnics. We use this discrimination as our behavioral measure of identity activation. The goal is to assess whether subjects will not only discriminate in favor of their co-ethnics in the dictator game, but also in favor of their non-co-ethnics that are of the same language family. Put differently, we examine whether individuals will activate a different aspect of their identity under some conditions and allocate money in a dictator game based on the activation of the new identity. Because each round of the dictator game in this experiment consists of four players (subject plus three confederates), each player will be given three bills, two of which will be worth 2,000 UGX and one worth 1,000 UGX. The purpose of the 1,000 UGX bill is to allow disproportionate allocation that could help separate co-ethnics from non-co-ethnics of the same language family by allowing the possibility of observing greater preference for non-co-ethnics of the same language family (or not). Thus, in the treatment groups, the 1,000 UGX bill will allow us to possibly assess whether the co-ethnic or the non-co-ethnic of the same language family receives more money. Treatments and Control Control While waiting for the five minutes before the dictator game begins, confederates will engage in conversation with the subject in which they will introduce themselves and reveal their ethnic identity. After identities are revealed, confederates will ensure that any conversation steers away from ethnicity or any other topic that may stir feelings of identity within the subject. Notably, confederates will not introduce any discussion about language family in the control condition. Treatment 1 Subjects in the treatment group will be asked to not only claim their ethnicity but also what language family they and their parents belong to. These questions on the pre-survey are designed to capture the idea of how claiming an ethnicity or language family on the census can cognitively prime the idea of belonging to certain groups. Then, in the waiting room confederates will engage in conversation surrounding ethnicity. The conversation will focus on how the subject\u2019s ethnicity is similar to those of the two confederates of the same language family and different from the third confederate, building the idea that the subject comes from a single Bantu or Nilotic language family. This conversation imitates the idea that the repertoire of the nominal attributes generated by the census concerning what constitutes an ethnic group could result in the activation of different identities. Treatment 2 Subjects and confederates will be given a name badge that states their name and below it their language family. No special conversation will take place as in the control group. This treatment more strongly tests the effect of institutions by clearly categorizing subjects and confederates into new identities. It also tests the idea of how the repertoire of the descent-based attributes generated by the census determines it. By making the subject and confederates\u2019 new identities visible through the use of a name badge, we are testing whether language family can be activated to the point where subjects will give preference based on it. Treatment 3 This last treatment will be a joint intervention of treatments 1 and 2. Post Survey After the dictator game has been played, subjects in all treatment and the control groups will be given a post-survey in which two different scales will be administered to rate how strongly they identify with their ethnicity and language family. These additional questions will be used for additional secondary analyses. Basic Data Analysis Plan Data will be analyzed by performing simple difference-in-means tests between control and each treatment condition, and then among pairs of treatment conditions. In all we will consider: 1. Control vs. Treatment 1 2. Control vs. Treatment 2 3. Control vs. Treatment 3 4. Treatment 1 vs. Treatment 2 5. Treatment 1 vs. Treatment 3 6. Treatment 2 vs. Treatment 3 We will conduct a number of secondary analyses. Demographic data from the pre-survey will be used to check for within group differences. We will examine different socioeconomics levels, gender, and language family (Bantu vs. Nilotic).

Post Survey After the dictator game has been played, subjects in all treatment and the control groups will be given a post-survey in which two different scales will be administered to rate how strongly they identify with their ethnicity and language family. These additional questions will be used for additional secondary analyses.

Accordingly, in our control group we establish a baseline level of favoritism for co-ethnics relative to non-co-ethnics without attempting to induce any shifts. The treatments then introduce various pieces of information through small group dialogue or objective identifying information to understand whether it activates other aspects of a person\u2019s identity and away from one\u2019s own ethnic group to other ethnic groups within one\u2019s language family. We describe the specific protocol in greater detail below, but we test the following hypotheses. H1: In the control group, subjects are more likely to show favoritism towards a co-ethnic compared to the two non-co-ethnics (e.g., Muganda should favor Muganda within Bantu family over Munyankole or Acholi). Subjects should not be any more likely to favor either of the non-coethnics in which one is of the same language family and one is not (e.g., Muganda should not favor Munyankole over Acholi even though Munyankole is of the same language family). H2: In treatment 1, subjects should favor non co-ethnics of their same language family at least as much as co-ethnics (e.g., Muganda should favor Munyankole at least as much as Muganda, because both are Bantu). Subjects should favor both the co-ethnic and the non-co-ethnic of the same language family over the non-co-ethnic of a different language family (e.g., Muganda should prefer both Muganda and Munyankole over Acholi). H3: In treatment 2, subjects should favor non co-ethnics of their same language family at least as much as co-ethnics (e.g., Muganda should favor Munyankole at least as much as Muganda, because both are Bantu). Subjects should favor both the co-ethnic and the non-co-ethnic of the same language family over the non-co-ethnic of a different language family (e.g., Muganda should prefer both Muganda and Munyankole over Acholi). Treatment 1 should have a stronger effect than treatment 2 given the more pronounced social pressure effect in treatment 1. H4: In treatment 3, subjects should favor non co-ethnics of their same language family at least as much as co-ethnics (e.g., Muganda should favor Munyankole at least as much as Muganda, because both are Bantu). Subjects should favor both the co-ethnic and the non-co-ethnic of the same language family over the non-co-ethnic of a different language family (e.g., Muganda should prefer both Muganda and Munyankole over Acholi). We expect the combined treatment should have the greatest effect of all treatments in activating language family as a salient identity.\"", "q17": "\"We will sample from within two locations in Uganda. One sample will consist of ethnic groups from the Bantu language family. The other sample will consist of ethnic groups from the Nilotic language family. The Bantu sample will primarily come from Kampala because of its high concentration of Bantu ethnicities, and the Nilotic sample will primarily come from Gulu for the same reason. Subjects from both samples will be randomly recruited from multi-ethnic neighborhoods within both cities. We have trained local Ugandan recruiters to go door-to-door and follow a protocol to produce a representative, random sample. Once recruited, subjects will come to a lab where they will participate in the experiment. At the lab, subjects will first fill out a pre-survey where they will provide their demographic information, including ethnicity and, in some conditions, language family. After filling out the pre-survey, subjects will enter a waiting room where they will then be placed into groups with confederates posing as subjects. Each group will consist of (1) the subject, (2) a co-ethnic confederate, and (3) two non co-ethnic confederates of which one is of the same language family and one is not. Confederates will either be of a Bantu or Nilotic ethnic group. To minimize the risk of group-specific effects, we hired a group of confederates and randomly select which confederates work on which days. Each confederate will participate in two extensive training sessions to ensure quality of group deliberation. After the group is formed, the subject and the confederates will move to the next room where they will wait for five minutes before all playing a form of the dictator game. During those five minutes, the confederates will initiate conversation and either the control or treatment will be introduced. In Habyarimana et al. (2009), they find that when co-ethnics are forced to discriminate in the dictator game (while being observed by their co-ethnics) that they will discriminate in favor of their co-ethnics. We use this discrimination as our behavioral measure of identity activation. The goal is to assess whether subjects will not only discriminate in favor of their co-ethnics in the dictator game, but also in favor of their non-co-ethnics that are of the same language family. Put differently, we examine whether individuals will activate a different aspect of their identity under some conditions and allocate money in a dictator game based on the activation of the new identity. Because each round of the dictator game in this experiment consists of four players (subject plus three confederates), each player will be given three bills, two of which will be worth 2,000 UGX and one worth 1,000 UGX. The purpose of the 1,000 UGX bill is to allow disproportionate allocation that could help separate co-ethnics from non-co-ethnics of the same language family by allowing the possibility of observing greater preference for non-co-ethnics of the same language family (or not). Thus, in the treatment groups, the 1,000 UGX bill will allow us to possibly assess whether the co-ethnic or the non-co-ethnic of the same language family receives more money. Treatments and Control Control While waiting for the five minutes before the dictator game begins, confederates will engage in conversation with the subject in which they will introduce themselves and reveal their ethnic identity. After identities are revealed, confederates will ensure that any conversation steers away from ethnicity or any other topic that may stir feelings of identity within the subject. Notably, confederates will not introduce any discussion about language family in the control condition. Treatment 1 Subjects in the treatment group will be asked to not only claim their ethnicity but also what language family they and their parents belong to. These questions on the pre-survey are designed to capture the idea of how claiming an ethnicity or language family on the census can cognitively prime the idea of belonging to certain groups. Then, in the waiting room confederates will engage in conversation surrounding ethnicity. The conversation will focus on how the subject\u2019s ethnicity is similar to those of the two confederates of the same language family and different from the third confederate, building the idea that the subject comes from a single Bantu or Nilotic language family. This conversation imitates the idea that the repertoire of the nominal attributes generated by the census concerning what constitutes an ethnic group could result in the activation of different identities. Treatment 2 Subjects and confederates will be given a name badge that states their name and below it their language family. No special conversation will take place as in the control group. This treatment more strongly tests the effect of institutions by clearly categorizing subjects and confederates into new identities. It also tests the idea of how the repertoire of the descent-based attributes generated by the census determines it. By making the subject and confederates\u2019 new identities visible through the use of a name badge, we are testing whether language family can be activated to the point where subjects will give preference based on it. Treatment 3 This last treatment will be a joint intervention of treatments 1 and 2.

Raising money from wealthy charitable donors, they provide small-scale loans to the world\u2019s poor to enable microenterprises to lift borrowers out of poverty. As charitable organizations, the primary goal of MFIs is to relieve poverty, with secondary goals of female empowerment, social capital formation, improved education, and better health, among others. Microfinance has spread to as many as 300 million borrowers worldwide and garnered the Nobel Peace Prize for the pathbreaking Grameen Bank and its founder, Muhammad Yunus. But recently, among other accustations, a firestorm of criticism has swirled around the movement in the wake of reported suicides in Bangladesh by over-indebted Grameen borrowers. A fierce debate rages over the effectiveness of microcredit. Development economists have explored the effects of microcredit with careful scientific studies employing randomized control trials. Led by Yale\u2019s Dean Karlan and Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo of MIT, the several studies suggest mixed results. The studies suggest that microcredit is very effective at enabling small-business owners or people inclined toward entrepreneurship to capitalize their businesses and curb frivolous consumption, but it appears to have no general poverty-reducing effects across a population or to promote female empowerment, health, or education. When Banerjee and Duflo, along with co-authors Rachel Glennerster and Cynthia Kinnan, released the results of their extensive 18-month study performed in Hyderabad, India, in 2010, microcredit boosters fought back. Representatives of the six largest MFIs worldwide assumed that all the results would be negative (they were not) and reacted by producing six anecdotes of successful borrowers.

However, the Karlan and Duflo experiments do not report negative findings, they show mixed results and suggest that microcredit can be part of the answer to the problem of global development (Banerjee and Duflo 2011). The current study seeks to assess how generalized this negative reaction to scientific findings might be. We randomly assign short descriptions of and citations to two parallel randomized control trials of microcredit by Karlan and co-author Jonathan Zinman.

Two additional rounds of follow-up emails are sent to those emails that do not respond.

We follow-up with those MFIs who express interest in potentially partnering with PEDL in a subsequent email and provide them with articles on microfinance evaluation and ask them specific questions about their interests in a future partnership and their potential funding sources for the randomized evaluation. PEDL will pursue active partnerships with promising organizations. EMAIL APPROACH , I am contacting you as director of the Political Economy and Development Lab (PEDL) at Brigham Young University. We want to identify microfinance institutions in that may be interested in participating in an impact evaluation using random assignment. Would your organization be interested in receiving more information about potentially partnering with PEDL on a future impact evaluation? Please understand that this is not an invitation for immediate partnership, which would require funding and mutual availability. We are, however, hoping to identify interested organizations. We hope to hear from you soon. Sincerely, Daniel L.

A recent scientific study shows that microcredit loans have a positive effect on economic self-sufficiency, subjective well-being, and women\u2019s empowerment (Karlan and Zinman 2009, \u201cExpanding Credit Access,\u201d Review of Financial Studies). These findings are interesting, but microfinance institutions vary, so you may want to know your program\u2019s particular results. NEGATIVE TREATMENT Credible academic research suggests that microfinance may be ineffective. A recent scientific study shows that microcredit loans have no effect on economic self-sufficiency, subjective well-being, or women\u2019s empowerment (Karlan and Zinman 2011, \u201cMicrocredit in Theory and Practice,\u201d Science). These findings are interesting, but microfinance institutions vary, so you may want to know your program\u2019s particular results. DATA ANALYSIS PLAN Upon completion of the field study, data will first be analyzed by performing simple difference-in-means tests between control and treatment conditions and between the treatment conditions. Sub-group difference-in-means tests will also be performed within the regional blocs. We have attempted to balance the key regional covariates with the block randomization procedure, so the need for regression analysis should be minimal. However, further logit and probit regression analyses, controlling for fixed effects for the regional groups, will be employed to check robustness. Very low response rates may require the employment of rare-events logistic analysis as an additional robustness check. While there will likely be near-perfect overlap, response rates \u2013 including both negative and positive responses \u2013 will be analyzed separate from positive response rates.\""}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q30": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q38": {"extra": {}, "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Confirmation Bias in Microfinance Institutions: A Randomized Field Experiment", "q2": "Daniel Nielson | Matthew Brigham | Chase Petrey | William Matthias", "q3": "20120727AA", "q4": "07/27/2012 - 05:22", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "", "q9": "", "q10": "", "q11": "", "q12": "", "q13": "", "q14": "", "q15": "\"Microfinance institutions (MFIs) are the archetypal altruist organizations in international development.

Emails are sent from a proxy server and are addressed to the MFI's name or acronym. The reply-to address is impactevaluations@byu.edu, and all emails include the digital signature of Daniel Nielson, the director of the Political Economy and Development Lab at BYU. The subject line for these emails is \"\"Potential Partnership.\"\" The invitation for MFIs to request additional information about a partnership on an impact evaluation is fully sincere: PEDL is actively seeking partnerships with MFIs and other NGOs for future randomized evaluations. The emails make clear that they are not invitations for immediate partnerships, which would require funding and mutual availability, so there is no deception in the communication. 5. Two additional rounds of follow-up emails are sent to those emails that do not respond. The new emails are entitled \"\"Potential Partnership Reminder\"\" and begin with a brief reminder paragraph, signaling that this is a follow-up email. 6. As we receive emails, they are coded based on 1) whether or not they respond to our invitation and 2) whether or not they express a positive interest in an impact evaluation. 7. We follow-up with those MFIs who express interest in potentially partnering with PEDL in a subsequent email and provide them with articles on microfinance evaluation and ask them specific questions about their interests in a future partnership and their potential funding sources for the randomized evaluation. PEDL will pursue active partnerships with promising organizations. EMAIL APPROACH , I am contacting you as director of the Political Economy and Development Lab (PEDL) at Brigham Young University. We want to identify microfinance institutions in that may be interested in participating in an impact evaluation using random assignment. Would your organization be interested in receiving more information about potentially partnering with PEDL on a future impact evaluation? Please understand that this is not an invitation for immediate partnership, which would require funding and mutual availability. We are, however, hoping to identify interested organizations. We hope to hear from you soon. Sincerely, Daniel L. Nielson Associate Professor & Director Political Economy and Development Lab Political Science Department Brigham Young University Provo, UT 84602-5545 POSITIVE TREATMENT Credible academic research suggests that microfinance may be effective. A recent scientific study shows that microcredit loans have a positive effect on economic self-sufficiency, subjective well-being, and women\u2019s empowerment (Karlan and Zinman 2009, \u201cExpanding Credit Access,\u201d Review of Financial Studies). These findings are interesting, but microfinance institutions vary, so you may want to know your program\u2019s particular results. NEGATIVE TREATMENT Credible academic research suggests that microfinance may be ineffective. A recent scientific study shows that microcredit loans have no effect on economic self-sufficiency, subjective well-being, or women\u2019s empowerment (Karlan and Zinman 2011, \u201cMicrocredit in Theory and Practice,\u201d Science). These findings are interesting, but microfinance institutions vary, so you may want to know your program\u2019s particular results. DATA ANALYSIS PLAN Upon completion of the field study, data will first be analyzed by performing simple difference-in-means tests between control and treatment conditions and between the treatment conditions. Sub-group difference-in-means tests will also be performed within the regional blocs. We have attempted to balance the key regional covariates with the block randomization procedure, so the need for regression analysis should be minimal. However, further logit and probit regression analyses, controlling for fixed effects for the regional groups, will be employed to check robustness. Very low response rates may require the employment of rare-events logistic analysis as an additional robustness check. While there will likely be near-perfect overlap, response rates \u2013 including both negative and positive responses \u2013 will be analyzed separate from positive response rates.\"", "q18": "",

This is broadly consistent with a realist view that compliance with international standards will only occur when backed up with state power. The third expectation is that service providers will be more likely to allow anonymous incorporation to a client from an explicitly non-corrupt country as opposed to a potential client from a clearly corrupt nation (H3). Finally, our fourth expectation is that providers in the United States will be far less likely to allow any client associated with global terror to incorporate without disclosing identification (H4). We expect the most significant treatment effects from H4, and suspect that the previous three treatments will garner much less substantial or statistically insignificant effects. In the international sample, the alias consultant makes an inquiry that is identical to the one in the U.S. control condition. In this case, however, the researcher purports to be from one of the basket of low-corruption countries discussed in treatment three above (Denmark, New Zealand, Finland, Sweden, Netherlands, Australia, Norway, or Austria), instead of from a \u2015Guineastan\u2016 nation. Prior evidence suggests that U.S. incorporators are probably inclined to offer anonymous incorporation to the bulk of their clients; however, we presume that providers worldwide may exercise more discretion. So, we posit that sending the control emails from one of the world\u2019s least-corrupt nations may raise fewer \u2015red flags,\u2016 as it were, and increase our likelihood of seeing effects from the various treatments. The first international treatment is nearly identical to the first treatment in the U.S. sample and invokes the regulatory power of the FATF. In a similar manner, we hypothesize that service providers worldwide should be somewhat more likely to follow international standards when they receive a prompt about the existence of these standards (H5). The second treatment is identical to the control, but it lists the United States as its country of origin instead of the non-corrupt basket of countries. In this case, we are evaluating the difference that a request from the U.S. as the global hegemon has on service\u2019s likelihood of allowing anonymous incorporation. We expect that most providers will be less likely to accept anonymous incorporation from hegemon-based clients and also predict that this treatment will garner some of our most significant results (H6). 23 The seventh and eighth treatments similarly reference the FATF, but they also offer rationales for raising the question of international law, mapping to different approaches core to the international relations literature. These treatments probe how incorporation services respond to rationalist or normative references to international standards. The treatment and matching hypothesis (H7) is designed to tap a constructivist logic of appropriateness. According to this view, actors engage in ethical reasoning to ensure their behavior conforms with generally shared conceptions of appropriate conduct. Thus H7 maintains that service providers will be more likely to comply, relative to the control condition but not necessarily compared to treatments one and two, if they are provided with cues about the appropriate course of action to preserve their self-esteem and reputation for propriety. The next treatment substitutes an explicitly rationalist logic of consequences whereby noncompliance runs the risk of costly punishment. Hypothesis eight thus explains compliance as a costbenefit calculation by service providers seeking to avoid sanctions (H8), and we expect that compliance should increase relative to the control, but are agnostic about whether compliance should be higher or lower than other conditions. \""}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "(This field was made required after this registration was initially submitted.)"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e2b02f087a1d900e21cf11c", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/y73bv/providers/osfstorage/5e2b02f087a1d900e21cf11c", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/y73bv/providers/osfstorage/5e2b02f087a1d900e21cf11c", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/y73bv/providers/osfstorage/5e2b02f087a1d900e21cf11c?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/y73bv/providers/osfstorage/5e2b02f087a1d900e21cf11c"}, "attributes": {"etag": "80f20399cb4f45b6086124b4444bf8eb94acb1dfc1a197091193eabd98d80e6d", "kind": "file", "name": "20110302AA_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e2b02f087a1d900e21cf11c", "size": 331269, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "a99967cf8736b97d7d4779f517cf35c6", "sha256": "30c6da1197f8391bceb15fc85e8e61fa9bbf15a266d29bb75414326ea569a944"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 331269, "modified": "2020-01-24T14:45:04.720884+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "y73bv", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20110302AA_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-01-24T14:45:04+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "y73bv", "sha256": "30c6da1197f8391bceb15fc85e8e61fa9bbf15a266d29bb75414326ea569a944", "viewUrl": "/project/h2jfm/files/osfstorage/5e2b02f4c19c5d00efedfe92/", "selectedFileName": "20110302AA_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20110302AA_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": {}, "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "The Causes of Compliance in International Relations: Evidence from a Field Experiment on Financial Transparency.\u00a0", "q2": "Mike Findley | Daniel Nielson | Jason Sharman | Shima Baradaran", "q3": "20110302AA", "q4": "03/01/2011 - 22:00", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "", "q9": "", "q10": "No", "q11": "", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "No", "q15": "\"Observational studies of compliance with international law have produced mixed findings and been plagued by methodological challenges that might be addressed through random assignment to treatment and control groups.

The body of studies that have probed the salience of positive income changes, such as interest payments from a savings account, is newer. Karlan et al (2010) find that reminders can increase savings, and boost salience of specific expenditures by labeling savings accounts with what the consumers hope to save for (for example, housing or education). Other studies explore ways in which collection services (Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin [2006]; Dupas and Robinson [2009]) or surveys (Stango and Zinman -2010) can increase savings by acting as a shock to attention, and this can be considered a form of increased salience.

review\n\nBackground: Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a worldwide public health problem. In last years, there is a growing evidence supporting craving, the irrepressible desire to drink, as a major mechanism implicated in AUD. Impulsivity is identified as playing a significant role in craving in many studies. However, relationships with inhibition and thought suppression remain unclear in the existing literature. A systematic review was conducted to evaluate their associations in order to better understand cognitive processes involved in craving.\nMethods: Studies were identified by searching PubMed, PsycINFO and Web of Science using PRISMA procedure and PICOTS framework. There were included if they assessed craving and thought suppression or inhibition or impulsivity, and sample composed of AUD participants.  \nResults: Fourteen studies were included and were categorized by cognitive process evaluated. The first part dealt with thought suppression and the second with impulsivity and inhibition. About a third of studies showed a positive association between thought suppression and increased craving. More than fifth of studies showed that poorer inhibition was associated with increased craving and more than third of studies showed that impulsivity was positively associated with craving. More than a tenth of studies showed a negative association between impulsivity and inhibition with higher craving. \nConclusions: Our review suggests that alcohol craving is associated with poorer inhibition and greater impulsivity.

In last years, there is a growing evidence supporting craving, the irrepressible desire to drink, as a major mechanism implicated in AUD. Impulsivity is identified as playing a significant role in craving in many studies. However, relationships with inhibition and thought suppression remain unclear in the existing literature.
