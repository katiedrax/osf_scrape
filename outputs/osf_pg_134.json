The formative construct will be linked to a reflective measure of acquired capability (i.e., the ACSS-FAD subscale and pain tolerance as measured by the ACSS). \n\nHypothesis #2 (Model 2): A second redundancy analysis model will be fitted to the data. In this model, 1 formative construct will be formed by the items on the PPES. The formative construct will be linked to latent variables that predict item scores on the negative urgency subscale and the sensation seeking subscale in the UPPS-P. \n\nBoth models will use covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) with maximum likelihood estimation.\n\nFollowing Chiu et al's (2018) procedure. We will use the following criteria to redesign the PPES so only the most relevant items to the formative construct are included:\n- Items will be considered for deletion if their path coefficient is too low (ideally, PC &gt; .8)\n- Items will be considered for deletion if there's a multicolinearity problem. If the variance inflation factor is greater than 3.3 then the item may be problematic.\n- Weights and bivariate correlations that are statistically nonsignificant will be considered for deletion.\n\nDue to the predominant use of multiple indicator multiple cause (MIMIC) models in formative measurement models, these models will be compared to the redundancy analysis models to see if there are any major discrepancies or differences. Several nested models of hypotheses 1 and 2 will be fitted to the data:\nModel 3: Hypothesis #1 will also be tested with a MIMIC model that has one latent variable and two reflective indicators (ACSS-FAD subscale scores and pain tolerance scores on the ACSS). A chi-square difference test between model 1 and model 3 will be used to see if the models are significantly different from each other.\n\nModel 4: Hypothesis #2 will be tested by fitting a model that has two latent variables (one latent variable corresponding to negative urgency and the second corresponding to sensation seeking). A chi-square difference test between model 2 and model 4 will be used to see if the models are significantly different from each other.
