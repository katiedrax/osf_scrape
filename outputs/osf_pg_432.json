We will follow the procedures described below. In the good institutions condition, (1) Participants are given the information about the game including that they will complete a clerical task, pay taxes into a common pot, and that the common pot will be evenly redistributed to all participants at the end of the game. Their compensation will depend on how well they complete the task, how they play the game, how others play the game, and chance. Specifically, they will be paid a specific amount of experimental currency units (ECU) for every line of numbers entered and these ECUs will be converted into dollars at the end of the game. (2) There will be one practice round of the clerical task where all students are employed. Participants will first be asked to vote for their preferred tax rate; the preferred tax rate is considered to be their redistributive preference and is our main dependent variable of interest. We will emphasize that the size of the tax rate determines how large the common pot is which then gets distributed to all participants at the end of each round. In the practice round, their performance will not determine their compensation. For the practice rounds, participants will complete the task and be updated with a list of pre- and post-tax earnings with individuals ranked from high to low productivity and their own position highlighted. This mimics the procedures for the subsequent actual rounds of the game. (3) Next, we hold several rounds of the actual game. First, participants will first find out if they were randomly assigned to be unemployed and will receive this message on their computer screen. Unemployed students will be asked to wait for this round to end and informed that this does not mean they will necessarily be unemployed in future rounds of the game. (4) Tax Rate 1 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the first time. The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote. Participants will complete 3 rounds of the clerical task. Each round some participants will be randomly assigned to be unemployed or not. At the end of all 3 rounds, participants are updated with the information from the previous 3 rounds. This includes pre- and post-tax earnings, the productivity of all participants, and where their own productivity lies. (5) Tax Rate 2 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the second time. The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote. Participants will complete 3 rounds of the clerical task. Each round some participants will be randomly assigned to be unemployed or not. At the end of all 3 rounds, participants are updated with the information from the previous 3 rounds. This includes pre- and post-tax earnings, the productivity of all participants, and where their own productivity lies. (6) Tax Rate 3 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the third and final time. The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote. Participants will complete 3 rounds of the clerical task. Each round some participants will be randomly assigned to be unemployed or not. (7) At the end of all of the rounds, participants will complete a short survey including questions about social trust and an incentivized risk question (a short gambling game). In the first tax evasion treatment (uniform audit risk) of the game: (1) As above, participants are given the basic information about how the game is played. (2) Unlike the good institutions scenario described above, participants will additionally be told they can choose what percentage of their earnings to report at the end of the round. Taxes will only be paid on reported income and all individuals face a low probability (10%) of being audited. Audited individuals who have under-reported their income must pay a fee of 2 times the amount which they hid. These funds are not placed into the social policy pool for future redistribution. We will truthfully inform individuals that the probability of audit is the same across individuals and exogenous. That is, it does not depend on the percentage of earnings reported or productivity. Subjects will be allowed to choose to report any percentage of their earnings between 0% and 100%. Participants will not know how many rounds they will be playing, but they will be informed beforehand that we will be updating them with information about how much each participant earns, how much each person pays in taxes, and the extent of underreporting. They will be told that this information will be anonymized (they will not know who earned or reported certain amounts). (8) Practice round as described above. (3) Next, we hold several rounds of the actual game. a. Tax Rate 1 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the first time. The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote. Participants will complete 3 rounds of the clerical task. Each round some participants will be randomly assigned to be unemployed or not. At the end of all 3 rounds, participants are updated with the information from the previous 3 rounds. This includes pre- and post-tax earnings, the productivity of all participants, their own productivity, and the rate of actual cheating in the previous three rounds. Participants will be asked to choose what percentage of income to report and reminded that there is a uniform and low risk of audit that is not linked to how much they earned or how much income they choose to report. b. Tax Rate 2 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the second time. The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote. Participants will complete 3 rounds of the clerical task. Each round some participants will be randomly assigned to be unemployed or not. At the end of these 3 rounds, participants are updated with the information from the previous 3 rounds. This includes pre- and post-tax earnings, the productivity of all participants, their own productivity, and the rate of actual cheating in the previous three rounds. Participants will be asked to choose what percentage of income to report and reminded that there is a uniform and low risk of audit that is not linked to how much they earned or how much income they choose to report. c. Tax Rate 3 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the third and final time. The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote. Participants will complete 3 rounds of the clerical task. Each round some participants will be randomly assigned to be unemployed or not. (4) At the end of all of the rounds, participants will complete a short survey including questions about social trust and an incentivized risk question (a short gambling game). In the second tax evasion treatment (variable audit risk) of the game: (1) As above, participants are given the basic information about how the game is played. (2) Unlike the scenarios described above, participants will also be told they will be allowed to decide what percentage of their earnings to report at the end of the round as in the first tax cheating treatment. This time, however, probability of being audited will be either 10 or 70% (participants will have a 50/50 chance of being assigned either risk of audit). Each participant will have the same risk of audit throughout all of the rounds below. Those who are audited and caught under-reporting their income will pay the tax plus a fine equal to the amount of the tax. Note that the common pot is only funded by reported income and even if participants are caught underreporting, the penalty will not go into the common pot. The idea is to see how different risks of audit influence individual rates of cheating and how the differing risks of audit interact with other individual level characteristics (especially productivity) to influence preferences for redistribution. Again, participants will be truthfully informed that audit risk is exogenous and not tied to income or how much they underreport. (3) Practice round as described above. Everyone is employed in the practice round, tax evasion will be allowed to let participants see how that works, and participants will receive the information about pre and post income. (4) Next, we will hold several rounds of the actual game. a. Tax Rate 1 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the first time. The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote. Participants will complete 3 rounds of the clerical task. Each round some participants will be randomly assigned to be unemployed or not. At the end of all 3 rounds, participants are updated with the information from the previous 3 rounds. This includes pre- and post-tax earnings, the productivity of all participants, their own productivity, and the rate of actual underreporting in the previous three rounds. Participants will be asked to choose what percentage of income to report and reminded that there is a uniform and low risk of audit that is not linked to how much they earned or how much income they choose to report. b. Tax Rate 2 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the second time. The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote. Participants will complete 3 rounds of the clerical task. Each round some participants will be randomly assigned to be unemployed or not. At the end of these 3 rounds, participants are updated with the information from the previous 3 rounds. This includes pre- and post-tax earnings, the productivity of all participants, their own productivity, and the rate of actual underreporting in the previous three rounds. Participants will be asked to choose what percentage of income to report and reminded that there is a uniform and low risk of audit that is not linked to how much they earned or how much income they choose to report. c. Tax Rate 3 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the third and final time. The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote. Participants will complete 3 rounds of the clerical task. Each round some participants will be randomly assigned to be unemployed or not. (5) At the end of all of the rounds, participants will complete a short survey including questions about social trust and an incentivized risk question. Note that it is important for this to be played as a game in which there are real consequences for a person\u2019s compensation depending on how she and other group members play. There is evidence that simply setting up a hypothetical scenario will not produce realistic results. The game is designed to mimic a realistic situation in which there is a risk of unemployment and individuals vary in their productivity. ************ Survey questions \u2022 Risk aversion (gambling game): asked before any of the other parts of the experiment \u2022 Socioeconomic questions (age, marital status, education, income, employment, current employer, current position) \u2022 Government spending preferences (8 different categories) \u2022 Government responsibility preferences (7 different categories) \u2022 Degree to which an individual is law-abiding \u2022 Social trust \u2022 Perception of institutions (how fair do you think the system is) o 5 categories of answers from strongly disagree to strongly agree with a \u201chard to say\u201d answer o Several Statements \uf0a7 Politicians typically follow through on their policy promises. \uf0a7 Government policies change frequently. \uf0a7 Most people pay their taxes. \uf0a7 Government officials can generally be relied upon to follow laws. \uf0a7 It is easy to get the state-provided benefits to which I am entitled. \uf0a7 Government officials are typically corrupt."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "USA, Russia"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "15-0462"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "28-Aug-15"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Lab Experiments"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Corruption", "Development", "Governance"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e3842acfa39b7015c1dcd23", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/knq8a/providers/osfstorage/5e3842acfa39b7015c1dcd23", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/knq8a/providers/osfstorage/5e3842acfa39b7015c1dcd23", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/knq8a/providers/osfstorage/5e3842acfa39b7015c1dcd23?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/knq8a/providers/osfstorage/5e3842acfa39b7015c1dcd23"}, "attributes": {"etag": "b72526d5908fd085a6c17f7a249044a51b168b940a23a3051b3e91ad7fa8029d", "kind": "file", "name": "20160225AA_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e3842acfa39b7015c1dcd23", "size": 154608, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "1debbb7e96482463985de72950de7609", "sha256": "c05483b562e5c02ec799229976aca6a383dee3abf6f25677a61b4e827fd36a7c"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 154608, "modified": "2020-02-03T15:56:28.264549+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "knq8a", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20160225AA_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T15:56:28+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "knq8a", "sha256": "c05483b562e5c02ec799229976aca6a383dee3abf6f25677a61b4e827fd36a7c", "viewUrl": "/project/h3afy/files/osfstorage/5e3842b1fa39b701481dd256/", "selectedFileName": "20160225AA_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20160225AA_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "The Foundations of Social Policy Support: Experimental Evidence on How Institutional Quality Affects Redistributive Preferences", "q2": "Sarah Wilson Sokhey | Joseph B.

In each country, we assign 3 groups per condition for a total of 9 groups in each location. For each session, we anticipate roughly 12-15 students will participate. We will have up to 150 participants in each location meaning a maximum of 300 participants total.

Hypothesis 3 (Productivity x Risk of Audit): Generally, more productive individuals should prefer less redistribution according to the classic Meltzer-Richard model. We expect that the risk of audit and individual levels of productivity to have an interactive effect which alters this traditional expectation. Individuals who are highly productive and have a low risk of audit should be the most likely to cheat and prefer more redistribution because they benefit from both cheating and redistribution.", "q17": "In each session, participants will play 10 rounds (1 practice round and 9 actual rounds). We will follow the procedures described below. In the good institutions condition, (1) Participants are given the information about the game including that they will complete a clerical task, pay taxes into a common pot, and that the common pot will be evenly redistributed to all participants at the end of the game. Their compensation will depend on how well they complete the task, how they play the game, how others play the game, and chance. Specifically, they will be paid a specific amount of experimental currency units (ECU) for every line of numbers entered and these ECUs will be converted into dollars at the end of the game. (2) There will be one practice round of the clerical task where all students are employed. Participants will first be asked to vote for their preferred tax rate; the preferred tax rate is considered to be their redistributive preference and is our main dependent variable of interest. We will emphasize that the size of the tax rate determines how large the common pot is which then gets distributed to all participants at the end of each round. In the practice round, their performance will not determine their compensation. For the practice rounds, participants will complete the task and be updated with a list of pre- and post-tax earnings with individuals ranked from high to low productivity and their own position highlighted. This mimics the procedures for the subsequent actual rounds of the game. (3) Next, we hold several rounds of the actual game. First, participants will first find out if they were randomly assigned to be unemployed and will receive this message on their computer screen. Unemployed students will be asked to wait for this round to end and informed that this does not mean they will necessarily be unemployed in future rounds of the game. (4) Tax Rate 1 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the first time. The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote. Participants will complete 3 rounds of the clerical task. Each round some participants will be randomly assigned to be unemployed or not. At the end of all 3 rounds, participants are updated with the information from the previous 3 rounds. This includes pre- and post-tax earnings, the productivity of all participants, and where their own productivity lies. (5) Tax Rate 2 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the second time. The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote. Participants will complete 3 rounds of the clerical task. Each round some participants will be randomly assigned to be unemployed or not. At the end of all 3 rounds, participants are updated with the information from the previous 3 rounds. This includes pre- and post-tax earnings, the productivity of all participants, and where their own productivity lies. (6) Tax Rate 3 (3 rounds of clerical task): Participants will vote on a preferred tax rate for the third and final time. The actual tax rate will be the median tax rate for which participants vote.

December of 2007. Because of the sensitivity of the election, several organizations sent observer delegations. With so many different organizations present, the recommendations and observations made by different organizations diverged considerably. Furthermore, one of the most prominent institutions sending observers, the European Union, did not issue its report until late May of 2013, nearly two months after the election and significantly after the promised date. The conflicting assessments and the delay called into question both the impartiality of election monitors and the utility of their pronouncements. It also caused African officials to publicly doubt the validity of non-African election observers sent to the region (Kelley 2013). This example and many others like it raises the question: what attributes of election monitoring organizations determine whether domestic actors view a given organization as credible or legitimate (Hyde 2012)? This is germane for international organizations more broadly, but it is a particularly relevant question in the context of international election observer organizations, which countries invite with the very goal of validating their own elections\u2019 legitimacy (Kelley 2008, 230, Hyde 2011). If different organizations make different pronouncements after an election, which organizations do citizens believe? Which assessments do journalists report? Who gains authority and why? The question of organizational credibility and legitimacy is particularly interesting in a realm such as election monitoring in which multiple organizations vie for influence in a given election (Kelley 2009). Whether election monitoring organizations are present matters: they can reduce fraud in the polling stations they visit (Hyde 2007). But it also matters which organizations are present, because not all organizations are equally effective (Kelley 2012, Ch. 7). Thus the credibility and perceptions of legitimacy of these organizations matter both for their ability to function and for how citizens and societies weigh their contributions. In this project we examine the sources of credibility for election monitoring organizations, both domestic and international, and for IGOs as well as NGOs. The inclusion of a more varied set of organizations allows us to speak more generally to the sources of credibility and legitimacy, which, at least theoretically, have been posited to have similarities across the international and domestic contexts. The next section discusses the sources of credibility and legitimacy and derives a set of general hypotheses. After that, we explain how we use a global experiment on non-governmental organizations to test the hypotheses. The basic research design discussion includes an explanation of how the hypotheses are operationalized in the context of election monitoring organizations. The last section discusses the analysis plan."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Legitimacy Hypotheses. Compared to baseline, actors perceive organizations as more legitimate and credible if they: H1: Procedural Operate transparently, consistent with established rules H2: Independence Act autonomously and independently from sponsoring organizations or target countries H3: Normative Subscribe to universally accepted values H4: Profile Are recognized broadly in media and on the internet H5: Isomorphic Invoke identification based on geography, language or culture H6: Organizational Are managed by governments as opposed to being private, non-governmental organizations"}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "In order to test the effects of information about different organizational attributes on perceived legitimacy, we will conduct a survey experiment with behavioral outcomes in assessing the perceived credibility and legitimacy of prominent international election monitoring organizations. We will send emails to some 14,000 NGOs globally encouraging them to vote in favor of inviting different international governmental organizations (IGOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) involved in election observation to observe the next election in the NGOs\u2019 (respondents\u2019) home countries. We will inform the NGOs that their votes in favor of inviting specific groups will be shared with the election observation organizations so that they can make their decisions on which elections to observe next with fuller information from civil society groups. Thus, even though this outcome measure is embedded within what is a survey instrument, it is similar to behavioral outcomes in other studies like signing a petition or sending a postcard. After receiving an email addressed to the NGO, subjects (NGOs) that choose to participate will click on a link to a Qualtrics instrument that will guide them through the survey experiment, which will randomly assign different primes regarding election-monitoring attributes to each participating NGO. The primes will be associated at random with 7 different election observation organizations. Subject NGOs will be able to use the Qualtrics instruments to express support for inviting the election observation organizations one-by-one on a sliding scale from -5 to +5. After the NGO subjects recommend the organizations one-by-one, they will be shown all seven organizations in a list along with summary statements of the priming conditions and asked to assign 100 votes across the 7 organizations. This should enable us to acquire a more nuanced set of revealed preferences for the various organizations potentially affected by the randomly assigned primes. It should be noted that this research design is not optimal for testing the heuristic hypotheses. Heuristics are assumed to operate most strongly in the absence of information, but in this case we are actually providing subjects with information about election monitors, so this may dampen or replace any real-world tendency to rely on heuristics. Furthermore, some heuristic conditions, such as level of exposure to an organization (profile) cannot easily be simulated in our design. Telling people that an organization is prominent is not necessarily equivalent to those people having been highly exposed to it in actuality). That said, if the heuristic hypotheses are supported by significant results in this experiment, this should be persuasive. Before discussing the experiment and the analysis plan in greater depth, we first discuss the treatment primes. Experimental Conditions For each respondent, each of eight election observer groups will be randomly assigned one prime that frames a characteristic corresponding to the theorized sources of organizations\u2019 perceived legitimacy outlined above. For each of the following hypotheses and corresponding treatments, the subject will be asked: \u201cPlease move the slider bar into the position that best represents your desire to support or oppose the above-mentioned election observing organization to observe the next election in your country. A score of 5 represents that you strongly support this organization; a score of -5 indicates that you strongly oppose the organization.\u201d Two of the seven statements will be placebo or control as follows: Control 1 \u201cOrganization X actively observes elections. It is an election observing organization that sends a team of observers to report on the general conduct of national elections in different countries.\u201d Control 2 \"Organization X regularly undertakes election observation missions. Through the election period in various countries, trained observers follow up on developments at polling stations and monitor the vote count.\" The next section discusses each of the hypotheses and associated treatment language. H1. Independence Legitimacy Monitors are mandated to render quality assessments by being honest and independent in their assessment (Hyde 2012) and offering constructive suggestions for improvements in the electoral processes, both before and after the elections. That is, monitors may even visit countries before an election and offer recommendations as to how the election is organized. We therefore operationalize performance legitimacy with the following primes. The Independence Treatment focuses on observation organizations\u2019 ability to deliver an independent assessment. All of the organizations used in the experiment endorse the United Nations Declaration of Principles on International Election Observation from which the quoted language is drawn. Independence Treatment \u201cOrganization X seeks to be independent in election observation. It professes \u2018to conduct an impartial and professional analysis of ... information; and to draw conclusions about the character of electoral processes based on the highest standards for accuracy of information and impartiality of analysis.\u2019\u201d H2. Procedural Legitimacy The Procedural Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they operate transparently and consistent with established rules. In the case of election monitoring organizations, procedural legitimacy will be higher for organizations that follow clear rules of election observation as set by international standard and that produce accessible and thorough assessments (Hyde 2012). Such rules would include only observing elections conditional on an invitation from a state, having systematic and transparent ways of recording data, issuing timely reports, and never interfering with the conduct of the election. We therefore operationalize procedural legitimacy with the following prime, again with quoted language drawn from the United Nations Declaration of Principles on International Election Observation: Procedural Treatment \u201cOrganization X emphasizes proper procedures. It professes to follow \u2018systematic, comprehensive and accurate gathering of information concerning the laws, processes and institutions related to the conduct of elections and other factors concerning the overall electoral environment.\u2019\u201d H3: Normative Legitimacy The Normative Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they subscribe to universally accepted values. For election monitoring organizations, normative legitimacy is about the electoral and democratic norms the observers represent and the extent to which people perceive these as converging with international norms. We therefore operationalize procedural legitimacy with the following prime: Normative Treatment \u201cOrganization X seeks to uphold norms of democracy. It is committed to the idea that the will of the people of a country is the basis for the authority of government, and that will must be determined through genuine periodic elections.\u201d H4. Profile Legitimacy The Profile Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they are prevalent, if they hear more about them, or if they learn that others consider them as opinion leaders. In the case of election monitoring, people may perceive an organization as more legitimate it is very visible or active or has a long history of operating within a country, or if it is well known for example as evidenced by often being referenced by other organizations, the media, and governments whom citizens may consider appropriate opinion leaders. Name recognition itself may be valuable, even if the organization is known for things other than election monitoring. We therefore operationalize prevalence legitimacy with the following primes. Profile Treatment \u201cOrganization X is well known. It is one of the most widely recognized election observation organizations based on coverage by international media and attention on the internet.\u201d H5. Isomorphic Legitimacy The Isomorphism Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they invoke identification based on geography, language or culture. For international election monitoring, this means that people are more likely to perceived organizations as legitimate if they are more local or indigenous. Regional organizations may therefore be seen as more legitimate than global, or western, ones. An example of this occurred when, in March 2013, former Nigeria president, Olusegun Obasanjo gave a keynote address at the 7th Annual symposium of the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA) in Johannesburg, and argued that \u201cnon-African election observer missions should be banned from monitoring polls in the continent,\u201d because they \u201cwere sometimes biased and that their position sometimes seemed to undermine the sovereignty of African countries.\u201d We therefore operationalize Isomorphic Legitimacy with the following primes for regional compard to global organizations: Isomorphism treatments Regional \u201cOrganization X is headquartered in [regional capital] and operates in [region]. Global \u201cOrganization X is headquartered in [foreign capital] and operates globally. Amendment to Protocol This is an amendment to the prior protocol submitted in November of 2015. Nearly all of the research design elements are identical to the original study. However, in an additional round of survey experiments, a new subject pool of roughly 30,000 NGOs (drawn from the World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations) will be randomly assigned to two different experimental arms. The first arm is identical to that described above in the November 2015 protocol. The second arm, however, rather than assigning subjects initially to assess the credibility of actual electoral observation groups instead will be asked to evaluate hypothetical groups with names removed, so \u201cOrganization A,\u201d \u201cOrganization B,\u201d etc. All of the priming treatment language is identical across treatment arms. Randomly assigned hypothetical conditions also include whether the organization is a \u201cprivate organization without government involvement\u201d or an \u201cinternational organization managed by governments.\u201d The headquarters of the hypothetical organization is also randomly assigned as being in Europe, America, Africa, or Asia. After subjects rate the credibility of the hypothetical organizations, they are given the opportunity to express support for actual organizations by name without additional descriptions. All language and design features, including outcomes of interest, are otherwise identical across the two treatment arms. Outcomes of Interest The Qualtrics platform will prompt subject NGOs to provide two different types of recommended invitations to the election monitors: 1. NGO level of support, -5 to 5 -point scale from least to most favored for an invitation to observe the NGOs\u2019 home countries\u2019 next elections. The order in which the organizations are presented will be randomized along with the priming statement for each of the factors that we hypothesize will drive legitimacy perceptions. 2. NGO 100-Point Voting. After the initial questions about endorsements based on randomly assigned priming states, subjects will be shown the list of the organizations along with summaries of the priming statements in random order and be invited to assign a number of votes summing to 100 to each of the organizations. Subjects will see the following statement: \u201cCommunicating Your Voice We are interested in your organization\u2019s opinion about which international election observation groups should be invited to observe the next national elections in your country. Below you will find a list of seven different election observation groups that could potentially be invited to observe the next elections along with brief information about each group. In order to communicate how strongly you feel about which organizations should be invited, you are given 100 \u201cvotes\u201d to cast across the seven groups. More votes mean that you feel more strongly that the group should be invited. The 100 votes may be cast in any way you choose across the organizations listed. You can give all your votes to one organization or give some votes to several organizations. It is okay for some organizations to receive no votes. The rankings will enable us to convey which organizations you think should be invited and to provide more detailed information about the strength of your opinions to the election observation organizations.\u201d It is important to note here that the relative level of endorsement received by each of the election monitoring organizations compared to the others will not affect the results in expectation. Each organization serves as its own control, and the treatment effects should thus reflect the relative causal influence of each of the priming statements on NGO support for each organization compared to the placebo statements. We included two placebo conditions to help improve statistical power given the multiple comparisons planned. We will randomly assign the five treatment statements plus two placebos such that each subject sees one of the seven statements associated with each of the seven organizations on the list, one-by-one. In the guided Qualtrics survey instrument, subjects will first be invited to rate the specific organization on the -5 to 5-point scale. Next, subjects will then be shown all seven organizations along with the prompts and asked to distribute the 100 votes. Note that we will not be manipulating the attributes of the organizations per se, since those features are in a real sense already set. But we will be manipulating primes or salient information about the features by providing different prompts. The priming effects, while potentially different from the actual underlying sources of legitimacy and credibility, should nevertheless still be consistent with the theory of legitimacy that we have augmented above. This should give us a relative ranking of treatment effects of information regarding the posited sources of legitimacy. The level of endorsement may give us some separation across the treatments and placebo, but the 100-point voting for the election observer organizations should be an even more sensitive measure that ought to capture relative legitimacy of each election observer organization and, on average, the effects the treatments have on the relative rankings. For example, if the independence statement induces more public endorsement and a higher ranking for the EU compared to the placebo, then we might conclude that information about independence in some sense causes improved legitimacy or credibility. Subject Pool The experiment will be performed on more than 14,000 NGOs involved in international development drawn from the Directory of Development Organizations. Many NGOs will choose not to participate in the study \u2013 indeed, our prior experiments with subjects from this database suggest that the base rate expected for the response proportion will be relatively low (roughly five percent). Nevertheless, since each subject will be making 7 endorsements each and also completing the 100-point voting for each organization, we should have sufficient power to detect meaningful treatment effects. The selected international observers organizations for NGOs in each global region are listed below and their assignments are indicated in the table. These organizations were selected to obtain a set of realistic actors that spanned a variety of regional and global origins and that might plausibly observe elections in given countries given their regional affiliation. Amendment to Protocol In addition to the 14,000 NGOs employed in the November 2015 study, an additional study was undertaken employing two treatment arms \u2013 hypothetical organizations and real organizations \u2013 as described in the amendment section above. The new study was conducted on roughly 30,000 NGOs drawn from the World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations. Contact of subjects and administration of the survey experiment was otherwise identical to the November 2015 design. This amendment was registered before researchers had access to the additional data.

Because of the sensitivity of the election, several organizations sent observer delegations. With so many different organizations present, the recommendations and observations made by different organizations diverged considerably. Furthermore, one of the most prominent institutions sending observers, the European Union, did not issue its report until late May of 2013, nearly two months after the election and significantly after the promised date. The conflicting assessments and the delay called into question both the impartiality of election monitors and the utility of their pronouncements. It also caused African officials to publicly doubt the validity of non-African election observers sent to the region (Kelley 2013). This example and many others like it raises the question: what attributes of election monitoring organizations determine whether domestic actors view a given organization as credible or legitimate (Hyde 2012)? This is germane for international organizations more broadly, but it is a particularly relevant question in the context of international election observer organizations, which countries invite with the very goal of validating their own elections\u2019 legitimacy (Kelley 2008, 230, Hyde 2011). If different organizations make different pronouncements after an election, which organizations do citizens believe? Which assessments do journalists report? Who gains authority and why? The question of organizational credibility and legitimacy is particularly interesting in a realm such as election monitoring in which multiple organizations vie for influence in a given election (Kelley 2009). Whether election monitoring organizations are present matters: they can reduce fraud in the polling stations they visit (Hyde 2007). But it also matters which organizations are present, because not all organizations are equally effective (Kelley 2012, Ch. 7). Thus the credibility and perceptions of legitimacy of these organizations matter both for their ability to function and for how citizens and societies weigh their contributions. In this project we examine the sources of credibility for election monitoring organizations, both domestic and international, and for IGOs as well as NGOs. The inclusion of a more varied set of organizations allows us to speak more generally to the sources of credibility and legitimacy, which, at least theoretically, have been posited to have similarities across the international and domestic contexts. The next section discusses the sources of credibility and legitimacy and derives a set of general hypotheses. After that, we explain how we use a global experiment on non-governmental organizations to test the hypotheses. The basic research design discussion includes an explanation of how the hypotheses are operationalized in the context of election monitoring organizations. The last section discusses the analysis plan.", "q16": "Legitimacy Hypotheses. Compared to baseline, actors perceive organizations as more legitimate and credible if they: H1: Procedural Operate transparently, consistent with established rules H2: Independence Act autonomously and independently from sponsoring organizations or target countries H3: Normative Subscribe to universally accepted values H4: Profile Are recognized broadly in media and on the internet H5: Isomorphic Invoke identification based on geography, language or culture H6: Organizational Are managed by governments as opposed to being private, non-governmental organizations", "q17": "In order to test the effects of information about different organizational attributes on perceived legitimacy, we will conduct a survey experiment with behavioral outcomes in assessing the perceived credibility and legitimacy of prominent international election monitoring organizations. We will send emails to some 14,000 NGOs globally encouraging them to vote in favor of inviting different international governmental organizations (IGOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) involved in election observation to observe the next election in the NGOs\u2019 (respondents\u2019) home countries. We will inform the NGOs that their votes in favor of inviting specific groups will be shared with the election observation organizations so that they can make their decisions on which elections to observe next with fuller information from civil society groups. Thus, even though this outcome measure is embedded within what is a survey instrument, it is similar to behavioral outcomes in other studies like signing a petition or sending a postcard. After receiving an email addressed to the NGO, subjects (NGOs) that choose to participate will click on a link to a Qualtrics instrument that will guide them through the survey experiment, which will randomly assign different primes regarding election-monitoring attributes to each participating NGO. The primes will be associated at random with 7 different election observation organizations. Subject NGOs will be able to use the Qualtrics instruments to express support for inviting the election observation organizations one-by-one on a sliding scale from -5 to +5. After the NGO subjects recommend the organizations one-by-one, they will be shown all seven organizations in a list along with summary statements of the priming conditions and asked to assign 100 votes across the 7 organizations. This should enable us to acquire a more nuanced set of revealed preferences for the various organizations potentially affected by the randomly assigned primes. It should be noted that this research design is not optimal for testing the heuristic hypotheses. Heuristics are assumed to operate most strongly in the absence of information, but in this case we are actually providing subjects with information about election monitors, so this may dampen or replace any real-world tendency to rely on heuristics. Furthermore, some heuristic conditions, such as level of exposure to an organization (profile) cannot easily be simulated in our design. Telling people that an organization is prominent is not necessarily equivalent to those people having been highly exposed to it in actuality). That said, if the heuristic hypotheses are supported by significant results in this experiment, this should be persuasive. Before discussing the experiment and the analysis plan in greater depth, we first discuss the treatment primes. Experimental Conditions For each respondent, each of eight election observer groups will be randomly assigned one prime that frames a characteristic corresponding to the theorized sources of organizations\u2019 perceived legitimacy outlined above. For each of the following hypotheses and corresponding treatments, the subject will be asked: \u201cPlease move the slider bar into the position that best represents your desire to support or oppose the above-mentioned election observing organization to observe the next election in your country. A score of 5 represents that you strongly support this organization; a score of -5 indicates that you strongly oppose the organization.\u201d Two of the seven statements will be placebo or control as follows: Control 1 \u201cOrganization X actively observes elections. It is an election observing organization that sends a team of observers to report on the general conduct of national elections in different countries.\u201d Control 2 \"Organization X regularly undertakes election observation missions. Through the election period in various countries, trained observers follow up on developments at polling stations and monitor the vote count.\" The next section discusses each of the hypotheses and associated treatment language. H1. Independence Legitimacy Monitors are mandated to render quality assessments by being honest and independent in their assessment (Hyde 2012) and offering constructive suggestions for improvements in the electoral processes, both before and after the elections. That is, monitors may even visit countries before an election and offer recommendations as to how the election is organized. We therefore operationalize performance legitimacy with the following primes. The Independence Treatment focuses on observation organizations\u2019 ability to deliver an independent assessment. All of the organizations used in the experiment endorse the United Nations Declaration of Principles on International Election Observation from which the quoted language is drawn. Independence Treatment \u201cOrganization X seeks to be independent in election observation. It professes \u2018to conduct an impartial and professional analysis of ... information; and to draw conclusions about the character of electoral processes based on the highest standards for accuracy of information and impartiality of analysis.\u2019\u201d H2. Procedural Legitimacy The Procedural Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they operate transparently and consistent with established rules. In the case of election monitoring organizations, procedural legitimacy will be higher for organizations that follow clear rules of election observation as set by international standard and that produce accessible and thorough assessments (Hyde 2012). Such rules would include only observing elections conditional on an invitation from a state, having systematic and transparent ways of recording data, issuing timely reports, and never interfering with the conduct of the election. We therefore operationalize procedural legitimacy with the following prime, again with quoted language drawn from the United Nations Declaration of Principles on International Election Observation: Procedural Treatment \u201cOrganization X emphasizes proper procedures. It professes to follow \u2018systematic, comprehensive and accurate gathering of information concerning the laws, processes and institutions related to the conduct of elections and other factors concerning the overall electoral environment.\u2019\u201d H3: Normative Legitimacy The Normative Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they subscribe to universally accepted values. For election monitoring organizations, normative legitimacy is about the electoral and democratic norms the observers represent and the extent to which people perceive these as converging with international norms. We therefore operationalize procedural legitimacy with the following prime: Normative Treatment \u201cOrganization X seeks to uphold norms of democracy. It is committed to the idea that the will of the people of a country is the basis for the authority of government, and that will must be determined through genuine periodic elections.\u201d H4. Profile Legitimacy The Profile Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they are prevalent, if they hear more about them, or if they learn that others consider them as opinion leaders. In the case of election monitoring, people may perceive an organization as more legitimate it is very visible or active or has a long history of operating within a country, or if it is well known for example as evidenced by often being referenced by other organizations, the media, and governments whom citizens may consider appropriate opinion leaders. Name recognition itself may be valuable, even if the organization is known for things other than election monitoring. We therefore operationalize prevalence legitimacy with the following primes. Profile Treatment \u201cOrganization X is well known. It is one of the most widely recognized election observation organizations based on coverage by international media and attention on the internet.\u201d H5. Isomorphic Legitimacy The Isomorphism Hypothesis states that actors perceive organizations as more legitimate if they invoke identification based on geography, language or culture. For international election monitoring, this means that people are more likely to perceived organizations as legitimate if they are more local or indigenous. Regional organizations may therefore be seen as more legitimate than global, or western, ones. An example of this occurred when, in March 2013, former Nigeria president, Olusegun Obasanjo gave a keynote address at the 7th Annual symposium of the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA) in Johannesburg, and argued that \u201cnon-African election observer missions should be banned from monitoring polls in the continent,\u201d because they \u201cwere sometimes biased and that their position sometimes seemed to undermine the sovereignty of African countries.\u201d We therefore operationalize Isomorphic Legitimacy with the following primes for regional compard to global organizations: Isomorphism treatments Regional \u201cOrganization X is headquartered in [regional capital] and operates in [region]. Global \u201cOrganization X is headquartered in [foreign capital] and operates globally. Amendment to Protocol This is an amendment to the prior protocol submitted in November of 2015. Nearly all of the research design elements are identical to the original study. However, in an additional round of survey experiments, a new subject pool of roughly 30,000 NGOs (drawn from the World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations) will be randomly assigned to two different experimental arms. The first arm is identical to that described above in the November 2015 protocol. The second arm, however, rather than assigning subjects initially to assess the credibility of actual electoral observation groups instead will be asked to evaluate hypothetical groups with names removed, so \u201cOrganization A,\u201d \u201cOrganization B,\u201d etc. All of the priming treatment language is identical across treatment arms. Randomly assigned hypothetical conditions also include whether the organization is a \u201cprivate organization without government involvement\u201d or an \u201cinternational organization managed by governments.\u201d The headquarters of the hypothetical organization is also randomly assigned as being in Europe, America, Africa, or Asia. After subjects rate the credibility of the hypothetical organizations, they are given the opportunity to express support for actual organizations by name without additional descriptions. All language and design features, including outcomes of interest, are otherwise identical across the two treatment arms. Outcomes of Interest The Qualtrics platform will prompt subject NGOs to provide two different types of recommended invitations to the election monitors: 1. NGO level of support, -5 to 5 -point scale from least to most favored for an invitation to observe the NGOs\u2019 home countries\u2019 next elections. The order in which the organizations are presented will be randomized along with the priming statement for each of the factors that we hypothesize will drive legitimacy perceptions. 2. NGO 100-Point Voting. After the initial questions about endorsements based on randomly assigned priming states, subjects will be shown the list of the organizations along with summaries of the priming statements in random order and be invited to assign a number of votes summing to 100 to each of the organizations. Subjects will see the following statement: \u201cCommunicating Your Voice We are interested in your organization\u2019s opinion about which international election observation groups should be invited to observe the next national elections in your country. Below you will find a list of seven different election observation groups that could potentially be invited to observe the next elections along with brief information about each group. In order to communicate how strongly you feel about which organizations should be invited, you are given 100 \u201cvotes\u201d to cast across the seven groups. More votes mean that you feel more strongly that the group should be invited. The 100 votes may be cast in any way you choose across the organizations listed. You can give all your votes to one organization or give some votes to several organizations. It is okay for some organizations to receive no votes. The rankings will enable us to convey which organizations you think should be invited and to provide more detailed information about the strength of your opinions to the election observation organizations.\u201d It is important to note here that the relative level of endorsement received by each of the election monitoring organizations compared to the others will not affect the results in expectation. Each organization serves as its own control, and the treatment effects should thus reflect the relative causal influence of each of the priming statements on NGO support for each organization compared to the placebo statements. We included two placebo conditions to help improve statistical power given the multiple comparisons planned. We will randomly assign the five treatment statements plus two placebos such that each subject sees one of the seven statements associated with each of the seven organizations on the list, one-by-one. In the guided Qualtrics survey instrument, subjects will first be invited to rate the specific organization on the -5 to 5-point scale. Next, subjects will then be shown all seven organizations along with the prompts and asked to distribute the 100 votes. Note that we will not be manipulating the attributes of the organizations per se, since those features are in a real sense already set. But we will be manipulating primes or salient information about the features by providing different prompts. The priming effects, while potentially different from the actual underlying sources of legitimacy and credibility, should nevertheless still be consistent with the theory of legitimacy that we have augmented above. This should give us a relative ranking of treatment effects of information regarding the posited sources of legitimacy. The level of endorsement may give us some separation across the treatments and placebo, but the 100-point voting for the election observer organizations should be an even more sensitive measure that ought to capture relative legitimacy of each election observer organization and, on average, the effects the treatments have on the relative rankings. For example, if the independence statement induces more public endorsement and a higher ranking for the EU compared to the placebo, then we might conclude that information about independence in some sense causes improved legitimacy or credibility. Subject Pool The experiment will be performed on more than 14,000 NGOs involved in international development drawn from the Directory of Development Organizations.

These organizations were selected to obtain a set of realistic actors that spanned a variety of regional and global origins and that might plausibly observe elections in given countries given their regional affiliation. Amendment to Protocol In addition to the 14,000 NGOs employed in the November 2015 study, an additional study was undertaken employing two treatment arms \u2013 hypothetical organizations and real organizations \u2013 as described in the amendment section above. The new study was conducted on roughly 30,000 NGOs drawn from the World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations.

Although research on the topic has gone somewhat dormant in recent years, a conventional wisdom seems to be that they should, and virtually all the major cross-national survey data projects have elected to do so. In two population-based survey experiments to be conducted in Mexico, I will assess the impact of question wording on the measure of mass partisanship.

There will be three treatments: (1) a verbal labeling/listing of a nonpartisanship option without a verbal labeling of party options, (2) no verbal labeling of either, (3) a verbal labeling of party options without a verbal labeling of a nonpartisanship option. Based on existing best practices in questionnaire design as well as my own findings from similar experiments I conducted in Brazil and Russia, I hypothesize treatment 3 to provide the best discrimination of partisans from nonpartisans. (The primary quantity of interest is the discrimination parameter, which will be measured via item response theory procedures.) I also suspect response set to have an effect on the rates of nonpartisanship and partisanship, with treatment 3 yielding the lowest estimates of nonpartisanship. The second experiment, which will appear toward the end of the questionnaire, will randomize the attachment descriptor while holding the response set constant (at #3) above. There will be three treatments: (1) party closeness (\"\u00bfa cu\u00e1l partido pol\u00edtico se siente m\u00e1s cercano?\", a wording used by the CNEP), (2) party preference (\"\u00bfcu\u00e1l es su partido pol\u00edtico preferido?,\" a wording adopted from Datafolha in Brazil), and (3) self-consideration (\"\u00bfusted se considera panista, ...\", a wording adopted from ANES).

Although research on the topic has gone somewhat dormant in recent years, a conventional wisdom seems to be that they should, and virtually all the major cross-national survey data projects have elected to do so. In two population-based survey experiments to be conducted in Mexico, I will assess the impact of question wording on the measure of mass partisanship. In particular, I will evaluate the impact of random manipulations on two different dimensions: the \"attachment descriptor\" (\"preference,\" \"sympathy,\" \"closeness,\" etc.) and the verbal response set.", "q16": "I plan to conduct two survey experiments embedded within the same questionnaire. The first experiment, which will appear toward the beginning of the questionnaire, will randomize the verbal response set (i.e., the options that are explicitly given to respondents after interviews have read the question stem) while holding the attachment descriptor constant (at \"sympathize\"). There will be three treatments: (1) a verbal labeling/listing of a nonpartisanship option without a verbal labeling of party options, (2) no verbal labeling of either, (3) a verbal labeling of party options without a verbal labeling of a nonpartisanship option. Based on existing best practices in questionnaire design as well as my own findings from similar experiments I conducted in Brazil and Russia, I hypothesize treatment 3 to provide the best discrimination of partisans from nonpartisans. (The primary quantity of interest is the discrimination parameter, which will be measured via item response theory procedures.) I also suspect response set to have an effect on the rates of nonpartisanship and partisanship, with treatment 3 yielding the lowest estimates of nonpartisanship. The second experiment, which will appear toward the end of the questionnaire, will randomize the attachment descriptor while holding the response set constant (at #3) above. There will be three treatments: (1) party closeness (\"\u00bfa cu\u00e1l partido pol\u00edtico se siente m\u00e1s cercano?\", a wording used by the CNEP), (2) party preference (\"\u00bfcu\u00e1l es su partido pol\u00edtico preferido?,\" a wording adopted from Datafolha in Brazil), and (3) self-consideration (\"\u00bfusted se considera panista, ...\", a wording adopted from ANES). I hypothesize that the effect of these attachment descriptors will be relatively small, certainly smaller than the effect of response set, on the estimated discrimination parameters and rates of nonpartisanship.", "q17": "I will test these hypotheses via item response theory procedures as well as simple different of means tests.
