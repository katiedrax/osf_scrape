Expressions of negative affect are utilised by third-party observers to classify an action as inappropriate and to infer what makes it inappropriate. We aim to extend these findings by focusing on two positive emotional reactions (gratitude and admiration) in response to ambiguous norm-related behaviours. Considering the antecedents of those emotions in a normative context, we expect the two expressions to impose diverging group values, and different outcomes on perceptions of warmth and competence characteristics.

To do so, the other elements of the equation must be defined: \n- zquant: For a 95% confidence interval, the quantile from the standardized normal distribution is 1.96 \n- SD: We used the highest standard deviations from ratings of perceived event characteristics of people experiencing an MLE (data from Study 5 in Luhmann et al., under review) as an approximation of the expected standard deviation of external ratings (i.e., SDmax = 1.45 for external control of relationship problems) \n- MOE: We use the smallest standard deviation of ratings of perceived event characteristics within an event characteristic as an approximation of the smallest differences we want to be able to detect (i.e., SD = 0.32 for social status change). Again, these estimates stemmed from people experiencing the MLE from Study 5 in Luhmann et al. (under review).\n\nThis procedure yielded a required number of ex situ ratings of at least 77 per MLE.", "q15": "n/a", "q20": "This preregistration is only meant to preregister the study design.

learn the causal structure of the world is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. This causal knowledge allows us to predict future events and perform actions to generate desired outcomes [1-2]. However, acquiring such knowledge directly from the world is costly in both time and effort [3-4]. Thus, it is vital to transmit already acquired causal knowledge effectively, in order to facilitate quick decision-making and advance collective understanding [5-6]. \n\nThe present study explores visualizations as a means overcoming these limitations by conveying causal knowledge in a condensed, exportable format over large gaps in space and time. We capitalize on prior work that has examined how the spatial layout of elements in well-designed visualizations mirrors the placement and relations of elements in the physical world, making it easier to grasp the correspondence among elements in each domain [7-10]. Visualizations have also been shown to promote inference of abstract relations by leveraging a small set of relational symbols, such as lines and arrows [11-12]. \n\nIn particular, participants will draw simple machines (gears, levers, and pulleys), which comprise a unique class of objects that can be rich in both visual appearance and causal information. The study thus explores how prompts to generate visual explanations (e.g., of how a machine functions) or visual depictions (e.g., of what a machine looks like) may affect what participants choose to include in their drawings.

Each participant will therefore read 120 sentences in random order during the experiment.\n", "analyses": "The data will be analyzed using linear and logit mixed-effects models with the following structure:\n   1) Reaction times: reaction time (transformed based on the Box-Cox test) as a dependent variable, word-order and response correctness as fixed effects, item and participant as random effects\n   2) Response correctness: response as dependent variable, word-order as fixed effect, item and participant as random effects.\n", "outliers": "Participants' response correctness on filler sentences will be measured and these who will score below 70% correct will be excluded from the analyses. \nThe reaction times will be trimmed very conservatively, only those data points that were clearly discontinuous in the distribution will be removed.\n", "dependent": "In the experiment we follow these dependent variables: response correctness and reaction times.\nThe experiment is designed as a self-paced reading (with sentence presented as a whole) in Ibex Farm presentation software. Reaction times will be measured directly in this software. \n\nSince we use open-ended comprehension questions, the responses will be coded manually. As a correct answer, we will accept various response variants which explicitly contain the main correct information (e.g. in the temporal reference is \"Sunday\", we accept answers like \"Sunday\", \"on Sunday\", \"during Sunday\" as correct, but answers like \"on the Weekend\", \"on Monday\" as incorrect).\n", "conditions": "Participants are asked to read a sentence and then respond on an open-ended comprehension question. The independent variables are (a) word-order (with two values, see below) and (b) question type (with three values - either a \"what-question\" asking on a sentence object, \"when-question\" asking on the temporal reference, or \"where\" on the locative reference. In other words, the experiment has 2x3 within-subject design. Altogether, there are 24 items and each participant thus gets four exemplars of each condition. \n\nItem example:\n(1) Word order 1 + what-question\nSentence: Star\u0161\u00ed d\u016fchodce v ned\u011bli v knihovn\u011b velmi pe\u010dliv\u011b pro\u010detl noviny.\n'An older retiree - on Sunday - in the library - very carefully - read the newspaper.'\nQ1: Co pro\u010detl d\u016fchodce?

In a prior experiment, we observed that objects were generally recalled better than temporal references. In this experiment, our aim is to (a) replicate these findings, (b) also test locative references. To reach our goal, we compare sentences with a different word-order position of targeted sentence elements. The elements appear either in the most prominent or in a less prominent position in the middle of the sentence.\n\nIn sum, our hypotheses are as follows:\n(1) Temporal references will be recalled worse than object references.\n(2) Locative references will be recalled worse than object references.\n(3) The success rate in recalling temporal and locative references will not differ.\n(4) The sentence final position of a reference will yield higher recall success rate.\n\n", "study_type": "Experiment", "study_type_other": ""}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecac48", "text":

different frequency tones which oscillate to produce different effects. Each of these beats operates in different frequencies thus having different sound production: theta, delta, alpha, beta, and gamma. In the experiment beta Binaural Beats with frequencies of 200 and 216 Hertz, Hz (unit of measurement for frequency), were used with a control of 200 Hz flat noise. The experiment utilized the psychomotor vigilance task to measure changes in response times and utilized Affectiva to measure changes in facial musculature. The response times were then analyzed to explain why the Binaural Beats condition had significantly shorter response times compared to the control group throughout the task. In terms of emotional change, some trends were noticed for the Binaural Beats and the control condition; however, none of the trends were significant. Moving forward with the experiment, an increased number of participants can be recorded to strengthen the validity and test different frequencies of Binaural Beats for accuracy.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-10T19:05:09.321164", "date_modified": "2020-04-09T19:46:14.096513", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Mohitha Obulasetty", "Gene Brewer", "Kimberly Wingert"], "year": "2018"}, "analytics_key": "281584b0f7abc4540b6d55265da8b04a6b01e1d12b69e69901c4adb5e4cc0835d70052542e3122eb04446479e0813fa15a5c1942ce5158ec17f835153014746fe255b6341b590be0f506c813866880653bad2363d3133c4b47ec933418a61881f113aafb1de12a8031b0243cf6975e53d5704f16356a01549c3af5a2da19386f983a89aba831866411c85ef969f4ce54", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-10T19:05:09.304712", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Prereg Challenge", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "The Effect of Binaural Beats on Vigilance and Mood"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Mohitha Obulasetty, Gene Brewer, Kimberly Wingert, Matthew Robison"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "There have been many previous studies that have shown that Binaural Beats affect vigilance, working memory and mood in a positive direction.
