Public health experts believe that \u201cindividual behaviour will be crucial to control the spread of COVID-19\u201d (Anderson et al. 2020, The Lancet). These behaviors include washing hands more frequently and for longer; avoiding public gatherings; cancelling travel plans; and keeping distance from others, because the virus is contagious even before people feel sick.\n \nWhile some people agree that the moral thing to do is to take these actions in these circumstances, there are many different kinds of moral principles that people can draw on to justify their actions and attempt to persuade others. We might, for example, appeal to utilitarian moral theories focused on cost/benefit ratios and expected consequences (Everett et al. 2018, Psychological Review). We might appeal to deontological moral theories focused on notions of duties, rights, and responsibilities. Or we might appeal to more virtue based notions of moral exemplars and consider what an ideal person would do. As far as we are aware, there is almost no work directly exploring the persuasiveness of these different kinds of moral justifications on expected intentions to act, and certainly not in the context of this global pandemic. This is our first goal.\n \nJust as it is critically important to understand the potential persuasiveness of these different moral framings, we also need to understand how people differentially trust and perceive those who give such messages. Our previous work has demonstrated that we differentially trust people based on whether they make more utilitarian or deontological decisions in a variety of different domains (Everett, Pizarro, &amp; Crockett, 2016, JEPG; Everett et al. 2018, JESP), and we know that because trust is the cornerstone of society this can have incredibly important downstream consequences on our willingness to act. Importantly, our previous work suggests that different moral justifications can also be favoured depending on the kind of social role one has: whether the person is a leader in a position of authority (e.g. a public health commissioner) or a general citizen (e.g. a teacher). Even if, as we predict, deontological or virtue-based moral messaging will be more effective and lead to greater trust than utilitarian moral messaging, it might be that this effect is attenuated or even reversed when it comes from a person in authority, who is supposed to act more impartially and make cost/benefit decisions (Everett et al. 2018, JESP).\n \nTo study this, we will conduct an experiment on Prolific in which we present a purported Facebook appeal and vary the source of a message (leader vs citizen) and the content of that message (utilitarian vs deontological vs virtue ethics vs non-moral control). We then look at both first-order and second-order beliefs on likelihood of taking different protective actions to reduce spread, intent to share the post wider, and questions about perceptions of the person who posted it and trust in them and their message."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Behavioral intentions: We predict that moral justifications for public health behaviors will have a stronger effect on intentions to adopt public health behaviors (relative to no moral justification). We also predict that appealing to utilitarian justifications will be less effective than deontological or virtue-based justifications. However we are anticipating possible ceiling effects on these measures due to social desirability concerns.\n\nSecond order beliefs: We predict that moral justifications for public health behaviors will have a stronger effect on second order beliefs about others\u2019 public health behaviors (relative to no moral justification). We also predict that appealing to utilitarian justifications will be less effective than deontological or virtue-based justifications. These measures may be more sensitive to our manipulations than behavioral intentions measures. \n\nImpressions of messenger: We predict that moral justifications for public health behaviors will make the speaker seem more moral and trustworthy (relative to no moral justification).

Public health experts believe that \u201cindividual behaviour will be crucial to control the spread of COVID-19\u201d (Anderson et al. 2020, The Lancet). These behaviors include washing hands more frequently and for longer; avoiding public gatherings; cancelling travel plans; and keeping distance from others, because the virus is contagious even before people feel sick.\n \nWhile some people agree that the moral thing to do is to take these actions in these circumstances, there are many different kinds of moral principles that people can draw on to justify their actions and attempt to persuade others. We might, for example, appeal to utilitarian moral theories focused on cost/benefit ratios and expected consequences (Everett et al. 2018, Psychological Review). We might appeal to deontological moral theories focused on notions of duties, rights, and responsibilities. Or we might appeal to more virtue based notions of moral exemplars and consider what an ideal person would do. As far as we are aware, there is almost no work directly exploring the persuasiveness of these different kinds of moral justifications on expected intentions to act, and certainly not in the context of this global pandemic. This is our first goal.\n \nJust as it is critically important to understand the potential persuasiveness of these different moral framings, we also need to understand how people differentially trust and perceive those who give such messages. Our previous work has demonstrated that we differentially trust people based on whether they make more utilitarian or deontological decisions in a variety of different domains (Everett, Pizarro, &amp; Crockett, 2016, JEPG; Everett et al. 2018, JESP), and we know that because trust is the cornerstone of society this can have incredibly important downstream consequences on our willingness to act. Importantly, our previous work suggests that different moral justifications can also be favoured depending on the kind of social role one has: whether the person is a leader in a position of authority (e.g. a public health commissioner) or a general citizen (e.g. a teacher). Even if, as we predict, deontological or virtue-based moral messaging will be more effective and lead to greater trust than utilitarian moral messaging, it might be that this effect is attenuated or even reversed when it comes from a person in authority, who is supposed to act more impartially and make cost/benefit decisions (Everett et al. 2018, JESP).\n \nTo study this, we will conduct an experiment on Prolific in which we present a purported Facebook appeal and vary the source of a message (leader vs citizen) and the content of that message (utilitarian vs deontological vs virtue ethics vs non-moral control). We then look at both first-order and second-order beliefs on likelihood of taking different protective actions to reduce spread, intent to share the post wider, and questions about perceptions of the person who posted it and trust in them and their message.", "q4": "Behavioral intentions: We predict that moral justifications for public health behaviors will have a stronger effect on intentions to adopt public health behaviors (relative to no moral justification). We also predict that appealing to utilitarian justifications will be less effective than deontological or virtue-based justifications. However we are anticipating possible ceiling effects on these measures due to social desirability concerns.\n\nSecond order beliefs: We predict that moral justifications for public health behaviors will have a stronger effect on second order beliefs about others\u2019 public health behaviors (relative to no moral justification). We also predict that appealing to utilitarian justifications will be less effective than deontological or virtue-based justifications. These measures may be more sensitive to our manipulations than behavioral intentions measures. \n\nImpressions of messenger: We predict that moral justifications for public health behaviors will make the speaker seem more moral and trustworthy (relative to no moral justification).

wellbeing of women (Mulhall et al., 2008; Stephenson &amp; Meston, 2015). As such, it is important that we understand factors that might hinder women\u2019s capacity to achieve this satisfaction (Glick &amp; Fiske, 1997). Benevolent sexism encompasses subjectively positive but patronizing attitudes toward women; for instance, that female passivity ought to be romanticized and that women ought to be dependent on men (Glick et al., 2015; Harris et al., 2016). In women, benevolent sexism typically manifests as the belief that oneself and other women should adhere to traditional gender roles (i.e. caregiver; Gaunt, 2013). Harris and colleagues (2016) found that women\u2019s benevolently sexist attitudes were indirectly associated with how frequently they reached orgasm; that is, women higher in benevolent sexism orgasmed less often. Given that orgasm frequency is predictive of sexual satisfaction, we have reason to believe that benevolent sexism might predict decreased sexual satisfaction in women (Haning et al., 2007). The purpose of the present study will therefore be to explore the mechanism through which women\u2019s benevolently sexist attitudes reduce their sexual satisfaction. Namely, we implicate the Traditional Sexual Script (TSS) \u2013 a schema that dictates how men and women stereotypically ought to behave during intercourse \u2013 as a means through which benevolently sexist women come to be sexually unsatisfied (O\u2019Sullivan &amp; Byers, 1992). \n\nIn the TSS, women are considered the \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 of sex; their worth and desirability is dictated by their initial reluctance, and subsequent submission, toward engaging in sexual activity. They are expected to remain passive throughout being sexually pursued, as well as during intercourse itself (Byers, 1996; Wiederman, 2005). Previous literature has demonstrated that women who adopt a submissive role during sex report experiencing less sexual arousal and greater difficulty becoming aroused (Sanchez et al., 2006). Given that arousal is associated with sexual satisfaction, these results suggest that submissiveness during sex is associated with decreased satisfaction (S\u00e1nchez-Fuentes et al., 2014). We therefore propose that TSS adoption might also be associated with decreased sexual satisfaction in women, given that female sexual submissiveness is an integral component of the TSS (Masters et al., 2013). In that being said, Sanchez and colleagues (2012) found that sexually submissive behaviour only predicted sexual dissatisfaction in women when the adoption of this behaviour was inconsistent with women\u2019s sexual preferences; that is, only women who reported having a preference for being dominant during sexual encounters were dissatisfied when they partook in submissive sexual behaviour. We therefore conclude that TSS adoption might only reduce sexual satisfaction in women for whom this adoption is not in keeping with their sexual preferences.\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "The present study aims to investigate the nature of the relationship between benevolent sexism, the TSS, and sexual satisfaction in heterosexual women. We hypothesise that an indirect relationship will exist between benevolently sexist attitudes and sexual satisfaction, such that benevolent sexism will lead to increased adoption of the TSS, which in turn will lead to a decrease in sexual satisfaction. In line with Sanchez et al. (2012), we also hypothesise that the relationship between TSS adoption and sexual satisfaction will be moderated by sexual preferences, such that adopting the TSS will only negatively affect sexual satisfaction among women who do not enjoy being submissive (please see \u201cFigure x\u201d which summarises our hypotheses).          \t                 \t"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

Participants will be asked to complete 4-items (as used in Sanchez et al., 2012) which involves indicating the extent to which they agree or disagree with the following statements: \u201cI tend to take on the more passive role during sexual activity,\u201d \u201cI tend to take on the submissive role during sexual activity,\u201d \u201cI am the passive one in my sexual relationships,\u201d and \u201cI tend to take on the more dominant role during sexual activity\u201d.

As such, it is important that we understand factors that might hinder women\u2019s capacity to achieve this satisfaction (Glick &amp; Fiske, 1997). Benevolent sexism encompasses subjectively positive but patronizing attitudes toward women; for instance, that female passivity ought to be romanticized and that women ought to be dependent on men (Glick et al., 2015; Harris et al., 2016). In women, benevolent sexism typically manifests as the belief that oneself and other women should adhere to traditional gender roles (i.e. caregiver; Gaunt, 2013). Harris and colleagues (2016) found that women\u2019s benevolently sexist attitudes were indirectly associated with how frequently they reached orgasm; that is, women higher in benevolent sexism orgasmed less often. Given that orgasm frequency is predictive of sexual satisfaction, we have reason to believe that benevolent sexism might predict decreased sexual satisfaction in women (Haning et al., 2007). The purpose of the present study will therefore be to explore the mechanism through which women\u2019s benevolently sexist attitudes reduce their sexual satisfaction. Namely, we implicate the Traditional Sexual Script (TSS) \u2013 a schema that dictates how men and women stereotypically ought to behave during intercourse \u2013 as a means through which benevolently sexist women come to be sexually unsatisfied (O\u2019Sullivan &amp; Byers, 1992). \n\nIn the TSS, women are considered the \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 of sex; their worth and desirability is dictated by their initial reluctance, and subsequent submission, toward engaging in sexual activity. They are expected to remain passive throughout being sexually pursued, as well as during intercourse itself (Byers, 1996; Wiederman, 2005). Previous literature has demonstrated that women who adopt a submissive role during sex report experiencing less sexual arousal and greater difficulty becoming aroused (Sanchez et al., 2006). Given that arousal is associated with sexual satisfaction, these results suggest that submissiveness during sex is associated with decreased satisfaction (S\u00e1nchez-Fuentes et al., 2014). We therefore propose that TSS adoption might also be associated with decreased sexual satisfaction in women, given that female sexual submissiveness is an integral component of the TSS (Masters et al., 2013). In that being said, Sanchez and colleagues (2012) found that sexually submissive behaviour only predicted sexual dissatisfaction in women when the adoption of this behaviour was inconsistent with women\u2019s sexual preferences; that is, only women who reported having a preference for being dominant during sexual encounters were dissatisfied when they partook in submissive sexual behaviour. We therefore conclude that TSS adoption might only reduce sexual satisfaction in women for whom this adoption is not in keeping with their sexual preferences.\n", "q4": "The present study aims to investigate the nature of the relationship between benevolent sexism, the TSS, and sexual satisfaction in heterosexual women. We hypothesise that an indirect relationship will exist between benevolently sexist attitudes and sexual satisfaction, such that benevolent sexism will lead to increased adoption of the TSS, which in turn will lead to a decrease in sexual satisfaction. In line with Sanchez et al. (2012), we also hypothesise that the relationship between TSS adoption and sexual satisfaction will be moderated by sexual preferences, such that adopting the TSS will only negatively affect sexual satisfaction among women who do not enjoy being submissive (please see \u201cFigure x\u201d which summarises our hypotheses).          \t                 \t", "q5": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

But, remarkably, many individuals experience only mild disruptions and quickly return to healthy functioning (Bonanno, 2005). Understanding the mechanisms of creating resilience, defined as the ability to bounce back from stress (Smith, Dalen, Wiggins, Tooley, Christopher, &amp; Bernard, 2008), is essential. It can inform future preventative interventions by using a transdiagnostic approach, which can be beneficial given high overlap among psychological disorders (Koole, Schwager, &amp; Rothermund, 2015).\nIn daily life individuals high in resilience experience negative affect as often  as individuals low in resilience (Montpetit, Bergeman, Deboeck, Tiberio, &amp; Boker, 2010). In the study by Waugh, Thompson and Gotlib (2011) resilience didn\u2019t predict negative affect while viewing negative images. What differentiates the participants high in resilience is their greater recovery from stress (Montpetit, Bergeman, Deboeck, Tiberio, &amp; Boker, 2010), which results in overall lower negative affect. Markovitz, Schrooten, Arntz, &amp; Peters (2015) showed that resilience predicts lower self-reported negative affect and that this difference increases in high stress conditions (it is higher for cancer patients). \nThere is growing consensus that positive affect is not just an opposite of negative affect. Positive emotions might play their own special role in resilience. Kalisch, M\u00fcller, &amp; T\u00fcscher (2015) propose that a positive appraisal style is a primary mechanism that protects individuals from the negative psychological effects of adversity. They argue that a quick recovery of mental health is an active process that relies on mechanisms that allow an individual to adjust stress responses to an optimal level. The authors suggest that aversive motivation causes stress, and the most effective way to prevent stress-related dysfunction is to limit aversion. According to the positive appraisal style theory of resilience (PASTOR) (Kalish et al., 2015), positive appraisal is the mechanism that lowers the frequency of strong aversive states. Thus, a general tendency for positive appraisal increases resilience. \nBroaden-and-build theory (Fredrickson, 2004) supports the idea of the importance of positive emotions for resilience. The theory states that positive emotions broaden an individual's thought-action repertoire. At times of adversity, positive emotions may help to recognize more possible coping strategies and solutions to the problem (Gloria, &amp; Steinhardt, 2016). Additionally, the broaden-and-build theory proposes that by promoting the discovery of novel actions, ideas, and social bonds, positive emotions build resources. Thus, an individual can accumulate resources during low-stress times to increase the chances of successful coping later in life. \nA particular type of positive emotion, extended trust, a tendency towards positive feelings over one\u2019s existence (Kuhl, Quirin, &amp; Koole, 2015), is of particular importance. Having inner security and trust in the world can help to cope with painful experiences (Kuhl, Quirin, &amp; Koole, 2015).  Lack of extended trust predicts psychological symptoms (Kuhl, Mitina, &amp; Koole, 2017). \nModerate levels of positive emotions may buffer stress by decreasing the negative arousal in stressful situations (Pressman &amp; Cohen, 2005). A high level of positive emotion, on the opposite, can be harmful. It might pose a physiological burden and might result in underestimating potential threats and adoption of inappropriate coping strategies (Pressman &amp; Cohen, 2005). Higher volatility of positive emotion is associated with lower well-being and greater depression and anxiety (Gruber, Kogan, Quoidbach, &amp; Mauss, 2013). Koole, Schwager, and Rothermund (2015) argue that resilience is based on a steady emotional balance rather than on general positivity bias. According to the authors, stable emotional balance is achieved through counter-regulation, a dynamic processing bias towards positive stimuli in negative contexts, and negative stimuli in positive contexts (Koole et al., 2015). \nEmpirical evidence shows that resilience is associated with higher positive emotions (Gloria &amp; Steinhardt, 2016). The study by Markovitz, Schrooten, Arntz, &amp; Peters (2015) supports the idea that resilient individuals maintain positive appraisal style in better times. In the study resilience predicted higher positive emotions and this relationship was not moderated by group type (cancer patients, i.e. high stress situation, vs. control group). The results of the study by Waugh, Thompson, and Gotlib (2011) are harder to interpret. In the study the participants higher in trait resilience reported higher positive affect while viewing positive images. One may interpret the results as showing that the participants high in resilience experience more positive emotions even in better times. Alternatively, one can argue that the participants high in resilience are balancing their emotions as they are being presented with a mix of negative and positive emotions. They are using positive emotions to recover from negative emotions elicited by previous negative images. \nThe theories discussed above concur that positive emotions contribute to resilience in stressful situations. However, they disagree on whether resilient individuals have stronger or weaker responses to positive stimuli in low-stress conditions than individuals low in resilience. In the present study, we will test whether resilience is associated with higher positive affect during less stressful times. Based on the PASTOR and the broaden-and-build theories, we predict that higher resilience will be associated with higher positive affect not only in stressful but also during less stressful times. \n\nRole of emotional congruence in resilience\nEmotional self-awareness has been identified as a factor contributing to resilience. Empirical evidence shows that emotional self-awareness was associated with higher resilience (Armstrong, Galligan, &amp; Critchley, 2011). A longitudinal study has identified a lack of emotional awareness as a risk factor for the development and maintenance of depression and anxiety in children and adolescents (Kranzler, Young, Hankin, Abela, Elias, &amp; Selby, 2016). In extreme case of alexithymia, the patients are unaware of their emotions and struggle to deploy coping mechanisms in time, which might result in longer periods of recovery from stressful events (Naatanen, Ryynanen, &amp; Keltikangas-Jarvinen, 1999). In a study by Naatanen et al. (1999), the participants high in alexithymia underestimated their physiological response during a stressful stimulus but overestimated their physiological response during the recovery. \nEmotional self-awareness is a trait measure, based on self-report. A parallel state measure, affective congruence (i.e., congruence between implicit and explicit affect) have not been widely studied. A correlational study by McKenzie Lockett and Sander Koole (2019) showed that affective incongruence is associated with higher PTSD symptoms. In the study, only the participants with high PTSD symptoms reported incongruent negative affect (i.e., implicit and explicit measures were not correlated). \nThe present study is the first to test the relationship between resilience and affective congruence. Kalisch, M\u00fcller, &amp; T\u00fcscher (2015) state that mechanisms that help to fine-tune stress response to an optimal level, to switch to a more efficient coping strategy, and to terminate the stress response when it is no longer necessary are likely to prevent psychological dysfunctions. We suggest that affective congruence facilitates all of the three processes, contributing to the individual's resilience. In the present correlational study, we hypothesize that individuals higher in affective congruence will report higher resilience. In line with previous findings (Ssenyonga, Owens, &amp; Olema, 2013) we expect resilience to be associated with lower PTSD symptoms. In addition, we hypothesize that this relationship will be mediated by affective congruence.\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "1.\tHigher resilience predicts lower negative affect during stressful times but not during less stressful times.\n2.\tHigher resilience predicts higher positive affect and this difference is larger during more stressful times. \n3.\tResilience is associated with higher negative and positive affective congruence. \n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

But, remarkably, many individuals experience only mild disruptions and quickly return to healthy functioning (Bonanno, 2005). Understanding the mechanisms of creating resilience, defined as the ability to bounce back from stress (Smith, Dalen, Wiggins, Tooley, Christopher, &amp; Bernard, 2008), is essential. It can inform future preventative interventions by using a transdiagnostic approach, which can be beneficial given high overlap among psychological disorders (Koole, Schwager, &amp; Rothermund, 2015).\nIn daily life individuals high in resilience experience negative affect as often  as individuals low in resilience (Montpetit, Bergeman, Deboeck, Tiberio, &amp; Boker, 2010).
