To assess this, I compare mean reputation ratings (see Likert scale in attached survey instrument). Specifically, a leader who follows through should be viewed as consistent, should issue threats and promises that believable, and should improve or significantly improve his country\u2019s standing in the world. Further, respondents should believe that a leader who followed through with a threat of ground invasion is more likely to invade another U.S. ally in the future compared to a leader who backs up on a threat. Leaders who back up to airstrikes should be seen as more credible than those who back up to sanctions. Experiment 2: Perceptions Among Threat Senders (Belligerence Costs/Backing In Inconsistency Costs) One goal of the experiment is to assess whether certain actions generate higher (lower) belligerence (inconsistency) costs than others and to assess whether certain segments of the population levy higher (lower) belligerence (inconsistency) costs than others. To do this, I calculate mean approval ratings of the leader in each of the experimental conditions. Based on the theory of belligerence costs put forth by Kertzer and Brutger (2016), I expect that in the full sample, belligerence costs will be higher for airstrikes than for sanctions. These higher belligerence costs will manifest in the form of lower mean approval ratings for the leader. I will then examine whether hawks or doves (as measured by a question on preferences toward intervention) levy higher belligerence costs. Based on Kertzer and Brutger (2016), I expect self-reported doves to levy higher belligerence costs than their more hawkish counterparts. I also expect self-reported doves to levy lower inconsistency costs than hawks. I must exercise caution in these results, however, because data on preferences toward interventionism are collected post-treatment. To account for this, I examine the distribution of interventionist attitudes across the three treatment groups. If there are no significant differences in the distribution of respondent attitudes toward interventionism across the three groups, I can have greater confidence that interventionism is not driven by exposure to treatments. The experiment also allows me to test the inconsistency costs of \u201cbacking in\u201d to a conflict Levy et al (2015). In other words, the President pledges to stay out of a conflict, but then \u201cbacks in\u201d by taking some form of military action. Unlike Levy et al who \u2013 like most scholars studying audience cost \u2013 treat backing in dichotomously, the experiment varies the degree to which the leader backs in (specifically, sanctions, air strikes, and a ground invasion). The primary outcome of interest is mean approval level, and I examine difference in means across the entire sample. I expect the audience costs for backing in to be highest for a ground invasion, followed by sanctions, then airstrikes, and the lowest for staying out. I also examine heterogeneous treatment effects by interacting treatment with a self-reported measure of interventionism. I expect less interventionist respondents to levy audience costs than hawkish respondents. In line with Levy et al (2015), I expect the costs for \u201cbacking in\u201d to be lower than those for backing out (Levy et al 2015, 996). I also ask respondents to rate the consistence of the President\u2019s handling of the situation with his initial statement. In line with the findings from the main experiment, I expect that staying out will have the highest mean consistence, followed by sanctions, airstrikes, and a ground invasion (lowest mean consistence rating). Additional Analysis of Data Collected During First Fielding of Main Survey: I intend to conduct additional analysis with data conducted in December 2016 (See attached draft article manuscript). Specifically, I intend to better explain why the audience costs for backing-up to airstrikes are not significantly different from backing up to sanctions. Given the manuscript\u2019s central argument that policy substitution can reduce audience costs by allowing leaders to back up to less inconsistent alternatives (rather than reneging completely and doing nothing at all), it is surprising that there is no significant difference in audience costs between the two backed up conditions (although there are significant differences in audience costs between the follow through, back up, and back down conditions). A closer examination of belligerence costs may explain why there are similar audience costs for the two backed up conditions. In short, since audience costs are the sum of belligerence and inconsistency components, it is possible that some actions generate high belligerence costs and low inconsistency costs while others generate low belligerence costs and high inconsistency costs. Thus, the sum of these data may balance out. Specifically, on average, sanctions may lead to low belligerence costs and high inconsistency costs (if the initial threat is to invade), while airstrikes may generate high belligerence costs and low inconsistency costs. To more closely examine this, I will first examine the distribution of interventionist attitudes across all of the experimental groups. If there are no significant differences between groups, I can have greater confidence that reported preferences toward intervention are not caused by treatment. I will then re-assess the effects of interventionist attitudes on audience costs for the backed-up conditions. Using the approach defined in Kertzer and Brutger (2016), I will disaggregate audience costs into belligerence costs and inconsistency costs. The belligerence costs should all be equal (given that there is no variation in the threat of ground invasion across the various treatment conditions), but inconsistency costs vary (with the highest inconsistency costs for backing down and the lowest for following through). However, I draw from the findings in Experiment 3 (above) to build upon the conception of belligerence costs by introducing variation in the type of threat that was initially issued (i.e. either sanctions or airstrikes) to demonstrate that belligerence costs for backing up to sanctions are lower than those for backing up to airstrikes. This \u201cequalizing\u201d effect of summing low (high) belligerence costs with high (low) inconsistency costs may help to better explain the lack of variation in the overall audience costs for the two backed-up conditions."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment 1: Perceptions Among Recipients The first experiment is fielded on a sample of 400 respondents recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk. The experiment allows me examine how respondents on the receiving end of a threat assess an adversary\u2019s reputation after the adversary either backs down or backs up on a threat. Current experimental research on audience costs examines respondents on the \u201csending\u201d side of a threat, and uses these data to infer how an adversary views the credibility of the sending state\u2019s future threats and promises. In contrast, my experiment puts respondents on the receiving end of a threat and exposes them to a situation where an adversary threatens to invade a U.S. ally if the U.S. does not close its military bases in the allied country. Qualtrics then randomly assigns respondents into one of four treatment groups that varies the action the adversary country takes: invades, launches airstrikes, enacts economic sanctions, or takes no action. I control for outcomes by telling respondents that \u201cNo Americans were harmed by the rival country\u2019s actions.\u201d Respondents are then presented with 13 multiple-choice questions that ask respondents to rate the consistency of the rival leader\u2019s actions (consistency between words and deeds), and to rate the reputational effects of the rival leader\u2019s actions on his and his country\u2019s reputations. The survey instrument accomplishes the latter by asking three questions: 1) Based solely on the rival leader\u2019s actions, how likely is it that the United States will believe threats and promises made by the foreign leader in the future?; 2)How much did the rival leader\u2019s handling of the situation hurt or improve the reputation of his country in the world?; and 3) I pose an explicit scenario: \u201cSeveral months later, the rival leader threatens to invade another U.S. ally. How likely is it that the rival leader will invade the U.S. ally? Experiment 2: Belligerence Costs/Backing In I field a second experiment on a sample of 800 respondents recruited using Amazon MechanicalTurk. The experiment allows me to examine 1) the disaggregated belligerence and audience costs of various \u201cbacked-up\u201d actions and 2) the audience costs of \u201cbacking in\u201d \u2013 but incrementally \u2013 to a conflict after pledging to stay out. The experimental design here draws heavily from 1) the design used in Kertzer and Brutger (2016) to create treatment conditions that allow me to disaggregate audience costs into inconsistency and belligerence cost components and 2) the design used in Levy et al (2015) to study the costs of backing into a conflict. I create eight experimental conditions that vary both the level of \u2018belligerence\u2019 and consistency. One on dimension, I vary the type of action the leader pledges/threatens (stay out, air strikes, sanctions). On the other, I vary whether the leader follows through, backs down, or backs in. Qualtrics randomly assigns respondents into one of these eight experimental conditions. Respondents are then presented with 15 multiple-choice questions that, among other questions, ask them to rate the President\u2019s handling of the situation, the President\u2019s competence, and the consistency of the actions. Respondents are also asked to provide demographic information (See attached survey instrument). Respondents are paid 20-cents for completing the survey, which should take approximately five minutes."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "United States"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "1200"}, "q20":

Experiment 2: Belligerence Costs/Backing In I field a second experiment on a sample of 800 respondents recruited using Amazon MechanicalTurk. The experiment allows me to examine 1) the disaggregated belligerence and audience costs of various \u201cbacked-up\u201d actions and 2) the audience costs of \u201cbacking in\u201d \u2013 but incrementally \u2013 to a conflict after pledging to stay out. The experimental design here draws heavily from 1) the design used in Kertzer and Brutger (2016) to create treatment conditions that allow me to disaggregate audience costs into inconsistency and belligerence cost components and 2) the design used in Levy et al (2015) to study the costs of backing into a conflict. I create eight experimental conditions that vary both the level of \u2018belligerence\u2019 and consistency. One on dimension, I vary the type of action the leader pledges/threatens (stay out, air strikes, sanctions). On the other, I vary whether the leader follows through, backs down, or backs in. Qualtrics randomly assigns respondents into one of these eight experimental conditions. Respondents are then presented with 15 multiple-choice questions that, among other questions, ask them to rate the President\u2019s handling of the situation, the President\u2019s competence, and the consistency of the actions. Respondents are also asked to provide demographic information (See attached survey instrument). Respondents are paid 20-cents for completing the survey, which should take approximately five minutes.", "q18": "United States", "q19": "1200", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24":

Can this help explain the special role of territory in international relations? Territorial disagreements between states have been shown to: more frequently lead to militarized conflict than other contentious issues, be more likely to escalate to war, be harder to resolve, and be more likely to lead to enduring international rivalries. Theoretical explanations for these observed patterns have tended to focus on the economic, ethnic or strategic value of the territory for states or citizens, or the salience of territorial issues for elites. These explanations tend to be rationalist, sometimes assuming but rarely investigating an \u201cintangible\u201d value for territory in addition to a material or military value. This sits uneasily with the assertion that humans, like other territorial animals, have an instinctive value for territory that is the product of evolution, that \u201cfollows a strategic logic, but one calibrated to cost-benefit ratios that prevailed in our evolutionary past, not those of the present\u201d (Johnson and Toft 2013, 35). Indeed, there is evidence that interstate conflicts over territory with intangible value tend to be the most severe (Hensel and Mitchell 2005), suggesting a large role for non-rational factors. We take a step towards clarifying one possible non-rationalist causal mechanism for territorial conflict, focusing on involuntary emotional reactions. In non-human social animals, territorial conflict has been shown to be associated with cooperative and other altruistic behaviors towards other in-group individuals, and individuals\u2019 roles in territorial defense are often gender-specific. In a pre-registered randomized survey experiment, we test whether a similar pattern is exhibited among Australians who are exposed to information about a territorial threat. We expect to find (as we did in a pre-registered pilot study) that territorial threat elicits cooperativeness among white men born in Australia, and among women of that background it reduces negative affect while increasing generosity through actual charitable donations. Drawing on the evolutionary biology literature, we tie these patterns to an instinctive emotional response to territorial threat that has evolved to help overcome in-group collective action problems for territorial defense. In modern societies, this may create an incentive for political leaders to mobilize publics on territorial issues, because they can strike a deep and unifying emotional chord within citizens.

boundaries of the public, private and civic spheres. Advocates believe CG enjoys higher legitimacy by promoting various public values, including efficiency, representation, empowerment, and so on. However, numerous public values, which may be equally fundamental yet incompatible with each other, exist in reality. Value-based conflicts force CG conveners make trade-off between alternative CG arrangements, which reflect conflicting principles. Such trade-off faced by CG conveners threaten the assumed causality between CG and legitimacy. To make things more complicated, people\u2019s initial position towards a political issue, including their perceived legitimacy towards certain policy process, may fail to remain stable when they are exposed to competing interpretations (Jackman & Sniderman, 2006). In this way, it will not only be important to examine how CG arrangements impact public perceived legitimacy, but more attention should also be paid on how competing CG designs, with conflicting public values, change people\u2019s initial position. All the challenges mentioned above show the complex dynamics between alternative CG designs, the underlying value conflicts, and public perceived legitimacy.

One reason to focus on college students is that, perceived legitimacy should be examined within certain socially constructed system of norms and cultures (Suchman, 1995). However, even for people who all live in the US, the perception of legitimacy may differ a lot, as these individuals were likely to be exposed to various cultures and norms during their developmental-age (Booth, etc., 2017). Considering the complexity of perceived legitimacy, we believe it is reasonable to focus on one of the specific groups of US citizens, the college students in this research, who are in similar birth cohorts and share similar educational backgrounds. Another reason is that college students are regarded as the group of people who are most likely to participate in protests against the authority (Van Dyke 2003). In this way, it will be extremely important to understand how college students regard the legitimacy of certain policy process, as perceived legitimacy guarantees policy compliance and social stability (Birnbaum 2016). Survey experiments will be the major method in this study. The subjects will be randomly divided into two groups. Both groups will be shown three hypothetical cases of collaborative arrangements. Each case respectively describes an arrangement in one of the three CG dimensions (participant selection, collaborative dynamics, decision making). In each of the three cases, the control group will be initially shown with arrangement in the column of Design A in Table 1. For example, in the case of a hypothetical CG arrangement of \u201cRed Lake\u201d Fishery Commission, the control group will be shown with a participant selection design based on willingness. Then we will measure their perceived legitimacy towards such a CG arrangement (first measurement). After that, the control group will be exposed to a counterargument with competing CG arrangement in column Design B, and we will measure their perceived legitimacy towards the initial CG arrangement again after that (second measurement). On the contrary, the experimental group will be first shown with CG arrangement in column Design B before they are exposed to a counterargument with competing arrangement in Design A. We then compare the initial perceived legitimacy in control group and experiment group, and compare the decrease of perceived legitimacy towards initial CG arrangement in both groups during the second measurement of perceived legitimacy. In order to test hypothesis 4, this research also need to measure college students\u2019 preference to various public values.

Advocates believe CG enjoys higher legitimacy by promoting various public values, including efficiency, representation, empowerment, and so on. However, numerous public values, which may be equally fundamental yet incompatible with each other, exist in reality. Value-based conflicts force CG conveners make trade-off between alternative CG arrangements, which reflect conflicting principles. Such trade-off faced by CG conveners threaten the assumed causality between CG and legitimacy. To make things more complicated, people\u2019s initial position towards a political issue, including their perceived legitimacy towards certain policy process, may fail to remain stable when they are exposed to competing interpretations (Jackman & Sniderman, 2006). In this way, it will not only be important to examine how CG arrangements impact public perceived legitimacy, but more attention should also be paid on how competing CG designs, with conflicting public values, change people\u2019s initial position. All the challenges mentioned above show the complex dynamics between alternative CG designs, the underlying value conflicts, and public perceived legitimacy. This research plan to use survey experiment to address the following questions. 1. How do institutional designs of collaborative governance (CG) influence citizens\u2019 perceived legitimacy towards such CG arrangement? 2.

First of all, in 2015, the Brazilian Supreme Court decided that campaign contributions by companies were illegal. Therefore, companies could not legally contribute to politicians and only individuals (some of them partners of large companies) were allowed to contribute to campaigns.

"Most final legal decisions in civil and criminal cases are made in state trial courts. The National Center for State Courts recognizes that the lack of racial and gender diversity on the bench continues to be a problem in many states, threatening the equality of minorities in the justice system. Many states have established commissions to examine gender and racial bias in the state court system, finding that such bias is common. This project will enhance the social scientific understanding of the relationship between citizens\u2019 expectations of representation and institutional legitimacy within a state judicial context. The first objective of the project is to determine how citizens view representation in a judicial context. The second objective is to determine how views on representation affect an individual\u2019s propensity to ascribe legitimacy to the judiciary. The third objective is to determine the relative impact that descriptive (in terms of race and gender) and substantive representation have on attitudes toward the judiciary. In order to accomplish these objectives, a survey with a series of embedded experiments will be conducted on a cross-section of the U.S. adult population. One experiment focuses on the aggregate numbers of female and African American judges in a state\u2019s trial courts. Respondents are randomly assigned to receive information about either African American judges or female judges in their state. The information varies by the percentage of each group of judges given to the respondent (whether the group in the respondent\u2019s state is higher, lower, or on par with the national average). In the other experiment, respondents are presented with a decision made by a trial judge in their state. The vignette varies by the importance of the political issue involved in the case as well as by the race and gender of the judge deciding the case. A pre-test was conducted in the summer of 2017 to determine certain details of the main survey (the focus of this pre-analysis plan), like the political issues to be involved in the court case for the second experiment. Aside from that, this preregistration and pre-analysis plan is being submitted prior to the main survey being conducted (prior to assignment of treatment)."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "I predict that individuals who are descriptively represented by judges in terms of race and gender will be more likely to view courts favorably by ascribing greater legitimacy to the courts, having greater confidence in the courts and judges, having greater trust in the judicial system, being more likely to believe judges reach decisions in a fair manner, and being more likely to agree with judicial decisions. Additionally, I predict that substantive representation from judges will only matter when individuals care about the political issue being decided by the judge. I also expect that attitudes toward the courts will be moderated by the extent to which individuals expect and value both descriptive and substantive representation from their state\u2019s trial court judges.

The National Center for State Courts recognizes that the lack of racial and gender diversity on the bench continues to be a problem in many states, threatening the equality of minorities in the justice system. Many states have established commissions to examine gender and racial bias in the state court system, finding that such bias is common. This project will enhance the social scientific understanding of the relationship between citizens\u2019 expectations of representation and institutional legitimacy within a state judicial context. The first objective of the project is to determine how citizens view representation in a judicial context. The second objective is to determine how views on representation affect an individual\u2019s propensity to ascribe legitimacy to the judiciary. The third objective is to determine the relative impact that descriptive (in terms of race and gender) and substantive representation have on attitudes toward the judiciary. In order to accomplish these objectives, a survey with a series of embedded experiments will be conducted on a cross-section of the U.S. adult population. One experiment focuses on the aggregate numbers of female and African American judges in a state\u2019s trial courts. Respondents are randomly assigned to receive information about either African American judges or female judges in their state. The information varies by the percentage of each group of judges given to the respondent (whether the group in the respondent\u2019s state is higher, lower, or on par with the national average). In the other experiment, respondents are presented with a decision made by a trial judge in their state. The vignette varies by the importance of the political issue involved in the case as well as by the race and gender of the judge deciding the case. A pre-test was conducted in the summer of 2017 to determine certain details of the main survey (the focus of this pre-analysis plan), like the political issues to be involved in the court case for the second experiment. Aside from that, this preregistration and pre-analysis plan is being submitted prior to the main survey being conducted (prior to assignment of treatment).", "q16": "I predict that individuals who are descriptively represented by judges in terms of race and gender will be more likely to view courts favorably by ascribing greater legitimacy to the courts, having greater confidence in the courts and judges, having greater trust in the judicial system, being more likely to believe judges reach decisions in a fair manner, and being more likely to agree with judicial decisions. Additionally, I predict that substantive representation from judges will only matter when individuals care about the political issue being decided by the judge. I also expect that attitudes toward the courts will be moderated by the extent to which individuals expect and value both descriptive and substantive representation from their state\u2019s trial court judges. Lastly, I predict that these expectations will vary by how individuals believe their state selects judges.", "q17": "I will estimate raw differences in reported post-treatment attitudes like judicial legitimacy, confidence, and trust across various demographic groups (African American/white women/men) both within and across treatment groups.
