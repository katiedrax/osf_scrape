This effect is largely neglected in studies of value-based decision making. Here, we use eye-tracking to investigate how this choice perseveration effect emerges in intertemporal choices. We expect to see choice perseveration effects as indicated by a higher amount of choice repetitions than choice switches, and shorter response times for choice repetitions than for choice switches. \nFurther, using eye-tracking allows us to uncover attentional processes in intertemporal decisions. For example, do people pay more attention to one choice dimension than to the other (e.g., more fixations on time than on reward)? Does attentional processing directly predict the eventual choice? Does the repetition bias affect attentional processing?\nIn order to answer these questions, we have developed an intertemporal choice paradigm that consists of two parts. Throughout the experiment, participants choose between a small/soon (SS) option that is available sooner, but has a smaller value, and a large/late (LL) option that is available later, but has a larger value (e.g., 10 \u20ac right now or 19 \u20ac in 14 days). In the first part, the measurement block, the SS and LL options are constructed to cover a wide range of reward values and time intervals in order to measure participants' individual delay discounting. We then use this individual delay discounting to tailor trials to each individual participant in the second part, the experimental block. In the experimental block, we construct mini-blocks of three trials: Two bias trials and one target trial. The two bias trials are attractive SS or attractive LL trials (i.e., participants are highly likely to choose the SS in attractive SS trials/LL in attractive LL trials), and the target trial is neutral (both options are equally attractive and equally likely to be chosen). This allows us to measure if, in the neutral target trial, people choose differently depending on their bias-sequence (i.e., will people choose the LL option more often in the neutral target trial after choosing LL in an LL-biased sequence, vs.  after choosing SS in an SS-biased sequence? How does that affect response time? How does that affect attentional processing?).\nOur hypotheses are based on our own findings in pilot studies and previous work (e.g., Scherbaum et al., 2016; Senftleben et al., 2019; Senftleben, Schoemann, Rudolf, &amp; Scherbaum, 2019), and on an eye-tracking study on intertemporal decision making (Franco-Watkins, Mattson, &amp; Jackson, 2016)."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "** behavioral**\n1.)

Furthermore, we will fit a hyperbolic discounting model g(D)= 1/(1 + kD), where g(D) is the discount factor, D is the time interval or delay, and k is the individual discounting parameter. This will return k-values for all individuals as a measure of delay discounting. \nAs k-parameters are usually not normally distributed, we will apply log-transformation in order to better meet assumptions of parametric tests.\n- as indicator for choice behavior, we will calculate (for each condition) the mean percentage of LL choices. For hypotheses regarding choice repetition, we will focus on choice percentages in target trials after successful bias trials (i.e., where participants chose SS in SS bias trials and LL in LL bias trials).\n- Response times will be averaged for each condition and log-transformed before statistical analysis (as they are likely not normally distributed). \n- Eye-tracking: After removing blinks, we will compute for each trial the number of fixations in total, number of fixations on each Area of Interest (AOI) (SS value, SS interval, LL value, LL interval), AOI acquisitions and reacquisitions, fixation duration of each fixation, mean fixation duration in total, mean fixation duration on each AOI, order of fixations (i.e., which AOI was fixated first, second,...last).\n- AOIs are defined as a visual angle margin of 1\u00b0 the borders of the stimulus boxes (see Orquin, Ashby, &amp; Clarke, 2016, JBDM)  \n- as indicator for selective attention, we will compute a selection bias score (Franco-Watkins et al., 2016): [(n fixations SS time + n fixations SS money) -  (n fixations LL time + n fixations LL money)]/total fixations, where 1=extreme bias to SS,-1=extreme bias to LL, 0=no

"value": "Gabriela Rosenblau, Christoph Korn, Ili Ma, Wenda Liu, Nikita Shah"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Cooperation plays a central role in building interpersonal relationships, particularly in economic interactions. Trust, a necessary ingredient for both initiating and sustaining cooperation, builds on individual's readiness to explore joint rewards at the risk of facing exploitation by the other party (Adolphs, 2003; Fehr and Fischbacher, 2003). Cooperation is hard to study in systematic, controlled settings due to the fragile nature of trust and its dependence on social context. An example of how it can be studied in a controlled setting is using economic games such as the trust game (Fehr et al., 1993). The trust game is a monetary exchange game in which an investor can send a sum of money to a trustee. The trustee receives a multiple of this sum and can return any amount back to the investor (Berg et al., 1995). Using this game, researchers have demonstrated that humans have an inherent preference to trust and cooperate with people (i.e. in social settings) (Mayer et al., 2014). Studies have found that people are more willing to choose risky options and engage in cooperation with people who have lower reciprocation rates than with non-human slot machines (Fetchenhauer and Dunning, 2012). It remains unclear, however, how the opportunity to gather information about the agent shapes cooperation and how trust is achieved and sustained in social vs. non-social situations. It is also unclear how cooperation changes in adolescence, a time of substantial neural and social development.\nComputational models paired with neuroscientific assessment can reveal the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying cooperation in adolescence. We will combine a developmental and neurocomputational approach to test 1) how early adolescents (8-12y, N=50) sample information about their cooperation partners, 2) which strategies they employ when cooperating with social and non-social agents, and 3) whether synchronization of neural activity between agents in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) measured with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) predicts reciprocal, sustained cooperation."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "We will use the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to identify optimal information sampling and cooperation strategies of adolescents in social and non-social settings. We will test whether model predictions scale with brain activity and how interpersonal neural synchronization predicts cooperation strategies. The work will proceed as follows:\nAIM 1: To identify how adolescents decide to trust a peer and determine cooperation strategies of adolescents in social and non-social settings. We will determine how adolescents sample information about the other peer and how they cooperate with a peer in a repeated economic exchange game (i.e., the trust game). Based on our pilot data (see section 14 below), we expect model-free and model-based differences between social and non-social conditions (social condition: 1. when children play with their peer and 2. when they think they play with their peer but play with a computer algorithm; non-social condition: when children know that they play with the computer algorithm). A forgiveness rate will be estimated as part of model fitting. This variable will determine how fast children choose to share and \"forgive\" their partner after the partner defected (see section 18). H1.1. In line with a previous study (Ma et al., 2018), we expect that an uncertainty tolerance model that estimates the uncertainty tolerance criterion for each child (see section 18) best describes how children sample information about peers. H1.2. Children will show higher cooperation rates in the social compared to the non-social condition. H1.3. Children will show higher forgiveness rates, estimated by the winning mathematical model, in the social compared to the non-social conditions. \nAIM 2: To identify the neural mechanisms of cooperation. Using fNIRS, we will measure participants' brain activity during the experiment. We will focus on the MPFC, a brain region that has been uniquely involved in social decision making and learning (Behrens et al., 2008; Nicolle et al., 2012). H.2.1. Activity in the MPFC will scale with children's sharing tendencies in the social compared to non-social settings. H.2.2 Predictions of the winning mathematical models scale with neural activity in the MPFC social versus non-social conditions. \nAIM 3: To identify the interpersonal neural synchronization of the MPFC during real interactions. We will investigate the synchronization between investor and trustee pairs by computing the wavelet transform coherence (WTC; Faugeras et al., 2004) for each pair of the participants over time. H.3.1 Synchronization levels of partners will predict cooperation levels and forgiveness rates during the real interaction.\n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Unbeknown to them, the outcomes of the games are computer generated and designed to have six different reciprocation rates (probability (p) of reciprocation: 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0). Adolescents are then invited into the lab in pairs and will be asked to play a child-friendly version of the trust game with each other and with computer algorithms. Pairs will be matched for age, sex, socioeconomic status and IQ. In each game, participants play multiple trials of the trust game. In this game the investor receives five coins, and can keep the five coins or share any amount with the trustee. If investors choose to share, the trustee will receive four times as many coins and can decide to share half back with the investor or keep all coins. \n\tParticipants play multiple consecutive games: First, participants play the trust game with each other (i.e. real interaction). One participant is randomly assigned to the trustee condition and the other to the investor condition. Thereafter, they play in the investor role with a computer partner. Before two of the four games, they are told that they are playing with a human (i.e., social condition). In the remaining games participants know that they are playing with computer partners (i.e. non-social condition). The social and non-social conditions are counterbalanced across participants.\nWhile playing the trust game, we will measure participants' brain activity during the tasks using fNIRS.

Trust, a necessary ingredient for both initiating and sustaining cooperation, builds on individual's readiness to explore joint rewards at the risk of facing exploitation by the other party (Adolphs, 2003; Fehr and Fischbacher, 2003). Cooperation is hard to study in systematic, controlled settings due to the fragile nature of trust and its dependence on social context. An example of how it can be studied in a controlled setting is using economic games such as the trust game (Fehr et al., 1993). The trust game is a monetary exchange game in which an investor can send a sum of money to a trustee. The trustee receives a multiple of this sum and can return any amount back to the investor (Berg et al., 1995). Using this game, researchers have demonstrated that humans have an inherent preference to trust and cooperate with people (i.e. in social settings) (Mayer et al., 2014). Studies have found that people are more willing to choose risky options and engage in cooperation with people who have lower reciprocation rates than with non-human slot machines (Fetchenhauer and Dunning, 2012). It remains unclear, however, how the opportunity to gather information about the agent shapes cooperation and how trust is achieved and sustained in social vs. non-social situations. It is also unclear how cooperation changes in adolescence, a time of substantial neural and social development.\nComputational models paired with neuroscientific assessment can reveal the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying cooperation in adolescence. We will combine a developmental and neurocomputational approach to test 1) how early adolescents (8-12y, N=50) sample information about their cooperation partners, 2) which strategies they employ when cooperating with social and non-social agents, and 3) whether synchronization of neural activity between agents in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) measured with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) predicts reciprocal, sustained cooperation.", "q4": "We will use the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to identify optimal information sampling and cooperation strategies of adolescents in social and non-social settings. We will test whether model predictions scale with brain activity and how interpersonal neural synchronization predicts cooperation strategies. The work will proceed as follows:\nAIM 1: To identify how adolescents decide to trust a peer and determine cooperation strategies of adolescents in social and non-social settings. We will determine how adolescents sample information about the other peer and how they cooperate with a peer in a repeated economic exchange game (i.e., the trust game). Based on our pilot data (see section 14 below), we expect model-free and model-based differences between social and non-social conditions (social condition: 1. when children play with their peer and 2. when they think they play with their peer but play with a computer algorithm; non-social condition: when children know that they play with the computer algorithm). A forgiveness rate will be estimated as part of model fitting. This variable will determine how fast children choose to share and \"forgive\" their partner after the partner defected (see section 18). H1.1. In line with a previous study (Ma et al., 2018), we expect that an uncertainty tolerance model that estimates the uncertainty tolerance criterion for each child (see section 18) best describes how children sample information about peers. H1.2. Children will show higher cooperation rates in the social compared to the non-social condition. H1.3. Children will show higher forgiveness rates, estimated by the winning mathematical model, in the social compared to the non-social conditions. \nAIM 2: To identify the neural mechanisms of cooperation. Using fNIRS, we will measure participants' brain activity during the experiment. We will focus on the MPFC, a brain region that has been uniquely involved in social decision making and learning (Behrens et al., 2008; Nicolle et al., 2012). H.2.1. Activity in the MPFC will scale with children's sharing tendencies in the social compared to non-social settings. H.2.2 Predictions of the winning mathematical models scale with neural activity in the MPFC social versus non-social conditions. \nAIM 3: To identify the interpersonal neural synchronization of the MPFC during real interactions. We will investigate the synchronization between investor and trustee pairs by computing the wavelet transform coherence (WTC; Faugeras et al., 2004) for each pair of the participants over time. H.3.1 Synchronization levels of partners will predict cooperation levels and forgiveness rates during the real interaction.\n", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

We will record brain activity during the trust game task using fNIRS.\nParticipants (N=50, aged 8 to 12y) will first participate in an online study, in which adolescents can sample how trustworthy 60 peers were on similar games. Unbeknown to them, the outcomes of the games are computer generated and designed to have six different reciprocation rates (probability (p) of reciprocation: 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0). Adolescents are then invited into the lab in pairs and will be asked to play a child-friendly version of the trust game with each other and with computer algorithms. Pairs will be matched for age, sex, socioeconomic status and IQ. In each game, participants play multiple trials of the trust game. In this game the investor receives five coins, and can keep the five coins or share any amount with the trustee. If investors choose to share, the trustee will receive four times as many coins and can decide to share half back with the investor or keep all coins. \n\tParticipants play multiple consecutive games: First, participants play the trust game with each other (i.e. real interaction). One participant is randomly assigned to the trustee condition and the other to the investor condition. Thereafter, they play in the investor role with a computer partner. Before two of the four games, they are told that they are playing with a human (i.e., social condition). In the remaining games participants know that they are playing with computer partners (i.e. non-social condition). The social and non-social conditions are counterbalanced across participants.\nWhile playing the trust game, we will measure participants' brain activity during the tasks using fNIRS.

", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "Participants will be randomized to one of three conditions: \n\u2022 Structural: read an article that explains the causal effect of structural inequality and poverty on gun violence; and recommends policies that support structural development to prevent gun violence.\n\u2022 Na\u00efve Structural: read an article that mentions (without providing a detailed explanation of) that structural inequality and poverty are important causes of gun violence and recommends policies that support structural development to prevent gun violence.\n\u2022 Control: read a paragraph that describes the extent of gun violence in poor, inner-city communities of color (presented after reading and answering questions about an unrelated article on e-cigarette use).", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "- KEY DEPENDENT VARIABLES -\n\nStereotypical attributions about community gun violence: \nParticipants will be asked to rate the extent to which they agree with four items on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The first item is included only to reduce social desirability concerns and will not be included in analyses. We expect that participants will feel licensed to express stereotypical beliefs if they are first given a chance to express that there are \u201cdecent, hard-working people\u201d living in poor, inner-city neighborhoods. \n1. \u201cIf we could get violent criminals off the streets of poor inner-city neighborhoods, the decent, hard-working people in those neighborhoods could lift themselves out of poverty.\u201d\n2. \"Gun violence in poor inner-city neighborhoods won\u2019t improve unless we get the criminals who are doing the shooting off the streets for good.\"\n3.  \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have so much gun violence in poor inner-city neighborhoods if the kids doing the shooting had parents who took responsibility for raising them.\u201d\n4. \u201cIf the people doing the shooting in poor inner-city neighborhoods knew they would be caught and severely punished, we\u2019d see a lot less gun violence in those neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nSupport for punitive public policies: \nParticipants will be asked to rate the extent to which they oppose or favor four items on a scale from 1 (strongly oppose) to 7 (strongly favor): \n1. More police on the streets\n2. Longer jail terms for those convicted of violent crimes\n3. More prisons and fewer opportunities for parole\n4. Increase criminal penalties for non-violent crimes (i.e., property crimes and theft)\n\nSupport for restorative public policies: \nParticipants will be asked to rate the extent to which they oppose or favor four items on a scale from 1 (strongly oppose) to 7 (strongly favor):\n\t1. More job and community programs for young people\n\t2. Job programs for people in the inner-cities\n\t3. More federal assistance to the poor\n\t4. Remove criminal-history questions from employment applications\n\n- COVARIATES -\n\nDemographics:\n1. Racial identification\n2. Gender identification\n3. Political party\n4. Political orientation\n5. Age\n6. Annual income\n7. Number of people living in household\n8. Highest level of education\n\n- EXPLORATORY MEASURES -\n\nSupport for gun control: \nParticipants will be asked to rate the extent to which they oppose or favor stricter gun control policies from 1 (strongly oppose) to 7 (strongly favor).\n\nOpen-ended attribution for gun violence disparity: \nParticipants will be asked to answer the following prompt to explore spontaneous attributions for racial disparities in gun violence: \n1. According to CDC, Black men are much more likely than white men to be involved in gun-related homicides. Why do you think that is?\n\nPerception of criminality: \nThe following questions are single-item exploratory measures related to participants perception of criminals in poor, inner-city neighborhoods of color with high rates of gun violence. Participants will be asked to rate the extent to which they agree with the following items on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree):\n1. \u201cNo matter what the circumstances are, people who become involved in gun violence are solely responsible for their choices to commit crime.\u201d\n2. \u201cConditions in poor, inner-city neighborhoods of color make it practically impossible for some kids to avoid getting involved with crime.\u201d\n3. \u201cSome people in poor, inner-city neighborhoods are just born criminals and there\u2019s not much other people can do to change that.\u201d\n4. \u201cSome people in poor, inner-city neighborhoods who commit crimes were just not raised right and there\u2019s not much that can be done to change that.\u201d\n5. \u201cEven if someone becomes involved with crime in poor, inner-city neighborhoods of color, it\u2019s possible for them to change if given the right kind of support.\u201d\n6. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for some people living in poor inner-city neighborhoods of color to avoid committing crimes in order to make a living.\u201d\n\nPerception of unemployment in poor, inner-city neighborhoods of color: \nThe following questions are single-item exploratory measures related to participants perception of unemployment in poor, inner-city neighborhoods of color with high rates of gun violence. Participants will be asked to rate the extent to which they agree with the following items on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree):\n1. \u201cCertain groups have high unemployment rates because they don\u2019t have a strong work ethic. \u201c\n2. \u201cCertain groups have higher unemployment rates than others because of societal factors beyond their control\u201d\n3. \u201cCertain groups have high unemployment rates because they do not have equal opportunities.\n4. \u201cCertain groups have high unemployment rates because they do not want to work.\u201d\n\nPerceived likelihood of personal involvement in gun violence: \nParticipants will be asked to respond to the following prompt on a scale of 1=absolutely impossible, 2=extremely unlikely, 3=very unlikely, 4=somewhat unlikely, 5=slightly unlikely, 6=neither likely nor unlikely, 7=slightly likely, 8=somewhat likely, 9=very likely, 10=extremely likely, 11=absolutely possible. They will then be asked to provide an open-ended explanation of their answer in a couple of sentences.\n1. Imagine that you had grown up in a poor, inner-city neighborhood with high rates of gun violence and little opportunity for legal employment. How likely do you think it is that you would have fallen into a path that led you to become involved in gun violence?", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "Stereotypical attributions about community gun violence: A composite score will be created for each participant by averaging their responses to all four items. \n\nSupport for punitive public policies: A composite score will be created for each participant by averaging their responses to all four items. \n\nSupport for restorative public policies: A composite score will be created for each participant by averaging their responses to all four items.
