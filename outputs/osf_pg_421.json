For present purposes, the concept of social capital encompasses a variety of individual-level behavioral and attitudinal outcomes including political participation, civic participation (e.g., membership in voluntary associations), network centrality, feelings of political efficacy, and social and political trust. Causally assessing this relationship requires separating the effect of attending university from confounding factors that may be associated with both the decision to enroll into university and political views, such as personal characteristics, early childhood socialization, or peer groups. To circumvent these issues, the study proposes a regression discontinuity design in Romania. The study takes advantage of a unique research design in Romania, where access to university is regulated by a high school exit exam, the baccalaureate (\u201cBac\u201d) and the results of all exams are public. This allows for the implementation of a regression discontinuity design (RDD), whereby only high school graduates who fall just above and below the cutoff necessary to enroll into university will be sampled. To be able to enroll into university a student must get a grade of at least 5 on all sections of the exam and an average grade for all sections of at leaset 6. The primary analysis will exploit a fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) design based on scores to the Bac. The treatment is not assigned perfectly based on the Bac score as in a sharp RD, but it is much easier for students to attend university if they pass the Bac than if they do not; one can thus expect a large jump (discontinuity) in the probability of attending university when moving from a student who barely fails the Bac to one who barely passes. Once identified based on the publicly available Bac results, the high school graduates in the target population will be contacted via Facebook and invited to take a survey that will assess, among other things, their social capital. The administration of the survey involves several steps. (1) From a complete list of all high schools in Romania (N~1500), we randomly draw 100 high schools. (2) From these schools, we identify the bac takers who fall within the target bandwidth (0.2 points above or below the cutoff) while scoring at least 5 on all sections of the exam. This is our target population. (3) We create FB meeting groups/ accounts for each of the 100 high schools. These accounts function as online fora for graduates to share memories and updates on their lives. (4) We try to identify high school graduates in our target population on each of the chosen high school\u2019s FB account. (5) We invite them to be friends with their online high school group. (While invitations will pursue graduates in our target population, these online fora will be open to all graduates from the respective high school.)

Survey questions will be randomized in order to avoid priming effects. We divide up the topic of social capital into four subcategories: voting (2 items), other modes of political participation (7 items), membership in voluntary associations (9 items), and trust (2 items). Questions pertaining to each of these subjects are included in the survey questionnaire (Appendix A). Respondents who answer less than half of these items will be dropped from the analysis and those who answer most but not all of them will have their missing responses imputed. We first create subcategory measures for each of the four subcategories by first standardizing each question and then taking a simple average of all items within a given subcategory. To construct an index of overall social capital we then take a simple average of the four subcategory indices. This overall social capital index represents our main dependent variable of interest. The central analysis will use a fuzzy RD design, with the causal effect estimated using the rdrobust function from the rdrobust R library with standard options for a fuzzy RD setup. We will cluster our standard errors by exam score since our score variable is not fully continuous, but slightly lumpy. The treatment variable of theoretical interest is university attendance and the score variable is the overall average BAC score. Because our survey sampling procedure will select respondents who necessarily have scores close to the threshold, we will not use standard bandwidth selection approaches and instead will simply include all of our data in the analysis. We will also conduct standard RD balance checks to assess whether the assumptions of our design appear plausible, as well as examine the robustness of estimates to bandwidth changes, recognizing that the already narrow bandwidth of our entire sample makes it unlikely that we will be able to observe much variation in our estimates by varying our bandwidth."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Romania"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "1000"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "IRB exemption"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "IRB exemption received on 07/06/2018"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Survey Methodology"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Governance"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e386920fa39b701741dde9c", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/uzdhk/providers/osfstorage/5e386920fa39b701741dde9c", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/uzdhk/providers/osfstorage/5e386920fa39b701741dde9c", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/uzdhk/providers/osfstorage/5e386920fa39b701741dde9c?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/uzdhk/providers/osfstorage/5e386920fa39b701741dde9c"}, "attributes": {"etag": "b9b0cb6e8da29303457f1c65a0a58f5b6f200f383e4e36392babf99daa05dd92", "kind": "file", "name": "20190314AL_survey.pdf", "path": "/5e386920fa39b701741dde9c", "size": 121870, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "5ad518393995eba018116d97ea424add", "sha256": "d5792a771f9d63ed8addc50fbb80022d53a20266592ceb5587d756dff6dbc8e4"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 121870, "modified": "2020-02-03T18:40:32.263548+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "uzdhk", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20190314AL_survey.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T18:40:32+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "uzdhk", "sha256": "d5792a771f9d63ed8addc50fbb80022d53a20266592ceb5587d756dff6dbc8e4", "viewUrl": "/project/bwkdt/files/osfstorage/5e38692957427b01810c4e33/", "selectedFileName": "20190314AL_survey.pdf"}, {"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e386924fa39b701831dab31", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/uzdhk/providers/osfstorage/5e386924fa39b701831dab31", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/uzdhk/providers/osfstorage/5e386924fa39b701831dab31", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/uzdhk/providers/osfstorage/5e386924fa39b701831dab31?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/uzdhk/providers/osfstorage/5e386924fa39b701831dab31"}, "attributes": {"etag": "70b554dcda0cb57ca4987a289d69418a664c78dcbfe6df04a194b1a2a95924ff", "kind": "file", "name": "20190314AL_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e386924fa39b701831dab31", "size": 229899, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "c408e1902c40d79a3ccc323fc736427e", "sha256": "c939fb623ccb46a3ec412f4683ea3f1ed4d59d79dcae2d105e0252b8f3a2d77c"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 229899, "modified": "2020-02-03T18:40:36.535321+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "uzdhk", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20190314AL_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T18:40:36+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "uzdhk", "sha256": "c939fb623ccb46a3ec412f4683ea3f1ed4d59d79dcae2d105e0252b8f3a2d77c", "viewUrl": "/project/bwkdt/files/osfstorage/5e38692957427b01810c4e31/", "selectedFileName": "20190314AL_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20190314AL_survey.pdf, 20190314AL_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Education and Social Capital", "q2": "John Gerring | Emanuel Coman | Brendan Apfeld | Stephen Jesse", "q3": "20190314AL", "q4": "03/14/2019 - 20:21", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to any research activities", "q9": "", "q10": "No", "q11": "3/1/19", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "The study seeks to test the accepted view that higher education increases social capital.

But under which conditions are emigrants willing to sacrifice economic returns for their origin country\u2019s national welfare? Diaspora bonds allow diaspora members to invest directly in the governments of their origin countries. These bonds are often priced at below-market returns, relying on diaspora members\u2019 willingness to provide a ``patriotic discount\u2019\u2019 that gives issuing governments access to cheaper capital and encourages migrants to contribute charitably through a less lucrative investment. An emerging literature in international political economy studies the conditional nature of investors\u2019 assessments of risk and willingness to invest. We contribute to this literature by investigating what shapes willingness to invest for a particular category of investors, diaspora members. We test how responsive diaspora investors are to both financial and non-financial considerations, adding to research on the diversity of investors\u2019 motivations. We also consider the literature on foreign aid, which points to self-interested, altruistic, and identity-oriented explanations for individuals\u2019 willingness to support international redistribution. Our project allows us to revisit these theories in a previously unstudied setting. Diaspora bonds are important in their own right. Diaspora communities of developing countries sent $466 billion in remittances to their home countries in 2017, a sum that eclipses the amount of official development assistance sent to these countries. Diaspora bonds could allow the governments of developing countries to more directly take advantage of the capital of their extended networks. In fact, diaspora bonds are mentioned in the UN Global Compact on Migration in support of its objective to create conditions for migrants and diasporas to fully contribute to sustainable development in all countries.

H2b: Individuals will be more likely to invest in bonds that are earmarked for specific purposes rather than general budgetary support. H2c: Priming individuals to think about politics will exaggerate the dynamics of H2a-b. Finally, a third set of hypotheses focuses on self-interest.

In the other half of the pairs, respondents compare between a hypothetical Indian diaspora bond and an alternative non-Indian bond. These comparisons allow us to examine how likely a respondent would be to actually select an Indian diaspora bond over other investment options.

We manipulate three aspects of the instructions we provide to each participant --- the framing (bonds as an \u201cinvestment opportunity\u201d vs. an \u201copportunity to give back\u201d), the state of the Indian economy (booming or flagging), and a political prime (\u201cthink about how the government will manage money\u201d vs. no prime).

But under which conditions are emigrants willing to sacrifice economic returns for their origin country\u2019s national welfare? Diaspora bonds allow diaspora members to invest directly in the governments of their origin countries. These bonds are often priced at below-market returns, relying on diaspora members\u2019 willingness to provide a ``patriotic discount\u2019\u2019 that gives issuing governments access to cheaper capital and encourages migrants to contribute charitably through a less lucrative investment. An emerging literature in international political economy studies the conditional nature of investors\u2019 assessments of risk and willingness to invest. We contribute to this literature by investigating what shapes willingness to invest for a particular category of investors, diaspora members. We test how responsive diaspora investors are to both financial and non-financial considerations, adding to research on the diversity of investors\u2019 motivations. We also consider the literature on foreign aid, which points to self-interested, altruistic, and identity-oriented explanations for individuals\u2019 willingness to support international redistribution. Our project allows us to revisit these theories in a previously unstudied setting. Diaspora bonds are important in their own right. Diaspora communities of developing countries sent $466 billion in remittances to their home countries in 2017, a sum that eclipses the amount of official development assistance sent to these countries. Diaspora bonds could allow the governments of developing countries to more directly take advantage of the capital of their extended networks. In fact, diaspora bonds are mentioned in the UN Global Compact on Migration in support of its objective to create conditions for migrants and diasporas to fully contribute to sustainable development in all countries.

H1b: Individuals will be no less likely to invest in diaspora bonds when the economy is doing poorly than doing well. H1c: Individuals who share ethnic ties with the ruling party will be more likely to invest in a diaspora bond. H1d: Individuals will be more likely to invest in bonds that are open only to their co-nationals. H1e: Individuals with a stronger sense of patriotism will be more likely to invest in a diaspora bond relative to other better-performing investments and will be more likely to exhibit the dynamics described in H1a-d. A second set of hypotheses looks instead to political preferences. H2a: Individuals who approve of the recipient country\u2019s government will be more likely to invest in diaspora bonds. H2b: Individuals will be more likely to invest in bonds that are earmarked for specific purposes rather than general budgetary support. H2c: Priming individuals to think about politics will exaggerate the dynamics of H2a-b. Finally, a third set of hypotheses focuses on self-interest.

We aim to present candidates in a setting which minimizes social desirability bias, to ensure that the differential treatment effects (if any) of the \u201clabels\u201d and \u201cpictures\u201d conditions are not driven by the respondent\u2019s desire to present him- or herself to the researcher as non-racist (external motivation to control stereotyping). To this end, we adapt and extend Hainmueller et al.\u2019s (2014) conjoint design for stated-preference experiments. Respondents are presented with pairs of choice objects, created by choosing among a number of pre-set \u201clevels\u201d for each of several attributes. In our design, the alternatives are candidates; the attributes are Race/Ethnicity, Education, Military Service, Political Party, and Other Information; and the choice task is voting. Respondents vote on six pairs of candidates. Hainmueller et al. (2014) hypothesize that conjoint designs are relatively insusceptible to social desirability bias, because the choice objects usually differ from one another on many dimensions that are not socially sensitive. A respondent who actually prefers profile A to profile B on racial grounds can therefore choose A without necessarily revealing her racial/ethnic preference. In typical conjoint designs, attribute levels are independently randomized. We will depart from this convention, however, and present respondents with candidate pairs prescreened to be roughly equally attractive to the typical respondent in all respects other than race / ethnicity. Our setup maintains the critical feature (for present purposes) of the typical conjoint design\u2014the candidates in a pair differ from one another in many respects other than race/ethnicity\u2014while giving us more power to detect differences between the average treatment effect of race/ethnicity in the \u201clabels\u201d and \u201cpictures\u201d conditions. Quite simply, when two candidates are about evenly matched, the treatment effect of varying a candidate\u2019s race/ethnicity on the probability that he is chosen is larger than when one candidate in the matchup dominates the other on many non-racial dimensions. After voting on six candidate matchups, respondents answer a short post-experiment survey in which we elicit basic demographic information and present a battery of questions developed by social psychologists to measure \u201cinternal\u201d and \u201cexternal\u201d motivations to control stereotyping (Plant and Devine, 1998). If differences are due to pictures inducing a gut-level reaction that cognitive commitments to nondiscrimination do not override, the treatment difference should be most pronounced among respondents who are internally motivated to control stereotyping."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "The following are non-precise, verbal descriptions of our hypotheses.

Elmendorf", "q3": "20160812AA", "q4": "08/12/2016 - 15:49", "q5": "We gratefully acknowledge support from Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences (TESS).", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to assignment of treatment", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "8/16/16", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "This study tests the hypothesis that white voters\u2014particularly white voters who are internally motivated to control stereotyping\u2014respond more favorably to written descriptions of a candidate as \u201cLatino/Hispanic\u201d than to photographs of the same candidate revealing his apparent ethnicity. We aim to present candidates in a setting which minimizes social desirability bias, to ensure that the differential treatment effects (if any) of the \u201clabels\u201d and \u201cpictures\u201d conditions are not driven by the respondent\u2019s desire to present him- or herself to the researcher as non-racist (external motivation to control stereotyping). To this end, we adapt and extend Hainmueller et al.\u2019s (2014) conjoint design for stated-preference experiments. Respondents are presented with pairs of choice objects, created by choosing among a number of pre-set \u201clevels\u201d for each of several attributes. In our design, the alternatives are candidates; the attributes are Race/Ethnicity, Education, Military Service, Political Party, and Other Information; and the choice task is voting. Respondents vote on six pairs of candidates. Hainmueller et al. (2014) hypothesize that conjoint designs are relatively insusceptible to social desirability bias, because the choice objects usually differ from one another on many dimensions that are not socially sensitive. A respondent who actually prefers profile A to profile B on racial grounds can therefore choose A without necessarily revealing her racial/ethnic preference. In typical conjoint designs, attribute levels are independently randomized. We will depart from this convention, however, and present respondents with candidate pairs prescreened to be roughly equally attractive to the typical respondent in all respects other than race / ethnicity. Our setup maintains the critical feature (for present purposes) of the typical conjoint design\u2014the candidates in a pair differ from one another in many respects other than race/ethnicity\u2014while giving us more power to detect differences between the average treatment effect of race/ethnicity in the \u201clabels\u201d and \u201cpictures\u201d conditions. Quite simply, when two candidates are about evenly matched, the treatment effect of varying a candidate\u2019s race/ethnicity on the probability that he is chosen is larger than when one candidate in the matchup dominates the other on many non-racial dimensions. After voting on six candidate matchups, respondents answer a short post-experiment survey in which we elicit basic demographic information and present a battery of questions developed by social psychologists to measure \u201cinternal\u201d and \u201cexternal\u201d motivations to control stereotyping (Plant and Devine, 1998). If differences are due to pictures inducing a gut-level reaction that cognitive commitments to nondiscrimination do not override, the treatment difference should be most pronounced among respondents who are internally motivated to control stereotyping.", "q16": "The following are non-precise, verbal descriptions of our hypotheses. Please refer to the additional documentation for formal statements of our estimands and hypotheses. H1 (primary hypothesis): In head-to-head matchups between a white candidate and a Latino/Hispanic candidate whose attributes, in expectation, are equivalent except for apparent ethnicity, the expected white vote share of the Latino/Hispanic candidate is greater when the candidates\u2019 ethnicity is conveyed to voters via written labels and ethnically identifiable names, than when ethnicity is conveyed via photographs and ethnically identifiable names. H2 (primary hypothesis; moderator): The H1 effect is larger among white voters who are internally motivated to control stereotyping of Latinos/Hispanics than among white voters who are not internally motivated to control stereotyping of Latinos/Hispanics. H3 (primary hypothesis; moderator): In head-to-head matchups between a white candidate and a Latino/Hispanic candidate whose attributes, in expectation, are equivalent except for apparent ethnicity, the expected vote share of the Latino/Hispanic candidate when the candidates\u2019 ethnicity is conveyed via written labels and ethnically identifiable names is the same as the candidate\u2019s expected vote share when ethnicity is conveyed via photographs and ethnically identifiable names, among white respondents who are externally but not internally motivated to control stereotyping. H4 (exploratory hypothesis): In head-to-head matchups between a white candidate and a Latino/Hispanic candidate whose attributes, in expectation, are equivalent except for apparent ethnicity, the expected white vote share of the Latino/Hispanic candidate is less than 0.5 when the candidates\u2019 ethnicity is conveyed to voters via written labels and ethnically identifiable names. H5 (exploratory hypothesis): In head-to-head matchups between a white candidate and a Latino/Hispanic candidate whose attributes, in expectation, are equivalent except for apparent ethnicity, the expected white vote share of the Latino/Hispanic candidate is less than 0.5 when the candidates\u2019 ethnicity is conveyed to voters via photographs and ethnically identifiable names.", "q17": "We will test these hypotheses using linear regression with clustered standard errors in a manner consistent with Hainmueller et al.

High levels of Democratic vote choice among Asian Americans are surprising, given that many are of high socioeconomic status, immigrated from countries with a communist history, or identify as Evangelical Christians. Why do Asian Americans, voters with some conservative predispositions, support Democrats? In previous observational work, I find evidence in support of a theory of \u201csocial transmission,\u201d which predicts that Asian Americans develop partisan preferences through the diffusion of partisan views from peers rather than the family. This experiment will provide a direct causal test of this theory. In this study, I will test the effects of viewing partisan social media posts from friends (treatment) versus an article headline (control) on the partisan preferences of Asian American college students. Using a randomized experiment, I will vary the nature and content of hypothetical partisan social media posts, drawing on respondent\u2019s referrals of their own friends to create the treatments.

Exposure to the treatment will also increase support for Democrats and intentions to vote within subjects. Hypothesis 1a (Message content effects): The treatment effects will be limited to or stronger for respondents who view an inclusion treatment, compared to those who view an affective treatment. Hypothesis 1b (Racial composition effects): Among Asian American respondents, the treatment effects on partisan preferences will be stronger for or limited to those who view a post from mostly non-Asian friends, compared to those who view a post from mostly Asian friends.

High levels of Democratic vote choice among Asian Americans are surprising, given that many are of high socioeconomic status, immigrated from countries with a communist history, or identify as Evangelical Christians. Why do Asian Americans, voters with some conservative predispositions, support Democrats? In previous observational work, I find evidence in support of a theory of \u201csocial transmission,\u201d which predicts that Asian Americans develop partisan preferences through the diffusion of partisan views from peers rather than the family. This experiment will provide a direct causal test of this theory. In this study, I will test the effects of viewing partisan social media posts from friends (treatment) versus an article headline (control) on the partisan preferences of Asian American college students. Using a randomized experiment, I will vary the nature and content of hypothetical partisan social media posts, drawing on respondent\u2019s referrals of their own friends to create the treatments. See the attached pre-analysis plan for more information about the study.", "q16": "The main hypotheses are listed below. See the attached pre-analysis plan for additional hypotheses and information about the outcomes, moderators, pre-treatment covariates (pp. 6-10). Hypothesis 1 (Social network effects): Relative to social media posts with an article headline alone (control), posts with a headline and comments from friends (treatment) will increase support for the Democratic Party and intentions to vote in future elections. Exposure to the treatment will also increase support for Democrats and intentions to vote within subjects. Hypothesis 1a (Message content effects): The treatment effects will be limited to or stronger for respondents who view an inclusion treatment, compared to those who view an affective treatment. Hypothesis 1b (Racial composition effects): Among Asian American respondents, the treatment effects on partisan preferences will be stronger for or limited to those who view a post from mostly non-Asian friends, compared to those who view a post from mostly Asian friends. In contrast, the treatment effects on voting will be stronger for those who view a post from mostly Asian friends, compared to those who view a post from mostly non-Asian friends.
