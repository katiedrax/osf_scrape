frailty having cancer surgery", "description": "BACKGROUND: Frailty is a well-established predictor of adverse postoperative outcomes in older surgical patients and is especially common in older people having cancer surgery. Early evidence suggests exercise could improve postoperative outcomes for people with frailty, however little is known about the factors that influence older people\u2019s adherence in exercise before surgery (prehabilitation) programs.\n\nOBJECTIVE: Our objective is to identify predictors of prehabilitation adherence in older adults living with frailty before cancer surgery.\n\nMETHODS: This will be a nested prospective cohort of older adults with frailty having cancer surgery who participated in a randomized controlled trial of home-based prehabilitation vs. standard care to improve postoperative functional performance. It is anticipated that 102 participants from the intervention arm will be included in this study\u2019s nested cohort.\n\nWe will construct a multivariable ordinary least squares linear regression model using pre-specified, prospectively collected covariates to predict adherence (% prescribed exercise sessions attempted). Our covariates (collected at baseline) have been selected a priori based on clinical expertise and literature review; they will include age, sex, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), disability, frailty score, previous physical activity, depression, and neoadjuvant therapy. If assumptions of normality are met, our dependent variable will be % adherence; otherwise a log transformation will be applied. All continuous variables will be standardized and assessed for best fit using fractional polynomials. Collinearity will be considered using variance inflation factor and addressed with penalisation. Missing data will be handled using multiple imputation. Bootstrapping will be used to internally validate the model. \n\nEXPECTED RESULTS: This model will help us to understand the proportion of variance in prehabilitation adherence that is explained by baseline participant characteristics. This will allow for identification of people at risk of low adherence to inform resource targeting and personalization of prehabilitation support systems.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-22T15:54:40.662185", "date_modified": "2020-04-22T15:53:01.491378", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Julia F Shaw"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "b226c375ccf41393fc079e534fcb3b96ca6d746df2a1f0e28a4b394aa64ef7e0ab9f79782d0639732ac4c2e1cfa8c9050a1dffe89db90d4d14062979e505f336e84e316e3ad00959087a773a5c5f7ce98dd45232602ef7113df596dd17ad564271d60fc20cdd0e6f0e232f2f01e951cb9eb522246c5af810b4db20666d9e55651a9c6fd94bab9ec0df6ff3e7ce9ca220", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-22T15:54:40.644731", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Open-Ended Registration", "registered_meta": {"summary": {"extra": [], "value": "This is a registration of plans for the development and validation of a prediction model.

typically developed control?", "description": "Despite every day life impairments in cognitive flexibility are frequently reported in autism, these impairments are more inconsistent in laboratory experiments (Teunisse et al., 2012).

This will lead to a lesser CR and a longer RT for the ASD group compared to the control group. We also expect two interaction effects.

The type of emotional shift will be added in our model and we expect an interaction between the shift effect and the emotional type.

Particularly, autistic females seem to have enhanced attention to faces as compared to autistic males (Harrop et al., 2018). They also have better social camouflaging (Schuck et al., 2019) and flexibility abilities (B\u00f6lte et al., 2011). Even if TD females might be faster at categorizing socio-emotional scenes (Vanmarcke &amp; Wagemans, 2015), emotion recognition seems not to differ between autistic males and females on a task without contextual cues (Baron-Cohen et al., 2015). They might even be more impaired in emotion categorization during complex situations (Vanmarcke et al., 2016).

"}, "conditions": {"extra": [], "value": "Autistic participants will be compared to control participants. For each flexibility task (EST and TST), there will be two conditions, described below:  the shifting condition and the non-shifting condition.\n\nProcedure and material\nThe experiment will be performed online on the Psytoolkit platform (Stoet, 2010, 2016). Using online experiment is particularly relevant with autistic participants regarding their difficulties with changes and with social communication. Autistic persons usually feel more comfortable with online communication, as it allows more control, it reduces stress related to social interactions and it ensure to protect their privacy (Benford &amp; Standen, 2009; Gillespie-Lynch et al., 2014). Therefore online experiment could facilitate optimal performances. The Psytoolkit platform allow reliable data collection for correct response rate and response time (Kim et al., 2019). The experiment will include 5 parts. Part 2 and 3 will be counterbalanced. Before the first part, the participant will be informed about the experiment and will have to give its informed consent. \n\nPart 1: Demographical data\nDuring this first part, we will collect demographical data. All participants will have to report their age, sex, education level, and handedness. They will have to report if they have a normal or corrected to normal visual acuity. Participants will also have to report if they have another psychiatric or neurological diagnosis (with a general YES/NO answer), if they have a developmental diagnosis (e.g., dyslexia, ADHD) except autism, and if they have a pharmacological treatment that might impair their cognitive functions. \nThen, participants will also have to self-report if they have an autism diagnosis, and if yes, which kind of autism diagnosis. We will ensure that they received a clinical diagnosis by asking them which type of professional has delivered their diagnosis.\n\nPart 2: The Emotional Shifting task (Biro et al., in prep)\nDuring this second part, participants will have to perform an 8 minutes Emotional Shifting Task (EST), developed by (Biro et al., in prep). Contrary to previous emotional flexibility tasks, where the participant had to switch between an emotional task and another type of task, the switch in the EST will remain in the emotional domain and emotional faces will include their context, which is more ecological. During this task, the participant will have to recognize the valence of an emotion on a truncated picture (i.e., without context), in the Simple Emotion condition. This will enable us to evaluate the ability of the participant to recognize a simple emotion without context. Then, the same image will appear untruncated (i.e., with its context) and again, the participant will have to recognize the valence of the emotion. This will be the Complex Emotion condition. During the non-shifting condition (which could be either from positive to positive or negative to negative), the context will be congruent with the emotion that appears at the first sight during the Simple Emotion Condition. During the shifting condition (which could be either positive to negative or negative to positive), it will be incongruent. Hence, the participant will have to decide to change his first judgment or not, by picking up cues in the context, which have the predictive value to perform the task. Cueing is not explicit here. Moreover, shifting and non-shifting conditions are randomly mixed (unpredictable). To give his answer, the participant will have to press the keyboard (B or V key) with his index (the right index for right handed and left index for left handed). The side of emotion will be counterbalanced (B for positive and V for negative for half of the participants and the contrary for the other half).\n\nPart 3: The Task Switching Task (Rogers &amp; Monsell, 1995).\nThe participant will then perform a cognitive flexibility task lasting 8 minutes: the Task Switching Task (TST). During this task, a square will appear on the screen, which will be divided into four cells. A letter and a number will appear side by side, on the top left cell, then on the top right cell, then on the bottom right cell and finally on the bottom left cell, and so on and so forth. When the stimulus will appear on the top cells, the participant will have to perform the letter task, that is, press V if the letter is a consonant and press B if the letter is a vowel. When the stimulus will appear in the bottom cells, the participant will have to perform the number task, that is press V if the number is odd and press B if the number is even. As the task is difficult, and implies to be memorized, the participant will be first trained only on the letter task, then the participant will be trained only on the number task, and finally, he will perform mixed tasks. When tasks will be mixed, the order will always be the same (previously described). Hence, the participant will know when the switch between task will appear (predictable) and he will also know exactly what to do as the cue for the switch is explicit.\n\nPart 4: Autism Spectrum Quotient (AS - Baron-Cohen et al., 2001)\nThis is a 10 minutes questionnaire aiming at evaluating autistic traits in the participant. A score above 32 is usually associated to high autistic traits.\n\nPart 5: Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS - Watson et al., 1988)\nThis is a 5 minutes questionnaire that aims to detect anxious and depressive states. Scores above the 5th percentile (Positive affects &lt; 18; Negative affects &gt; 29) are correlated with depressive and/or anxious states (Crawford &amp; Henry, 2004).\n"}, "hypothesis": {"extra": [], "value": "Autism Spectrum Disorders  are characterized by socio-communicative impairments associated with specific interests, repetitive behaviors as well as sensory specificities (American Psychiatric Association et al., 2015). Repetitive behaviors and the difficulty for autistic people to change their plans and routines is an expression of their cognitive inflexibility. Cognitive flexibility is the ability to switch from one task to another, or to change strategy or perspective according to the situation. Thus, it is an essential adaptive skill, which implies to be attentive to relevant cues (which have a predictive value for the switch) and also to disengage attention to irrelevant ones. Real-life cognitive flexibility impairments are usually well reported by using the shift sub-scale of the BRIEF questionnaire (Gioia et al., 2000; Roth et al., 2005), which discriminates autistic adults from typically developing (TD) controls (Leung &amp; Zakzanis, 2014). However, laboratory results on flexibility are quite inconsistent and poorly differentiate autistic participants from TD controls (Leung &amp; Zakzanis, 2014). De Vries and Geurts (2012) suggest that mixed results could be related to a lack of ecological validity of most of these tests. Everyday life situations usually require the processing of complex stimuli and adaptation to unpredictable changes. De Vries and Geurts (2012) created a flexibility task with unpredictable changes and involving human emotional faces, which are more ecological stimuli. Thus, the task explored the interplay between socio-emotional information processing and cognitive flexibility in autism, studying the interactive effect of the two main symptoms of autism, usually studied separately. In their task, participants were seeing faces and had to report either the gender or the emotion of the face, according to a cue appearing just above the face. Contrary to their prediction, authors found no overall difference in performances between autistic children and TD controls. They suggested that the lack of significant results could emerge from the predictable nature of their task as the switch, despite being unannounced, was guided by explicit rules (i.e., the cue indicating the switch). They also suggested that the emotional content was to simple (only two basics emotions) and could therefore reduce the ecological validity of the task. In real-life, rules are implicit, usually requiring the processing of multiple cues. Hence, flexibility impairments in autism would mainly appear during complex tasks, for instance, when the task require an autonomous exploration of the relevant cues to achieve the task. It might explain why performances at the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), in which the rule has to be guessed by the participant, are usually impaired in autism (Landry &amp; Al-Taie, 2016), despite other flexibility tasks often fail to differentiate autistic participants from TD controls. In WCST, studies usually show more perseverative errors in autism compared to TD controls (Landry &amp; Al-Taie, 2016). Latinus et al. (2019) also explored the interplay between socio-emotional information processing and cognitive flexibility, using an emotional WCST. Participants have to abstract the rule to pair the central face with a surrounding one, either by the identity, by the emotion, or by the frame color. Contrary to Landry and Al-Taie (2016), they found no group difference for perseverative and non-perseverative errors and attribute this result to the task explicitness. However, they found that autistic participants committed more errors than control participants when they have to find the emotion rule. This result can reveal more difficulties for autistic participants to switch toward emotional processing, but has not been found in the study of De Vries and Geurts (2012). \nVan de Cruys et al. (2014) hypothesize that flexibility impairments in autism could be explained by a more general framework, encompassing the different autism symptoms, relying on predictive coding frameworks. They suggest that autism characteristics can be explained by high and inflexible precision of prediction errors. Prediction errors is the difference between the sensory input and predictions (or priors, which are abstracted from past experiences). The weight allowed to prediction errors should be adapted according to meta-learning (i.e., learning of the relevant characteristics for realizing the task). High precision to prediction error means that each error is seen as \u201cimportant\u201d, thus preventing from meta-learning. Consequently, it would create a prolonged processing of stimuli, particularly if they are unpredicted, and deficit in disengaging (Van de Cruys et al., 2014) that can result in perseveration, and might thus explain flexibility impairments. This would also explain several social difficulties experienced by autistic persons, as emotional faces and social situations are particularly complex, changing, and context-bound. Meta-learning of which cues are informative is thus very challenging in these situations.\nThe objective of our study is to examine the effect of unpredictability and non-cued switches of a complex socio-emotional environment on flexibility of autistic participants compared to a TD control group. To this end, we employed the novel Emotional Shifting Task (EST, Biro et al., in prep) to assess emotional flexibility.

In WCST, studies usually show more perseverative errors in autism compared to TD controls (Landry &amp; Al-Taie, 2016). Latinus et al. (2019) also explored the interplay between socio-emotional information processing and cognitive flexibility, using an emotional WCST. Participants have to abstract the rule to pair the central face with a surrounding one, either by the identity, by the emotion, or by the frame color. Contrary to Landry and Al-Taie (2016), they found no group difference for perseverative and non-perseverative errors and attribute this result to the task explicitness. However, they found that autistic participants committed more errors than control participants when they have to find the emotion rule. This result can reveal more difficulties for autistic participants to switch toward emotional processing, but has not been found in the study of De Vries and Geurts (2012). \nVan de Cruys et al. (2014) hypothesize that flexibility impairments in autism could be explained by a more general framework, encompassing the different autism symptoms, relying on predictive coding frameworks. They suggest that autism characteristics can be explained by high and inflexible precision of prediction errors. Prediction errors is the difference between the sensory input and predictions (or priors, which are abstracted from past experiences). The weight allowed to prediction errors should be adapted according to meta-learning (i.e., learning of the relevant characteristics for realizing the task). High precision to prediction error means that each error is seen as \u201cimportant\u201d, thus preventing from meta-learning. Consequently, it would create a prolonged processing of stimuli, particularly if they are unpredicted, and deficit in disengaging (Van de Cruys et al., 2014) that can result in perseveration, and might thus explain flexibility impairments. This would also explain several social difficulties experienced by autistic persons, as emotional faces and social situations are particularly complex, changing, and context-bound. Meta-learning of which cues are informative is thus very challenging in these situations.\nThe objective of our study is to examine the effect of unpredictability and non-cued switches of a complex socio-emotional environment on flexibility of autistic participants compared to a TD control group. To this end, we employed the novel Emotional Shifting Task (EST, Biro et al., in prep) to assess emotional flexibility.
