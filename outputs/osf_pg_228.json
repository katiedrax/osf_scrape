However, experimental evidence has been limited and subject to confounds. \n\nTo address this, we will utilize a novel pharmacological approach (acetaminophen) to investigate whether emotion plays a pivotal role in judgments of moral condemnation. We will also investigate whether the influence of emotion on moral condemnation interacts with the domain of the moral transgression. \n\nA second aim of this experiment is to examine the effects of acetaminophen intervention on moral decision making.

We will investigate the influence of emotion on moral condemnation by manipulating emotion with acetaminophen. Acetaminophen, or Tylenol as it is commonly known, is an analgesic that has been shown to reduce the extremity of emotion evaluations for both positive and negative valence, but not non-evaluative judgments (Durso et al., 2015). Using a double-blind placebo controlled design, we will first administer treatment, and then collect judgments of normed transgressions (Clifford et al., 2015) that are matched on arousal (moderate-high arousal) and wrongness (moderately-highly wrong), and decisions on moral dilemmas that include personal and impersonal dilemmas. We have selected transgressions from the harm and purity domains, and included social norm violations from the same battery (Clifford et al., 2015) to act as a neutral control. Unlike the moral transgressions (harm and purity), social norm violations are already near floor for wrongness and emotion; thus, we don\u2019t expect Tylenol to further reduce ratings, but instead have included them to provide contrast to the moral violations. The present study will also investigate whether acetaminophen differentially affects condemnation of purity transgressions, harm transgressions, or violations of social norms. \n\nAcetaminophen and emotion. Given the importance of the role of emotion in the present research, we will collect emotion ratings for each moral judgment or dilemma. These ratings will be used to assess whether acetaminophen has reduced the overall average ratings of emotion. Critically, we will also test emotion as a mediating variable in the relationship between acetaminophen and moral judgments or decisions. Indeed, if ratings of emotion do not mediate the relationship between treatment and moral judgment, this would provide strong evidence against the self-perception of emotion driving moral judgments. Of course, acetaminophen may affect emotion in ways that are not captured by our measure (e.g., physiology), but this outcome would be most consistent with cognitivist views of moral judgment.\n\nModeration of treatment effects by individual differences. Previous research has suggested that individuals high in personal body awareness evidence larger effects of emotion manipulations on moral judgment (Schnall et al., 2008). We will therefore investigate whether personal body awareness and trait mindfulness moderate the effect of acetaminophen on moral judgment. \n\nExperimental Procedure\n\nFollowing the informed consent process, participants will be randomly assigned to either acetaminophen condition or placebo condition. This will begin the treatment uptake period (60 minutes), during which participants will complete a number of questionnaires that do not contain either moral, emotional, or related construct questions (e.g., Big Five Aspects; Duke Religion Index, Paranormal Beliefs). Participants will work on these questionnaires for 60 minutes or until they finish. If they finish before the end of the uptake period, they will complete puzzles (e.g., Sudoku) until the minimum uptake period has passed. \n\nAfter the uptake period is complete, participants will begin the main experimental task. They will first assess transgressions; each transgression type will be in a separate block, with the scenarios presented in random order. To minimize the likelihood of participants being swayed by their own ratings, we have split the moral and emotion ratings. Participants will view each scenario twice for a single block (before moving to the next block): first, randomly presented scenarios from the block will be followed by the immorality rating; second, the same scenarios will be presented randomly again and followed by the emotion rating. The order of transgression block presentation will be counterbalanced across participants. Following this, participants will view and make judgments about 10 personal and 10 impersonal dilemmas presented in fully-randomized trials. The block of 20 dilemmas will always follow the blocks of transgressions.  \n\nParticipants will then complete the key individual differences measures (e.g., MFQ). Finally, when the participant completes the main experimental procedure, the experimenter will administer a condition guess questionnaire to assess whether participants were accurately able to guess the treatment they were randomly assigned to.\n"}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "The effects of acetaminophen on moral judgment and decision-making", "q2": "Jordan Wylie, Hanah Chapman, Matthew Vanaman, Justin Storbeck", "q3": "Debates concerning the active ingredient in moral judgment and decision-making continue to burden the field of moral psychology.

Unlike the moral transgressions (harm and purity), social norm violations are already near floor for wrongness and emotion; thus, we don\u2019t expect Tylenol to further reduce ratings, but instead have included them to provide contrast to the moral violations. The present study will also investigate whether acetaminophen differentially affects condemnation of purity transgressions, harm transgressions, or violations of social norms. \n\nAcetaminophen and emotion. Given the importance of the role of emotion in the present research, we will collect emotion ratings for each moral judgment or dilemma. These ratings will be used to assess whether acetaminophen has reduced the overall average ratings of emotion. Critically, we will also test emotion as a mediating variable in the relationship between acetaminophen and moral judgments or decisions. Indeed, if ratings of emotion do not mediate the relationship between treatment and moral judgment, this would provide strong evidence against the self-perception of emotion driving moral judgments. Of course, acetaminophen may affect emotion in ways that are not captured by our measure (e.g., physiology), but this outcome would be most consistent with cognitivist views of moral judgment.\n\nModeration of treatment effects by individual differences. Previous research has suggested that individuals high in personal body awareness evidence larger effects of emotion manipulations on moral judgment (Schnall et al., 2008). We will therefore investigate whether personal body awareness and trait mindfulness moderate the effect of acetaminophen on moral judgment. \n\nExperimental Procedure\n\nFollowing the informed consent process, participants will be randomly assigned to either acetaminophen condition or placebo condition. This will begin the treatment uptake period (60 minutes), during which participants will complete a number of questionnaires that do not contain either moral, emotional, or related construct questions (e.g., Big Five Aspects; Duke Religion Index, Paranormal Beliefs). Participants will work on these questionnaires for 60 minutes or until they finish. If they finish before the end of the uptake period, they will complete puzzles (e.g., Sudoku) until the minimum uptake period has passed. \n\nAfter the uptake period is complete, participants will begin the main experimental task. They will first assess transgressions; each transgression type will be in a separate block, with the scenarios presented in random order. To minimize the likelihood of participants being swayed by their own ratings, we have split the moral and emotion ratings. Participants will view each scenario twice for a single block (before moving to the next block): first, randomly presented scenarios from the block will be followed by the immorality rating; second, the same scenarios will be presented randomly again and followed by the emotion rating. The order of transgression block presentation will be counterbalanced across participants. Following this, participants will view and make judgments about 10 personal and 10 impersonal dilemmas presented in fully-randomized trials. The block of 20 dilemmas will always follow the blocks of transgressions.  \n\nParticipants will then complete the key individual differences measures (e.g., MFQ). Finally, when the participant completes the main experimental procedure, the experimenter will administer a condition guess questionnaire to assess whether participants were accurately able to guess the treatment they were randomly assigned to.\n", "q8.question": "Moral Transgressions: \nA counterbalanced 2 (Treatment; Acetaminophen or Placebo) x 3 (Transgression Type: Harm, Purity, and Social Conventional) mixed factorial design.\nWithin-subjects IV: Transgression Type \nBetween-subjects IV: Treatment - participants will be randomly assigned to either Acetaminophen or Placebo conditions.   \n\nMoral Dilemmas (will always follow moral transgression ratings): \nA counterbalanced 2 (Treatment; Acetaminophen or Placebo) x 2 (Dilemma Type: Utilitarian vs. Deontological) mixed factorial design.\nWithin-subjects IV: Dilemma Type \nBetween-subjects IV: Treatment  ", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Participants \nQueens college students will be recruited from campus and the subject pool for participation.

No analyses have been performed on this holdout dataset yet, and all replication analyses will be conducted as outlined in this preregistration. "}, "analyses": {"extra": [], "value": "General modeling notes. For many analyses, mixed-effects models will be used. Mixed-effects models allow for repeated measurements to be nested within participants by adding a random effect of participant. Model-building analyses in the exploratory dataset also revealed that adding a random slope of time in therapy greatly improved model fit for models in which time in therapy is a predictor. As such, we again plan to test whether adding a random slope for time in therapy improves model fit in the validation dataset, and if so, we will include it in mixed-effect models. Additionally, we plan to conduct primary analyses on internalizing symptoms. However, we also plan to report statistics for analyses of depression and anxiety separately in the supplement, for thoroughness. \n\n1) Do clients\u2019 symptoms decrease over the course of therapy? We will use a mixed-effects model to test for a linear relationship between days in treatment and internalizing symptoms. \n\n2) Does client linguistic distance increase over the course of therapy? We will first conduct a series of mixed-effects models to explore whether the traditional measure of linguistic distance increases over therapy and if this reflects a general issue in which present-tense verbs, past-tense verbs, future-tense verbs, first-person singular pronouns, and pronouns that are not first-person singular all increase over time in therapy. If all of these word types increase over therapy, we will have justification to use the newer measures of temporal and social distance in our analyses. We will use two mixed-effects models to test whether temporal distance (i.e., the proportion of verbs that were not in the present tense) and social distance (i.e., the proportion of pronouns that were not first-person singular) were significantly related to time in therapy. \n\n3) Does client linguistic distance track client symptoms? Two mixed-effects models will test whether clients\u2019 temporal and social distance are significantly related to internalizing symptoms. Prior research has shown that in longitudinal designs, it is important to decompose predictors into their within-person and between-person sources of variance (Bolger &amp; Laurenceau, 2013; Enders &amp; Tofighi, 2007). As such, we will follow prior work in decomposing the measures of temporal and social distance into within-person and between-person components. In essence, a variable representing the within-person fluctuation in temporal distance will be created by subtracting each individual\u2019s mean temporal distance score from the score of each of their observations (i.e., producing a variable representing within-person deviations, centered around individuals\u2019 means). This will be repeated for social distance. Then, a variable representing between-person variance in temporal distance will be constructed by subtracting the overall group mean of temporal distance from that participant\u2019s average temporal distance (i.e., a variable that is constant within each participant and represent how their mean level deviates from the group\u2019s mean). The same will be repeated for social distance. These within-person and between-person variables will then be entered simultaneously in mixed-effects models to test how internalizing symptoms relate to both within- and between-person variance in linguistic distance. \n\n4) Do within-person shifts in linguistic distance mediate changes in internalizing symptoms over the course of treatment? If the analyses above provide support for each leg of the mediation model described above, we will then conduct mediation analyses to formally test whether within-person increases in temporal or social distance over the course of treatment mediate symptom changes. As described above, we will use measures of temporal and social distance that are decomposed into their within-person and between-person components in these models. Typically, mediation analyses utilize bootstrapping methods (i.e., randomly sampling from the original dataset with preplacement thousands of times) to generate many samples from which a confidence window can be constructed to test the significance of mediation model (Davison &amp; Hinkley, 1997). However, the appropriate method for bootstrapping multilevel data is not clear, as random samples can drawn at the participant level, at the observation level, or at both participant and observation levels. We thus used Bayesian analytic procedures, which do not involve bootstrapping methods, for our mediation analyses to sidestep this issue (for a similar approach, see Rodman et al., under review). Consequently, we will conduct Bayesian mediation analyses testing whether temporal and/or social distance mediate the relationship between time in therapy and internalizing symptoms. Like the mixed-effects models described above, the Bayesian regression models will include a random effect of participant to account for the multi-level nature of the dataset. To provide relatively unbiased starting points for Bayesian analyses, we will supply weakly informative priors (gaussian distribution of M = 0, SD = 10) for all regressors in the models. Bayesian analyses will be implemented using the Stan language in R (Stan Development Team, 2017). Two Markov chains using the Monte Carlo No U-Turn Sampler (Hoffman &amp; Gelman, 2014) will approximate the posterior distribution of each regressor across 12,500 iterations, with the first 2,500 iterations discarded as burn-in. The indirect effect (i.e., the a \u00d7 b pathway for the within-person parameter) and proportion mediated [i.e., indirect effect / (indirect effect + direct effect) \u00d7 100] will be computed for each mediation model. A significant mediation will be said to occur when the 95% credible range (CR) of posterior density for the indirect effect does not include 0. \n\n5) Does therapist linguistic distance relate to treatment outcomes? As a simple preliminary analysis of this question, we will first test for a simple correlation between a client\u2019s overall symptom reduction (i.e., final internalizing symptom score \u2013 initial internalizing symptom score) and their therapist\u2019s overall level of linguistic distance. We will also test whether this relationship holds after controlling for clients\u2019 baseline internalizing symptom scores. We will then test whether therapist linguistic distance indeed moderates the mediation model proposed above. This involves adding therapist linguistic distance as an interaction term to mixed-effects regressions for each of the legs of the mediation model. [i.e., does therapist linguistic distance interact with time in therapy in predicting client symptoms (c path moderation)? Does therapist linguistic distance interact with time in therapy in predicting client linguistic distance (a path moderation)? Does therapist linguistic distance interact with client linguistic distance in predicting client outcomes (b path moderation)?] We will use client temporal and social distance variables for these analyses (as described above), but we will use the traditional measure of linguistic distance for the therapist\u2019s language (as in Nook et al., 2017, 2019). This will be done because the use of a single measure of average therapist linguistic distance across the entire study precludes the need to standardize or adjust for changes in verb or pronoun use across time. When significant interactions emerge in regressions, we will use simple slopes analyses to unpack the direction of the effect. If we observe interactions in the c path as well as either the a or b paths, we will conduct a full moderated mediation analysis within a Bayesian framework, as described above.\n\n6) Can treatment progress be inferred from text data alone? We will utilize finite mixture modeling techniques (Leisch, 2004) to cluster participants based on their linguistic distance at the text level. In essence, mixture regressions identify clusters of individuals depending on similarities of joint distributions among variables. In other words, participants who tend to have the same relationship between two variables are grouped together into a cluster. In this case, we will use mixture regressions to cluster individuals based on how their social and temporal distance in individual text messages varied across time (e.g., grouping clients whose temporal distance increased over time into one cluster and grouping clients whose temporal distance decreased over time into a different cluster). Mixture regression models will be conducted on a dataset that includes the temporal and social distance score for every text sent by clients to their primary therapist over the course of therapy. In this dataset, time in therapy will be quantified as a decimal value that includes the proportion of a day that has passed since the first text sent between the patient. One set of mixture regressions will be used to group participants into clusters based on their trajectory of temporal distance across time, and a second set of mixture regressions will group participants based on social distance across time. We will conduct mixture regression models that group participants into one, two, three, and four clusters, and then select the number of clusters that provide the best fit, as determined by AIC. For additional stability and model fit, mixture regressions for each cluster size will be implemented 10 times to account for subtle differences that can emerge depending on random starting points of the clustering algorithm, and the best fitting model for each number of clusters will be selected. Mixture regressions sill include a random effect of subject to account for nesting of text messages within subjects. \n"}, "outliers": {"extra": [], "value": "No exclusions to this dataset will be made. However, if participants do not have any relevant words to compute a measure of linguistic distance (i.e., they used no verbs or pronouns in their messages, which are required for measures of temporal and social distance, respectively), these measures cannot be computed and thus those observations will be excluded from analyses."}, "dependent": {"extra": [], "value": "Dependent variables for all analyses include:\n\nTime in therapy.

The linguistic distance for each text will be computed following prior work (see Mehl et al., 2012; Nook et al., 2017, 2019).  Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC; Pennebaker, Booth, &amp; Francis, 2007) software will be used to compute the percentage of words that fall into each component of the linguistic distance composite measure (i.e., first-person singular pronouns, present-tense verbs, discrepancy words, articles, and words longer than 6 letters). These percentages will be z-scored across messages. Use of first-person singular pronouns, present-tense verbs, and discrepancy words will be reverse-scored (by multiplying their z-scores by -1), and then these resulting scores will be averaged to produce linguistic distance scores for each text message. \n\nSubcomponents of linguistic distance. Analyses will also examine how subcomponents of linguistic distance (e.g., the proportion of words in a text that are present-tense verbs or first-person singular pronouns) vary across time in therapy. These variables will be the raw outputs from the LIWC software, which extracts the proportion of words in each text that fall into relevant linguistic categories.\n\nTemporal distance. Analyses in the exploratory dataset revealed that present-tense, past-tense, and future-tense verbs all increased over time in therapy. Thus, to get an accurate measure of linguistic distance it is important to account for these time-related shifts in overall verb use, rather than using the traditional measure of linguistic distance for client texts. As such, we will create a measure of temporal distance by computing the proportion of verbs in text messages that are not present-tense verbs for each of the client\u2019s text messages [i.e., (past + future) / (past + future + present)].\n\nSocial distance. Similarly, the proportion of both first-person singular pronouns and all other pronouns increased across treatment. As such, we will create a measure of social distance by computing the proportion of pronouns that are not first-person singular for each of the client\u2019s text messages [i.e., (second-person + first-person plural + third-person singular + third-person plural) / (second-person + first-person plural + third-person singular + third-person plural + first-person singular)]. \n"}, "conditions": {"extra": [], "value": "Not applicable. The study design does not include assignment to conditions. The study involves analyses of existing data in which clients received therapy from therapists on the Talkspace platform."}, "hypothesis": {"extra": [], "value": "Internalizing forms of psychopathology like anxiety and depression have been associated with both insufficient use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies (e.g., cognitive reappraisal) and excessive use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (e.g., rumination; Aldao, Nolen-Hoeksema, &amp; Schweizer, 2010; Gross &amp; Jazaieri, 2014; Sheppes et al., 2015). Hence, shifting emotion regulation from maladaptive to adaptive strategies is an important target of clinical interventions (Berking, Ebert, Cuijpers, &amp; Hofmann, 2013; Mennin, Fresco, Ritter, &amp; Heimberg, 2015). Prior work taking a psycholinguistic approach to emotion regulation has shown that \u201clinguistic distancing\u201d (i.e., using language that increases psychological distance between oneself and the topic of discussion), for example by reducing use of present-tense verbs and first-person singular pronouns, is associated with effective use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies (Kross et al., 2014; Nook, Schleider, &amp; Somerville, 2017; Nook, Vidal Bustamante, Cho, &amp; Somerville, 2019; Orvell, Kross, &amp; Gelman, 2017; Shahane &amp; Denny, 2019). Consistent with the idea that low linguistic distance is associated with both poor emotion regulation and internalizing symptoms, prior work shows that people suffering from more severe depression and anxiety symptoms tend to use more first-person singular pronouns (i.e., they speak with less linguistic distance; Brockmeyer et al., 2015; Edwards &amp; Holtzman, 2017). Taken together, these results suggest that linguistic distance might be a marker (or even a mechanism) of treatment response in psychotherapy. However, little research has examined linguistic distance in the context of therapy. \n\nAs such, the current study seeks to address six key research questions concerning the roles of both client and therapist linguistic distance in psychotherapy. We test these research questions by making use of data from Talkspace, a platform for asynchronous messaging-based therapy. Both text messages (which comprise therapeutic exchanges between thereapists and clients) and self-report symptom measures from a total of 6,229 participants will be analyzed for this study. These participants were randomly divided into exploratory (N = 3,729) and validation (N = 2,500) datasets. At present, the analyses described below have been implemented in the exploratory dataset only. No analyses have been conducted on the validation subsample (i.e., the validation subsample is a true holdout dataset). As such, the current preregistration serves to preregister the analyses we plan to conduct in the validation dataset with the aim of replicating key results found in the exploratory dataset. Below we outline the overall hypothesized model, research questions, and relevant analyses.\n\nOverall hypothesized model. Based on the literature described above, this study\u2019s research questions are organized around an overall moderated mediation model in which increased linguistic distance mediates the relationship between time in therapy and reduced internalizing symptoms. We propose that (i) clients\u2019 internalizing symptoms will decrease over therapy, (ii) linguistic distance will increase over the course of therapy (potentially reflecting improved emotion regulation ability), and (iii) linguistic distance will be inversely correlated with internalizing symptoms. Together, we hypothesize that these relationships will fit into a mediation model in which increased linguistic distance mediate reduced symptoms over time in therapy. However, we also hypothesize that a therapist\u2019s linguistic distance will moderate this mediation. In particular, we hypothesize that therapists who speak with higher linguistic distance will have patients who more strongly reduce their symptoms. We posit that this moderation will arise because therapists who use more distanced language will in turn induce larger increases in their client\u2019s linguistic distance over the course of therapy (i.e., therapist linguistic distance will moderate the a path of the mediation model). As such, we hypothesize that therapist linguistic distance will amplify the linguistic distance mediation model described above. The research questions below chart each component of this model.\n\n1) Do clients\u2019 symptoms of depression and anxiety decrease over the course of therapy? We will first test whether a client\u2019s internalizing symptoms decrease over time in therapy (i.e., the c path of the mediation model). We hypothesize a significant negative relationship between time in therapy and internalizing symptoms.\n\n2) Does client linguistic distance increase over the course of therapy? We will then test whether a client\u2019s linguistic distance increases over time in treatment (i.e., the a path of the mediation model). We hypothesize that linguistic distance will be positively related to time in therapy. \n\n3) Does client linguistic distance track client internalizing symptoms? We will then test whether a client\u2019s linguistic distance is related to the severity of their internalizing symptoms (i.e., the b path in the mediation model). We hypothesize that symptoms will be negatively related to linguistic distance. \n\n4) Do within-person shifts in linguistic distance mediate changes in symptoms over the course of treatment? After testing each leg of the mediation model described above, we will then conduct a mediation analysis to formally test whether increasing linguistic distance over the course of treatment mediates symptom changes over time. We hypothesize that increases in linguistic distance mediate decreased symptoms across therapy.\n\n5) Does therapist linguistic distance relate to treatment outcomes? Turning to therapist language, our next research question investigates whether therapists who use more distant language will be more successful in reducing their clients\u2019 symptoms. We hypothesize that clients will experience greater reductions in symptoms if their therapists speak with higher linguistic distance. Additionally, we hypothesize that this overall relationship between therapist language and client symptoms fit within a moderated mediation model, in which higher therapist linguistic distance will strengthen the mediation pathway described above. Specifically, we hypothesize that therapist linguistic distance will moderate how strongly a client\u2019s linguistic distance increases over time in therapy (i.e., the a path of the mediation model).\n\n6) Can treatment progress be inferred from text data alone? As a supplemental/alternative approach to the regression analyses described above, we sought to test whether clients could be grouped into clusters based on their linguistic data alone and whether these clusters would differ in their symptom levels and treatment outcomes. We hypothesized that clients could indeed be clustered according to their trajectories of linguistic distance over time in therapy and that these clusters would differ in their initial symptom levels, final symptom levels, and change in symptom levels across therapy. \n"}, "study_type": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational/archival study"}, "study_type_other": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"data": "It's complicated.

No analyses have been performed on this holdout dataset yet, and all replication analyses will be conducted as outlined in this preregistration. ", "analyses": "General modeling notes. For many analyses, mixed-effects models will be used. Mixed-effects models allow for repeated measurements to be nested within participants by adding a random effect of participant. Model-building analyses in the exploratory dataset also revealed that adding a random slope of time in therapy greatly improved model fit for models in which time in therapy is a predictor. As such, we again plan to test whether adding a random slope for time in therapy improves model fit in the validation dataset, and if so, we will include it in mixed-effect models. Additionally, we plan to conduct primary analyses on internalizing symptoms. However, we also plan to report statistics for analyses of depression and anxiety separately in the supplement, for thoroughness. \n\n1) Do clients\u2019 symptoms decrease over the course of therapy? We will use a mixed-effects model to test for a linear relationship between days in treatment and internalizing symptoms. \n\n2) Does client linguistic distance increase over the course of therapy? We will first conduct a series of mixed-effects models to explore whether the traditional measure of linguistic distance increases over therapy and if this reflects a general issue in which present-tense verbs, past-tense verbs, future-tense verbs, first-person singular pronouns, and pronouns that are not first-person singular all increase over time in therapy. If all of these word types increase over therapy, we will have justification to use the newer measures of temporal and social distance in our analyses. We will use two mixed-effects models to test whether temporal distance (i.e., the proportion of verbs that were not in the present tense) and social distance (i.e., the proportion of pronouns that were not first-person singular) were significantly related to time in therapy. \n\n3) Does client linguistic distance track client symptoms? Two mixed-effects models will test whether clients\u2019 temporal and social distance are significantly related to internalizing symptoms. Prior research has shown that in longitudinal designs, it is important to decompose predictors into their within-person and between-person sources of variance (Bolger &amp; Laurenceau, 2013; Enders &amp; Tofighi, 2007). As such, we will follow prior work in decomposing the measures of temporal and social distance into within-person and between-person components. In essence, a variable representing the within-person fluctuation in temporal distance will be created by subtracting each individual\u2019s mean temporal distance score from the score of each of their observations (i.e., producing a variable representing within-person deviations, centered around individuals\u2019 means). This will be repeated for social distance. Then, a variable representing between-person variance in temporal distance will be constructed by subtracting the overall group mean of temporal distance from that participant\u2019s average temporal distance (i.e., a variable that is constant within each participant and represent how their mean level deviates from the group\u2019s mean). The same will be repeated for social distance. These within-person and between-person variables will then be entered simultaneously in mixed-effects models to test how internalizing symptoms relate to both within- and between-person variance in linguistic distance. \n\n4) Do within-person shifts in linguistic distance mediate changes in internalizing symptoms over the course of treatment? If the analyses above provide support for each leg of the mediation model described above, we will then conduct mediation analyses to formally test whether within-person increases in temporal or social distance over the course of treatment mediate symptom changes. As described above, we will use measures of temporal and social distance that are decomposed into their within-person and between-person components in these models. Typically, mediation analyses utilize bootstrapping methods (i.e., randomly sampling from the original dataset with preplacement thousands of times) to generate many samples from which a confidence window can be constructed to test the significance of mediation model (Davison &amp; Hinkley, 1997). However, the appropriate method for bootstrapping multilevel data is not clear, as random samples can drawn at the participant level, at the observation level, or at both participant and observation levels. We thus used Bayesian analytic procedures, which do not involve bootstrapping methods, for our mediation analyses to sidestep this issue (for a similar approach, see Rodman et al., under review). Consequently, we will conduct Bayesian mediation analyses testing whether temporal and/or social distance mediate the relationship between time in therapy and internalizing symptoms. Like the mixed-effects models described above, the Bayesian regression models will include a random effect of participant to account for the multi-level nature of the dataset. To provide relatively unbiased starting points for Bayesian analyses, we will supply weakly informative priors (gaussian distribution of M = 0, SD = 10) for all regressors in the models. Bayesian analyses will be implemented using the Stan language in R (Stan Development Team, 2017). Two Markov chains using the Monte Carlo No U-Turn Sampler (Hoffman &amp; Gelman, 2014) will approximate the posterior distribution of each regressor across 12,500 iterations, with the first 2,500 iterations discarded as burn-in. The indirect effect (i.e., the a \u00d7 b pathway for the within-person parameter) and proportion mediated [i.e., indirect effect / (indirect effect + direct effect) \u00d7 100] will be computed for each mediation model. A significant mediation will be said to occur when the 95% credible range (CR) of posterior density for the indirect effect does not include 0. \n\n5) Does therapist linguistic distance relate to treatment outcomes? As a simple preliminary analysis of this question, we will first test for a simple correlation between a client\u2019s overall symptom reduction (i.e., final internalizing symptom score \u2013 initial internalizing symptom score) and their therapist\u2019s overall level of linguistic distance. We will also test whether this relationship holds after controlling for clients\u2019 baseline internalizing symptom scores. We will then test whether therapist linguistic distance indeed moderates the mediation model proposed above. This involves adding therapist linguistic distance as an interaction term to mixed-effects regressions for each of the legs of the mediation model. [i.e., does therapist linguistic distance interact with time in therapy in predicting client symptoms (c path moderation)? Does therapist linguistic distance interact with time in therapy in predicting client linguistic distance (a path moderation)? Does therapist linguistic distance interact with client linguistic distance in predicting client outcomes (b path moderation)?] We will use client temporal and social distance variables for these analyses (as described above), but we will use the traditional measure of linguistic distance for the therapist\u2019s language (as in Nook et al., 2017, 2019). This will be done because the use of a single measure of average therapist linguistic distance across the entire study precludes the need to standardize or adjust for changes in verb or pronoun use across time. When significant interactions emerge in regressions, we will use simple slopes analyses to unpack the direction of the effect. If we observe interactions in the c path as well as either the a or b paths, we will conduct a full moderated mediation analysis within a Bayesian framework, as described above.\n\n6) Can treatment progress be inferred from text data alone? We will utilize finite mixture modeling techniques (Leisch, 2004) to cluster participants based on their linguistic distance at the text level. In essence, mixture regressions identify clusters of individuals depending on similarities of joint distributions among variables. In other words, participants who tend to have the same relationship between two variables are grouped together into a cluster. In this case, we will use mixture regressions to cluster individuals based on how their social and temporal distance in individual text messages varied across time (e.g., grouping clients whose temporal distance increased over time into one cluster and grouping clients whose temporal distance decreased over time into a different cluster). Mixture regression models will be conducted on a dataset that includes the temporal and social distance score for every text sent by clients to their primary therapist over the course of therapy. In this dataset, time in therapy will be quantified as a decimal value that includes the proportion of a day that has passed since the first text sent between the patient. One set of mixture regressions will be used to group participants into clusters based on their trajectory of temporal distance across time, and a second set of mixture regressions will group participants based on social distance across time. We will conduct mixture regression models that group participants into one, two, three, and four clusters, and then select the number of clusters that provide the best fit, as determined by AIC. For additional stability and model fit, mixture regressions for each cluster size will be implemented 10 times to account for subtle differences that can emerge depending on random starting points of the clustering algorithm, and the best fitting model for each number of clusters will be selected. Mixture regressions sill include a random effect of subject to account for nesting of text messages within subjects. \n", "outliers": "No exclusions to this dataset will be made. However, if participants do not have any relevant words to compute a measure of linguistic distance (i.e., they used no verbs or pronouns in their messages, which are required for measures of temporal and social distance, respectively), these measures cannot be computed and thus those observations will be excluded from analyses.", "dependent": "Dependent variables for all analyses include:\n\nTime in therapy. Time in therapy will be defined as the number of days that have passed since the start of therapy (defined as the date of the first text message between the client and their primary therapist).\n\nDepression symptoms. Depression symptoms are measured via the Personal Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8; Kroenke et al., 2009) questionnaire, which is administered to clients approximately every three weeks. Responses on the PHQ-8 are summed to produce a measure of depression symptoms.\n\nAnxiety symptoms. Anxiety symptoms are measured via the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, &amp; L\u00f6we, 2006) questionnaire, which is also administered approximately every three weeks. Responses on the GAD-7 are summed to produce a measure of anxiety symptoms.\n\nInternalizing symptoms.

Analyses in the exploratory dataset revealed that present-tense, past-tense, and future-tense verbs all increased over time in therapy. Thus, to get an accurate measure of linguistic distance it is important to account for these time-related shifts in overall verb use, rather than using the traditional measure of linguistic distance for client texts. As such, we will create a measure of temporal distance by computing the proportion of verbs in text messages that are not present-tense verbs for each of the client\u2019s text messages [i.e., (past + future) / (past + future + present)].\n\nSocial distance. Similarly, the proportion of both first-person singular pronouns and all other pronouns increased across treatment. As such, we will create a measure of social distance by computing the proportion of pronouns that are not first-person singular for each of the client\u2019s text messages [i.e., (second-person + first-person plural + third-person singular + third-person plural) / (second-person + first-person plural + third-person singular + third-person plural + first-person singular)]. \n", "conditions": "Not applicable.

This will be done for each of the five youth gambling products separately.\n \nThe dependent variable for each product is the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI). PGSI is very likely to be positively skewed. Thus, we will run a test for skewness. Using Bulmer\u2019s (1979) classic skewness descriptives, we will declare PGSI to be positively skewed if the relevant skewness statistic is &gt; 1. If PGSI is positively skewed, we will use a log (+1) transformed version of the variable. If PGSI is not skewed, we will use raw scores. Using a log-transformed version of skewed dependent variables, particularly the PGSI, is relatively common in gambling and related literature (e.g., Browne et al., 2019).\n \nThe independent variables (frequency of engagement in each form) are coded as 0 = \u2018never\u2019, 1 = \u2018rarely\u2019, 2 = \u2018occasionally\u2019, 3 = \u2018frequently\u2019, 4 = \u2018very frequently\u2019. The response option of \u2018never\u2019 is qualitatively different to the other response options. Therefore, we will split the research question for each gambling product into two orthogonal (independent) aspects:\n \nIs any level of engagement with a youth gambling product versus having never used that product associated with adult PGSI scores?\nFor gamblers who have used a given gambling product, are increased levels of recollected usage associated with adult PGSI scores?\n \nA significance level of .01 will be used, since we are introducing a Bonferroni correction for the fact that five products are being tested. A further Bonferroni correction is not introduced for splitting the overall research question into aspects 1) and 2), as these are individual sub-components of the overall research question. Either the \u201cnever vs any frequency\u201d or \u201cfrequency\u201d components of the independent variables being statistically significant will support the hypothesis.\n \nAt this stage we as yet do not know how many participants will endorse having engaged in each of the five types of legal youth gambling. It is possible that almost all, or almost none, of participants will report engaging in a specific form. If a given gambling product was used by nearly everyone in the sample, then we will be unable to detect reliable estimates for aspect 1) above. If a given gambling product was used by almost nobody in the sample, then we will be unable to detect reliable estimates for both 1) and 2) above.\n \nTherefore, we will not run analysis 1) for a given gambling product is used by .95 or more of the sample. We will not run either analysis 1) or 2) if a given gambling product is used by less than .05 of the sample.\n \nThe analysis will be performed via generalized linear models programmed in R. Part 2) will be analyzed by treating different levels of youth gambling engagement as an interval scale.\n \nNote that the \u2018never vs any frequency\u2019 variable will be coded 1 = \u2018no\u2019 and 0 = \u2018yes\u2019, so a negative coefficient will indicate an association between that form and PGSI. This is because the frequency variable will be coded as 0 (never) to 4 (very frequently), and the coefficient for this variable will indicate the association between frequency and PGSI for those who score 0 on the never vs any frequency variable (i.e., those who DO engage in the form). For frequency, a positive coefficient predicting PGSI will support the hypothesis.\n \nAdditional analyses are not related to the determination of whether the main experimental hypothesis is supported or not, but will be considered as exploratory research to present a wider picture for the overall paper. These analyses include adding age to each model as a covariate, and an interaction between age and engagement in forms that are found to have a statistically significant relationship with adult PGSI. Other collected demographic information of gender, education, and occupation will be reported only in the Participants section of the paper, and not included in the statistical analysis.\n \nReferences\n \nBrowne, M., Hing, N., Rockloff, M., Russell, A.

For example, national lottery products can be purchased from the age of 16, and some low-stakes slot machines (\u201cCategory D fruit machines\u201d) can be legally played at any age.\n\nThis is a retrospective study correlating recollected usage of these legal youth gambling products with current gambling problems and gambling harms in a group of UK adult gamblers. This study is relevant to the current landscape, where a number of gambling-like opportunities have recently become accessible to under 18s (e.g., \u201cloot boxes\u201d in video games), but not enough time has yet passed to see how these new products might contribute to later life gambling problems and harm.\n\nThe survey will not investigate illegal youth gambling, as from a regulatory standpoint this is more of a secondary enforcement issue.\n", "q4": "We predict there will be positive correlations between recollected usage of legal youth gambling and\nadult problem gambling severity, as measured by the problem gambling severity index\n \nAn alpha level of .01 will be used, adjusting the conventional .05 level for the fact that five main comparisons are being made.", "q5": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

One element is the measurement of adult gambling problems, via the Problem Gambling Severity Index. The main novel aspect is the recollected legal usage of four gambling products which are available to under 18s:\n \nNational lottery tickets -- a standard international lottery, legal to use from the age of 16\nNational lottery scratchcards -- standard instant scratchards, legal to use from the age of 16\nCategory D fruit machines -- electronic gambling machines with a maximum bet of 10p and a maximum payout of \u00a35. Legal to use from any age.\nCoin push machines -- arcade machines where coins of value up to 10p are wagered in the hope of winning more coins. Legal to use from any age.\nCrane grab machines -- arcade machines costing up to \u00a31 to play, where the aim is to successfully grab a prize worth up to \u00a350. Legal to use from any age.\n \nThese gambling products vary by the age they can be used from and also the extent to which they resemble conventional gambling products. Each of these products will come with a short block of descriptive text and a picture, so that each question will be clear to participants. Descriptive text will be uploaded to the study page\u2019s OSF link.\n \nThe survey also contains a demographics block.", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "We aim to collect 1,000 current UK nationals who are adult gamblers. Participants will be collected via Prolific Academic, and Prolific\u2019s pre-screeners used to ensure they satisfy the inclusion criteria. We will exclude any participant who tries to complete the survey twice. They will be paid at least \u00a3.50 for taking part, which should equate to more than \u00a36/hour pro-rata. The study should be available on Prolific for no longer than a week.\n \nParticipants will additionally be pre-screened to be aged 40 or younger. This is because one of the gambling products, national lottery scratchcards, was only introduced in 1995. We want to ensure that all participants had an opportunity to legally use these products while being aged under 18. By removing participants aged over 40 we also reduce the extent to which memory biases might affect the results.\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "The main novel measured variable is recollected legal usage of that legal youth gambling product, measured on a 5-point Likert scale:\n \n\u201cHow often do you recall using Category D fruit machines while being under the age of 18?\nNever\nRarely\nOccasionally\nFrequently\nVery frequently\u201d\n \nEach of these questions will also contain descriptive text explaining what that gambling product is.\n \nWe decided to use frequency rather than expenditure, since expenditure may vary due to staking limits varying between the products, and the products potentially being appealing to people at different age ranges.\n \nWe will also collect the Problem Gambling Severity Index.\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "The goal of the analysis is to determine whether increased levels of engagement with legal youth gambling products is associated with adult gambling problems. This will be done for each of the five youth gambling products separately.\n \nThe dependent variable for each product is the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI). PGSI is very likely to be positively skewed. Thus, we will run a test for skewness. Using Bulmer\u2019s (1979) classic skewness descriptives, we will declare PGSI to be positively skewed if the relevant skewness statistic is &gt; 1. If PGSI is positively skewed, we will use a log (+1) transformed version of the variable. If PGSI is not skewed, we will use raw scores. Using a log-transformed version of skewed dependent variables, particularly the PGSI, is relatively common in gambling and related literature (e.g., Browne et al., 2019).\n \nThe independent variables (frequency of engagement in each form) are coded as 0 = \u2018never\u2019, 1 = \u2018rarely\u2019, 2 = \u2018occasionally\u2019, 3 = \u2018frequently\u2019, 4 = \u2018very frequently\u2019. The response option of \u2018never\u2019 is qualitatively different to the other response options. Therefore, we will split the research question for each gambling product into two orthogonal (independent) aspects:\n \nIs any level of engagement with a youth gambling product versus having never used that product associated with adult PGSI scores?\nFor gamblers who have used a given gambling product, are increased levels of recollected usage associated with adult PGSI scores?\n \nA significance level of .01 will be used, since we are introducing a Bonferroni correction for the fact that five products are being tested. A further Bonferroni correction is not introduced for splitting the overall research question into aspects 1) and 2), as these are individual sub-components of the overall research question. Either the \u201cnever vs any frequency\u201d or \u201cfrequency\u201d components of the independent variables being statistically significant will support the hypothesis.\n \nAt this stage we as yet do not know how many participants will endorse having engaged in each of the five types of legal youth gambling. It is possible that almost all, or almost none, of participants will report engaging in a specific form. If a given gambling product was used by nearly everyone in the sample, then we will be unable to detect reliable estimates for aspect 1) above. If a given gambling product was used by almost nobody in the sample, then we will be unable to detect reliable estimates for both 1) and 2) above.\n \nTherefore, we will not run analysis 1) for a given gambling product is used by .95 or more of the sample. We will not run either analysis 1) or 2) if a given gambling product is used by less than .05 of the sample.\n \nThe analysis will be performed via generalized linear models programmed in R. Part 2) will be analyzed by treating different levels of youth gambling engagement as an interval scale.\n \nNote that the \u2018never vs any frequency\u2019 variable will be coded 1 = \u2018no\u2019 and 0 = \u2018yes\u2019, so a negative coefficient will indicate an association between that form and PGSI. This is because the frequency variable will be coded as 0 (never) to 4 (very frequently), and the coefficient for this variable will indicate the association between frequency and PGSI for those who score 0 on the never vs any frequency variable (i.e., those who DO engage in the form). For frequency, a positive coefficient predicting PGSI will support the hypothesis.\n \nAdditional analyses are not related to the determination of whether the main experimental hypothesis is supported or not, but will be considered as exploratory research to present a wider picture for the overall paper. These analyses include adding age to each model as a covariate, and an interaction between age and engagement in forms that are found to have a statistically significant relationship with adult PGSI. Other collected demographic information of gender, education, and occupation will be reported only in the Participants section of the paper, and not included in the statistical analysis.\n \nReferences\n \nBrowne, M., Hing, N., Rockloff, M., Russell, A.

{"extra": [], "value": "First, through four separate ordinary least squares multiple regressions, we will regress consumption frequency of each type of meat (beef, pork, chicken, and fish) on gender, gender identity centrality, traditional gender role conformity, the interaction term for gender and gender identity centrality, and the interaction term for gender and traditional gender role conformity. We will follow up any significant interaction effect by testing the bivariate link between the significant moderating variable (i.e., centrality or conformity) and consumption within each gender level through a logistic regression. An effect is considered to be significant if it yields a p-value of less than .05.\n\nSecond, through two separate logistic multiple regressions, we will regress openness to going (1) vegetarian and (2) vegan on gender, gender identity centrality, traditional gender role conformity, the interaction term for gender and gender identity centrality, and the interaction term for gender and traditional gender role conformity. We will follow up a significant interaction effect by testing the bivariate link between the significant moderating variable (i.e., centrality or conformity) and openness within each gender level through a logistic regression. An effect is considered to be significant if it yields a p-value of less than .05.\n\nThird, we will conduct six separate two-proportions z-tests to compare prospective reason for going vegetarian and vegan (including only the following three reasons: animals, health, and the environment) between men and women. Three tests will compare the proportions of men versus women who would go vegetarian for (1) animals, (2) health, and (3) the environment. Another three tests will compare these proportions for reason for going vegan. An effect is considered to be significant if it yields a p-value of less than .05.\n\nFourth, among men, we will conduct two separate one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to test whether gender identity centrality and traditional gender role conformity vary depending on what reason one would have for going vegetarian (including only the following three reasons: animals, health, and the environment).
