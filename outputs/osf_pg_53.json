{"data": [{"id": "3sfqt", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "The Effect of Masculine Honor Beliefs on Expectations for Bullying Victims", "description": "Experiences of bullying have been found to contribute to adulthood anxiety and depression (Roth, Coles, &amp; Heimberg, 2002) and increased self-harm, violent behavior, and psychotic symptoms in adolescence (Arseneault &amp; Shakoor, 2010). Despite the unfortunate effects of bullying, many adults may hold expectations about how bullying victims should respond to this injustice, especially if the victim is a male. Masculine honor is an ideology in which men are expected to respond with aggression to threats or insults against themselves, family, or property (Cohen, 1998). We contend that masculine honor beliefs may help explain perceptions of bullies as well as possible expectations for bullying victims in responding to the bully. As our lab has previously shown, we expect that male victims will be expected to confront their bully violently, while female victims will not be expected to violently confront their bully. We expect that masculine honor beliefs will be associated with more negative perceptions of the bully, and the victim, unless the victim defends themselves violently rather than ignoring the threat or deferring the problem to a teacher or parent (especially young boys compared to girls) (O\u2019Dea, Chalman, Castro Bueno, &amp; Saucier, 2018; O\u2019Dea, Martens, &amp; Saucier, 2019).", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-09T14:53:03.245974", "date_modified": "2020-04-14T01:46:42.523049", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "6a9ba610ae44fe35d87902d194ba37bd5ddbe227dab2ff8a3a0fa20559264de4394ddece9ac7671acdbba280cce18d60ef632b8d5058789bf69ac664cc44ac56413f7865f51ccc09958f250f0da4eafe0336deb4cc148a56b82f0b78c3f47260fe86aa2c6cae9a04e34604ea8539ccc6982be67c28ea1b3f1f41d8906d8b3153a127e0bd5f21d893f81e2aab23c69657", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-09T14:53:03.227339", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Samantha Rapp, Conor O'Dea"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "We contend that masculine honor beliefs may help explain perceptions of bullies as well as possible expectations for bullying victims in responding to the bully.

Study preregistration is one of several open science practices, which also include sharing data, analysis code, and research materials; the use of pre-prints and open access to articles; the promotion of study replications; and improvements to the quality of reporting (Munaf\u00f2 et al., 2017). Of these, preregistration is thought to be most impactful on the scientific process (Allen &amp; Mehler, 2019) and potentially has considerable value in reducing questionable or biased research practices (Nosek et al., 2018, 2019). For example, by pre-specifying hypotheses and outcomes of interest, the ability of researchers to engage in HARKing (i.e., hypothesising after the results are known) and selective outcome reporting is reduced, or at least detectable when a published study is available. Preregistration also might reduce Researcher Degrees of Freedom (RDoF), or the many methodological choices available to researchers when they are collecting and analysing data and reporting their findings (Wicherts et al., 2016). This is important because, when researchers make these data collection and data analysis choices in an ad hoc manner, they can enter down a \u201cgarden of forking paths\u201d (Gelman &amp; Loken, 2013) that ultimately leads to a significantly reduced likelihood of reproducing the same outcomes in a reanalysis of the same data and difficulties in replicating the findings in new samples. The freedom to make many possible decisions during the research process (i.e., RDoF) can inflate the risk of finding false-positive results or Type-I errors (Wicherts et al., 2016), which when done is strategically known as P-hacking or asterisk hunting (Head et al., 2015). Veldkamp et al. (2018) have developed a checklist specifically for assessing the extent to which preregistrations restrict RDoF during the research process by clearly prespecifying the methods to be used.\n\nDespite the many potential benefits of preregistration, the value of the process is limited by at least two factors: [1] the degree to which it might restrict the opportunity to use RDoF questionably through a detailed specification of the planned methods, and [2] the extent to which researchers actually follow the plan outlined in their preregistration and declare any deviations. The study proposed in this research protocol will evaluate the extent to which researchers in the field of gambling studies are effectively preregistering their research (i.e., specificity) and following the methods they specify (i.e., adherence). At this time, discussion of open science principles and practices in the gambling studies literature is limited (Blaszczynski &amp; Gainsbury, 2019; Heirene &amp; Gainsbury, 2020; LaPlante, 2019; Wohl et al., 2019), and there are no available assessments of gambling preregistrations\u2019 specificity, or how well the extant preregistrations of gambling studies consider and effectively restrict opportunistic use of RDoF.\n\n4.\tAims \n-\tEvaluate the specificity of preregistrations for research on concepts related to gambling using a Researcher Degrees of Freedom (RDoF) checklist.\n-\tCompare RDoF checklist scores for preregistrations for research focused on concepts related to gambling with the scores for a randomly selected sample of multidisciplinary preregistrations evaluated by Veldkamp et al. (2018).\n-\tExamine the extent to which researchers who study topics related to gambling adhere to the methods specified in their preregistrations.\n\n5.\tResearch questions \n1.\tTo what extent do gambling study preregistrations restrict RDoF (i.e., via clearly and comprehensively prespecifying methods)?\n2.\tAre researchers who study gambling-related concepts adhering to the methods outlined in their study preregistrations?\n3.\tHow does the extent to which gambling preregistrations restrict RDoF (i.e., via clearly and comprehensively prespecifying methods) compare to that of a random selection of cross-discipline preregistrations? \n\n6.\tHypothesis \nAs the discussion of open science principles and practices in gambling studies has been limited, we hypothesise that preregistrations of gambling studies will restrict RDoF to a lesser extent (i.e., have lower scores on the RDoF checklist items) than the multidisciplinary sample of preregistrations. No other hypotheses will be tested in the study.\n\nResearch plan\n7.\tIdentification and selection of preregistrations \nWe will search the Open Science Framework (OSF) repository (www.osf.io) for preregistrations of gambling studies by searching the terms \u201cgambling\u201d, \u201cwagering\u201d, and \u201cbetting\u201d separately. For inclusion, the preregistration must: \n-\toutline the plan for a study that is primarily focused on a gambling-related concept or concepts; \n-\tbe written in English; \n-\treport at least one hypothesis (i.e., not represent an entirely exploratory research study);\n-\tnot be for a review and/or meta-analytic study as these studies involve unique forms of RDoF and risks of bias that would require a separate scoring system (e.g., PRISMA-P; Moher et al., 2015);\n-\tnot be for a clinical trial as these also involve unique forms of RDoF and risks of bias that would require a separate scoring system (e.g., CONSORT; Schulz et al., 2010); and,\n-\tWe will include preregistrations authored by the researchers involved in the present study (i.e., this research protocol) in order to provide the most accurate and comprehensive overview of gambling study preregistrations. However, to avoid potentially biased scoring, no team member will be involved in scoring one of their own preregistrations (e.g., any preregistration authored by RH and SG will be scored by two of the remaining team members). Additionally, we will ensure that the scoring of these preregistrations is reviewed and agreed on by a researcher external to the team. \n\nNo other inclusion or exclusion criteria will be used to select preregistrations. Although we will not be able to control the number of gambling study preregistrations available for evaluation, we have undertaken an a priori power analysis to determine how many gambling and multidisciplinary study preregistrations would be required to achieve 0.80 power (i.e., 1 - \uf062, where \uf062 is the Type-II error probability) assuming a medium effect size. Using G*Power V3.1.9.4, we calculated that for a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test with power of 0.80, an effect size of 0.5 (d), and alpha (i.e., where \uf061 is the Type-I error probability) at 0.05, 53 preregistrations per group (n = 106 overall; 53 gambling and 53 multidisciplinary studies) would be required. This is identical to the outcome of the power analysis undertaken by Veldkamp et al. (2018), who included 53 preregistrations in each of their two groups. Considering the outcomes of our power analysis, we will include a maximum of 60 gambling study preregistrations due to resource limitations; however, there may be fewer than 60 preregistrations that meet our inclusion criteria. There will be no minimum restriction on the number of registrations included. Gambling study preregistrations will be initially identified on one date during April 2020. If fewer than 60 preregistrations meeting eligibility criteria are identified on this date, an updated search using the same terms and selection criteria will be carried out mid-way through the coding process (estimated date: May 2020). No additional preregistrations will be included after this second round of identification and selection, even if fewer than 60 relevant preregistrations have been identified. If more than 60 preregistrations are identified on either occasion that meet our eligibility criteria then the details of them all (i.e., name, link, date) will be put into a .csv file and ordered using a random number generator in R (see R script on OSF under the \u201cscripts\u201d tab: \u201cRandomly_select_registrations.R\u201d). Following this process, we will select the first 60 preregistrations.\n\nOne member of the research team (BK) will undertake the search and selection process. A second team member (RH) will check 10% of included registrations and 10% of excluded registrations for the accuracy of the selection process. If any inaccuracies are observed (e.g., an excluded registration meets the eligibility criteria for inclusion), the second team member (RH) will screen all included and excluded registrations for accuracy. In the report of findings, we will present a flowchart outlining the search and selection processes.\n\n8.  Scoring of preregistration specificity \nTo evaluate the quality and specificity of the preregistrations identified, we will use the RDoF checklist developed by Wicherts et al. (2016) and later converted to a scoring protocol for preregistration evaluation by Veldkamp et al. (2018). This scoring protocol contains 22 questions relating to 29 potential areas where researchers could use their RDoF opportunistically during the research processes (e.g., during decisions relating to sample size, participant eligibility criteria, or randomisation).  The protocol allows readers to score the extent to which a clearly specified plan in the preregistration  restricted each area. Coders assign a \u201crestriction score\u201d between 0 and 3 to each of the protocol questions:\n\n0 = not specified\u2014opportunistic use of RDoF not restricted at all.\n1 = some specification but lacking details\u2014 opportunistic use of RDoF is restricted to some extent.\n2 = detailed specification\u2014opportunistic use of RDoF is completely restricted, but no explicit statement confirming that authors will not deviate from this plan by adding additional methods/processes.\n3 = detailed specification and statement that authors will not deviate from their plan by adding additional methods/processes (e.g., in a recent preregistration written by two of the present authors, we outlined the reasons why a participant\u2019s data may be excluded from analyses before stating: \u201cIndividuals will not be excluded from analyses for reasons other than those stated here.\u201d [osf.io/6dpkw])\u2014opportunistic use of RDoF is completely restricted.\nN.A. = RDoF item not relevant to preregistration. \n\nSome questions have dependencies. For example, question 2 in the scoring protocol is: \u201cDoes the text explicitly exclude the possibility that at least one other variable (e.g., a covariate) is included in the analysis testing the hypothesis reported in the confirmatory analysis section?\u201d. This question corresponds to RDoF D2 (\u201cmeasuring additional variables that can lead to be selected as covariates, independent variables, mediators, or moderators\u201d) and RDoF A10 (\u201cchoosing to include different measured variables as covariates, independent variables, mediators, or moderators\u201d) in Witcherts et al.\u2019s (2016) checklist. As a result, the same restriction score will be given to both D2 and A10 as a result of scoring question 2 in the protocol. Overall, although there are only 22 questions, restriction scores for 29 RDoFs are produced via Veldcamp et al.\u2019s (2018) scoring protocol.\n\nTwo researchers will independently code each preregistration according to the scoring protocol, convening to discuss any inconsistencies in restriction scores. Where any disagreements cannot be resolved by the two coders, a third member of the research team will be consulted.\n\nGiven concerns regarding many gambling researchers\u2019 conflicts of interest (Cassidy, 2014), we also will score gambling study preregistrations on whether relevant disclosures are reported. We will use the International Gambling Studies (IGS) three-factor disclosure framework to structure our assessment. IGS\u2019 framework requires authors to disclose [1] funding sources for the work, [2] any competing interests, and [3] any constraints on publishing the findings made by funders or stakeholders. We will score the sample of gambling preregistrations identified in this study on each of the three factors as either 0 (no mention) or 3 (relevant disclosure reported). We anticipate low scores on these items because preregistration recommendations typically have not included disclosing conflicts of interests in advance of undertaking studies. \n\nRestriction scores will not be computed using any method other than stated in this section. \n\n9.\tScoring of preregistration adherence\nAfter scoring the preregistrations\u2019 specificity using the RDoF checklist, we will search for all pre-prints and peer-reviewed publications reporting results from the scored studies. We do not expect all preregistrations to have an associated pre-print/publication; although, we would anticipate that all those first registered more than two years prior to our search date will have findings reported somewhere unless the timeline specified in the preregistration suggests that this would not be possible. We will report the number of preregistrations with no associated report of findings registered more than two years prior to our search date. \nUsing each of the items in the RDoF checklist, we will evaluate the extent to which the methods reported are consistent with those specified in the authors\u2019 preregistration (if both a pre-print and peer-reviewed publication of findings are available, the latter will be selected for evaluation). Each RDoF item (e.g., hypotheses, primary outcome, etc.) will be assigned a \u201cdeviation score\u201d between 0 and 3: \n0 = consistent with preregistration\u2014no deviation. \n1 = deviation from preregistration made and declared by the authors and a justification for change is provided.\n2 = deviation from preregistration made and declared, but no justification for deviation is provided. \n3 = deviation made and not declared or justified by the authors \nN.A. = not relevant/unable to determine. \nNote, although we have distinguished between no deviation (score of 0) and deviation from preregistration that is declared justified (score of 1) to provide the most informative scoring system, we do not necessarily the view the latter as being \u201cworse\u201d or bad practice as we recognise the need for flexibility where appropriate and difficulties researchers can face in predicting all contingencies. \n\nWe will accept explicit reference to the preregistration methods as confirmation that the prespecified methods were adhered to. That is, if a researcher states something analogous to \u201cWe followed the methods specified in our preregistration for data handling and cleaning\u201d, items will be scored as 0 unless any deviations in the pre-print or peer-reviewed publication are observed by the research team. \n\nWe will score items related to disclosures for adherence. That is, we will compare the disclosures stated in the preregistration (if any) with the disclosures stated in the report of findings and score consistency using the same 0-3 scoring system used for RDoF items. \n\n10.\tComparing gambling and multidisciplinary preregistrations\nRestriction scores for gambling preregistrations will be compared with those for the cross-discipline preregistrations scored by Veldkamp et al. (2018). Vedlkamp and colleagues compared the extent to which RDoF was restricted by two forms of preregistration\u2014the Open-Ended Registration format and the Preregistration Challenge format\u2014randomly selecting a sample of 53 preregistrations from each. We will compare our sample with the 53 Preregistration Challenge sample. We conducted a brief preliminary scoping exercise to explore the preregistration formats used by gambling researchers on OSF and structured formats appeared to be used more commonly than the open-ended format. Most frequently observed were the Standard OSF format (formerly the Preregistration Challenge format) and the AsPredicted template. Based on these preliminary observations, it appears more appropriate to compare gambling preregistrations with Velkamp and colleagues\u2019 Preregistration Challenge sample. \n\n11.\tScoring guide and framework\nWe have created a scoring guide to assist researchers with the scoring of preregistrations. This scoring guide outlines the original 29-item RDoF checklist developed by Wicherts et al. (2016), the corresponding preregistration scoring items developed by Veldkamp et al. (2018), and comments on scoring each item made by the research team. The scoring guide file is available on this project\u2019s OSF page: \u201cscoring_guide.xlsx\u201d.\n\nWe have also developed a scoring framework for recording the scoring of preregistrations according to each RDoF. The framework contains space to record adherence to preregistrations according to each item in the RDoF checklist. The scoring framework file is available on OSF: \u201cscoring_framework.xlsx\u201d. Two identical scoring frameworks will be used by the two coders to avoid one coder\u2019s scores influencing the other\u2019s judgments. Prior to undertaking inter-coder consistency and confirmatory analyses, the datasets will be screened for missing scores. If missing scores are identified, the coder responsible will address accordingly. The final decided scores will be included in a separate data frame used for analyses.\n\n12.\tTrial coding and inter-coder consistency\nBefore commencing the study, we will select 10% of the gambling study preregistrations with associated pre-prints/publications from the sample returned by our search process (section 7 above) to pilot test the scoring procedures outlined in sections 8 and 9 (these will be included in the final set). Two coders will independently score the specificity of preregistrations (restriction scores) and pre-prints/publications adherence to them (deviation scores). The level of inter-coder reliability achieved for both scores will be quantified separately using Krippendorff\u2019s alpha (\uf061). If the reliability coefficient for either or both is less than 0.7 (Krippendorff, 2004), we will review the scoring procedures and undertake another round of trial scoring (for either or both of the scoring procedures for which reliability was unsatisfactory), repeating the process until a satisfactory level of reliability is achieved (i.e., \uf061 \u2265 0.7).  We will use the R package \u201cirr\u201d (Gamer &amp; Lemon, 2012) to calculate \uf061. An analysis script for the planned inter-coder reliability analysis can be found on this project\u2019s OSF page with the file name \u201cInter-coder_consistency.R\u201d.\n\n13.\tData management and analysis software\nData will be stored in .xlsx or .omv files in jamovi (The jamovi Project, 2019). All analyses will be conducted using the statistical analysis software R Studio V 1.2.1578 (R Studio Team, 2019) or its associated graphical user-interface jamovi. As well as base R functions, we will use the \u201ctidyverse\u201d, \u201cyarrr\u201d and \u201creshape\u201d packages in RStudio for data management and some analyses, as well as the \u201cmice\u201d package for checking for the presence of \u201cN.A.\u201d scores before implementing a data imputation procedure and the \u201cirr\u201d package for intercoder consistency analyses. No other statistical analysis software will be used. \n\n14.\tAnalysis plan\nWe will calculate the arithmetic mean (plus standard deviation) and median restriction scores for each RDoF item and overall (i.e., mean scores on all items will be summed for each group of preregistrations and divided by the total number of items [n = 29]). When computing overall scores, we will not weight items according to any criteria (e.g., risk of bias, importance to the research study), although as stated in section 8, there are some dependencies between items and therefore scores to some questions will carry more weight. Restriction scores will not be summarised in any other way. Restriction scores will be tabulated for ease of comparison\u2014see Example Table 1 in the Appendix (only included in PDF version of preregistered protocol). \n\nWe will use one-tailed non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney analyses to test the hypothesis that preregistrations of gambling studies will restrict RDoF to a lesser extent (i.e., have lower restriction scores) than the multidisciplinary sample of preregistrations. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests will compare differences in restriction scores between gambling preregistrations and the random sample (n = 53) of multidisciplinary preregistrations selected by Veldkamp et al. (2018). For restriction scores scored as \u201cN.A.\u201d, Veldkamp et al. used a two-way imputation procedure based on corresponding row and column means before the restriction scores between the two groups of preregistrations were compared. Before conducting our confirmatory analyses, we will employ the same procedure for gambling preregistrations that are given N.A. scores and the resulting imputed data will be compared with the imputed data for Veldkamp and colleagues\u2019 53 multidiscipline preregistrations. Descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median) will be calculated on the non-imputed dataset, with N.A. values excluded. No other method of dealing with missing data points will be used. \n\nNon-parametric tests will be used to test our hypothesis as Veldkamp and colleagues (2018) observed that restriction scores were more likely to be in the lower range (0\u20131) than upper range (2\u20133) in their sample of registrations and therefore scores were positively skewed. We will compare differences between the two groups of registrations on all individual items scores and the overall scores, resulting in a total of 30 Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests (29 individual item restriction scores and 1 overall restriction score). Restriction scores for conflicts of interest disclosures (which will not be included when calculating the overall restriction score) were not computed by Veldkamp et al. (2018) and therefore cannot be compared between the two groups. To minimise the false discovery rate (FDR), we will use the Benjamini-Hochberg correction technique (Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995) with the FDR set at 5%. This process will involve comparing each p value returned from confirmatory analyses to its Benjamini-Hochberg \u201ccritical value\u201d, which is calculated as: (i/m)Q, where i = the rank of the p value (ordered from smallest to largest), m = the total number of tests undertaken,  and Q = the FDR we select (i.e., .05). In Example Table 2 in the Appendix (only included in PDF version of preregistered protocol) we have included the Benjamini-Hochberg critical values required for 30 tests (the R script used to calculate these critical values can be found on this project\u2019s Open Science Framework page, file name: \u201cBenjamini-Hochberg_critical_value_calculations.R\u201d). In any follow-up exploratory analyses, will use p &lt; 0.05 as the inference criterion for determining statistical significance. No other inference criteria will be used.\n\nWe will not exclude datapoints (i.e., restriction scores) from confirmatory analyses for any reason other than stated here. No additional covariates or variables will be included in the confirmatory analyses and no outcome other than restriction scores will be the focus of confirmatory testing. We will not transform the data in any way and will not check that the data meets any specific statistical assumptions (e.g., by investigating distribution of scores).\n\nWe also will calculate the unweighted arithmetic mean (plus standard deviation) and median deviation scores for each RDoF item and overall (i.e., mean deviation scores on all items will be summed and divided by the total number of items [n = 29]). We also will tabulate these and provide qualitative descriptions of the deviations that explain the type and extent of deviation, where relevant (e.g., \u201cItem 2 (direction of hypothesis): Two papers reported using a one-tailed analysis to test their hypothesis, despite the authors reporting a bidirectional hypothesis in their preregistration\u201d). We also will calculate the total number of undisclosed deviations (i.e., deviation score 2) for each pre-print/publication and overall. Deviation scores will only be summarised using the descriptive statistics stated here and will not be analysed using inferential statistical tests. No data points (i.e., individual deviation scores) will be omitted from descriptive summaries of the data for any reason. \n\nThe analysis scripts for calculating descriptive statistics and for the statistical comparisons of restriction scores are shared on OSF under the \u201cscripts\u201d component.\n\n\n\u2003\nDisclosures\n15.\tDirect funding sources\nFunding for this project was provided by the Division on Addiction to the University of Sydney via a research contract between the Division on Addiction and GVC Holdings, PLC.

LaPlante, Ph.D., Eric R. Louderback, Ph.D., Brittany Keen, Ph.D., Marjan Bakker, Ph.D., &amp; Sally Gainsbury, Ph.D.\n\n3.\tBackground and rationale\nA preregistration is a time-stamped, immutable document that outlines the details of a proposed research study, including the study\u2019s hypotheses, methods to be used, outcomes of interest, and data analysis plan. Study preregistration is one of several open science practices, which also include sharing data, analysis code, and research materials; the use of pre-prints and open access to articles; the promotion of study replications; and improvements to the quality of reporting (Munaf\u00f2 et al., 2017). Of these, preregistration is thought to be most impactful on the scientific process (Allen &amp; Mehler, 2019) and potentially has considerable value in reducing questionable or biased research practices (Nosek et al., 2018, 2019). For example, by pre-specifying hypotheses and outcomes of interest, the ability of researchers to engage in HARKing (i.e., hypothesising after the results are known) and selective outcome reporting is reduced, or at least detectable when a published study is available. Preregistration also might reduce Researcher Degrees of Freedom (RDoF), or the many methodological choices available to researchers when they are collecting and analysing data and reporting their findings (Wicherts et al., 2016). This is important because, when researchers make these data collection and data analysis choices in an ad hoc manner, they can enter down a \u201cgarden of forking paths\u201d (Gelman &amp; Loken, 2013) that ultimately leads to a significantly reduced likelihood of reproducing the same outcomes in a reanalysis of the same data and difficulties in replicating the findings in new samples. The freedom to make many possible decisions during the research process (i.e., RDoF) can inflate the risk of finding false-positive results or Type-I errors (Wicherts et al., 2016), which when done is strategically known as P-hacking or asterisk hunting (Head et al., 2015). Veldkamp et al. (2018) have developed a checklist specifically for assessing the extent to which preregistrations restrict RDoF during the research process by clearly prespecifying the methods to be used.\n\nDespite the many potential benefits of preregistration, the value of the process is limited by at least two factors: [1] the degree to which it might restrict the opportunity to use RDoF questionably through a detailed specification of the planned methods, and [2] the extent to which researchers actually follow the plan outlined in their preregistration and declare any deviations. The study proposed in this research protocol will evaluate the extent to which researchers in the field of gambling studies are effectively preregistering their research (i.e., specificity) and following the methods they specify (i.e., adherence). At this time, discussion of open science principles and practices in the gambling studies literature is limited (Blaszczynski &amp; Gainsbury, 2019; Heirene &amp; Gainsbury, 2020; LaPlante, 2019; Wohl et al., 2019), and there are no available assessments of gambling preregistrations\u2019 specificity, or how well the extant preregistrations of gambling studies consider and effectively restrict opportunistic use of RDoF.\n\n4.\tAims \n-\tEvaluate the specificity of preregistrations for research on concepts related to gambling using a Researcher Degrees of Freedom (RDoF) checklist.\n-\tCompare RDoF checklist scores for preregistrations for research focused on concepts related to gambling with the scores for a randomly selected sample of multidisciplinary preregistrations evaluated by Veldkamp et al. (2018).\n-\tExamine the extent to which researchers who study topics related to gambling adhere to the methods specified in their preregistrations.\n\n5.\tResearch questions \n1.\tTo what extent do gambling study preregistrations restrict RDoF (i.e., via clearly and comprehensively prespecifying methods)?\n2.\tAre researchers who study gambling-related concepts adhering to the methods outlined in their study preregistrations?\n3.\tHow does the extent to which gambling preregistrations restrict RDoF (i.e., via clearly and comprehensively prespecifying methods) compare to that of a random selection of cross-discipline preregistrations? \n\n6.\tHypothesis \nAs the discussion of open science principles and practices in gambling studies has been limited, we hypothesise that preregistrations of gambling studies will restrict RDoF to a lesser extent (i.e., have lower scores on the RDoF checklist items) than the multidisciplinary sample of preregistrations. No other hypotheses will be tested in the study.\n\nResearch plan\n7.\tIdentification and selection of preregistrations \nWe will search the Open Science Framework (OSF) repository (www.osf.io) for preregistrations of gambling studies by searching the terms \u201cgambling\u201d, \u201cwagering\u201d, and \u201cbetting\u201d separately. For inclusion, the preregistration must: \n-\toutline the plan for a study that is primarily focused on a gambling-related concept or concepts; \n-\tbe written in English; \n-\treport at least one hypothesis (i.e., not represent an entirely exploratory research study);\n-\tnot be for a review and/or meta-analytic study as these studies involve unique forms of RDoF and risks of bias that would require a separate scoring system (e.g., PRISMA-P; Moher et al., 2015);\n-\tnot be for a clinical trial as these also involve unique forms of RDoF and risks of bias that would require a separate scoring system (e.g., CONSORT; Schulz et al., 2010); and,\n-\tWe will include preregistrations authored by the researchers involved in the present study (i.e., this research protocol) in order to provide the most accurate and comprehensive overview of gambling study preregistrations. However, to avoid potentially biased scoring, no team member will be involved in scoring one of their own preregistrations (e.g., any preregistration authored by RH and SG will be scored by two of the remaining team members). Additionally, we will ensure that the scoring of these preregistrations is reviewed and agreed on by a researcher external to the team. \n\nNo other inclusion or exclusion criteria will be used to select preregistrations. Although we will not be able to control the number of gambling study preregistrations available for evaluation, we have undertaken an a priori power analysis to determine how many gambling and multidisciplinary study preregistrations would be required to achieve 0.80 power (i.e., 1 - \uf062, where \uf062 is the Type-II error probability) assuming a medium effect size. Using G*Power V3.1.9.4, we calculated that for a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test with power of 0.80, an effect size of 0.5 (d), and alpha (i.e., where \uf061 is the Type-I error probability) at 0.05, 53 preregistrations per group (n = 106 overall; 53 gambling and 53 multidisciplinary studies) would be required. This is identical to the outcome of the power analysis undertaken by Veldkamp et al. (2018), who included 53 preregistrations in each of their two groups. Considering the outcomes of our power analysis, we will include a maximum of 60 gambling study preregistrations due to resource limitations; however, there may be fewer than 60 preregistrations that meet our inclusion criteria. There will be no minimum restriction on the number of registrations included. Gambling study preregistrations will be initially identified on one date during April 2020. If fewer than 60 preregistrations meeting eligibility criteria are identified on this date, an updated search using the same terms and selection criteria will be carried out mid-way through the coding process (estimated date: May 2020). No additional preregistrations will be included after this second round of identification and selection, even if fewer than 60 relevant preregistrations have been identified. If more than 60 preregistrations are identified on either occasion that meet our eligibility criteria then the details of them all (i.e., name, link, date) will be put into a .csv file and ordered using a random number generator in R (see R script on OSF under the \u201cscripts\u201d tab: \u201cRandomly_select_registrations.R\u201d). Following this process, we will select the first 60 preregistrations.\n\nOne member of the research team (BK) will undertake the search and selection process. A second team member (RH) will check 10% of included registrations and 10% of excluded registrations for the accuracy of the selection process. If any inaccuracies are observed (e.g., an excluded registration meets the eligibility criteria for inclusion), the second team member (RH) will screen all included and excluded registrations for accuracy. In the report of findings, we will present a flowchart outlining the search and selection processes.\n\n8.  Scoring of preregistration specificity \nTo evaluate the quality and specificity of the preregistrations identified, we will use the RDoF checklist developed by Wicherts et al. (2016) and later converted to a scoring protocol for preregistration evaluation by Veldkamp et al. (2018). This scoring protocol contains 22 questions relating to 29 potential areas where researchers could use their RDoF opportunistically during the research processes (e.g., during decisions relating to sample size, participant eligibility criteria, or randomisation).  The protocol allows readers to score the extent to which a clearly specified plan in the preregistration  restricted each area. Coders assign a \u201crestriction score\u201d between 0 and 3 to each of the protocol questions:\n\n0 = not specified\u2014opportunistic use of RDoF not restricted at all.\n1 = some specification but lacking details\u2014 opportunistic use of RDoF is restricted to some extent.\n2 = detailed specification\u2014opportunistic use of RDoF is completely restricted, but no explicit statement confirming that authors will not deviate from this plan by adding additional methods/processes.\n3 = detailed specification and statement that authors will not deviate from their plan by adding additional methods/processes (e.g., in a recent preregistration written by two of the present authors, we outlined the reasons why a participant\u2019s data may be excluded from analyses before stating: \u201cIndividuals will not be excluded from analyses for reasons other than those stated here.\u201d [osf.io/6dpkw])\u2014opportunistic use of RDoF is completely restricted.\nN.A. = RDoF item not relevant to preregistration. \n\nSome questions have dependencies. For example, question 2 in the scoring protocol is: \u201cDoes the text explicitly exclude the possibility that at least one other variable (e.g., a covariate) is included in the analysis testing the hypothesis reported in the confirmatory analysis section?\u201d. This question corresponds to RDoF D2 (\u201cmeasuring additional variables that can lead to be selected as covariates, independent variables, mediators, or moderators\u201d) and RDoF A10 (\u201cchoosing to include different measured variables as covariates, independent variables, mediators, or moderators\u201d) in Witcherts et al.\u2019s (2016) checklist. As a result, the same restriction score will be given to both D2 and A10 as a result of scoring question 2 in the protocol. Overall, although there are only 22 questions, restriction scores for 29 RDoFs are produced via Veldcamp et al.\u2019s (2018) scoring protocol.\n\nTwo researchers will independently code each preregistration according to the scoring protocol, convening to discuss any inconsistencies in restriction scores. Where any disagreements cannot be resolved by the two coders, a third member of the research team will be consulted.\n\nGiven concerns regarding many gambling researchers\u2019 conflicts of interest (Cassidy, 2014), we also will score gambling study preregistrations on whether relevant disclosures are reported. We will use the International Gambling Studies (IGS) three-factor disclosure framework to structure our assessment. IGS\u2019 framework requires authors to disclose [1] funding sources for the work, [2] any competing interests, and [3] any constraints on publishing the findings made by funders or stakeholders. We will score the sample of gambling preregistrations identified in this study on each of the three factors as either 0 (no mention) or 3 (relevant disclosure reported). We anticipate low scores on these items because preregistration recommendations typically have not included disclosing conflicts of interests in advance of undertaking studies. \n\nRestriction scores will not be computed using any method other than stated in this section. \n\n9.\tScoring of preregistration adherence\nAfter scoring the preregistrations\u2019 specificity using the RDoF checklist, we will search for all pre-prints and peer-reviewed publications reporting results from the scored studies. We do not expect all preregistrations to have an associated pre-print/publication; although, we would anticipate that all those first registered more than two years prior to our search date will have findings reported somewhere unless the timeline specified in the preregistration suggests that this would not be possible. We will report the number of preregistrations with no associated report of findings registered more than two years prior to our search date. \nUsing each of the items in the RDoF checklist, we will evaluate the extent to which the methods reported are consistent with those specified in the authors\u2019 preregistration (if both a pre-print and peer-reviewed publication of findings are available, the latter will be selected for evaluation). Each RDoF item (e.g., hypotheses, primary outcome, etc.) will be assigned a \u201cdeviation score\u201d between 0 and 3: \n0 = consistent with preregistration\u2014no deviation. \n1 = deviation from preregistration made and declared by the authors and a justification for change is provided.\n2 = deviation from preregistration made and declared, but no justification for deviation is provided. \n3 = deviation made and not declared or justified by the authors \nN.A. = not relevant/unable to determine. \nNote, although we have distinguished between no deviation (score of 0) and deviation from preregistration that is declared justified (score of 1) to provide the most informative scoring system, we do not necessarily the view the latter as being \u201cworse\u201d or bad practice as we recognise the need for flexibility where appropriate and difficulties researchers can face in predicting all contingencies. \n\nWe will accept explicit reference to the preregistration methods as confirmation that the prespecified methods were adhered to. That is, if a researcher states something analogous to \u201cWe followed the methods specified in our preregistration for data handling and cleaning\u201d, items will be scored as 0 unless any deviations in the pre-print or peer-reviewed publication are observed by the research team. \n\nWe will score items related to disclosures for adherence. That is, we will compare the disclosures stated in the preregistration (if any) with the disclosures stated in the report of findings and score consistency using the same 0-3 scoring system used for RDoF items. \n\n10.\tComparing gambling and multidisciplinary preregistrations\nRestriction scores for gambling preregistrations will be compared with those for the cross-discipline preregistrations scored by Veldkamp et al. (2018). Vedlkamp and colleagues compared the extent to which RDoF was restricted by two forms of preregistration\u2014the Open-Ended Registration format and the Preregistration Challenge format\u2014randomly selecting a sample of 53 preregistrations from each. We will compare our sample with the 53 Preregistration Challenge sample. We conducted a brief preliminary scoping exercise to explore the preregistration formats used by gambling researchers on OSF and structured formats appeared to be used more commonly than the open-ended format. Most frequently observed were the Standard OSF format (formerly the Preregistration Challenge format) and the AsPredicted template. Based on these preliminary observations, it appears more appropriate to compare gambling preregistrations with Velkamp and colleagues\u2019 Preregistration Challenge sample. \n\n11.\tScoring guide and framework\nWe have created a scoring guide to assist researchers with the scoring of preregistrations. This scoring guide outlines the original 29-item RDoF checklist developed by Wicherts et al. (2016), the corresponding preregistration scoring items developed by Veldkamp et al. (2018), and comments on scoring each item made by the research team. The scoring guide file is available on this project\u2019s OSF page: \u201cscoring_guide.xlsx\u201d.\n\nWe have also developed a scoring framework for recording the scoring of preregistrations according to each RDoF. The framework contains space to record adherence to preregistrations according to each item in the RDoF checklist. The scoring framework file is available on OSF: \u201cscoring_framework.xlsx\u201d. Two identical scoring frameworks will be used by the two coders to avoid one coder\u2019s scores influencing the other\u2019s judgments. Prior to undertaking inter-coder consistency and confirmatory analyses, the datasets will be screened for missing scores. If missing scores are identified, the coder responsible will address accordingly. The final decided scores will be included in a separate data frame used for analyses.\n\n12.\tTrial coding and inter-coder consistency\nBefore commencing the study, we will select 10% of the gambling study preregistrations with associated pre-prints/publications from the sample returned by our search process (section 7 above) to pilot test the scoring procedures outlined in sections 8 and 9 (these will be included in the final set). Two coders will independently score the specificity of preregistrations (restriction scores) and pre-prints/publications adherence to them (deviation scores). The level of inter-coder reliability achieved for both scores will be quantified separately using Krippendorff\u2019s alpha (\uf061). If the reliability coefficient for either or both is less than 0.7 (Krippendorff, 2004), we will review the scoring procedures and undertake another round of trial scoring (for either or both of the scoring procedures for which reliability was unsatisfactory), repeating the process until a satisfactory level of reliability is achieved (i.e., \uf061 \u2265 0.7).  We will use the R package \u201cirr\u201d (Gamer &amp; Lemon, 2012) to calculate \uf061. An analysis script for the planned inter-coder reliability analysis can be found on this project\u2019s OSF page with the file name \u201cInter-coder_consistency.R\u201d.\n\n13.\tData management and analysis software\nData will be stored in .xlsx or .omv files in jamovi (The jamovi Project, 2019). All analyses will be conducted using the statistical analysis software R Studio V 1.2.1578 (R Studio Team, 2019) or its associated graphical user-interface jamovi. As well as base R functions, we will use the \u201ctidyverse\u201d, \u201cyarrr\u201d and \u201creshape\u201d packages in RStudio for data management and some analyses, as well as the \u201cmice\u201d package for checking for the presence of \u201cN.A.\u201d scores before implementing a data imputation procedure and the \u201cirr\u201d package for intercoder consistency analyses. No other statistical analysis software will be used. \n\n14.\tAnalysis plan\nWe will calculate the arithmetic mean (plus standard deviation) and median restriction scores for each RDoF item and overall (i.e., mean scores on all items will be summed for each group of preregistrations and divided by the total number of items [n = 29]). When computing overall scores, we will not weight items according to any criteria (e.g., risk of bias, importance to the research study), although as stated in section 8, there are some dependencies between items and therefore scores to some questions will carry more weight. Restriction scores will not be summarised in any other way. Restriction scores will be tabulated for ease of comparison\u2014see Example Table 1 in the Appendix (only included in PDF version of preregistered protocol). \n\nWe will use one-tailed non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney analyses to test the hypothesis that preregistrations of gambling studies will restrict RDoF to a lesser extent (i.e., have lower restriction scores) than the multidisciplinary sample of preregistrations. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests will compare differences in restriction scores between gambling preregistrations and the random sample (n = 53) of multidisciplinary preregistrations selected by Veldkamp et al. (2018). For restriction scores scored as \u201cN.A.\u201d, Veldkamp et al. used a two-way imputation procedure based on corresponding row and column means before the restriction scores between the two groups of preregistrations were compared. Before conducting our confirmatory analyses, we will employ the same procedure for gambling preregistrations that are given N.A. scores and the resulting imputed data will be compared with the imputed data for Veldkamp and colleagues\u2019 53 multidiscipline preregistrations. Descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median) will be calculated on the non-imputed dataset, with N.A. values excluded. No other method of dealing with missing data points will be used. \n\nNon-parametric tests will be used to test our hypothesis as Veldkamp and colleagues (2018) observed that restriction scores were more likely to be in the lower range (0\u20131) than upper range (2\u20133) in their sample of registrations and therefore scores were positively skewed. We will compare differences between the two groups of registrations on all individual items scores and the overall scores, resulting in a total of 30 Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests (29 individual item restriction scores and 1 overall restriction score). Restriction scores for conflicts of interest disclosures (which will not be included when calculating the overall restriction score) were not computed by Veldkamp et al. (2018) and therefore cannot be compared between the two groups. To minimise the false discovery rate (FDR), we will use the Benjamini-Hochberg correction technique (Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995) with the FDR set at 5%. This process will involve comparing each p value returned from confirmatory analyses to its Benjamini-Hochberg \u201ccritical value\u201d, which is calculated as: (i/m)Q, where i = the rank of the p value (ordered from smallest to largest), m = the total number of tests undertaken,  and Q = the FDR we select (i.e., .05). In Example Table 2 in the Appendix (only included in PDF version of preregistered protocol) we have included the Benjamini-Hochberg critical values required for 30 tests (the R script used to calculate these critical values can be found on this project\u2019s Open Science Framework page, file name: \u201cBenjamini-Hochberg_critical_value_calculations.R\u201d). In any follow-up exploratory analyses, will use p &lt; 0.05 as the inference criterion for determining statistical significance. No other inference criteria will be used.\n\nWe will not exclude datapoints (i.e., restriction scores) from confirmatory analyses for any reason other than stated here. No additional covariates or variables will be included in the confirmatory analyses and no outcome other than restriction scores will be the focus of confirmatory testing. We will not transform the data in any way and will not check that the data meets any specific statistical assumptions (e.g., by investigating distribution of scores).\n\nWe also will calculate the unweighted arithmetic mean (plus standard deviation) and median deviation scores for each RDoF item and overall (i.e., mean deviation scores on all items will be summed and divided by the total number of items [n = 29]). We also will tabulate these and provide qualitative descriptions of the deviations that explain the type and extent of deviation, where relevant (e.g., \u201cItem 2 (direction of hypothesis): Two papers reported using a one-tailed analysis to test their hypothesis, despite the authors reporting a bidirectional hypothesis in their preregistration\u201d). We also will calculate the total number of undisclosed deviations (i.e., deviation score 2) for each pre-print/publication and overall. Deviation scores will only be summarised using the descriptive statistics stated here and will not be analysed using inferential statistical tests. No data points (i.e., individual deviation scores) will be omitted from descriptive summaries of the data for any reason. \n\nThe analysis scripts for calculating descriptive statistics and for the statistical comparisons of restriction scores are shared on OSF under the \u201cscripts\u201d component.\n\n\n\u2003\nDisclosures\n15.\tDirect funding sources\nFunding for this project was provided by the Division on Addiction to the University of Sydney via a research contract between the Division on Addiction and GVC Holdings, PLC.

"description": "Stunting is one of the most important child health issues globally. Guatemala has among the world\u2019s highest prevalence of child stunting. In February 2020, the new Guatemalan government released the latest national nutrition strategy, the Gran Cruzada Nacional por la Nutrici\u00f3n. Like prior national nutrition strategies, the Gran Cruzada prioritizes scaling-up evidence-based, cost-effective preventative interventions delivered in the \u201c1,000 days window.\u201d \n\nYet, the Gran Cruzada\u2019s impact is uncertain. Nutrition interventions tend to have small effect sizes on linear growth in trials. Population coverage of interventions in Guatemala historically has been inconsistent. Finally, even with coverage improvements, it is not clear if the Gran Cruzada can reach its ambitious goals for child stunting, anemia, and other nutrition indicators.\n\nObjective\nThis study aims to estimate the impact of the implementation of Guatemala\u2019s new national nutrition policy, the Gran Cruzada. Realistic estimates of impact will be useful to nutrition policymakers and advocates in Guatemala who work to improve stunting. We plan to disseminate this work broadly in Guatemala and publish results as a peer-reviewed manuscript. \n\nMethods:\nThis study will use the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) to simulate policy implementation of the Gran Cruzada. LiST is a widely used modeling tool that uses publicly available data and intervention effect sizes to project maternal and child outcomes including stunting.\n\nThe primary outcomes of interest will be between-model changes in stunting prevalence and absolute number of stunted children ages 0-5 years. Secondary outcomes will include child mortality, maternal mortality, and anemia in women of reproductive age. Each of these outcomes corresponds with key nutrition indicators in the Gran Cruzada. We also plan to investigate the relative contribution of each intervention to these outcomes.\n\nOverall, we plan to simulate multiple policy scenarios below. \n\n1. Static intervention coverage\t4. Delayed implementation of Gran Cruzada\n2. Continuation of historical trends\t5. Scale-up to wealthiest quantile\n3. Gran Cruzada scale-up by 2024\t6. Aspirational coverage\n\nContinuation of historical trends (model 2) will be based on regression models projecting future coverage expansion. The models will use population-averaged historical survey data in Guatemala and other sources recommended in LiST. We plan to fit logistic curves for coverage inputs and shift the trendline so that our projections match the most recent data available. Similar LiST forecasting method have been described previously. The key assumption of model 2 is that future coverage changes are predicted by past coverage trends.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-13T20:01:52.271321", "date_modified": "2020-04-08T22:57:03.754643", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Scott Tschida"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "770c365b28f8a2dde61b91c353cffb52c22dc5775542d3d598ee514c90c3f034dd7f4be7dec56277bdcd2dc432fb96d0263de9176f9985c439ac4e1aa595799761056eafbf6b2095d84a943651639bdcdd56f8c2731edea4e871520f4e825a47551a6810e7b7233e95376a9ba8dfcd020f7c6579933281233f4fb2cb16d633c9d248b9ae8bad12da3ff5168a4caf6f36", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-13T20:01:52.250981", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Open-Ended Registration", "registered_meta": {"summary": {"extra": [], "value": "This registration is a summary of our plan for our study Simulating the impact of the Gran Cruzada using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST).

Respondents will be contacted online, via Facebook sites and emails, and invited to participate anonymously in a study on disgust. Only data from individuals over 18 years of age will be included in the analyses. Participation in the study will not be reimbursed. \n\nQuestionnaires will be completed online through the Qualtrics survey platform. They will include basic sociodemographic questions, long-term and current health issues, the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) assessing personality characteristics and the 20-item Trait Anxiety Inventory (TAI), which explores stable anxiety traits. These questionnaires will be followed by a priming text. Randomly assigned half of respondents will be presented with a short priming story about the threat of coronavirus transmission (pathogen threat) and about violation of rules which increase the likelihood of transmission (moral disgust). The other half of respondents will be exposed to control priming focused on the threat of global warming (global threat). Priming will be followed by a set of questionnaires in a randomised order. This part will include questionnaires assessing disgust, namely the 21-item Three Domain Disgust Scale (TDDS), Culpepper Disgust Image Set (C-DIS), and 12-item Body Odor Disgust Scale (BODS), as well as questionnaires on hygienic behaviour (the 23-item Hygiene Inventory; HI-23), current anxiety (the 6-item State Anxiety Inventory, SAI), and stress (the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale; PSS).
