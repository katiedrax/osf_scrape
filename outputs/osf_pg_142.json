Forcibly displaced children are at elevated risk for mental illness; according to a recent systematic review, the overall prevalence in this population of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is 22.7%, depression is 13.8%, and anxiety disorders are 15.8% (Blackmore et al., 2019). Forced displacement impacts children directly\u2014through exposure to traumatic events and deprivation of resources (Betancourt et al., 2012)\u2014and also indirectly\u2014through the impact of displacement on children\u2019s caregiving environments (El-Khani et al., 2016). In immediate disaster or conflict settings, caregiver\u2019s own physical or psychological distress, the loss of social support and community, living condition stressors, and children\u2019s behavior changes can make it difficult for caregivers to support their child\u2019s development (El-Khani et al., 2016). In resettlement contexts, caregivers may continue to face limited access to resources and social support, while also navigating differing parenting norms and family roles in a new context (Deng &amp; Marlowe, 2013; Merry, Pelaez, &amp; Edwards, 2017). Language and cultural differences may make parenting particularly challenging in the country of resettlement (Khawaja, Hebbani, Obijiofor, &amp; Gallois, 2017).\n \nParenting interventions have the opportunity to strengthen caregivers\u2019 abilities to buffer their children\u2019s stress in the context of displacement and trauma exposure (Renzaho &amp; Vignjevic, 2011). Many researchers have called for increased attention to parenting programs (El-Khani, Ulph, Peters, &amp; Calam, n.d.; Fazel &amp; Betancourt, 2018; Williams, 2012). To our knowledge, only one systematic review has assessed the availability and efficacy of family interventions for displaced populations (Slobodin &amp; de Jong, 2015). This systematic review by Slobodin and de Jong\u2014whose search was completed in 2013 and published in 2015\u2014 found only 6 studies that met their inclusion criteria; all six interventions reported a medium to large effect size on a range of outcomes. The majority of outcome measures assessed child improvement over the course of the family intervention (e.g., child PTSD, depression, and functional impairment), and a minority of studies assessed improvement in parenting (e.g., family problem solving, family hardiness). Since 2013, an additional 20 million individuals have been displaced, and increasing attention has been devoted to addressing the impact of forced displacement on children and families (UNHCR, 2019; Fazel &amp; Betancourt, 2018). We will systematically review the characteristics and effectiveness of available parenting/caregiver interventions for forcibly displaced migrants. It is anticipated that the growing humanitarian crises will have stimulated intervention design and evaluation in recent years; a systematic review of progress and gaps in knowledge is thus timely and relevant. The results of this review can be used to inform development and dissemination of parenting interventions to families experiencing forced displacement.\n\n \nObjectives:\nThe aim of this systematic review is to identify parenting programs for forcibly displaced persons and to evaluate the effectiveness of existing programs in both low and high income contexts. The proposed systematic review will answer the following questions:\n1) For which forcibly displaced subpopulations do parenting programs exist (e.g., refugees, internally displaced persons, asylum seekers, and individuals displaced by natural disasters)? \n2) Are existing parenting programs targeted to diverse ethnic groups or tailored specifically to particular cultural groups (e.g., Somali, Syrian)?\n3) What are the primary and secondary outcomes associated with parenting interventions for forcibly displaced caregivers? (E.g., parenting quality,  family conflict, children\u2019s psychological health)\n4) How many parenting programs have been developed for and evaluated with forcibly displaced persons living in low and middle income countries (LMICs) vs. in high income countries? Are there differences in program design and delivery across these contexts?\n5) Do parenting programs for forcibly displaced persons show efficacy?"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "1) For which forcibly displaced subpopulations do parenting programs exist (e.g., refugees, internally displaced persons, asylum seekers, and individuals displaced by natural disasters)? \nHypothesis: We do not have a specific hypotheses related to this exploratory research question.\n2) Are existing parenting programs targeted to diverse ethnic groups or tailored specifically to particular cultural groups (e.g., Somali, Syrian)?\nHypothesis: We do not have a specific hypotheses related to this exploratory research question.\n3) What are the primary and secondary outcomes associated with parenting interventions for forcibly displaced caregivers?

Study protocols and program descriptions will also be included in order to describe the availability of programs whose efficacy is not yet known.\n2)    Participants: The United Nations recognizes that over 70.8 million individuals are forcibly displaced; our review aims to identify programs that might assist those who are experiencing forced displacement due to diverse causes. We will, therefore, include studies that target parents and caregivers who have experienced forced displacement due to war, conflict, persecution, or natural disaster. Participants in included studies 1) must be caring for a child or adolescent and 2) must have themselves have a history of forced displacement. Participants can be living in low and middle income countries (LMICs) or be resettled in high-income countries.\n3)    Interventions: We will include preventive programs or treatments designed to improve the caregiving abilities of forcibly displaced parents and caregivers.\n\nInformation sources:\nWe will search online databases for original articles, chapters, dissertations, and systematic reviews. Databases to be searched include: PsycInfo (Ovid), Medline (Ovid), CINAHL (Proquest), Academic Search Premier (EBSCOhost), Scopus, PTSDpubs (Proquest), Dissertations &amp; Theses (Proquest), Campbell Collaboration, Cochrane Library, and Social Care Online. The reference list of included studies will be scanned to ensure literature saturation. When published abstracts are insufficient, we will reach out to the first author to solicit additional data. \n\nSearch Strategy:  \nStudies in English, Chinese, Hebrew, Arabic, and Spanish will be included, as these are spoken by team members and resources limit our ability for additional translation. We will not limit studies by date nor geography. The specific search strategies for each database will be designed by the research team in collaboration with a Social Sciences Librarian with expertise in systematic review searching. The draft search strategy for PsycInfo is included as Appendix 1. Additional studies will be identified by searching the citation lists of included articles and by searching additional articles that have cited included studies. This will ensure literature saturation.\n \nStudy Records\nLiterature search results will be imported into Covidence, an Internet based software program that supports deduplication, collaboration among reviewers during the screening process, and the creation of a PRISMA flow diagram upon screening completion. Automatic and manual de-duplication will be conducted in Covidence. It is possible that studies will be published in more than one location, such as a dissertation that is later published in a peer reviewed journal. When duplicates exist, peer-reviewed articles will be retained and other versions deleted. All such decisions will be recorded and reported.\n \nAll reviewers will be trained on the Covidence software by a librarian with experience in this software. The screening criteria will be piloted by having all reviewers screen a subset of abstracts; this process will be used to refine the criteria and establish consensus among reviewers. Individual reviewers will then code abstracts and full text articles; Covidence will record their decisions allowing reliability to be calculated.\n\nSelection process.\nAll screeners participated in the development of the review aims and inclusion/exclusion criteria; they have equal familiarity with the study goals and screening process. Reviewers will independently apply our inclusion criteria to the titles and abstracts included in the search results. Each reviewer will be randomly assigned to screen particular abstracts. Each abstract will be reviewed by at least two reviewers; disagreements will be recorded and resolved by group discussion. Rater agreement will be calculated. Reviewers will then screen full text articles and seek information from study authors if further information is needed in order to determine whether a study meets the inclusion criteria. Disagreements will be recorded and resolved through discussion. All exclusions during abstract and full text screening will be recorded.

Y. Chan, Joseph Maxwell, Neveen Ali Saleh-Darawshy, Scott Marsalis, Abigail Gewirtz", "q3": "Rationale:\nAn estimated 70.8 million people globally have been displaced by war, persecution, natural disasters, and economic crises, and over half of these are children (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 2019). Forcibly displaced children are at elevated risk for mental illness; according to a recent systematic review, the overall prevalence in this population of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is 22.7%, depression is 13.8%, and anxiety disorders are 15.8% (Blackmore et al., 2019). Forced displacement impacts children directly\u2014through exposure to traumatic events and deprivation of resources (Betancourt et al., 2012)\u2014and also indirectly\u2014through the impact of displacement on children\u2019s caregiving environments (El-Khani et al., 2016). In immediate disaster or conflict settings, caregiver\u2019s own physical or psychological distress, the loss of social support and community, living condition stressors, and children\u2019s behavior changes can make it difficult for caregivers to support their child\u2019s development (El-Khani et al., 2016). In resettlement contexts, caregivers may continue to face limited access to resources and social support, while also navigating differing parenting norms and family roles in a new context (Deng &amp; Marlowe, 2013; Merry, Pelaez, &amp; Edwards, 2017). Language and cultural differences may make parenting particularly challenging in the country of resettlement (Khawaja, Hebbani, Obijiofor, &amp; Gallois, 2017).\n \nParenting interventions have the opportunity to strengthen caregivers\u2019 abilities to buffer their children\u2019s stress in the context of displacement and trauma exposure (Renzaho &amp; Vignjevic, 2011). Many researchers have called for increased attention to parenting programs (El-Khani, Ulph, Peters, &amp; Calam, n.d.; Fazel &amp; Betancourt, 2018; Williams, 2012). To our knowledge, only one systematic review has assessed the availability and efficacy of family interventions for displaced populations (Slobodin &amp; de Jong, 2015). This systematic review by Slobodin and de Jong\u2014whose search was completed in 2013 and published in 2015\u2014 found only 6 studies that met their inclusion criteria; all six interventions reported a medium to large effect size on a range of outcomes. The majority of outcome measures assessed child improvement over the course of the family intervention (e.g., child PTSD, depression, and functional impairment), and a minority of studies assessed improvement in parenting (e.g., family problem solving, family hardiness). Since 2013, an additional 20 million individuals have been displaced, and increasing attention has been devoted to addressing the impact of forced displacement on children and families (UNHCR, 2019; Fazel &amp; Betancourt, 2018). We will systematically review the characteristics and effectiveness of available parenting/caregiver interventions for forcibly displaced migrants. It is anticipated that the growing humanitarian crises will have stimulated intervention design and evaluation in recent years; a systematic review of progress and gaps in knowledge is thus timely and relevant. The results of this review can be used to inform development and dissemination of parenting interventions to families experiencing forced displacement.\n\n \nObjectives:\nThe aim of this systematic review is to identify parenting programs for forcibly displaced persons and to evaluate the effectiveness of existing programs in both low and high income contexts. The proposed systematic review will answer the following questions:\n1) For which forcibly displaced subpopulations do parenting programs exist (e.g., refugees, internally displaced persons, asylum seekers, and individuals displaced by natural disasters)? \n2) Are existing parenting programs targeted to diverse ethnic groups or tailored specifically to particular cultural groups (e.g., Somali, Syrian)?\n3) What are the primary and secondary outcomes associated with parenting interventions for forcibly displaced caregivers? (E.g., parenting quality,  family conflict, children\u2019s psychological health)\n4) How many parenting programs have been developed for and evaluated with forcibly displaced persons living in low and middle income countries (LMICs) vs. in high income countries? Are there differences in program design and delivery across these contexts?\n5) Do parenting programs for forcibly displaced persons show efficacy?", "q4": "1) For which forcibly displaced subpopulations do parenting programs exist (e.g., refugees, internally displaced persons, asylum seekers, and individuals displaced by natural disasters)? \nHypothesis: We do not have a specific hypotheses related to this exploratory research question.\n2) Are existing parenting programs targeted to diverse ethnic groups or tailored specifically to particular cultural groups (e.g., Somali, Syrian)?\nHypothesis: We do not have a specific hypotheses related to this exploratory research question.\n3) What are the primary and secondary outcomes associated with parenting interventions for forcibly displaced caregivers?

RCTs, quasi-experimental designs, waitlist control, descriptive studies, pilot evaluations, and study protocols will all be included. Published reports and grey literature will be included.\n", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Eligibility Criteria\n1)    Study Designs: Given the ethical and logistical challenges of conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the context of humanitarian crises, we will include a broad range of study designs on parenting programs for forcibly displaced persons: RCTs, quasi-experimental designs, waitlist control, descriptive studies, and pilot evaluations. Study protocols and program descriptions will also be included in order to describe the availability of programs whose efficacy is not yet known.\n2)    Participants: The United Nations recognizes that over 70.8 million individuals are forcibly displaced; our review aims to identify programs that might assist those who are experiencing forced displacement due to diverse causes. We will, therefore, include studies that target parents and caregivers who have experienced forced displacement due to war, conflict, persecution, or natural disaster. Participants in included studies 1) must be caring for a child or adolescent and 2) must have themselves have a history of forced displacement. Participants can be living in low and middle income countries (LMICs) or be resettled in high-income countries.\n3)    Interventions: We will include preventive programs or treatments designed to improve the caregiving abilities of forcibly displaced parents and caregivers.\n\nInformation sources:\nWe will search online databases for original articles, chapters, dissertations, and systematic reviews. Databases to be searched include: PsycInfo (Ovid), Medline (Ovid), CINAHL (Proquest), Academic Search Premier (EBSCOhost), Scopus, PTSDpubs (Proquest), Dissertations &amp; Theses (Proquest), Campbell Collaboration, Cochrane Library, and Social Care Online. The reference list of included studies will be scanned to ensure literature saturation. When published abstracts are insufficient, we will reach out to the first author to solicit additional data. \n\nSearch Strategy:  \nStudies in English, Chinese, Hebrew, Arabic, and Spanish will be included, as these are spoken by team members and resources limit our ability for additional translation. We will not limit studies by date nor geography. The specific search strategies for each database will be designed by the research team in collaboration with a Social Sciences Librarian with expertise in systematic review searching. The draft search strategy for PsycInfo is included as Appendix 1. Additional studies will be identified by searching the citation lists of included articles and by searching additional articles that have cited included studies. This will ensure literature saturation.\n \nStudy Records\nLiterature search results will be imported into Covidence, an Internet based software program that supports deduplication, collaboration among reviewers during the screening process, and the creation of a PRISMA flow diagram upon screening completion. Automatic and manual de-duplication will be conducted in Covidence. It is possible that studies will be published in more than one location, such as a dissertation that is later published in a peer reviewed journal. When duplicates exist, peer-reviewed articles will be retained and other versions deleted. All such decisions will be recorded and reported.\n \nAll reviewers will be trained on the Covidence software by a librarian with experience in this software. The screening criteria will be piloted by having all reviewers screen a subset of abstracts; this process will be used to refine the criteria and establish consensus among reviewers. Individual reviewers will then code abstracts and full text articles; Covidence will record their decisions allowing reliability to be calculated.\n\nSelection process.\nAll screeners participated in the development of the review aims and inclusion/exclusion criteria; they have equal familiarity with the study goals and screening process. Reviewers will independently apply our inclusion criteria to the titles and abstracts included in the search results. Each reviewer will be randomly assigned to screen particular abstracts. Each abstract will be reviewed by at least two reviewers; disagreements will be recorded and resolved by group discussion. Rater agreement will be calculated. Reviewers will then screen full text articles and seek information from study authors if further information is needed in order to determine whether a study meets the inclusion criteria. Disagreements will be recorded and resolved through discussion. All exclusions during abstract and full text screening will be recorded.

Reviewers will calibrate their ratings on a sample of articles, and then will independently rate half of the studies using the appropriate tool. This tool assesses the risk for selection, performance, detection, attrition, reporting, and other biases. All assessments will be done at effect size level, namely, the outcome level.

Accumulating research is now challenging prominent conceptualizations of personality and with it the method of aggregation. By aggregating item responses into sum scores and individuals into groups, relevant differences between them might have been overlooked. Our goal is to offer new levels of explanation to allow the integration of findings.\nTo this end, we will cluster people by their item-response-patterns. We will investigate the heterogeneity of these clusters, and assess if similar levels (i.e. sums scores) on the five domains of the five factor model can reduce heterogeneity by accounting for similarities between item-response-patterns. Next to this confirmatory part, we aim to largely explore the combinations of characteristics within people by describing the possible cluster solutions. We will split our sample into three samples to be able to test any findings the result from exploration.\n\nPersonality characteristics will be operationalized as the 263 unique items (of the full 300 version) of the IPIP-NEO, also called personality \"nuances\".

Populated places were chosen with a probability equal to the number of citizens in the populated nucleus divided by the number of citizens in the municipality. The secondary sampling units were dwellings within selected populated places; these dwellings were chosen through a systematic walk. The final unit of sampling is the person of legal age that inhabits the dwelling. If there were multiple eligible adults in the dwelling, the one with the most recent birthday is sampled.

This program, funded by the United States Department of State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement and implemented by RTI International, ran from June 2016 through June 2019. It was designed to strengthen collaboration between the Guatemalan National Civil Police and municipal governments through the creation of model police precincts across the country.

The population of interest consisted of all adults over the age of 18 living in both the urban and rural areas of 65 Guatemalan municipalities. There were two stages of respondent selection. Firstly, the primary sampling unit was the \"nuclear populated place;\" these units are equivalent to census tracts in the United States. Populated places were chosen with a probability equal to the number of citizens in the populated nucleus divided by the number of citizens in the municipality. The secondary sampling units were dwellings within selected populated places; these dwellings were chosen through a systematic walk. The final unit of sampling is the person of legal age that inhabits the dwelling. If there were multiple eligible adults in the dwelling, the one with the most recent birthday is sampled. The survey was programmed in SurveyCTO, a platform based upon Open Data Kit (ODK). Information from the in-person interviews was recorded on tablets.
