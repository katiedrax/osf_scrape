After running In looking at the data, we noticed that reading metaphor affected monolinguals and bilinguals differently (a self-disclosed measure). A 2 x 2 ANOVA on RMET performance and self-identification as monolingual or bilingual resulted in a significant interaction effect. Looking at group means, we believe this interaction effect to be driven by monolingual speakers assigned to either the metaphor or literal condition. On the other hand, bilinguals who read metaphorical language seems to, if anything, score lower on the RMET, although we believe that this observation will have to be confirmed with more data collection. \n\nOverall, we predict that reading metaphorical language has a differential effect on RMET performance for monolingual English speakers and bilingual English speakers. We predict that monolinguals who read metaphorical sentences will perform better on the RMET than monolinguals who read literal sentences. We also predict that there will be no significant difference for RMET performance between literal and metaphor grouped bilingual speakers. \n\nTherefore, our new dependent variables will be Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task (RMET) scores and whether a participant speaks another language as identified through a demographics survey at the end of the experiment.\n\nIn addition to running a t-test on RMET scores between literal and metaphorical language groups, we will also perform a t-test on RMET scores for monolingual speakers. We will also conduct a 2 x 2 ANOVA that will check whether there is an interaction effect between the two conditions (literal and metaphor reading tasks) and identification as a monolingual or bilingual on RMET performance. A posthoc Tukey HSD test will determine where this difference originates. We will also perform a t-test on RMET scores for monolingual speakers to verify that there is an effect within this group. Additionally, we hope to run a 2 x 5 ANOVA on condition and language proficiency (which we anticipate dividing into 5 levels) and RMET scores on our new sample of participants.\n\nAdditionally, to relate to the existing literature on bilingualism and executive control, we will have participants perform a modified Stroop task (1935). According to van den Noort et. al. (2019), this task was one of the cognitive tasks in which bilinguals consistently had an advantage over monolinguals. We will run the manual version of the task (responses are key presses) as well as a modified version of the emotional Stroop task created by Shintel, Nusbaum, and Cacioppo which uses social words (2006). The two tasks will be counterbalanced for the order they will be given to participants. The manual Stroop task will help us evaluate the role of executive control on RMET performance and how metaphorical language might affect executive control in monolinguals and bilinguals. The Social Stroop task uses the same color identification task as the Stroop task, displays emotional and social words instead of color words. We are using the Social Stroop task since it could reveal whether metaphor primarily primes attention to social cues or whether primarily cultivates intimacy. While, based on previous research, metaphor might prime attention to social cues as evidenced by the RMET, it is unclear whether it is the fact that metaphor cultivates intimacy which drives this effect, or whether it is some other process. Indeed, Shintel, Nusbaum, and Cacioppo (2006) found that lonelier individuals showed greater interference effects on negative social words, meaning that they pay more attention to social cues. In other words, social attention is not necessarily correlated with whether a person experiences intimacy. The addition of this test might help clarify what aspects of metaphor are driving increased performance on the RMET. Additionally, it is important to account for loneliness and so we will have participants respond to the UCLA Loneliness Scale after the PANAS, IRI, and Imagined Speaker Questionnaire, but before the demographics questionnaire. This placement was chosen since the Stroop and Social Stroop tasks might cause participants to feel lonely given the nature of the color identification task, and the surveys in between might alleviate this possible effect. \n\nSince our new analysis involves asking participants about their linguistic background, we believe that we need a more detailed approach to determining a participant's native language. Therefore, we've expanded our demographic survey to include a modified version of Marian, Blumenfeld, and Kaushanskaya\u2019s (2007) LEAP-Q Questionnaire to collect more detailed information about the languages that our participants use and on what occasions do they use particular languages. This way, we can systematically describe which participants are monolingual and bilingual, and score participants based on their proficiency in other languages.\n\nAdditionally, we would like to state that we may modify our exclusion criteria. While we anticipate using the same as those used in our replication of Bowes and Katz (2015) (see https://osf.io/wr3mq/), we came to understand that these criteria may be eliminating otherwise important observations. There are several reasons why we may modify these exclusion criteria (eliminating too many observations, the spread being too wide, a tail being informative). This is especially true when considering the suggestions of Baayen and Milin (2010) in eliminating less than 15% of data overall, and less than 5% should the tails be thick. Should we modify these criteria, we will state our motivations for modifying these criteria on our OSF page (in addition to providing all the data needed to replicate our analyses).\n\nFinally, our future participants will be students recruited from the University of Chicago students.\n\nReferences\n\nCohen, T.

"value": "Russia has committed between $200 million and $250 million USD per year to significantly strengthen its cyber-offensive capabilities. These investments are not exceptions but rather part of a global trend -- countries have been spending significant resources to implement bureaucratic changes to their cyber apparatus. However, conditions under which such changes can conceivably deter adversaries are fairly limited, and this raises the question: Is this increased investment actually warranted by the threat of cyber attacks? After all, security measures are often a form of window-dressing, intending just to make the people feel more secure without doing much about the underlying threat. An example of this is TSA screening measures. In worst case, governments may inflate cyber threats in order to encroach on civil liberties by increasing surveillance. For example, have the American people started feeling more secure after the U.S. government threatened to retaliate against cyber attacks with all its means? Does the fact that the Brazilian government has created the Centre for Cyber-defense make Brazilian citizens feel more secure from external cyber threats or more frightened of the government\u2019s increasing ability to monitor and surveil citizens online behavior? And how does the public perceive such increasing in cyber offensive capability in the countries at which these deterrence measures are directed? In a series of four survey experiments, this research will investigate how the public perceives the increased government spending on cyber security. The first experiment tests the specific mechanisms undergirding citizens\u2019 perception of their own state\u2019s increased cyber capability through looking at the reactions of Americans and Russians. The second experiment tests the mechanisms that explain citizens\u2019 perception of increased cyber capability by the adversarial government, this time examining the Russian public\u2019s reaction to

and $250 million USD per year to significantly strengthen its cyber-offensive capabilities. These investments are not exceptions but rather part of a global trend -- countries have been spending significant resources to implement bureaucratic changes to their cyber apparatus. However, conditions under which such changes can conceivably deter adversaries are fairly limited, and this raises the question: Is this increased investment actually warranted by the threat of cyber attacks? After all, security measures are often a form of window-dressing, intending just to make the people feel more secure without doing much about the underlying threat. An example of this is TSA screening measures. In worst case, governments may inflate cyber threats in order to encroach on civil liberties by increasing surveillance. For example, have the American people started feeling more secure after the U.S. government threatened to retaliate against cyber attacks with all its means? Does the fact that the Brazilian government has created the Centre for Cyber-defense make Brazilian citizens feel more secure from external cyber threats or more frightened of the government\u2019s increasing ability to monitor and surveil citizens online behavior? And how does the public perceive such increasing in cyber offensive capability in the countries at which these deterrence measures are directed? In a series of four survey experiments, this research will investigate how the public perceives the increased government spending on cyber security. The first experiment tests the specific mechanisms undergirding citizens\u2019 perception of their own state\u2019s increased cyber capability through looking at the reactions of Americans and Russians. The second experiment tests the mechanisms that explain citizens\u2019 perception of increased cyber capability by the adversarial government, this time examining the Russian public\u2019s reaction to increased U.S. cyber capability intended to deter Russian attacks, and vice versa.", "q16": "Explained in the attached pre-analysis plan", "q17": "Explained in the attached pre-analysis plan", "q18":

Methodological differences may account for differences in memory when comparing witnesses who have experienced IB for a crime, and witnesses who have not. For example, in real life there may be pressure put on witnesses to provide responses, given misunderstandings regarding IB (see Levin &amp; Angelone, 2008; Simons &amp; Chabris, 2011). Therefore, one further aim of our study was to determine the effect of recall instruction (free report vs. forced report vs. no instruction) on the memory of witnesses who have experienced IB. \n\nOverall, it was hypothesised that participants who experienced IB would be less confident in their memory than participants who noticed the crime (Rivardo et al., 2011).

On the one hand, it is possible that receiving no instruction is similar to being forced to report (Scoboria &amp; Fisico, 2013), and therefore witnesses who have experienced IB may be comparable in their memory when forced to report and when not given a specific instruction. However, given that witnesses who experience IB are expected to be less confident (Rivardo et al., 2011), it may be that witnesses who experience IB may be comparable in their memory when able to freely report and when given no instruction, because they may not feel confident volunteering responses in the absence of a specific instruction (see theory of strategic regulation of memory accuracy: Koriat &amp; Goldsmith, 1996). \n"}, "study_type": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment"}, "study_type_other": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"data": "No, no data have been collected for this study yet.", "name": "Inattentional blindness and eyewitness memory: The influence of recall instruction", "other": "A number of personality questionnaires are used for the current study as filler tasks (Dissociative Experiences Scale, Modified Tellegen's Absorption Scale, the International Personality Item Pool).

Our study aims to extend this research by considering whether a different type of threat -- in this case the spread of the COVID-19 virus -- triggers certain attitudinal changes. Because of the large scope of the virus spread, we theorize that people will perceive the virus as not only being threatening to themselves individually but also to the society as a whole. As a result, we expect that there will be notable changes in people\u2019s attitudes toward how close they feel to and support their society. We therefore aim to assess the impact of the COVID-19 threat on a cluster of features that relate to in-group bonding. These include patriotism, social trust, and social desirability. We plan to examine these relationships via an experimental design where a randomly-assigned portion of survey participants will be presented a COVID-19 related vignette, while others will be shown a placebo scenario.
