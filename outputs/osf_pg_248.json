Nevertheless, a monetary incentive not to discriminate tends to result in a greater reduction of the hiring bias than both, a social norm and a combination of the monetary incentive and the social norm. Given that social norms (Bresnahan &amp; Zhuang, 2016; Goldstein, Cialdini, &amp; Griskevicius, 2008) as well as monetary incentives (Mantzari et al., 2015; Shaw &amp; Gupta, 2015) have been shown capable of influencing people\u2019s behavior, these results seem to be counterintuitive. Therefore, one of the aims of the present study is to replicate findings of the above mentioned studies with improved material. More specifically, materials of the previous studies will be adapted in the following ways:\n\n-\tThe norm used in Study 2 (\u201cIt is expected from the committee that all applicants are considered in the application procedure, irrespective of the reason for their previous absence from work.\u201d) rather resembles a disjunctive norm, because it suggests \u201cwhat others think should be done\u201d (Chung &amp; Rimal, 2016, p. 6). As previous studies indicated that descriptive norms might be more powerful to change people\u2019s behavior (Melnyk, van Herpen, Jak, &amp; van Trijp, 2019), the present study will use such instead. That is, the norm will be rephrased in such a way that it rather emphasizes \u201cwhat others actually do\u201d (Chung &amp; Rimal, 2016, p. 6; \u201cAll members of the committee, to which you belong, ensure that all applicants are considered in the application procedure, irrespective of the reason for their previous absence from work.\u201d).\n-\tTo ensure that sufficient attention is paid to both, general instructions as well as the manipulation, the latter will be presented after the general instructions. Thus, due to this separation, the manipulation will be more salient.\n-\tControl questions yielding at the deepened processing and understanding of the general instructions and those provided in the manipulation will be administered. More specifically, in order to make sure that participants have fully understood the general instructions, a test trial will be implemented. To exclude the possibility of influences on subsequent measures, the test trial was based on Pattern 1 adopted from Dorrough, Gl\u00f6ckner, Betsch, and Wille (2017), which has not been utilized for subsequent measurements. Moreover, information with regard to gender and disorder of the applicants will be removed from the test trial. In addition, manipulation specific control questions will be utilized and presented on the same page as the test trial: If the condition entails the presentation of the social norm (i.e., Condition 2 and 4), a control question with regard to this norm will be integrated. If the condition contains a monetary incentive (i.e., Condition 3 and 4), a control question with regard to the incentive will be included. Thus, besides the test trial, participants will be asked to answer no additional question in Condition 1, one additional question in Condition 2 (i.e., with regard to the norm), one additional question in Condition 3 (i.e., with regard to the incentive), and two additional questions in Condition 4 (i.e., with regard to both, norm and incentive). Moreover, for each of these questions, only one of the possible answers will be correct. Participants will subsequently receive feedback and will be presented with the repetition of instructions, if necessary. To prevent selective dropout due to varying numbers of control questions and the possibility of differences in difficulty, participants will be allowed to answer them multiple times and can only proceed after answering all of the control questions correctly.\n-\tAs a manipulation check, after assessment of the main dependent variables, participants will be asked to provide an estimate of the percentage of decisions that are solely based on job-related criteria since it is reasoned that participants who were presented with the descriptive norm (i.e., Conditions 2 and 4) should assume this percentage to be higher than participants who did not receive such information.\n-\tTo reduce the possibility of fatigue effects, the variable \u201cmental and physical demands due to a certain occupation\u201d, which previously had been assessed for other purposes, will be excluded.\n\n\nIn addition, based on the Stereotype Content Model (SCM, Fiske, 2012), which assumes that social judgments are formed by stereotypical perceptions along the two dimensions of warmth and competence, Study 1 and Study 2 indicated that the hiring bias is also mediated by perceived competence associated with the disorder. Given that the SCM states that the most negative judgments arise if the target is perceived to be low on both dimensions (i.e., competence and warmth) and in light of evidence suggesting that disorders do not only differ with regard to their perceived competence, but also with regard to their perceived warmth (Sadler, Meagor, &amp; Kaye, 2012; Fiske, 2012), the second aim of the present study is to examine whether mental as compared to physical disorders do differ with respect to their perceived warmth and whether this influences the hiring bias, too.\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "As the current study is intended to gather data for several purposes, all hypotheses are listed below.

Nevertheless, a monetary incentive not to discriminate tends to result in a greater reduction of the hiring bias than both, a social norm and a combination of the monetary incentive and the social norm. Given that social norms (Bresnahan &amp; Zhuang, 2016; Goldstein, Cialdini, &amp; Griskevicius, 2008) as well as monetary incentives (Mantzari et al., 2015; Shaw &amp; Gupta, 2015) have been shown capable of influencing people\u2019s behavior, these results seem to be counterintuitive. Therefore, one of the aims of the present study is to replicate findings of the above mentioned studies with improved material. More specifically, materials of the previous studies will be adapted in the following ways:\n\n-\tThe norm used in Study 2 (\u201cIt is expected from the committee that all applicants are considered in the application procedure, irrespective of the reason for their previous absence from work.\u201d) rather resembles a disjunctive norm, because it suggests \u201cwhat others think should be done\u201d (Chung &amp; Rimal, 2016, p. 6). As previous studies indicated that descriptive norms might be more powerful to change people\u2019s behavior (Melnyk, van Herpen, Jak, &amp; van Trijp, 2019), the present study will use such instead. That is, the norm will be rephrased in such a way that it rather emphasizes \u201cwhat others actually do\u201d (Chung &amp; Rimal, 2016, p. 6; \u201cAll members of the committee, to which you belong, ensure that all applicants are considered in the application procedure, irrespective of the reason for their previous absence from work.\u201d).\n-\tTo ensure that sufficient attention is paid to both, general instructions as well as the manipulation, the latter will be presented after the general instructions. Thus, due to this separation, the manipulation will be more salient.\n-\tControl questions yielding at the deepened processing and understanding of the general instructions and those provided in the manipulation will be administered. More specifically, in order to make sure that participants have fully understood the general instructions, a test trial will be implemented. To exclude the possibility of influences on subsequent measures, the test trial was based on Pattern 1 adopted from Dorrough, Gl\u00f6ckner, Betsch, and Wille (2017), which has not been utilized for subsequent measurements. Moreover, information with regard to gender and disorder of the applicants will be removed from the test trial. In addition, manipulation specific control questions will be utilized and presented on the same page as the test trial: If the condition entails the presentation of the social norm (i.e., Condition 2 and 4), a control question with regard to this norm will be integrated. If the condition contains a monetary incentive (i.e., Condition 3 and 4), a control question with regard to the incentive will be included. Thus, besides the test trial, participants will be asked to answer no additional question in Condition 1, one additional question in Condition 2 (i.e., with regard to the norm), one additional question in Condition 3 (i.e., with regard to the incentive), and two additional questions in Condition 4 (i.e., with regard to both, norm and incentive). Moreover, for each of these questions, only one of the possible answers will be correct. Participants will subsequently receive feedback and will be presented with the repetition of instructions, if necessary. To prevent selective dropout due to varying numbers of control questions and the possibility of differences in difficulty, participants will be allowed to answer them multiple times and can only proceed after answering all of the control questions correctly.\n-\tAs a manipulation check, after assessment of the main dependent variables, participants will be asked to provide an estimate of the percentage of decisions that are solely based on job-related criteria since it is reasoned that participants who were presented with the descriptive norm (i.e., Conditions 2 and 4) should assume this percentage to be higher than participants who did not receive such information.\n-\tTo reduce the possibility of fatigue effects, the variable \u201cmental and physical demands due to a certain occupation\u201d, which previously had been assessed for other purposes, will be excluded.\n\n\nIn addition, based on the Stereotype Content Model (SCM, Fiske, 2012), which assumes that social judgments are formed by stereotypical perceptions along the two dimensions of warmth and competence, Study 1 and Study 2 indicated that the hiring bias is also mediated by perceived competence associated with the disorder. Given that the SCM states that the most negative judgments arise if the target is perceived to be low on both dimensions (i.e., competence and warmth) and in light of evidence suggesting that disorders do not only differ with regard to their perceived competence, but also with regard to their perceived warmth (Sadler, Meagor, &amp; Kaye, 2012; Fiske, 2012), the second aim of the present study is to examine whether mental as compared to physical disorders do differ with respect to their perceived warmth and whether this influences the hiring bias, too.\n", "q4": "As the current study is intended to gather data for several purposes, all hypotheses are listed below. The hypotheses that will be tested within a master\u2019s thesis are written in bold letters.\n\nIn addition, contrary to the previous studies, the replication hypotheses will be tested across all four conditions rather than only for Condition 1, because the relationships are expected to be found in all four conditions. This, in turn, might also result in greater power to detect the below described relationships.\n\nReplication hypotheses concerning all four conditions:\n-\tH1: Across all conditions, the probability to choose the more suitable applicant is predicted in a rational manner by job relevant cues (positive relation).\n-\tH2: Across all conditions, the probability to choose the more suitable applicant is higher for applicants with physical as compared to mental disorders (main effect of disorder (i.e., hiring bias)).\n-\tIf H1 and H2 are confirmed, the cue validity of the cue mental vs. physical disorder and how much better an applicant with a mental disorder has to be according to job relevant cues (delta Bayes posterior probability) to be preferred over a person with a physical disorder will be calculated.\n\n-\tH3: Across all conditions, the probability to choose the more suitable applicant is influenced negatively by the expected long-term impairment (difference between the more and the less suitable applicant). It is hypothesized that the expected effect of the cue mental vs. physical disorder is (fully or partially) mediated by differences in expected long term impairment.\n-\tH4: Across all conditions, people with mental as compared to physical disorders are perceived as being less competent (main effect of disorder).\n-\tH5: Across all conditions, the expected probability to be successful in the occupation is perceived to be lower for people with mental as compared to physical disorders (main effect of disorder).\n-\tH6: Across all conditions, the expected effect of the cue mental vs. physical disorder on the probability to choose the more suitable applicant is (fully or partially) mediated by perceived competence.\n\nNew hypotheses:\n-\tH7.0: It is hypothesized that in Conditions 2 (norm only), 3 (incentive only), and 4 (norm + incentive), the probability to choose the more suitable applicant will be higher in comparison to Condition 1.\n      o\tH7.1: The probability to choose the more suitable applicant increases with the presence of a social norm (main effect of norm).\n      o\tH7.2: The probability to choose the more suitable applicant with the presence of monetary incentives (main effect of incentive).\n-\tH8: Across all conditions, people with mental as compared to physical disorders are perceived as being less warm (main effect of disorder).\n-\tH9: Across all conditions, the expected effect of the cue mental vs. physical disorder on the probability to choose the more suitable applicant is (fully or partially) mediated by perceived warmth.\n\nExplorative analyses:\nIt will be exploratively investigated whether the expected effect of condition on the probability to choose the more suitable applicant is moderated by perceived warmth of the disorder (i.e., interaction between condition and perceived warmth).\n\n", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

information (Khemlani, 2018). Some explanations are non-causal in nature, but the vast majority of contemporary research into explanatory reasoning concerns causal explanations. For instance, a causal explanation for why, e.g., Ria was late to a meeting is that his car broke down. Previous studies show that people spontaneously generate causal explanations when they detect that a set of premises is inconsistent (Khemlani &amp; Johnson-Laird, 2011). In this study, we test whether people spontaneously produce non-causal, temporal explanations when provided with an inconsistent set of premises. Temporal explanations are explanations that appeal to events and their relations to one another in time. A temporal explanation for why Ria was late to work would be, e.g., that the meeting was rescheduled -- and so Ria was not, in fact, late. The explanation appeals to temporal, not causal relations, to resolve conflicts.\n\nThe materials of our previous experiment (TX1) seemed to have been too complicated. In this experiment, participants are told 2 facts: \n\n1. The interval of an event such as: \"The party was scheduled to occur from 7pm to 10pm on Friday.\"\n2. The time of an individual's arrival, such as: \"Gerald arrived at the party at 10:30pm on Friday.\"\n\nThe participant is told they discovered another fact:\n3. The individual was at the event: Gerald attended the party.\n\nAnd they are asked an open-response question: \"What, if anything, follows?\" \n\nIn this case, there is a conflict such that the party was supposed to end before Gerald arrived but we also know that he attended the party. Participants who notice the temporal conflict may state that one of the facts is simply wrong or they could generate an explanation, e.g., The party ran late.  We varied the first fact so that there was or was not a temporal conflict, e.g., The party was scheduled to occur from 7pm to 12am on Friday.  With this information, there is no temporal conflict: Gerald arrived while the party was supposed to be happening.  Participants could still generate explanations such as: Gerald got a flat on the way to the party and therefore was late.\n\nEach problem is designed with a consistent and an inconsistent version. Each participant will be randomly assigned the inconsistent version of 4 problems and the consistent version of the other 4. It is our prediction that there will be more explanations, and in particular temporal explanations, for the inconsistent problems than for the consistent problems.

Also articles with used virtual reality, biofeedback, or noncommercial video games as well as qualitative studies, single-subject studies or those with a sample size of \u22645, doctoral theses, reviews and/or meta-analysis, abstracts, newspaper articles, and news.\nThe full text of all articles identified from the search will be preliminarily reviewed by two independent trained reviewers for eligibility. Researchers will extract the necessary data from the articles. When the data are not available, the authors will be contacted and invited to submit the necessary data. Once the data are received, they will be recorded to analyze.\nTherefore, there are two procedures, on the one hand, we analyze all observational studies and, on the other hand, only experimental studies that obtained 6 or more scores on the PEDro scale were analyzing, validating the great experimental quality and reducing the risk of bias.\nMain outcomes: functionality, balance, quality of movement, gait speed, motivation, motor mobility, attention, quality of life, and cognition.\nStatistic data to be entered for analysis: In observational studies, we will use the number of participants, the mean, and standard deviation for the baseline and for the post-intervention measure. In experimental studies, we will use the number of participants and the mean differences and the standard deviation differences between baseline and post-intervention time. Heterogeneity will be determined using the I2 statistic and the total effect will be calculated using Z and p-values. For these, we will use RevMan 5.3 software.\n\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "Commercial video games: video games that are available in the stores (for example Nintendo Wii, Xbox, etc.) VS Conventional Rehabilitation (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, etc.).", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Functionality: Fulg\u2013Meyer Assessment, Functional Reach Test, Wolf Motor Function Test, Brunnstrom Approach, Functional Independence Measure, ARAT, Modified Motor Assessment Scale, Functional Ambulatory Category, Grip strength-strong hand\nBalance: Berg Balance Scale, Step Test, Postural Assessment Scale, Activity Specific Balance Confidence Test, Sitting Balance, Test Tinitti Gait\nQuality of Movement: Motor Activity Log Quality of Movement, Falls Efficacy Scale, Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement, Active Range Motion\nMotivation: Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) \nGait Speed: 6-min walk test, 10-Meter Walk Test, Dynamic Gait Index, 3 Meter Walk Test\nMobility: Timed Get Up and Go test, Modified Ashworth Scale, Motricity Index\nAttention: Color Trials Test, TMT\nQuality of life: Stroke Impact Scale, Barthel Index, SF36, Nottingham Health Profile, Frenchay Activity Index, Occupational Performance Measure Satisfaction\nCognition: Box and Block Test, K-MMSE.

These studies address the question of whether people seek post-decision counterfactual information - how much they could have won - in a gambling task (the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, BART; Lejuez et al., 2002). In previous studies we used a within-participant design, presenting participants with 60 trials of the BART and giving them the option to view the balloon's limit after each trial. Participants frequently sought information even at some cost even though a. it made them feel bad, and b. (we argue that) it had no instrumental value. Our argument that the information had no instrumental value relied on the independent nature of the trials in the task - since the balloon's limit was randomly determined on each trial - so gaining information about the limit on the previous trial cannot benefit performance on future trials. However, it may be argued that participants believe that there is some non-random structure that can be learned through seeking information about the balloon's limit. Thus, they might have sought information for instrumental reasons, even though the information was actually not of any instrumental value. \n\nIn the current study, we aim to demonstrate that people will still incur costs to learn post-decision counterfactual information when the possibility to use that information in the future is completely removed because there is only one trial and that information still makes them feel bad. In the new version of the task, participants practice by completing 10 trials of the BART with no option to seek information. They rate their emotions on a visual analogue scale after seeing the outcome of each trial. \n\nAfter the 10 practice trials, participants receive the following instructions: \"Now that you've had a chance to practice, it's time for the real thing! There is one more round and this time each pump is worth 20p!\". They then complete one critical round of the BART. If participants 'go bust' on this final round, then they do not get a bonus payment and they are not offered the opportunity to see how far they could have gone. If they 'banked' the money, then after rating their emotions about the outcome, then they are given the following instructions: \"You won \u00a3X.XX. Would you like to see how much you could have won if you kept going? The information comes at a price - you will have to wait 30 seconds for your completion code at the end of the experiment! Press Y for yes or N for no.\". \n\nIf they choose to see the information, then they see an animation of the balloon inflating to its randomly determined limit and are presented with information about how much money they could have won on the trial. If they choose not to receive the information then they continue to observe their obtained outcome for the same time as if they had chosen to view the information. Participants then rate their emotions a second time. This second emotion rating is the critical dependent variable.

Of those 18 participants, 10 participants stopped before the balloon's limit so banked the money. Of those, 8 sought information about how much they could have won, and 2 did not seek information. The remaining 8 participants 'went bust' so were not given the opportunity to see the balloon's limit. These pilot participants will not be included in the final sample. From this pilot phase we determined that the parameters of our design are suitable to elicit both choices to and not to seek information. This is crucial for comparing emotion ratings between those who did and did not seek information. No other designs were piloted.\n\nAdditional analyses planned:\nFollowing our previous analyses, we will determine the effect of the size of the missed opportunity on emotion ratings for those who observed the missed opportunity while controlling for the number of pumps. We will also run the same analysis on those who did not seek information as a check for any statistical artefacts (we do not expect to see any effect since participants did not observe the missed opportunity).\n\nAdditionally, we are interested in the change in emotion rating that the information brought, so we will compare difference scores between the two information ratings between participants who did and did not seek information."}, "sample": {"extra": [], "value": "We will collect data from 360 adult participants using the participant recruitment platform Prolific.co.

We have already collected some data but explain in Question 8 why readers may consider this a valid pre-registration nevertheless.", "name": "Counterfactual Curiosity - One-shot Task\n\nThis experiment is a follow-up to the five experiments reported in our pre-print \"The Lure of Counterfactual Curiosity\" (DOI: https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/jm3uc). These studies address the question of whether people seek post-decision counterfactual information - how much they could have won - in a gambling task (the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, BART; Lejuez et al., 2002). In previous studies we used a within-participant design, presenting participants with 60 trials of the BART and giving them the option to view the balloon's limit after each trial. Participants frequently sought information even at some cost even though a. it made them feel bad, and b. (we argue that) it had no instrumental value. Our argument that the information had no instrumental value relied on the independent nature of the trials in the task - since the balloon's limit was randomly determined on each trial - so gaining information about the limit on the previous trial cannot benefit performance on future trials. However, it may be argued that participants believe that there is some non-random structure that can be learned through seeking information about the balloon's limit. Thus, they might have sought information for instrumental reasons, even though the information was actually not of any instrumental value. \n\nIn the current study, we aim to demonstrate that people will still incur costs to learn post-decision counterfactual information when the possibility to use that information in the future is completely removed because there is only one trial and that information still makes them feel bad. In the new version of the task, participants practice by completing 10 trials of the BART with no option to seek information. They rate their emotions on a visual analogue scale after seeing the outcome of each trial. \n\nAfter the 10 practice trials, participants receive the following instructions: \"Now that you've had a chance to practice, it's time for the real thing! There is one more round and this time each pump is worth 20p!\". They then complete one critical round of the BART. If participants 'go bust' on this final round, then they do not get a bonus payment and they are not offered the opportunity to see how far they could have gone. If they 'banked' the money, then after rating their emotions about the outcome, then they are given the following instructions: \"You won \u00a3X.XX. Would you like to see how much you could have won if you kept going? The information comes at a price - you will have to wait 30 seconds for your completion code at the end of the experiment! Press Y for yes or N for no.\". \n\nIf they choose to see the information, then they see an animation of the balloon inflating to its randomly determined limit and are presented with information about how much money they could have won on the trial. If they choose not to receive the information then they continue to observe their obtained outcome for the same time as if they had chosen to view the information. Participants then rate their emotions a second time. This second emotion rating is the critical dependent variable. ", "other": "Data collection before the study: \nData from 18 participants has been collected in a pilot phase to determine whether people are willing to wait 30 seconds at the end of the experiment in return for seeing the balloon's limit. Of those 18 participants, 10 participants stopped before the balloon's limit so banked the money. Of those, 8 sought information about how much they could have won, and 2 did not seek information. The remaining 8 participants 'went bust' so were not given the opportunity to see the balloon's limit. These pilot participants will not be included in the final sample. From this pilot phase we determined that the parameters of our design are suitable to elicit both choices to and not to seek information. This is crucial for comparing emotion ratings between those who did and did not seek information. No other designs were piloted.\n\nAdditional analyses planned:\nFollowing our previous analyses, we will determine the effect of the size of the missed opportunity on emotion ratings for those who observed the missed opportunity while controlling for the number of pumps. We will also run the same analysis on those who did not seek information as a check for any statistical artefacts (we do not expect to see any effect since participants did not observe the missed opportunity).\n\nAdditionally, we are interested in the change in emotion rating that the information brought, so we will compare difference scores between the two information ratings between participants who did and did not seek information.", "sample": "We will collect data from 360 adult participants using the participant recruitment platform Prolific.co. Based on our previous studies using a within-participant design, we expected to see a medium to large effect of counterfactual information seeking on emotion ratings. Based on our pilot data (described below), we expected an uneven distribution between those who sought and those who did not seek information. We used G-Power to determine the sample size required for the between subjects t-test with uneven groups. We used the following parameters: tails = 2; Cohen's d = 0.5; alpha = 0.05; power = 0.8; Allocation ration N2/N1 = 0.25. This gives a minimum sample of 200 participants. Note that this analysis will only contain participants who did not 'go bust'. In our pilot, 8 out of 18 participants 'went bust', we will thus increase our sample by an additional 160 participants to achieve the required number of participants who do not go bust.", "analyses": "We will compare emotion ratings between participants who sought information and those who did not in a using the following analyses:\n\n1.
