A sense of inflated responsibility involves feeling as if one plays a pivotal role in both causing and preventing the negative outcomes of one\u2019s decisions. In this study, a cover story about formulating a music therapy for preventing post-traumatic stress disorder in a population was presented to all participants; in other words, this music selection task is not going to provide input into the development of a novel intervention for PTSD. Participants were assigned randomly to either an inflated responsibility or a non-inflated responsibility condition. Participants in the inflated responsibility condition were led to believe that their selections of music videos would have crucial influence on developing a new intervention for post-traumatic stress disorder. Participants in the non-inflated responsibility condition were told that their decisions would have no or only minimal impact on the intervention. We are testing whether participants who experienced an inflated sense of responsibility tried to maximize when selecting music for the therapy, meaning that they put more effort into the decision in order to make sure they attained the best possible outcome with their choices of songs.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-08T22:30:58.360424", "date_modified": "2020-04-07T00:33:21.640182", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["None"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "ba4c8faf9eca9c0c1989ec5e6463684cecc75d64da85db1796263af5dfcdeb9b47fb7f842f140723f0796f9a75262c7e78b57fab891cc479097adc68bbda68aea891bdfdf12cd159745747194db513648f1ef11c28f36b6520f7291975175187702e310926d30be7578b4a780f9285ec9b38f6be9104e52af087b56a81f6dc75a2affb7df7e616ef73f26a11598ee03b", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-08T22:30:58.336575", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Fanyi Mo"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Participants who were led to feel an inflated sense of responsibility will be more likely to maximize in the music selection task; they will also be more likely to attempt to avoid future regret.

The inequality between the sexes is  prevalent everyday. Although progress has been made in today's society to give equal opportunity to all, there remains an underlying bias. Women are judged by the way they look and how attractive they are perceived. This affects the way women are treated and the opportunities people who hold these biases provide them.  In this paper we examine whether there is a correlation between the approachability and attractiveness of a person and the likeliness of a possible bias. The purpose for this study is to see if there is a relationship between attractiveness and approachability. This study is important to help understand the extent of the bias that females face due to the superficial qualities of physical attractiveness on which they are often judged. I believe that there will be significant interaction between the higher the approachability score the higher the attractiveness score. This effect will be stronger in male participants than in female participants.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-08T21:02:12.953166", "date_modified": "2020-04-08T20:00:08.907575", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Sheahan Collins"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "0b8f060280169231c1e4cd84cf5c5dd640745dacfc193c74a98987990e99dcc3075193c026338b0798ea9fe69c5a8dfddec420582260893f76afeadb4431633298d51faa1de061e20a4a96c853e1b5f7dae9fa66f6920150a49badb7afd87807a9e9edd976006372389040c1d74f298cb12d86531e5adaedf99d9fdc8dd4a0d3d06d0f7893a1ec62dcbe5ffdb99d5345", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-08T21:02:12.936974", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Sheahan Collins"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "There will be an interaction that the higher the scores for approachability the higher attractiveness scores.

After screening, a quantitative Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analysis was performed in 15 studies (19 experiments, 189 foci) with 593 participants to evaluate the contrast pre- versus post- exercise effects on mental health. Additionally, subgroup analyses for memory, executive function, intervention term and age group were carried on as well.\nResults: Following the physical exercising intervention, the activation of the left cerebellar tonsil, the right precuneus and the right inferior frontal gyrus were increased while the activation of the right red nucleus, the right caudate head, the left precuneus and the right declive were decreased. Besides, primary activation in precuneus and red nucleus for memory, and cerebellar tonsil for executive function were also observed.\nConclusion: This article demonstrates that cerebrum, cerebellum (especially posterior lobe) and brainstem (red nucleus) all attribute to the improvement of mental health by exercise intervention via different pathways based on structural and functional evidences. Future diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of mental health illness should put the brain regions mentioned and their roles in network into full consideration, for it is what we usually neglect that may leave lasting impacts on patients\u2019 daily living activities and quality of life.\n", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-09T03:31:27.875092", "date_modified": "2020-04-09T03:27:15.032271", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [""], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "ec04af08c9699e1df1643bd652ca9840807997792c63b6443486af80b9ceb4b4a84ee797c6e1fc449424b1e0955471eccd79b3420937b0ee7e3124be52cbc4aa9334a5cd1b42289719b2d83de576559fbcbe73179f8ad1169d62ae4f2246e0c3bd51e2aa06e893708bf00a9142c64680db246ff6b18c4246c5a3c6cf780fd36bf7ad7515f4a6536d7fe5911cf8f110cd", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-09T03:31:27.844365", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Lin Yang"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "To first investigate the effects of exercise interventions on mental health through coordinate-based meta-analysis across neuroimaging studies, exploring relevant activated brain regions and interplay among them."}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": ["No blinding is involved in this study."]}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q6": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Meta-analysis "}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q8": {"extra": [], "value": "Registration following analysis of the data"}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q10": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Methods\nThis study will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. \nData sources \nThe literature search will be conducted from an inception to March 2020, through four electronic databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, PsychInfo, and Embase).
