Inclusion criteria were: provided written informed consent, healthy women, aged 18-65 years, BMI between 28-45 kg/m2, reporting an interest in weight loss and not actively participating in a commercial weight loss programme, not increased PA levels in the past 4 weeks, able to eat most everyday foods and fruits and vegetables. Exclusion criteria were: significant health problems, taking any medication or supplements known to affect appetite or weight, pregnant, planning to become pregnant or breastfeeding, history of anaphylaxis to food, known food allergies or food intolerance, smokers and those who have recently ceased smoking (within the last 3 months), participants receiving systemic or local treatment likely to interfere with evaluation of the study parameters, those who have taken part in a commercial weight loss programme in the last 2 months, individuals who work in appetite or feeding related areas, unable to consume foods used in the study, individuals who have had bariatric surgery, history of an eating disorder, presence of untreated hypothyroidism, insufficient English language skills to complete study questionnaires. \nDesign\nThe study was a non-randomised, parallel group design to explore whether there are behavioural characteristics associated with \u22655% or \u22643% weight loss following a 14-week diet. BM was measured with shoes and heavy clothing removed on the first day of the weight management programme using electronic scales.

Between weeks 2 and 14 participants visited the laboratory in the Human Appetite Research Unit (HARU) at the University of Leeds for measurement days. Participants received payment of \u00a3250 on completion of the study to reimburse them for their time and expenses. The study procedures and all study materials were reviewed and approved by the School of Psychology Ethics Board at the University of Leeds (14-0090).\nWeight management programme\nParticipants either followed the commercial diet (Slimming World) or the self-led diet (NHS Choices) for the 14-week intervention period. The commercial diet encouraged ad libitum intake of low energy dense foods as part of a balanced diet, with weekly weigh-ins, group support, weight loss goals and access to online support. The self-led diet group accessed free online resource and a self-led diet programme which recommends reducing calorie intake by 600 kcal/d. Both diet programmes also encouraged individuals to self-monitor and to increase the amount of physical activity they do.\nFor the purpose of this study, data were analysed with both diet intervention groups combined and participants were then categorised based on their percentage change in BM, but programme type was controlled for in all analyses. There were no specific research questions pertaining to the type of diet used to induce weight loss. Rather, the study sought to explore behavioural characteristics associated with the degree of diet-induced weight loss success.\nProcedures\nBM was measured on the first day of the weight management programme using electronic scales (commercial diet group: recorded as part of their first weigh-in at a support group meeting; self-led diet group: recorded by a researcher at the HARU). BM was measured with shoes and heavy clothing removed.\nFor all laboratory visits (measures and probe days) participants were instructed to be fasted from 10:00 pm the previous night and to abstain from strenuous exercise and alcohol consumption for at least 24 hours before all laboratory visits. Compliance was checked on arrival via self-report.\nMeasures days\nParticipants completed two measurement days; one during week 2 and one during week 14 at the end of the intervention. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured (GEM, NutrEn Technology Ltd, Cheshire, UK) with participants laying supine for 40 min during which expired air was collected using a ventilated hood system. VO2 and VCO2 values were sampled every 30 seconds. The average of the final 30 min values was deemed to be the RMR expressed as kcal/d. BM and body composition (fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM)) were measured using the BODPOD (Body Composition Tracking System, Life Measurement, Inc., Concord, USA) which uses air displacement plethysmography. Participants wore tight clothing and a swim cap to allow for an accurate measure of body volume. Height was measured using a stadiometer (Seca Ltd., Birmingham, UK) and waist circumference (WC) was measured horizontally in line with the umbilicus. \nFree-living energy intake\nParticipants completed a 7-day weighed food diary during weeks 3 and 12. Electronic scales and training were provided to ensure detailed descriptions (e.g. brands) and consumed weights of foods and beverages were reported. Total EI, macronutrient composition and energy density were calculated from the food diary. Energy density was calculated from the contribution of all food and milks (excluded all other drinks) (total EI divided by total weight intake) based on criteria previously used (Wrieden et al. 2015). Data were analysed using WISP 4.0 (Tinuviel Software 2013).\nFree-living physical activity, sedentary behaviour and energy expenditure\nFree-living PA and SB was objectively measured during week 3 and 12 using the SenseWear Armband mini (SWA; BodyMedia, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA), as has previously been described (Myers et al., 2016). Participants were instructed to wear the SWA on the posterior surface of their upper non-dominant arm for a minimum of 22 hour/d for \u22656 days (except for the time spent showering, bathing or swimming). For the SWA data to be valid &gt;22 hours of data per day had to be recorded on at least five days (midnight to midnight) including at least one weekend day.\nClassification of responders and non-responders\nTo identify differences that could account for individual variability in weight loss, participants were grouped based on their diet-induced BM change between week 0 and week 14. Participants were classified as responders if they lost \u22655% and non-responders if they lost \u22643% of their initial BM.\n\nAll participants who completed both measures days and both free-living PA and EI measurement periods will be included in the analyses.

Women participants with overweight or obesity (aged 18-65 years; body mass index (BMI) 28-45 kg/m2) were recruited by advertisement from the University of Leeds. Inclusion criteria were: provided written informed consent, healthy women, aged 18-65 years, BMI between 28-45 kg/m2, reporting an interest in weight loss and not actively participating in a commercial weight loss programme, not increased PA levels in the past 4 weeks, able to eat most everyday foods and fruits and vegetables. Exclusion criteria were: significant health problems, taking any medication or supplements known to affect appetite or weight, pregnant, planning to become pregnant or breastfeeding, history of anaphylaxis to food, known food allergies or food intolerance, smokers and those who have recently ceased smoking (within the last 3 months), participants receiving systemic or local treatment likely to interfere with evaluation of the study parameters, those who have taken part in a commercial weight loss programme in the last 2 months, individuals who work in appetite or feeding related areas, unable to consume foods used in the study, individuals who have had bariatric surgery, history of an eating disorder, presence of untreated hypothyroidism, insufficient English language skills to complete study questionnaires. \nDesign\nThe study was a non-randomised, parallel group design to explore whether there are behavioural characteristics associated with \u22655% or \u22643% weight loss following a 14-week diet. BM was measured with shoes and heavy clothing removed on the first day of the weight management programme using electronic scales. Participants\u2019 self-reported adherence to the intervention each week by responding to \u2018How well have you managed to stick with the weight control programme?\u2019 on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) anchored at each end with \u2018Not at all well\u2019 and \u2018Very well\u2019. Between weeks 2 and 14 participants visited the laboratory in the Human Appetite Research Unit (HARU) at the University of Leeds for measurement days. Participants received payment of \u00a3250 on completion of the study to reimburse them for their time and expenses. The study procedures and all study materials were reviewed and approved by the School of Psychology Ethics Board at the University of Leeds (14-0090).\nWeight management programme\nParticipants either followed the commercial diet (Slimming World) or the self-led diet (NHS Choices) for the 14-week intervention period. The commercial diet encouraged ad libitum intake of low energy dense foods as part of a balanced diet, with weekly weigh-ins, group support, weight loss goals and access to online support. The self-led diet group accessed free online resource and a self-led diet programme which recommends reducing calorie intake by 600 kcal/d. Both diet programmes also encouraged individuals to self-monitor and to increase the amount of physical activity they do.\nFor the purpose of this study, data were analysed with both diet intervention groups combined and participants were then categorised based on their percentage change in BM, but programme type was controlled for in all analyses. There were no specific research questions pertaining to the type of diet used to induce weight loss. Rather, the study sought to explore behavioural characteristics associated with the degree of diet-induced weight loss success.\nProcedures\nBM was measured on the first day of the weight management programme using electronic scales (commercial diet group: recorded as part of their first weigh-in at a support group meeting; self-led diet group: recorded by a researcher at the HARU). BM was measured with shoes and heavy clothing removed.\nFor all laboratory visits (measures and probe days) participants were instructed to be fasted from 10:00 pm the previous night and to abstain from strenuous exercise and alcohol consumption for at least 24 hours before all laboratory visits. Compliance was checked on arrival via self-report.\nMeasures days\nParticipants completed two measurement days; one during week 2 and one during week 14 at the end of the intervention. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured (GEM, NutrEn Technology Ltd, Cheshire, UK) with participants laying supine for 40 min during which expired air was collected using a ventilated hood system. VO2 and VCO2 values were sampled every 30 seconds. The average of the final 30 min values was deemed to be the RMR expressed as kcal/d. BM and body composition (fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM)) were measured using the BODPOD (Body Composition Tracking System, Life Measurement, Inc., Concord, USA) which uses air displacement plethysmography. Participants wore tight clothing and a swim cap to allow for an accurate measure of body volume. Height was measured using a stadiometer (Seca Ltd., Birmingham, UK) and waist circumference (WC) was measured horizontally in line with the umbilicus. \nFree-living energy intake\nParticipants completed a 7-day weighed food diary during weeks 3 and 12. Electronic scales and training were provided to ensure detailed descriptions (e.g. brands) and consumed weights of foods and beverages were reported. Total EI, macronutrient composition and energy density were calculated from the food diary. Energy density was calculated from the contribution of all food and milks (excluded all other drinks) (total EI divided by total weight intake) based on criteria previously used (Wrieden et al. 2015). Data were analysed using WISP 4.0 (Tinuviel Software 2013).\nFree-living physical activity, sedentary behaviour and energy expenditure\nFree-living PA and SB was objectively measured during week 3 and 12 using the SenseWear Armband mini (SWA; BodyMedia, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA), as has previously been described (Myers et al., 2016). Participants were instructed to wear the SWA on the posterior surface of their upper non-dominant arm for a minimum of 22 hour/d for \u22656 days (except for the time spent showering, bathing or swimming). For the SWA data to be valid &gt;22 hours of data per day had to be recorded on at least five days (midnight to midnight) including at least one weekend day.\nClassification of responders and non-responders\nTo identify differences that could account for individual variability in weight loss, participants were grouped based on their diet-induced BM change between week 0 and week 14. Participants were classified as responders if they lost \u22655% and non-responders if they lost \u22643% of their initial BM.\n\nAll participants who completed both measures days and both free-living PA and EI measurement periods will be included in the analyses. For the physical activity data to be valid &gt;22 hours of data per day had to be recorded on at least five days (midnight to midnight) including at least one weekend day.", "q10.uploader": [], "q14.question": "Weight loss programme: commercial diet (low energy dense) or self-led diet (calorie restricted).

According to 2018 global health data sources, the MENA region has the lowest HIV prevalence in the world (less than 0.1%), 240,000 people recorded living with HIV and 20,000 new HIV infections. Unfortunately, annual new infections are rising because prevention programs are not reaching those who need them. It is important to note, that public health HIV prevention programs are especially important in this region as access to school-based sex education is limited, with little or no focus on sexually transmitted infections. As a result, education on HIV, and subsequent HIV awareness among young people, tends to be poor. Our review is important as it will identify different prevention programs utilized across the region and their respective efficacy. Our findings will help identify where prevention programs are needed within the region and strategies that have worked. These findings will help medical and public health personnel across the region develop and implement prevention programs for the general population and high risk groups within the region. \n\nResearch Questions \n\u2022\tDetermine the range and efficacy of HIV prevention strategies in the MENA Region\n\u2022\tWhat are the barriers to implementing HIV prevention strategies in the MENA region?\n\u2022\tWhat cultural aspects are important to consider when implementing HIV prevention strategies in the MENA region?\n\nIdentifying Relevant Studies\n\nInformation Sources\n\u2022\tMedline via Ovid\n\u2022\tEmbase \n\u2022\tGlobal Health\n\u2022\tScopus\n\u2022\tPsycINFO\n\u2022\tWHO IRIS \u2013 specifically the Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean: https://apps.who.int/iris/ \n\u2022\tWorld Bank documents: http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/docsearch/topic/674854\n\nSearch Strategy \nMain concepts included:\n\u2022\tHIV\n\u2022\tMENA countries\n\u2022\tPrevention strategies\no\tPrevent*\no\tIntervention, initiative, strategy, program, policy\no\tInformation, communication, awareness, mass media, television\no\tCondoms\no\tHealth and sex education\no\tNeedle/syringe exchange programs\no\tCounseling, hotline\no\tScreening, testing, mobile testing\no\tPre-exposure prophylaxis\no\tOpiate substation treatment\no\tHarm reduction\no\tStigma\no\tMother-to-child transmission\no\tNGOs, National AIDs program\nFilters:\n\u2022\tEnglish-only\n\u2022\tRemoved news items, erratum, and conference papers/abstracts, books, book chapters\n\nMedline Ovid Search:\n((exp HIV Infections/ or exp HIV/ or exp HIV Antibodies/ or exp HIV Seropositivity/ or exp HIV Seroprevalence/ or HIV.tw OR (human immun* adj2 virus*).tw) \nAND \n(exp Middle East/ or Islam/ or Arabs/ or Arab World/ or exp Africa, Northern/ or Sudan/ or Somalia/ or Djibouti/ or Cyprus/ or Pakistan/ or middle east.tw or north africa.tw or EMRO.tw or eastern Mediterranean.tw or arab.tw or arabs.tw or Afghanistan.tw or Algeria.tw or Bahrain.tw or Cyprus.tw or Djibouti.tw or Egypt.tw or Iran.tw or Iraq.tw or Israel.tw or Jordan.tw or Kuwait.tw or Lebanon.tw or Libya.tw or Morocco.tw or Oman.tw or Pakistan.tw or Qatar.tw or Saudi Arabia.tw or Somalia.tw or Sudan.tw or Syria.tw or Tunisia.tw or UAE.tw or United Arab Emirates.tw or Yemen.tw or Dubai.tw or Abu Dhabi.tw or Sharjah.tw or West Bank.tw or Ghaza.tw or Palestine.tw or (occupied adj3 (territory OR territories)).tw) \nAND \n(intervention*.tw or prevent*.tw or initiative*.tw or strateg*.tw or program*.tw or policy.tw or policies.tw or information.tw or health education/ or sex education/ or education.tw or awareness.tw or communication.tw or campaign*.tw or exp mass media/ or mass media.tw or television*.tw or Condoms/ or condom*.tw OR ((needle or syringe) adj3 (exchange OR policy OR policies OR service* or program*)).tw or Needle-Exchange Programs/ or counseling.tw or testing.tw or mass screening/ or screening.tw or pre-exposure prophylaxis/ or pre-exposure prophylaxis.tw or PrEP.tw or Opiate Substitution Treatment/ or (Opioid substitution adj (treatment or therapy)).tw or harm reduction/ or harm reduction.tw or hotline*.tw OR prevention control.fs.

As a result, education on HIV, and subsequent HIV awareness among young people, tends to be poor. Our review is important as it will identify different prevention programs utilized across the region and their respective efficacy. Our findings will help identify where prevention programs are needed within the region and strategies that have worked. These findings will help medical and public health personnel across the region develop and implement prevention programs for the general population and high risk groups within the region. \n\nResearch Questions \n\u2022\tDetermine the range and efficacy of HIV prevention strategies in the MENA Region\n\u2022\tWhat are the barriers to implementing HIV prevention strategies in the MENA region?\n\u2022\tWhat cultural aspects are important to consider when implementing HIV prevention strategies in the MENA region?\n\nIdentifying Relevant Studies\n\nInformation Sources\n\u2022\tMedline via Ovid\n\u2022\tEmbase \n\u2022\tGlobal Health\n\u2022\tScopus\n\u2022\tPsycINFO\n\u2022\tWHO IRIS \u2013 specifically the Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean: https://apps.who.int/iris/ \n\u2022\tWorld Bank documents: http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/docsearch/topic/674854\n\nSearch Strategy \nMain concepts included:\n\u2022\tHIV\n\u2022\tMENA countries\n\u2022\tPrevention strategies\no\tPrevent*\no\tIntervention, initiative, strategy, program, policy\no\tInformation, communication, awareness, mass media, television\no\tCondoms\no\tHealth and sex education\no\tNeedle/syringe exchange programs\no\tCounseling, hotline\no\tScreening, testing, mobile testing\no\tPre-exposure prophylaxis\no\tOpiate substation treatment\no\tHarm reduction\no\tStigma\no\tMother-to-child transmission\no\tNGOs, National AIDs program\nFilters:\n\u2022\tEnglish-only\n\u2022\tRemoved news items, erratum, and conference papers/abstracts, books, book chapters\n\nMedline Ovid Search:\n((exp HIV Infections/ or exp HIV/ or exp HIV Antibodies/ or exp HIV Seropositivity/ or exp HIV Seroprevalence/ or HIV.tw OR (human immun* adj2 virus*).tw) \nAND \n(exp Middle East/ or Islam/ or Arabs/ or Arab World/ or exp Africa, Northern/ or Sudan/ or Somalia/ or Djibouti/ or Cyprus/ or Pakistan/ or middle east.tw or north africa.tw or EMRO.tw or eastern Mediterranean.tw or arab.tw or arabs.tw or Afghanistan.tw or Algeria.tw or Bahrain.tw or Cyprus.tw or Djibouti.tw or Egypt.tw or Iran.tw or Iraq.tw or Israel.tw or Jordan.tw or Kuwait.tw or Lebanon.tw or Libya.tw or Morocco.tw or Oman.tw or Pakistan.tw or Qatar.tw or Saudi Arabia.tw or Somalia.tw or Sudan.tw or Syria.tw or Tunisia.tw or UAE.tw or United Arab Emirates.tw or Yemen.tw or Dubai.tw or Abu Dhabi.tw or Sharjah.tw or West Bank.tw or Ghaza.tw or Palestine.tw or (occupied adj3 (territory OR territories)).tw) \nAND \n(intervention*.tw or prevent*.tw or initiative*.tw or strateg*.tw or program*.tw or policy.tw or policies.tw or information.tw or health education/ or sex education/ or education.tw or awareness.tw or communication.tw or campaign*.tw or exp mass media/ or mass media.tw or television*.tw or Condoms/ or condom*.tw OR ((needle or syringe) adj3 (exchange OR policy OR policies OR service* or program*)).tw or Needle-Exchange Programs/ or counseling.tw or testing.tw or mass screening/ or screening.tw or pre-exposure prophylaxis/ or pre-exposure prophylaxis.tw or PrEP.tw or Opiate Substitution Treatment/ or (Opioid substitution adj (treatment or therapy)).tw or harm reduction/ or harm reduction.tw or hotline*.tw OR prevention control.fs.

Analyzing the effects of more news on affective polarization and other outcomes", "description": "Many scholars accept that democracies function best when citizens are up-to-date on political events and knowledgeable about the issues of the day (e.g., Delli Carpini &amp; Keeter, 1996). Thus, news exposure has been seen as normatively beneficial, and citizens are expected to attend to the news (as reected, for instance, in social desirability bias leading to overreporting of news consumption in survey self-reports; Prior, 2009). Yet, the current media environment makes it possible for citizens to avoid news altogether, which could decrease political knowledge and engagement (Delli Carpini &amp; Keeter, 1996). It may be equally problematic that those who decide to tune in to political outlets have unprecedented opportunity to consume like-minded news, which may in part be to blame for increasing attitude (e.g., Levendusky, 2013) and affective polarization, or the animosity between people who identify with opposing political parties (e.g., Garrett et al., 2014). In this project, we problematize the notion of news exposure being necessarily democratically desirable and, in so doing, we offer a novel take on the problem of polarization.\n\nWe propose that increasing people's news exposure will exacerbate both attitude and affective polarization. We rely on group identity as a major mechanism underlying these effects. As people are exposed to news, political issues, parties, policies, and different sociopolitical groups become more salient in their minds, regardless of the ideology of the news consumed. Therefore, people learn and/or are reminded of the positions of their political in-group as well as the out-group. Because people tend to use group cues and their own political identity to make sense of the political world, they often adopt an opinion that more closely matches their in-group, increasing attitude polarization. During this process, group identity also becomes more salient, increasing affective polarization or negative attitudes toward the political out-group.\n\nWe also suspect that increasing news exposure will lead to more negative perceptions of the political system, lowering support for compromise and also increasing perceived levels of polarization and of attribution to negative intentions to the out-party (i.e., attribution of malevolence). In addition to these effects, we also explore the effects of increased news consumption on an under-studied factor, namely individual general well-being. Finally, in order to provide a balanced perspective on the impact of news, we also address the expected democratically beneffcial effects of increased political knowledge and participatory intentions.\n\nIn sum, this project addresses a fundamental question: \"In what ways is news of any kind harmful, and in what ways is it beneffcial?\" To test these effects, we incentivized participants in our ongoing panel to increase their news consumption for 12 days (the treatment). We include this experiment at the end of the second wave of a 3-wave panel study in Poland. 2,138 respondents completed wave 1 and were invited to the second wave. We randomly assign wave 2 respondents into this \"more news\" treatment group with a .6 probability. The rest are assigned to a control group and do not receive any instructions regarding altering their news diet. Our approach is novel in that we look at the effects of increasing news consumption in general (i.e., altering an individual's news diet) as opposed to the effect of exposure to a single article or browsing session, using an experimental design in a naturalistic setting. This may also be the first study to address various distinct effects of news consumption using both self-reported measures as well as observational methods in the form of online browsing data that the study participants voluntarily submitted.\n\nIn the analyses, we aim to establish the effects of increasing news exposure while also testing whether these effects depend on people's prior levels of (likeminded) news consumption.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-06T09:46:30.905953", "date_modified": "2020-04-06T09:41:09.483673", "registration": true,

With the exception of a few drugs that require a medical prescription, cannabidiol cannot legally be sold in most European countries, including Norway. It may contain a small amount of Tetrahydrocannabinol/\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC is the psychoactive substance in cannabis and considered an illegal drug independent of dosage in most European countries, including Norway. \n\nIn a report to the Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services, the Norwegian Medicines Agency has recommended that that the legislation is clarified concerning whether or not products containing &gt; 0.2% THC should be classified as narcotics (4).  If the Ministry decides that products with less than 0.2% THC should not be considered as narcotics, cannabidiol supplements will be considered in the Norwegian marked. The Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services is awaiting the results from novel food applications and a statement from The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). If EFSA approves the novel food applications, there is reason to believe that cannabidiol supplements will be considered legal in the EU countries. As of February 2020 two novel food applications have been submitted to EFSA where the CBD dosage set to is 130 mg and 150 mg (2). The U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has no dosage recommendation for cannabidiol as a supplement (3). \n\nSupplements are usually sold in specialty shops, online, and food- and drugstores. There is no need for a medical prescription from a doctor. There is normally established an upper daily intake and a recommended dosage. In European countries, supplements are regulated with approved health claims. Cannabidiol is an active substance in a few drugs that require a medical prescription. Normally composition of substance and dosages are different in prescription drugs and supplements. Because it is not established which dosage of cannabidiol that will be legal as a supplement in Norway or in the EU, there is no cutoff or set on CBD dosage in this scoping review. The upper daily intake for supplements will probably be lower than in the prescribed drugs. In the review, we will discuss whether the current literature can inform about the effects of CBD in dosages relevant for CBD supplements. THC dosage cutoff is set to 0.2% THC based on a suggestion from The Norwegian Medicines Agency on THC dosage in CBD products for the Norwegian market (4). The registered prescription drugs contains a higher dosage of THC than 0.2%.\n\nIn preparations for the review, we searched for articles on cannabidiol as a supplement. We did not find any scoping reviews about cannabidiol as a supplement, and no other effect studies directly concerning supplements. This may be because \u201csupplement\u201d was not present in the title or abstracts of possibly relevant articles. The research field for cannabidiol as a supplement new and few studies have been published. This makes it reasonable to assume that the majority of the articles included in this review will not concern cannabidiol as a supplement, but cannabidiol as prescribed drugs and unregistered drugs made specifically for the study. \n\n\nThe aim of this scoping review is to map the available literature to provide an overview of research on health effects related to different doses of cannabidiol, and to identify knowledge gaps.\n \nResearch questions: \n1.\tWhat are the health outcomes addressed?\n2.\tWhich doses of CBD have been studied?\n3.\tFor which CBD doses are health effects reported, and are these doses relevant for supplements?\n\nSee attachment for the full study protocol.

As of February 2020 two novel food applications have been submitted to EFSA where the CBD dosage set to is 130 mg and 150 mg (2). The U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has no dosage recommendation for cannabidiol as a supplement (3). \n\nSupplements are usually sold in specialty shops, online, and food- and drugstores. There is no need for a medical prescription from a doctor. There is normally established an upper daily intake and a recommended dosage. In European countries, supplements are regulated with approved health claims. Cannabidiol is an active substance in a few drugs that require a medical prescription. Normally composition of substance and dosages are different in prescription drugs and supplements. Because it is not established which dosage of cannabidiol that will be legal as a supplement in Norway or in the EU, there is no cutoff or set on CBD dosage in this scoping review. The upper daily intake for supplements will probably be lower than in the prescribed drugs. In the review, we will discuss whether the current literature can inform about the effects of CBD in dosages relevant for CBD supplements. THC dosage cutoff is set to 0.2% THC based on a suggestion from The Norwegian Medicines Agency on THC dosage in CBD products for the Norwegian market (4). The registered prescription drugs contains a higher dosage of THC than 0.2%.\n\nIn preparations for the review, we searched for articles on cannabidiol as a supplement. We did not find any scoping reviews about cannabidiol as a supplement, and no other effect studies directly concerning supplements. This may be because \u201csupplement\u201d was not present in the title or abstracts of possibly relevant articles. The research field for cannabidiol as a supplement new and few studies have been published. This makes it reasonable to assume that the majority of the articles included in this review will not concern cannabidiol as a supplement, but cannabidiol as prescribed drugs and unregistered drugs made specifically for the study. \n\n\nThe aim of this scoping review is to map the available literature to provide an overview of research on health effects related to different doses of cannabidiol, and to identify knowledge gaps.\n \nResearch questions: \n1.\tWhat are the health outcomes addressed?\n2.\tWhich doses of CBD have been studied?\n3.\tFor which CBD doses are health effects reported, and are these doses relevant for supplements?\n\nSee attachment for the full study protocol.
