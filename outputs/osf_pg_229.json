Spending resources to punish offenders or to compensate victims are two alternative strategies to enforce compliance when norms are broken. Here, we investigate how attentional processes predict a preference for punishment and compensation. We will employ the Third-Party Justice Game (Civai et al, 2019), where two players share a sum of money until one (offender) steals from the other (victim); participants, who play as witnesses, must decide whether to do nothing or spend their money to either punish the offender or to compensate the victim. From a set of previous studies we have run, we expect that the amount of attention directed towards the offender, compared to the victim, will positively predict punishment. Moreover, we expect that the way in which payoffs are represented influences attention and, consequently, choice. Hence, in one condition, payoffs are being represented as piles of coins: when the offender steals money, their payoff increases by one pile, making the representation of offender\u2019s payoff more visually salient. In another condition, the payoffs are being represented as digits, and no difference in visual saliency is assumed.

Based on our previous experiments, the predicted effect is large (Cohen's d = 0.85 from an independent sample t-test)\niii) The difference between the amount of attention (percentage of dwell time) directed towards the offender and the amount of attention directed towards the victim will positively predict punishment (and negatively predict compensation). Based on our previous experiments, we expect a medium to large effect size (R-squared = 0.21 from regression analysis). We expect to find the same trend when analysing the amount.  \niv) Following from ii) and iii), the condition will also predict the likelihood of punishment: participants will be more likely to punish in the coins condition, when the representation of the offender's payoff is more salient.

Spending resources to punish offenders or to compensate victims are two alternative strategies to enforce compliance when norms are broken. Here, we investigate how attentional processes predict a preference for punishment and compensation. We will employ the Third-Party Justice Game (Civai et al, 2019), where two players share a sum of money until one (offender) steals from the other (victim); participants, who play as witnesses, must decide whether to do nothing or spend their money to either punish the offender or to compensate the victim. From a set of previous studies we have run, we expect that the amount of attention directed towards the offender, compared to the victim, will positively predict punishment. Moreover, we expect that the way in which payoffs are represented influences attention and, consequently, choice. Hence, in one condition, payoffs are being represented as piles of coins: when the offender steals money, their payoff increases by one pile, making the representation of offender\u2019s payoff more visually salient. In another condition, the payoffs are being represented as digits, and no difference in visual saliency is assumed. If this is the case, the idea that bottom-up implicit attentional processes influence complex choices would be supported (Milosavljevic et al, 2011; Parnamets et al., 2015). ", "q4": "We hypothesise that: \ni) punishment and compensation (likelihood of choice and amount spent) will increase with the increase of the level of injustice (coins stolen by the offender). From previous studies, we predict a large effect size (e.g., partial eta-squared of 0.63 for percentage of punish/compensate, and of 0.5 for amount spent, from Civai et al, 2019). \nii) The difference between the amount of attention (percentage of dwell time) directed towards the offender and the amount of attention directed towards the victim will differ between conditions: when the representation of the offender's payoff is visually more salient (coins condition), the difference in dwell time will be larger compared to when the payoffs are represented as digits (digits condition). Based on our previous experiments, the predicted effect is large (Cohen's d = 0.85 from an independent sample t-test)\niii) The difference between the amount of attention (percentage of dwell time) directed towards the offender and the amount of attention directed towards the victim will positively predict punishment (and negatively predict compensation). Based on our previous experiments, we expect a medium to large effect size (R-squared = 0.21 from regression analysis). We expect to find the same trend when analysing the amount.  \niv) Following from ii) and iii), the condition will also predict the likelihood of punishment: participants will be more likely to punish in the coins condition, when the representation of the offender's payoff is more salient. Based on our previous experiments where we varied the payoff representation between experiments, we expect a medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.53 from an independent sample t-test).

But to be clear, we do not intend to pre-register those analyses, which should be understood as data-driven, exploratory exercises. \n\nThe tables and figures can be found in the attached file \"PGZ_Tables_Figures.docx\"", "q19.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e5e8662e8903300d3f04c1d", "file_name": "PGZ_Tables_Figures.docx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/enwvg/files/osfstorage/5e5e8662e8903300d3f04c1d", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e5e8662e8903300d3f04c1d"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "934ffe1cfc4abf2fd1a55bf5f8c2dffe04c06cc4a98e20d31f4b5ce0a1b5e2d2"}}]}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=enwvg", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "enwvg", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "enwvg", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/m3qsd/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "m3qsd", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tqsmk/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "tqsmk", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/enwvg/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/enwvg/"}}, {"id": "nkp96", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "5.
