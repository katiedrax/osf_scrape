Standardized means that, the test is administered in a standardized way, is objectively scored (either manually or electronically by the test administrator or a third person) and offers norms that allow comparisons to the norm sample.

In order to cope with dependencies between effect sizes, hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) approach to meta-analysis (Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002), also known as 'multilevel meta-analysis', will be used. At Level 1 (base level) the model is a random-effects model. Similar to Freund and Kasten (2011) both a within- and a between-study model will be formulated. At Level 2, moderators at relationship level (all moderators except for 'publication year') will be included (within-study model). Level 3 will include all moderators at study level (between-study model). In order to check the specific effect of a moderator on the overall effect, subgroup analysis will be conducted. \n\nSince multiple studies found, that there might be a relationship between self-efficacy and neuroticism (e.g. Ackerman &amp; Wolman, 2007; Judge &amp; Ilies, 2002) multicollinearity between these two moderators has to be expected. Therefore, the analysis is performed twice separately for neuroticism and self-efficacy. Since, as mentioned above, the corrected overall mean (Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004) will be compared to the observed overall mean, this ultimately leads to a total of four analyses. \n\nStudy heterogeneity will be described by reporting the Q statistic, tau, tau\u00b2, and I\u00b2. In order to detect which studies (or effect sizes, since multiple effect sizes per study are expected) influence the overall estimate the most leave-one-out sensitivity analyses will be performed by excluding one study/effect size at a time. Furthermore, a baujat plot (Baujat et al., 2002) will be used to investigate the contribution of each study/effect size to the overall heterogeneity. \n\nPotential publication bias will be investigated by using the following methods: p-curve (Simonsohn et al., 2014), p-uniform (van Assen et al., 2015), p-uniform* (van Aert &amp; van Assen, 2018), PET-PEESE (Stanley &amp; Doucouliagos, 2014), Begg and Mazumdar's rank-order correlation (1994), Sterne and Egger's regression approach (2005), moderator analysis of published vs. unpublished literature (Card, 2012), Duval &amp; Tweedie\u2019s trim-and-fill procedure (2002) and test for excess significance following the approach of Ioannidis and Trikalinos (2007).

", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "To find all studies that should potentially be included in the meta-analysis,  online databases PsychINFO, PSYNDEX, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, Google Scholar and OATD will be searched, using the following search string: \n\n(\u201ecognitive ability\u201c OR \u201eintelligenc*\u201c) AND (estimate* OR perceive* OR self-apprais* OR self-assess* OR self-estimate* OR self-evaluat* OR self-perceive* OR self-rate*).\n\nThe databases will be searched systematically with forward searches (articles, that cite Freund and Kasten (2011)) as well as backward searches based on the identified papers and the already included studies. We will also consider unpublished data, grey literature and translate studies using deepl.com if they were not published in English. \nLike Freund and Kasten (2011), we will include all studies that meet the following inclusion criteria:\n\n 1) To be included a study has to compare a self-estimate of cognitive ability (intelligence) to a psychometrically assessed ability test measure. \n\n2) This psychometric measure has to be collected using a standardized cognitive ability test. Standardized means that, the test is administered in a standardized way, is objectively scored (either manually or electronically by the test administrator or a third person) and offers norms that allow comparisons to the norm sample. Such norms can either be included in the test manual or be derived from the data collected from the study sample (e.g. when the test battery was developed exclusively for this study). To ensure high levels of objectivity and comparability with regard to the criteria observed, other criterion measures, such as grades or experts'/others\u2019 including teachers, parents, and peers) estimates of cognitive ability, will not be included. \n\n3) A direct measure of self-assessed cognitive ability has to be used. Studies with indirect measures of self-estimations (e.g. conclusions that were drawn from subjects\u2019 estimates of constructs that are related to cognitive ability, e.g., interest) will not be included.\n\n4) Except for those studies, that were included by Freund and Kasten (2011), all included studies must have been conducted between 2011 and 2020. \n\n5) Only studies, that include healthy adult participants will be considered.\n\nThe screening of title, abstract and full texts as well as data extraction will be performed by the author. Results and all relevant details of the screening and literature search will be displayed in a PRISMA Flowchart. \n\nFrom all relevant studies, the following information will be extracted: \n-study authors\n-correlation coefficient between SAI and psychometrically assessed intelligence\n-z-transformed correlation coefficient\n-standard error of effect size (r)\n-sample size\n-reliability of self-assessment\n-test reliability\n-methodology of self-assessment\n-ability type\n-order of assessment\n-sex of participants\n-sample composition\n-year of publication\n-selection process\n-mean self-efficacy\n-number of answer options (self-efficacy)\n-achievable points of self-efficacy scale\n-mean neuroticism\n-achievable points of neuroticism scale\n-number of answer options (neuroticism)\n-total number of self-efficacy items\n-total number of neuroticism items\n-test\n\nAdditionally, each included study will be given a unique study ID to allow easy tracking.

As studies are expected to use several different measures to assess the self-assessed and psychometrically assessed intelligence a correction for unreliability seems reasonable (Card, 2012). Therefore, a measurement correction of the effect sizes (i.e. Pearsons r) and standard errors will be performed: First, the square root of the reliability of self-estimated intelligence multiplied by the reliability of the psychometric test will be taken. Second, the effect size (i.e. correlation) and standard error, will be divided by the unreliability to get the adjusted effect size and standard error  (Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004). Subsequently, the observed and corrected mean will be compared. In case, that a study contains not enough information to calculate the adjusted values of both SAI and psychometrically assessed intelligence it will be excluded for summery effect calculations. Any exclusions will be made transparent and documented.", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Due to high observed study heterogeneity in the preceding meta-analysis by Freund and Kasten (2011), a random-effects meta-analysis with a restricted (residual) maximum-likelihood estimator (REML) will be conducted. \n\nIn line with the previous meta-analysis (Freund &amp; Kasten, 2011), it can be expected that single studies will report multiple effect sizes. In order to cope with dependencies between effect sizes, hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) approach to meta-analysis (Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002), also known as 'multilevel meta-analysis', will be used. At Level 1 (base level) the model is a random-effects model. Similar to Freund and Kasten (2011) both a within- and a between-study model will be formulated. At Level 2, moderators at relationship level (all moderators except for 'publication year') will be included (within-study model). Level 3 will include all moderators at study level (between-study model). In order to check the specific effect of a moderator on the overall effect, subgroup analysis will be conducted. \n\nSince multiple studies found, that there might be a relationship between self-efficacy and neuroticism (e.g. Ackerman &amp; Wolman, 2007; Judge &amp; Ilies, 2002) multicollinearity between these two moderators has to be expected. Therefore, the analysis is performed twice separately for neuroticism and self-efficacy. Since, as mentioned above, the corrected overall mean (Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004) will be compared to the observed overall mean, this ultimately leads to a total of four analyses. \n\nStudy heterogeneity will be described by reporting the Q statistic, tau, tau\u00b2, and I\u00b2. In order to detect which studies (or effect sizes, since multiple effect sizes per study are expected) influence the overall estimate the most leave-one-out sensitivity analyses will be performed by excluding one study/effect size at a time. Furthermore, a baujat plot (Baujat et al., 2002) will be used to investigate the contribution of each study/effect size to the overall heterogeneity. \n\nPotential publication bias will be investigated by using the following methods: p-curve (Simonsohn et al., 2014), p-uniform (van Assen et al., 2015), p-uniform* (van Aert &amp; van Assen, 2018), PET-PEESE (Stanley &amp; Doucouliagos, 2014), Begg and Mazumdar's rank-order correlation (1994), Sterne and Egger's regression approach (2005), moderator analysis of published vs. unpublished literature (Card, 2012), Duval &amp; Tweedie\u2019s trim-and-fill procedure (2002) and test for excess significance following the approach of Ioannidis and Trikalinos (2007). Furthermore, studies will be displayed in enhanced funnel plots (Peters et al., 2008) to investigate the funnel plot asymmetry. \n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children":

ActivPAL data during sleep will be identified using self-reported sleep/wake-time diaries from participants. In the original study, an algorithm was used to match self-reported sleep/wake-times to activPAL data. In case the self-reported sleep/wake-times and the activPAL data did not match (i.e., no sedentary episode of long duration starting within the 40 minute time-window around self-reported bedtimes, or ending within the 40 minute timewindow around the self-reported waketimes) these self-reported sleep/wake-times were manually adjusted to plausible bed- or waketimes, based on visual inspection of the activPAL data, as well as consultancy with participants on regular bed and waketimes. These adjusted sleep/wake-time diaries are used for the current study. First, we increase participants self-reported bedtimes and decrease participants self-reported waketimes with 20 minutes. Next, all sedentary and active episodes of a day, that start after the respective adjusted bedtime for that day, and start before the respective adjusted wake time of the next day, are excluded. In addition, all sedentary episodes of a day that end after the adjusted bedtime for that day, and start before the adjusted waketime of the next day, are excluded. \n\u2022\tValid wear-day. We exclude all data on days that are considered invalid wear days (i.e., day on which the participant did not wear the activPAL according to the instructions). A day is considered invalid if at least one of the following criteria is met:\no\tOne activity takes up more than 95% of totale time awake\no\t&lt;500 steps counted\no\t&lt;10 hours awake\n\nAssumptions\nWe will test the assumptions of multilevel time-to-event analysis as follows:\n\u2022\tDistribution of predictors. We will visually explore histograms to examine the distribution of predictors. In case of serious concerns we will refit the model with a transformation of the predictor variable. We will use a transformation on the predictor that sufficiently creates a normal distribution, starting with square root transformation, followed by log transformation, followed by inverse transformation (Tabachnik &amp; Fidell, 2013). In case no transformation is useful, we will dichotomize the predictor.

We will examine deviance residuals to detect cases that are not predicted well by the model. We will evaluate whether the proportion of residuals &gt; 3 is approximately 0%, the proportion of residuals &gt; 2.5 is approximately 1%, and the proportion of residuals &gt; 2 is approximately 5%. In case of concern, we will refit the model excluding cases with a deviance residual &gt; 3. When refitting the model changes the interpretation of the results, we will report on this.  \no\tSchoenfeld residuals. We will plot schoenfeld residuals against ranked event times, and we will test the correlation between schoenfeld residuals and ranked event times, to test the proportionality assumption. A significant correlation indicates violation of the assumption. If the assumption is violated, we will follow recommendations by Singer and Willet (2003), and refit and examine a model including an interaction with time as a predictor, to represent the time varying effect.\no\tScore residuals. We will plot score residuals against ranked event times to detect influential and high leverage cases. In case high-influential cases are concentrated at specific event times, we will refit the model excluding observations with extreme score residuals (as the absolute value of score residuals is not meaningful, we will choose the cut-off for extreme values based on visual inspection of the graph).

In this study, we distinguish between sitting behaviour and activity, referring to all non-sitting behaviour. Sitting behaviour and activity were assessed using an activPAL3 micro (PAL Technologies Ltd, Glasgow, UK), a device that is worn on the thigh that directly assesses posture using triaxial accelerometry. ActivPALs are known to have a good reliability and validity to measure sitting and activity behaviour (Edwardson et al., 2017) for more information on the activPAL). Placement was standardised to the anterior midline of the upper right thigh, with monitors inserted into a flexible waterproof sleeve and attached using a breathable, hypoallergenic dressing. Participants were asked to wear the monitor 24 hours over an 8-day period and not to remove the monitor. The activPAL measures sitting behaviour and activity with seconds precision, and provides timestamped activity code (sitting/lying down; standing; or stepping) for each transition between postures and each step. For this study, standing and stepping are taken together as active, so the data contains a new row for each sit-active and active-sit transition. \n-\tEvent times in minutes (precision in seconds) are calculated by subtracting the time of the previous event from the time of the current event, e.g., the time of the previous stand up events is subtracted from the current sit-down event.\n\nGrouping variables\n\u2022\tCV patients vs. healthy controls (group)\n\u2022\tMeasurement moment regarding cardiac rehabilitation (cr_time): Pre- vs. post- vs. follow-up\n\nPredictor variables and measurement:\n- Time of the day (within-participants); In hours since midnight (precision in seconds); Inferred from the time registration in the activPAL data\n- Activity in last 5 hours (within-participants); In minutes (precision in seconds); Sum of all active (non-sedentary) time in the 5 hours prior to the current event\n- Age (between-participants); In years; Self-report\n- Sex (between-participants); Male vs. female; Self-report\n- BMI (between-participants); Weight(kg) / Height(m)^2; Retrieved from electronic patient files\n- Average sitting level (between-participants); Average total sitting time per day in hours (precision in seconds); Calculated from activPAL data\n- Average MVPA level (between-participants); Average total MVPA per day in minutes (precision in seconds); Calculated as the sum of all stepping time with a MET value \u2265 3\n- Type of CVD (between-participants); Acute coronary syndrome (ACS; Acute coronary syndrome; Angina Pectoris) vs. Other (Congenital heart disease; Heart failure; Heart rhythm disorder; Heart valve disease; Other CVD); Retrieved from electronic patient files\n- Polypharmacy (between-participants); Yes (&gt; 5 medications) vs. No; Retrieved from electronic patient files\n- Treatment (between-participants); Voronary Artery Bypass Crafting (CABG) vs. Other (Electro cardioversion / ablation / mini-maze procedure; Heart valve replacement; Pacemaker or ICD implementation; PCI; Medication only); Retrieved from electronic patient files\n- Comorbid diabetes (between-participants); Yes vs. No; Retrieved from electronic patient files\n- Comorbid dyslipidaemia (between-participants); Yes vs. No; Retrieved from electronic patient files\n- Comorbid rheumatoid arthritis or arthrosis (between-participants); Yes vs. No; Retrieved from electronic patient files\n- Alcohol consumption (between-participants); High vs. Low; Retrieved from electronic patient files\n- Smoking status (between-participants); Currently smoking vs. Not currently smoking; Retrieved from electronic patient files"}, "conditions": {"extra": [], "value": "N/A"}, "hypothesis": {"extra": [], "value": "The overall aim of the current research is to extend findings from the original study on sitting behaviour amongst CV patients, by using a dynamic approach to investigate patterns of sitting behaviour amongst CV patients and healthy controls (as opposed to average total sitting behaviour on a person or day level).\n\nThe study has four aims: \n1.\tInvestigate differences in baseline (i.e., pre cardiac rehabilitation) sitting patterns between CV patients and healthy controls\n2.\tInvestigate changes in sitting patterns of CV patients from before to after cardiac rehabilitation\n3.\tExplore the temporal dynamics of sitting behaviour in CV patients compared to healthy controls\n4.\tExplore individual characteristics and patient characteristics as predictors of sitting patterns of CV patients\n\nSitting behaviour is conceptualized as a dynamic chain of individual sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transitions.

ActivPAL data during sleep will be identified using self-reported sleep/wake-time diaries from participants. In the original study, an algorithm was used to match self-reported sleep/wake-times to activPAL data. In case the self-reported sleep/wake-times and the activPAL data did not match (i.e., no sedentary episode of long duration starting within the 40 minute time-window around self-reported bedtimes, or ending within the 40 minute timewindow around the self-reported waketimes) these self-reported sleep/wake-times were manually adjusted to plausible bed- or waketimes, based on visual inspection of the activPAL data, as well as consultancy with participants on regular bed and waketimes. These adjusted sleep/wake-time diaries are used for the current study. First, we increase participants self-reported bedtimes and decrease participants self-reported waketimes with 20 minutes. Next, all sedentary and active episodes of a day, that start after the respective adjusted bedtime for that day, and start before the respective adjusted wake time of the next day, are excluded. In addition, all sedentary episodes of a day that end after the adjusted bedtime for that day, and start before the adjusted waketime of the next day, are excluded. \n\u2022\tValid wear-day. We exclude all data on days that are considered invalid wear days (i.e., day on which the participant did not wear the activPAL according to the instructions). A day is considered invalid if at least one of the following criteria is met:\no\tOne activity takes up more than 95% of totale time awake\no\t&lt;500 steps counted\no\t&lt;10 hours awake\n\nAssumptions\nWe will test the assumptions of multilevel time-to-event analysis as follows:\n\u2022\tDistribution of predictors. We will visually explore histograms to examine the distribution of predictors. In case of serious concerns we will refit the model with a transformation of the predictor variable. We will use a transformation on the predictor that sufficiently creates a normal distribution, starting with square root transformation, followed by log transformation, followed by inverse transformation (Tabachnik &amp; Fidell, 2013). In case no transformation is useful, we will dichotomize the predictor. When refitting the model changes the interpretation of the results, we will report on this. \n\u2022\tResiduals will be examined for each model:\no\tDeviance residuals. We will examine deviance residuals to detect cases that are not predicted well by the model. We will evaluate whether the proportion of residuals &gt; 3 is approximately 0%, the proportion of residuals &gt; 2.5 is approximately 1%, and the proportion of residuals &gt; 2 is approximately 5%. In case of concern, we will refit the model excluding cases with a deviance residual &gt; 3. When refitting the model changes the interpretation of the results, we will report on this.  \no\tSchoenfeld residuals. We will plot schoenfeld residuals against ranked event times, and we will test the correlation between schoenfeld residuals and ranked event times, to test the proportionality assumption. A significant correlation indicates violation of the assumption. If the assumption is violated, we will follow recommendations by Singer and Willet (2003), and refit and examine a model including an interaction with time as a predictor, to represent the time varying effect.\no\tScore residuals. We will plot score residuals against ranked event times to detect influential and high leverage cases. In case high-influential cases are concentrated at specific event times, we will refit the model excluding observations with extreme score residuals (as the absolute value of score residuals is not meaningful, we will choose the cut-off for extreme values based on visual inspection of the graph).

In this study, we distinguish between sitting behaviour and activity, referring to all non-sitting behaviour. Sitting behaviour and activity were assessed using an activPAL3 micro (PAL Technologies Ltd, Glasgow, UK), a device that is worn on the thigh that directly assesses posture using triaxial accelerometry. ActivPALs are known to have a good reliability and validity to measure sitting and activity behaviour (Edwardson et al., 2017) for more information on the activPAL). Placement was standardised to the anterior midline of the upper right thigh, with monitors inserted into a flexible waterproof sleeve and attached using a breathable, hypoallergenic dressing. Participants were asked to wear the monitor 24 hours over an 8-day period and not to remove the monitor. The activPAL measures sitting behaviour and activity with seconds precision, and provides timestamped activity code (sitting/lying down; standing; or stepping) for each transition between postures and each step. For this study, standing and stepping are taken together as active, so the data contains a new row for each sit-active and active-sit transition. \n-\tEvent times in minutes (precision in seconds) are calculated by subtracting the time of the previous event from the time of the current event, e.g., the time of the previous stand up events is subtracted from the current sit-down event.\n\nGrouping variables\n\u2022\tCV patients vs. healthy controls (group)\n\u2022\tMeasurement moment regarding cardiac rehabilitation (cr_time): Pre- vs. post- vs. follow-up\n\nPredictor variables and measurement:\n- Time of the day (within-participants); In hours since midnight (precision in seconds); Inferred from the time registration in the activPAL data\n- Activity in last 5 hours (within-participants); In minutes (precision in seconds); Sum of all active (non-sedentary) time in the 5 hours prior to the current event\n- Age (between-participants); In years; Self-report\n- Sex (between-participants); Male vs. female; Self-report\n- BMI (between-participants); Weight(kg) / Height(m)^2; Retrieved from electronic patient files\n- Average sitting level (between-participants); Average total sitting time per day in hours (precision in seconds); Calculated from activPAL data\n- Average MVPA level (between-participants); Average total MVPA per day in minutes (precision in seconds); Calculated as the sum of all stepping time with a MET value \u2265 3\n- Type of CVD (between-participants); Acute coronary syndrome (ACS; Acute coronary syndrome; Angina Pectoris) vs. Other (Congenital heart disease; Heart failure; Heart rhythm disorder; Heart valve disease; Other CVD); Retrieved from electronic patient files\n- Polypharmacy (between-participants); Yes (&gt; 5 medications) vs. No; Retrieved from electronic patient files\n- Treatment (between-participants); Voronary Artery Bypass Crafting (CABG) vs. Other (Electro cardioversion / ablation / mini-maze procedure; Heart valve replacement; Pacemaker or ICD implementation; PCI; Medication only); Retrieved from electronic patient files\n- Comorbid diabetes (between-participants); Yes vs. No; Retrieved from electronic patient files\n- Comorbid dyslipidaemia (between-participants); Yes vs. No; Retrieved from electronic patient files\n- Comorbid rheumatoid arthritis or arthrosis (between-participants); Yes vs. No; Retrieved from electronic patient files\n- Alcohol consumption (between-participants); High vs. Low; Retrieved from electronic patient files\n- Smoking status (between-participants); Currently smoking vs. Not currently smoking; Retrieved from electronic patient files", "conditions": "N/A", "hypothesis": "The overall aim of the current research is to extend findings from the original study on sitting behaviour amongst CV patients, by using a dynamic approach to investigate patterns of sitting behaviour amongst CV patients and healthy controls (as opposed to average total sitting behaviour on a person or day level).\n\nThe study has four aims: \n1.\tInvestigate differences in baseline (i.e., pre cardiac rehabilitation) sitting patterns between CV patients and healthy controls\n2.\tInvestigate changes in sitting patterns of CV patients from before to after cardiac rehabilitation\n3.\tExplore the temporal dynamics of sitting behaviour in CV patients compared to healthy controls\n4.\tExplore individual characteristics and patient characteristics as predictors of sitting patterns of CV patients\n\nSitting behaviour is conceptualized as a dynamic chain of individual sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transitions.

The framework for the assessment of gene-environment interactions consists of four steps: (1) assessment of the strength of the evidence for main effects of the environmental exposure and the genetic variant on the outcome of interest, 2) establishment of an a prior score category and decision on the pattern of interaction to be expected, 3) assessment of the strength of the evidence for interaction between the environmental exposure and the genetic variant, and 4) examination of the overall plausibility of the interaction by combining the prior score and the strength of the evidence and interpretation of the findings.", "q22": "", "q23": "", "q24": "", "q25": "", "q8.question": "The present study is a field synopsis, which is a snapshot of the current state of knowledge on associations for risk factors in a particular research field, as defined by a disease or trait, and provides a summary of the cumulative evidence on the etiology of complex diseases and normal traits.", "q8.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e4ba79cb8c2e5005d4c61ac", "file_name": "Protocol registration.docx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/3rd7w/files/osfstorage/5e4ba79cb8c2e5005d4c61ac", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e4ba79cb8c2e5005d4c61ac"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "1e0acdf51d0f669be2a55f398462f5eb1afab3aee1a62e69c66b765a979074c5"}}], "q12.question": "We will systematically search PubMed to identify epidemiological studies that examined gene-environment interactions and risk for MS.
