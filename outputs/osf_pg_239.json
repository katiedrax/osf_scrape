for policy-makers to ensure the legitimacy of their decisions. While interest groups are often involved in policy-making in both national and international governance, it is contested whether they strengthen or weaken its legitimacy. On the one hand, consultation of interest groups may lead to more inclusive, more legitimate and \u2018better\u2019 policy. On the other hand, interest groups might push policy-makers to pursue narrow interests and, thereby, exacerbate public discontent with political decisions. In order to systematically assess how interest group involvement affects the legitimacy of governance, we conduct survey experiments among representative samples of citizens in the UK, the US, Germany and Denmark using a conjoint design with vignettes describing hypothetical policy decisions. We are interested in exploring the role of three factors which might affect both the substantive and procedural legitimacy of specific political decisions: (a) to what extent different types of interest groups were involved in the policy- making process; (b) the alignment of the adopted policies with the preferences of interest groups; and (c) whether these policies were in line with public opinion. We argue that interest group involvement may improve the legitimacy of policy-making in democratic politics depending on the policy preferences and configuration of active interests involved. Our study provides new insights on how citizens judge the potential trade-offs which decision-makers face in responding to citizen and interest group preferences. Moreover, it adds knowledge of how citizens assess the importance of ensuring diversity in the types of interest groups included in policy-making."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: Citizens\u2019 perceptions of legitimacy are higher when the key interest groups relevant to an issue are invited to submit oral evidence/contribute to a legislative hearing than when they are H2: Citizens\u2019 perceptions of legitimacy are higher when equal numbers of groups representing special and diffuse interests are involved in the policy-making process as compared to having groups representing one of the two types of interest dominate. H2a: Having groups representing special interests dominate has a stronger negative effect on perceived legitimacy than having groups representing diffuse interests dominate. H2b: The negative effect on perceived legitimacy of one interest group type dominating participation is stronger when the policy output goes against the opinion of the group type that is in the minority or not represented. H3: Perceived legitimacy is higher when the public supports the policy and the stronger public support for the policy.

We conduct two separate experiments with different policy issues within one survey in order to increase our confidence that the findings are generalizable to different policy areas. The issues are presented to respondents in a randomized order. In each of the two experiments, respondents will be presented with a short text explaining a new policy that has been debated and either passed or rejected by parliament. In the description, two different types of interest groups are identified as the main stakeholders on the policy issue. It is also stated whether these two types of interests were invited to participate in a consultation process and what decision the decision-makers took. Finally, respondents are told whether the decision was in line with public opinion and with the position of the two types of interest groups. The survey will be fielded among representative samples of the population in Denmark, Germany, the UK, and the US (N=3,000 per country).

While interest groups are often involved in policy-making in both national and international governance, it is contested whether they strengthen or weaken its legitimacy. On the one hand, consultation of interest groups may lead to more inclusive, more legitimate and \u2018better\u2019 policy. On the other hand, interest groups might push policy-makers to pursue narrow interests and, thereby, exacerbate public discontent with political decisions. In order to systematically assess how interest group involvement affects the legitimacy of governance, we conduct survey experiments among representative samples of citizens in the UK, the US, Germany and Denmark using a conjoint design with vignettes describing hypothetical policy decisions. We are interested in exploring the role of three factors which might affect both the substantive and procedural legitimacy of specific political decisions: (a) to what extent different types of interest groups were involved in the policy- making process; (b) the alignment of the adopted policies with the preferences of interest groups; and (c) whether these policies were in line with public opinion. We argue that interest group involvement may improve the legitimacy of policy-making in democratic politics depending on the policy preferences and configuration of active interests involved. Our study provides new insights on how citizens judge the potential trade-offs which decision-makers face in responding to citizen and interest group preferences. Moreover, it adds knowledge of how citizens assess the importance of ensuring diversity in the types of interest groups included in policy-making.", "q16": "H1: Citizens\u2019 perceptions of legitimacy are higher when the key interest groups relevant to an issue are invited to submit oral evidence/contribute to a legislative hearing than when they are H2: Citizens\u2019 perceptions of legitimacy are higher when equal numbers of groups representing special and diffuse interests are involved in the policy-making process as compared to having groups representing one of the two types of interest dominate. H2a: Having groups representing special interests dominate has a stronger negative effect on perceived legitimacy than having groups representing diffuse interests dominate. H2b: The negative effect on perceived legitimacy of one interest group type dominating participation is stronger when the policy output goes against the opinion of the group type that is in the minority or not represented. H3: Perceived legitimacy is higher when the public supports the policy and the stronger public support for the policy. H3a: The negative effect on perceived legitimacy of not inviting key stakeholder groups to provide oral evidence is weaker the stronger public support for a policy decision. H3b: The negative effect on perceived legitimacy of one interest group type dominating participation is weaker the stronger public support for a policy decision.

We conduct two separate experiments with different policy issues within one survey in order to increase our confidence that the findings are generalizable to different policy areas. The issues are presented to respondents in a randomized order. In each of the two experiments, respondents will be presented with a short text explaining a new policy that has been debated and either passed or rejected by parliament. In the description, two different types of interest groups are identified as the main stakeholders on the policy issue. It is also stated whether these two types of interests were invited to participate in a consultation process and what decision the decision-makers took. Finally, respondents are told whether the decision was in line with public opinion and with the position of the two types of interest groups.

This project investigates how de-facto and perceived security provision affects perceptions of the legitimacy of governance actors. In particular, our research seeks to answer two questions: What are the sources of legitimacy in areas of limited statehood? What is the relationship between perceptions of security and legitimacy? We articulate a set of hypotheses about the sources of legitimacy and test them with a survey implemented in Liberia. The study will build on previous research and existing theories about the sources of legitimacy. The project focuses on output-based theories of legitimacy and the extent to which effective governance allow authorities to build perceptions of legitimacy among local populations. Specifically, the project investigates the degree to which perceptions of physical security within local populations can function as a source of legitimacy, since security perceptions are an essential part of effective governance. Moreover, the project will also consider alternative sources of legitimacy such as procedural justice or democratic input-mechanisms. Thereby, the study contributes to the debate about which sources of legitimacy are most relevant and allows for comparisons between varying sources. The project takes the legitimacy of state institutions on different levels in to account (local vs. county-level), but also the legitimacy of UNMIL troops as external actors. Therefore, comparisons between different actors and institutions will be possible.

Our collaborators at Orange Door Research partnered with a firm called GeoPoll, which has a large sample of Liberian phone numbers, which we used to conduct the nationally representative SMS surveys. GeoPoll has established a partnership with Liberian TelCos, which enables GeoPoll to randomly sample from a full mobile subscriber database of network providers, including the ability to draw random, pre-stratified samples for specific sub-national geographic areas. For this project, and under guidance and supervision from Orange Door Research, GeoPoll randomly sampled respondents from its subscriber database according to the geographic specification provided by Orange Door Research. We use county-specific questions in the survey itself to validate the location of each respondent. This is an opt-in survey. Respondents are sent the first initial invitation (consent message) at an agreed upon time. After this first message, sample members that are unresponsive are resent the invitation message once every 24 hours as long as the survey is open or an agreed amount of days after the initial message. Sample members that move past the consent message are sent a reminder message to complete the survey once every 24 hours until they complete the survey. Upon successful completion of the survey, each respondent receives the local equivalent of $0.50 in airtime top-up credit. In order to include individual as well as county-level covariates, we will employ multilevel models to include in our regression. Our primary outcome measures are three sets of questions that asked respondents to say how much they trusted they had in each type of authority (county, community, UNMIL). We will create two variables from the survey to use as a dependent variable: (1) a binary indicator for whether respondents said they had much trust in an authority and (2) an ordinal variable ranging from 0-3 that covers the full range of responses possible. We will use primarily logit models to assess the relationship between our explanatory variables and the binary indicator. From these results, we will derive predicted probabilities for ease of interpretation. We will also conduct ordered logit regression for robustness.

This project investigates how de-facto and perceived security provision affects perceptions of the legitimacy of governance actors. In particular, our research seeks to answer two questions: What are the sources of legitimacy in areas of limited statehood? What is the relationship between perceptions of security and legitimacy? We articulate a set of hypotheses about the sources of legitimacy and test them with a survey implemented in Liberia. The study will build on previous research and existing theories about the sources of legitimacy. The project focuses on output-based theories of legitimacy and the extent to which effective governance allow authorities to build perceptions of legitimacy among local populations. Specifically, the project investigates the degree to which perceptions of physical security within local populations can function as a source of legitimacy, since security perceptions are an essential part of effective governance. Moreover, the project will also consider alternative sources of legitimacy such as procedural justice or democratic input-mechanisms. Thereby, the study contributes to the debate about which sources of legitimacy are most relevant and allows for comparisons between varying sources. The project takes the legitimacy of state institutions on different levels in to account (local vs. county-level), but also the legitimacy of UNMIL troops as external actors. Therefore, comparisons between different actors and institutions will be possible. We selected Liberia because the state\u2019s limitations in Liberia make it possible for us to generalize our findings to other settings with limited statehood.", "q16": "H1a: Individual perceptions of procedural justice are positively associated with the likelihood that citizens perceive county-level state institutions as legitimate.

Our collaborators at Orange Door Research partnered with a firm called GeoPoll, which has a large sample of Liberian phone numbers, which we used to conduct the nationally representative SMS surveys. GeoPoll has established a partnership with Liberian TelCos, which enables GeoPoll to randomly sample from a full mobile subscriber database of network providers, including the ability to draw random, pre-stratified samples for specific sub-national geographic areas. For this project, and under guidance and supervision from Orange Door Research, GeoPoll randomly sampled respondents from its subscriber database according to the geographic specification provided by Orange Door Research. We use county-specific questions in the survey itself to validate the location of each respondent. This is an opt-in survey. Respondents are sent the first initial invitation (consent message) at an agreed upon time. After this first message, sample members that are unresponsive are resent the invitation message once every 24 hours as long as the survey is open or an agreed amount of days after the initial message. Sample members that move past the consent message are sent a reminder message to complete the survey once every 24 hours until they complete the survey. Upon successful completion of the survey, each respondent receives the local equivalent of $0.50 in airtime top-up credit. In order to include individual as well as county-level covariates, we will employ multilevel models to include in our regression. Our primary outcome measures are three sets of questions that asked respondents to say how much they trusted they had in each type of authority (county, community, UNMIL). We will create two variables from the survey to use as a dependent variable: (1) a binary indicator for whether respondents said they had much trust in an authority and (2) an ordinal variable ranging from 0-3 that covers the full range of responses possible. We will use primarily logit models to assess the relationship between our explanatory variables and the binary indicator. From these results, we will derive predicted probabilities for ease of interpretation. We will also conduct ordered logit regression for robustness. As the number of second level units (counties) is rather low, we will focus on robust and rather conservative models such as random intercept models with a limited number of county-level variables included.

Identities in the mixed blocks were paired based on general similarity of appearance (e.g., hair colour, age). ", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Rating scores:\nParticipants rated each image on a given trait (trustworthiness, dominance, or attractiveness) with ratings ranging from 1 (not at all) to 9 (very). For example, a face was presented, and participants were asked \u201chow trustworthy is this person?\u201d. We will use these ratings to create variability scores for each image (see Indices section). \n\nImplicit person theory scale:\nChiu, Hong, and Dweck\u2019s (1997) implicit person theory scale measures beliefs regarding the extent to which personal attributes, as a whole, are malleable (incremental theorists) as opposed to fixed (entity theorists). The eight items from their scale are rated on a 6-point scale ranging from 1 (very strongly disagree) to 6 (very strongly agree), with higher scores reflecting an entity view of personality and lower scores consistent with an incremental theory of personality. Each of the items are listed below: \n1.\tThe kind of person someone is, is something very basic about them and it can\u2019t be changed very much.\n2.\tPeople can do things differently, but the important parts of who they are can\u2019t really be changed.\n3.\tEveryone, no matter who they are, can significantly change their basic characteristics.\n4.\tAs much as I hate to admit it, you can\u2019t teach an old dog new tricks. People can\u2019t really change their deepest attributes.\n5.\tPeople can always substantially change the kind of person they are.\n6.\tEveryone is a certain kind of person, and there is not much that can be done to really change that.\n7.\tNo matter what kind of person someone is, they can always change very much.\n8.\tAll people can change even their most basic qualities.\n\nStability of traits scale:\nThe stability of traits scale is an adaption of Chiu et al\u2019s. (1997) scale which will be used to target to the specific traits of interest for this study. People might not hold the same beliefs for different personality traits. The nine-item questionnaire is rated on a 6-point scale ranging from 1 (very strongly disagree) to 6 (very strongly agree), with higher scores reflecting an entity view of personality and lower scores consistent with an incremental theory of personality. Each of the items are listed below:\n\n1.\tA person\u2019s trustworthiness will remain relatively the same from one situation to the next. \n2.\tA person\u2019s trustworthiness will differ depending on the context \n3.\tTrustworthiness is relatively fixed and tends not to change\n4.\tA person\u2019s dominance will remain relatively the same from one situation to the next. \n5.\tA person\u2019s dominance will differ depending on the context \n6.\tDominance is relatively fixed and tends not to change.\n7.\tA person\u2019s attractiveness will remain relatively the same from one situation to the next. \n8.\tA person\u2019s attractiveness will differ depending on the context \n9.\tAttractiveness is relatively fixed and tends not to change\n\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "Variability scores:\nThese scores will allow us to assess the extent to which image ratings vary across different traits and image sets. For each identity, we will subtract each participant\u2019s rating score of each image from the participants\u2019 mean score of that identity. We will use the absolute value of these scores because we are only interested in the extent of the variation, not the direction. For example, if a participant gave a rating of 5 for an image and their mean rating score for the identity of that image was 3, the image would have a variability score of 2. As such, for each identity, every participant will have a variability score for each image, which will reflect the degree that image\u2019s rating differs from the mean of the identity. \n\nQuestionnaires:\nBoth the implicit person theory scale and the stability of traits scale will be computed into composite scores for each participant. The implicit person theory scale items which were reverse coded will be converted (e.g., a score of 1 will be coded as 6). The item scores will then be aggregated and then divided by 8 to produce a mean composite score for each participant. The stability of traits scale will also be computed in the same manner. However, a composite score will also be calculated separately for each of the three facets (each of the trait dimensions) in addition to the entire scale. \n", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "\nWe will primarily analyse the data using Rstudio (R core team, 2019). We will employ linear mixed effects models to investigate hypotheses 1 and 2 using the \u2018lme4\u2019 package (Bates, Maechler, Bolker &amp; Walker, 2015). \n\nParticipants are nested in traits as they were randomly allocated to rate images on only one trait. Additionally, images are nested within identities because each identity consists of 20 images. Trait type (trustworthiness, dominance, and attractiveness), image set type (same or mixed identity), image set number (1-11), and the stability of traits scale will be entered into the models as fixed effects. Participants will be entered as a random effect in all of the models. The dependent variable will be the computed variability scores. We will build the models in a stepwise fashion starting with the null model and adding different combinations of fixed effects for each subsequent model. We are particular interested in whether trait type, image set type, and the interaction of trait type and image set type significantly fit the data. \n\nA likelihood ratio test will be performed using analysis of variance to compare between the models. Models which are significant or have the lowest AIC values will be considered to best fit the data as this does not penalise model complexity to the same extent as BIC (Kuha, 2004). \n\n\nTo address hypothesis 3 (to compare variability in trait ratings between studies), a separate between-subjects analysis of variance will be performed to compare between study 1 and the current study. Only the images used in same identity image sets will be included in this analysis for consistency between the studies. We will test for a main effect of identity awareness (i.e., study 1 or the current study) to determine whether ratings will vary less when the identity of the images is known (current study) as opposed to unknown (study 1). We will also test for an interaction between identity awareness and the type of trait to assess whether being aware of an identity has a different effect across different traits. Following a significant main effect, planned comparisons will be performed within each trait across studies. \n\n\nPearson correlations will be conducted between the Chui et al\u2019s implicit person theory scale and our stability of personality scale (along with each of the facets) to establish validity. We expect moderate to strong positive correlations between the two scales and the facets of our scale and Chui et al\u2019s scale.
