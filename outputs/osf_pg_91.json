Indeed, smartphones as research tools in the field of psychology bear multiple significant advantages (see Miller, 2012; Raento, Oulasvirta, &amp; Eagle, 2009):\n\nSmartphones seem to be ideally suited as tools for Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM; Hektner, Schmidt, &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2007). Experience Sampling  is aiming at studying everyday psychological phenomena in naturalistic settings, asking participants about their momentary behaviour, thoughts, or emotions at various moments. While traditional methods rely on retrospective or generalized self-reports, ESM provides in-situ and in-vivo self-report data (Kahneman, Krueger, Schkade, Schwarz, &amp; Stone, 2004; Mehl &amp; Conner, 2012), thus phenomena are captured where and when they actually occur. Considering repeated measurements in the field, ESM is promising the advantage of enhancing or maximizing ecological validity. Due to their versatile properties, smartphones have eventually already replaced other devices in the ESM context. \n\nA distinctive characteristic of smartphones compared to other methods is that in most cases they are already owned and used by the respondents.

Smartphones, however, already fulfil a vast number of other functions apart from serving as survey tools (e.g., social interactions, information gathering). In the United States, users have on average 35 apps installed on their smartphone, using about one third of these on a daily basis . Pielot, Church, and de Oliveira (2014) found in their study that participants (N=15) received on average 65.3 notifications from different apps per day. Given this vast volume of notifications, smartphone users have to deal with every day, feelings of information overload and satiation seem plausible. Unlike with PDAs, smartphone notifications from several apps must compete for the attention of their users, the rising number of apps installed making it more difficult to distinguish between more or less important bings. Regarding this aspect, participant burden in smartphone-based studies might not be as low as it is believed to be.\n\nIt could be shown that notifications can induce negative affects to their recipients: Objective and subjective e-mail and social network (but not messenger) notification counts are positively correlated with negative emotions like the increased feelings of being overwhelmed, stressed, interrupted and annoyed (Pielot et al., 2014). Furthermore, when apps subjectively not perceived as useful continue sending notifications, users become annoyed and consider deleting them from their phones (Felt, Egelman, &amp; Wagner, 2012).\nWeber, Voit, Auda, Schneegass, and Henze (2018) allowed their participants (N=16) to explicitly \u201csnooze\u201d the notifications of all apps installed on their smartphones via NHistory, an app specifically developed for this purpose. Main motives for deferring notifications included avoidance of switching contexts, being unable (e.g., while driving), or not being in the mood to react to the prompts. \n\nIn the context of smartphone-based ESM studies, participants typically respond to 2\u201312 bings per day (see Reis &amp; Gable, 2000). In accordance to app notifications in general, frequent notifications of research apps evoke feelings of annoyance (Church &amp; de Oliveira, 2013; Klasnja, Harrison, LeGrand, LaMarca, Froehlich, &amp; Hudson, 2018; see also van Berkel, Ferreira, &amp; Kostakos, 2017).\n\nRecently, several smartphone-based ESM studies have been conducted measuring affect in different contexts, applying signal-contingent designs.

Indeed, smartphones as research tools in the field of psychology bear multiple significant advantages (see Miller, 2012; Raento, Oulasvirta, &amp; Eagle, 2009):\n\nSmartphones seem to be ideally suited as tools for Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM; Hektner, Schmidt, &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2007). Experience Sampling  is aiming at studying everyday psychological phenomena in naturalistic settings, asking participants about their momentary behaviour, thoughts, or emotions at various moments. While traditional methods rely on retrospective or generalized self-reports, ESM provides in-situ and in-vivo self-report data (Kahneman, Krueger, Schkade, Schwarz, &amp; Stone, 2004; Mehl &amp; Conner, 2012), thus phenomena are captured where and when they actually occur. Considering repeated measurements in the field, ESM is promising the advantage of enhancing or maximizing ecological validity. Due to their versatile properties, smartphones have eventually already replaced other devices in the ESM context. \n\nA distinctive characteristic of smartphones compared to other methods is that in most cases they are already owned and used by the respondents. What is an obvious benefit from an economic point of view, could at the same time raise concerns regarding the validity of the results:\n\nPaper-pencil- and PDA-based diaries are designed or programmed for one specific purpose, namely gathering data within the framework of a study. Smartphones, however, already fulfil a vast number of other functions apart from serving as survey tools (e.g., social interactions, information gathering). In the United States, users have on average 35 apps installed on their smartphone, using about one third of these on a daily basis . Pielot, Church, and de Oliveira (2014) found in their study that participants (N=15) received on average 65.3 notifications from different apps per day. Given this vast volume of notifications, smartphone users have to deal with every day, feelings of information overload and satiation seem plausible. Unlike with PDAs, smartphone notifications from several apps must compete for the attention of their users, the rising number of apps installed making it more difficult to distinguish between more or less important bings. Regarding this aspect, participant burden in smartphone-based studies might not be as low as it is believed to be.\n\nIt could be shown that notifications can induce negative affects to their recipients: Objective and subjective e-mail and social network (but not messenger) notification counts are positively correlated with negative emotions like the increased feelings of being overwhelmed, stressed, interrupted and annoyed (Pielot et al., 2014). Furthermore, when apps subjectively not perceived as useful continue sending notifications, users become annoyed and consider deleting them from their phones (Felt, Egelman, &amp; Wagner, 2012).\nWeber, Voit, Auda, Schneegass, and Henze (2018) allowed their participants (N=16) to explicitly \u201csnooze\u201d the notifications of all apps installed on their smartphones via NHistory, an app specifically developed for this purpose. Main motives for deferring notifications included avoidance of switching contexts, being unable (e.g., while driving), or not being in the mood to react to the prompts. \n\nIn the context of smartphone-based ESM studies, participants typically respond to 2\u201312 bings per day (see Reis &amp; Gable, 2000). In accordance to app notifications in general, frequent notifications of research apps evoke feelings of annoyance (Church &amp; de Oliveira, 2013; Klasnja, Harrison, LeGrand, LaMarca, Froehlich, &amp; Hudson, 2018; see also van Berkel, Ferreira, &amp; Kostakos, 2017).\n\nRecently, several smartphone-based ESM studies have been conducted measuring affect in different contexts, applying signal-contingent designs. The devices were either provided by the researcher (e.g., Bujarski, Roche, Sheets, Krull, Guzman, &amp; Ray, 2015; Timmons et al., 2017) or the respondents installed a research app on their proprietary smartphones (e.g., Stieger &amp; Lewetz, 2018; Wouters, Jacobs, Duif, Lechner, &amp; Thewissen, 2018). Therefore, the question arises whether the negative mood elicited by the notifications, spills over to the assessment of affect within the ESM design.", "q4": "When smartphone notifications themselves are evoking specific emotions, what implications can be deduced for signal-based measuring of the latter? Particularly, when measuring momentary affect like anger, is the data gained confounded by the affect caused merely by the beep itself? With the aim of \u201cregaining their freedom\u201d, do respondents also show reactance effects (e.g., higher missing)? \n\nIf beep-induced affect spills over to the measurement of affect in the ESM design, then we expect that participants using their standard notification sound (experimental group) should have higher activation, more negative feelings, and lower happiness scores than participants using the ESM software with our predefined neutral notification sound (control group).", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

studies have generated evidence that altruism is paternalistic, e.g. with respect to health (see e.g. Jacobsson et al. (2007)). It is possible that this paternalism occurs because givers believe that recipients are impatient or have present-biased preferences, such that they will not use monetary transfers in a way that is relatively beneficial with respect to their future selves. With such beliefs, it can be rational for givers to give gifts in-kind rather than monetary gifts, even in cases where the recipient has stated that he/she prefers money over the gift (but that he/she values the gift positively). \n\nI run a dictator game-inspired experiment with two treatment groups. In both groups, participants are asked to freely allocate a sum of SEK 1000 between themselves and an anonymous recipient. A transfer to the recipient can be monetary and/or as a gift card at a store specialized in healthy food (such as vegetables and fruit).

Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the groups. In both groups, participants are asked to freely allocate a sum of SEK 1000 (\u223c$100) between themselves and an anonymous recipient. The transfer to the recipient can be monetary and/or as a gift card at a store specialized in healthy food (such as vegetables and fruit). Any sum between 0-1000 can be allocated to each of the options, as long as the total sum is equivalent to 1000. Sums below 0 and sums higher than 1000 in any of the boxes lead to an error message. The recipient has stated that he/she prefers receiving money over such a gift card, but that he/she would accept the gift card. This information is presented to the giver before the allocation decision. \n\nThe difference between the treatment groups is the receiver and the information provided about his/her time preferences. In one group, givers face an allocation situation with a recipient who in a prestudy has been ranked to have a low willingness to give up something today in order to bene\ufb01t from that in the future (patience). In the other group, givers face an allocation situation with a recipient who has been ranked to have a high such patience. These treatments are presented in the following way: \n\n\"In a pre-study, real persons were tested and ranked on their willingness to give up something today in order to benefit from that in the future (their patience). \n \nIndividual A ranked in the lowest[/highest] 10 %, suggesting that he/she has a low[/high] patience.\"\n\nThe participants will be informed that two individuals who participate in the experiment will be randomly drawn to receive real-life payment in accordance with their answer. One participant from each treatment group will be drawn. \n\nRecipients were recruited in a pre-study. The participants of that pre-study were ranked on their patience according to the validated Time Discounting Preference Module: Streamlined Version (Falk et al., 2016).  \n\nThe experiment will be conducted as an online survey sent out to all students at the Stockholm School of Economics over e-mail. The used survey tool is Qualtrics, a tool that allows for automatic randomization into the two treatments. The students will not know that there is another treatment group than their own. The survey language will be English (SSE students are assumed to have a high enough English proficiency to understand the content).  \n\nAt the start of the survey, participants are informed about the payout incentive of the experiment, their anonymity towards other participants, that individual answers will not be looked at (except the submissions drawn for real-life payment) and that the answers will only be used for academic purposes.

In the first round, the survey will be open until February 12, 2020. During this period, I will not look at the data nor the number of participants. At February 12, 2020, I will check the number of participants. If this number meets the sample size target specified below, I will close the survey. If the number does not meet the target, I will re-send the link to students who have not participated and keep the survey open until February 19, 2020.

This is to prevent analyzing observations from participants that submit several answers using different e-mail addresses.

These variables can take any number between 0 and 1000. \n\n(There will also be a third variable generated, the amount of money that the giver allocates to him-/herself, but this is not used in the analysis.)\n\nThe dataset will allow to see which treatment the individual has faced, as the treatments are in practice programmed as two different questions (each participant faces only one of the questions). I code these treatments as t_high_patience_receiver and t_low_patience_receiver. \n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "Three measures will be created from the collected data.\n\nThe first measure is the total gift for each giver. The total gift is the sum of the monetary gift and the gift in the form of a gift card at a store specialized in healthy food (such as vegetables and fruit) of that giver. The variable name is total_gift, such that total_gift = monetary_gift + paternalistic_gift for each observation.\n\nThe second measure is the average total gift, per treatment group. Hence, two averages will be created: average_total_gift_t_high_patience_receiver and average_total_gift_t_low_patience_receiver. These are simply the group averages of the variable total_gift, calculated per treatment group. \n\nThe third measure is a normalization of the paternalistic gift, calculated on the individual level. This measure is constructed as the paternalistic gift of that individual divided by the average total gift level of the treatment group which that individual belongs to. The variable name is paternalistic_gift_normalized, such that paternalistic_gift_normalized = paternalistic_gift / average_total_gift_t_high_patience_receiver for individuals in the high patient treatment group and paternalistic_gift_normalized = paternalistic_gift / average_total_gift_t_low_patience_receiver for individuals in the low patient treatment group. \n\nThe rationale behind this construction is two-fold: First, only analyzing the paternalistic gift level between the two treatment groups could yield a skewed picture, as the total gift level between the groups could vary. Hence, only looking at the paternalistic gift level alone might not capture differences in the relative degree of paternalistic giving behavior. \n\nSecond, using the treatment group's average total gift rather than the individual's total gift level yields the benefit that the variable can be defined also for individuals whose total gift level is zero. Note that this relies on the assumption that the average total gift level is not zero in any of the treatment groups.

If feeling shamed is affected differently by the different conditions, then we will test it as a mediator, but if it is similarly affected by all three manipulations, or not affected at all by any of them, we will test shame as a moderator. We will also analyze some exploratory variables: symbolic threat, realistic threat and terroristic threat as potential dependent variables and mediators. \nOur potential moderators are: (1) Preference for Consistency and (2) Shame.\nOur potential mediators are: (1) Unfreezing, (2) Shame, (3) Symbolic Threat, (4) Realistic Threat and (5) Terroristic  Threat.\nIn exploratory analysis, we will examine whether participants\u2019 religion or political affiliation has any moderating effects on the effect of experimental condition on any of the DVs. Christian participants will be labelled as \u20181\u2019 and non-Christian participants will be labelled as \u20180\u2019. Democratic participants will be labeled as \u20181\u2019 and Republican participants will be labelled as \u20180\u2019.\n", "sample": "We will mirror our previous study and recruit 200 participants per condition. In our previous study, we conducted a power analysis that indicated 76 participants per group will be required to detect a medium effect (d= .5) with .95 power. Samples of 436 per condition would be required to detect a small effect size (d=.2). Balancing our desire to have high power to detect small effects with budgetary constraints, we will recruit at least 200 participants per condition. This allowed us to detect an effect size of d= .3 with .95 power. ", "analyses": "We will run one-way ANOVAs across all conditions and LSD post-hoc analysis, which will be followed-up by t-tests between each condition and the control, for each of the outcome measures.\nUsing Hayes\u2019s (2018) PROCESS macro for SPSS, we will test for mediation and moderation, as described above, with our potential mediators and moderators, i.e., unfreezing, preference for consistency, and feeling shamed. We will test the differences between the two versions of condition 3, the CBH activity followed by the CPH activity (version 1) and the CPH activity followed by the CBH activity (version 2). If there is no difference between the two versions, we will combine responses across these conditions and treat them as one condition.\n", "outliers": "Sample sizes will be pre-determined in Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk, and we will not examine the data until the full sample is collected. We will also exclude all participants who identify as Muslim and who fail an attention check question embedded in the survey.", "dependent": "We will measure all dependent variables using self-report questionnaires. Order of presentation of items on each scale, and the presentation order of each DV will be randomized across participants.\n\nThe dependent variables: \n(1) Collective blame will be assessed by a brief description of the Belgium terror attacks (\u201cIn March, 2016, three Muslim extremists killed 32 people and wounded over 300 at the Brussels airport in Belgium. How responsible do you think Muslims are for this attack?\u201d) and having participants report how responsible they feel \u201cMuslims in general\u201d and \u201cBelgium Muslims\u201d were for the attacks using unmarked sliders anchored at 0 (not at all) and 100 (very much) (Bruneau, Kteily, &amp; Falk, 2018).  We will use only the measure of \u201cMuslims in general\u201d as our measure of collective blame.\n(2) Blatant dehumanization will be assessed by two measures (presentation of each measure relative to the other will be randomized): the trait measure and Ascent Dehumanization scale (Kteily, Bruneau, Waytz, &amp; Cotterill, 2015). The trait measure asks participants how well a series of eight dehumanizing traits/trait pairs (e.g., \u201csavage,\u201d \u201cunsophisticated,\u201d \u201cbarbaric, coldhearted\u201d; Bastian &amp; Haslam, 2010; Kteily, Bruneau, Waytz, &amp; Cotterill, 2015) apply to Muslims, and how well they apply to Christians (order of presentation of each target group will be randomized across participants). The Ascent Dehumanization scale (Kteily et al., 2015) presents participants with the popular \u201cAscent of (Hu)Man\u201d diagram and asks them to determine where target groups fall on the scale, from the quadrupedal early human ancestor (0) to fully \u201cevolved\u201d modern human (100). We will assess \u2018ascent dehumanization\u2019 towards Muslims, Christians, and other filler groups (presentation order of all groups will be randomized across participants). Consistent with previous work, we will assess dehumanization as a difference score (here, between Muslims and Christians), and we will then standardize the ratings on each scale and average these two dehumanization measures to provide a single measure of dehumanization. \n(3) Anti-Muslim policy support will be assessed by asking participants to indicate their support for five policies targeting Muslims based on previous scales from Kteily and Bruneau (2017), Lee et. al., (2009), and Schildkraut (2009); sample items include \u201cWe need to stop accepting Muslim immigrants into this country, period\u201d and \u201cWe should institute a database that keeps track of Muslims in this country.\u201d Responses will be made on 7-point Likert-type scales anchored at 1 (strongly disagree) and 7 (strongly agree).\n\nExploratory dependent variables:\n(4) Symbolic Threat will be assessed by asking participants to indicate their agreement with 3 items suggesting Muslims are threating American beliefs or values based on Uenal (2016); sample items include \u201cI am worried that the American culture is endangered by Islam\u201d and \u201cI am worried that American rights and freedom are threatened by the presence of Muslims\u201d. Responses will be made on 7-point Likert-type scales anchored at 1 (strongly disagree) and 7 (strongly agree).\n(5) Realistic Threat will be assessed by asking participants to indicate their agreement with 4 items suggesting Muslims pose a danger to Americans\u2019 well-being based on Uenal (2016); sample items include \u201cThe presence of Islam in America threatens our economic prosperity\u201d and \u201cBecause of the presence of Islam, the education system in America is threatened\u201d. Responses will be made on 7-point Likert-type scales anchored at 1 (strongly disagree) and 7 (strongly agree).\n(6) Terroristic Threat will be assessed with using three items developed by Uenal (2016); sample item include \u201cI am worried that the peace is threatened by radical Islamist groups in the U.S.\u201d. Responses will be made on 7-point Likert-type scales anchored at 1 (strongly disagree) and 7 (strongly agree).\n\nModerator:\n(1) Preference for consistency (PFC) will be assessed by an abridged 6-item version of the preference for consistency (PFC) scale developed by Cialdini, Trost, and Newsom (1995). \n\nMediator:\n(1) Unfreezing will be assessed using 4items indicating the extent, from 0 (not at all) to 100 (very much so), to which the survey made them doubt notions of Muslims (i.e., \u201cMuslims hate many of the freedoms that we hold dear in the U.S.\u201d) as developed by Hameiri et. al., (2014).\n\nModerator or Mediator:\n(1) Shame will be assessed with one item, asking participants how proud versus how ashamed of their American identity they feel the people who created this survey want them to feel on a Likert-type scale anchored at 1 (proud) and (7) ashamed.\n", "conditions": "Participants will be randomly assigned to either one of the 3 experimental conditions or the control:\nThe first condition will be the CBH activity: four consecutive examples of Christian extremists engaging in violent actions, followed by three consecutive examples of Muslim extremists engaging in violent actions. After presenting the examples, participants will be asked to report how responsible they think Christians/Muslims are for the violent actions of a Christian extremist/Muslim extremist?\nThe second condition will be the CPH activity we found to be the most effective in a previous study: three consecutive examples of Muslim organizations engaging in prosocial behavior, followed by three consecutive examples of Christian organizations engaging in prosocial behavior. After presenting the examples, participants will be asked to report how well they think the actions of the Christian/Muslim group reflect on Christians/Muslims, in general. \nThe third condition will combine the two interventions: displaying of either the CBH activity followed by the CPH activity or the CPH activity followed by the CBH activity.  \nThe last condition will be a control group, in which none of the events will be presented, and participants will be sent instead straight to the survey. In all 3 experimental conditions, participants will be sent to the survey immediately after evaluating the events.\nWe speculate condition one (CBH manipulation) will be more effective than condition 2 (CPH manipulation) in reducing anti-Muslim attitudes and behaviors. We do not have a clear prediction of how effective condition 3 (combined CBH and CPH) will be compared to the other two experimental conditions. \n", "hypothesis": "In previous work, we used a novel hypocrisy paradigm - reminiscent of cognitive dissonance induction paradigms - to reduce anti-Muslim attitudes and behavior. In the Collective Blame Hypocrisy activity (CBH; Bruneau, Kteily, &amp; Falk, 2018), non-Muslim participants are asked to report how responsible Muslims are for the actions of Muslim extremists after first reporting how responsible they hold themselves, White Americans/Christians for the actions of White/Christian extremists. We will run the CBH activity as in (Bruneau, Kteily, &amp; Falk, 2018); however, instead of providing examples of White extremists and asking participants to report responsibility of White Americans, we will provide examples of Christian extremist violence and ask participants to report responsibility of Christians. This will provide better parity with the Collective Praise Hypocrisy activity, which focuses on Muslims and Christians.\nIn a previous study, we explored the effects of a novel hypocrisy paradigm in building parity between the prosocial actions by groups of Muslims versus groups of Christians. In the CPH activity, non-Muslim participants are asked to report how well they think benevolent actions of Christian groups should reflect on Christians, in general after first reporting how well they think benevolent actions of Muslim groups should reflect on Muslims, in general.\nThe present study will combine and compare the CBH activity and the CPH activity to determine the effectiveness of each at reducing anti-Muslim attitudes and behavior, and if their effects are additive. We will also attempt to uncover the psychological mechanisms underlying the effects of each intervention. \nIrrespective of the mechanism, we predict that these interventions will improve evaluations of Muslims by reducing dehumanization of Muslims. We also predict that the CBH activity will reduce collective blame of Muslims (the target perceptions of the intervention); and we will determine if CPH also reduces collective blame of Muslims. The other two outcomes we will assess are and (3) anti-Muslim policy support. We predict that both of these outcomes will be reduced by the interventions.

Such health campaigns have been carried out in the U.S., Canada, and the UK, and targeted a number of risky and health behaviors, such as drug use, alcohol consumption, and tobacco use (e.g. Arbour-Nicitopoulos, Kwan, Lowe, Taman, &amp; Faulkner, 2010; Cislaghi &amp; Heise, 2018; Donaldson et al., 1994; Larimer &amp; Neighbors, 2003; Liu &amp; Shi, 2019; Neighbors et al., 2004).

See below for descriptions of DVs and covariates used for secondary analyses. \n\nAnalyses 1 - 4 are related message level ratings other than social relevance and favorability. Based on pilot data, descriptive norm condition (relative to message control condition) had a smaller effect on these message ratings (self relevance, self motivation, other motivation, and sharing intention). As such, we propose these analyses in the secondary section. These analyses will be conducted in participants in descriptive norm and in message control condition, at participant x message level. \n\n1. Investigate the effect of descriptive norm condition on  intentions. This effect will be tested using a multilevel mixed effects model specified as below:\nmd = lmer(message favorability ~ condition + age + (1|participant ID) + (1|message ID))\n\n2. Investigate the effect of descriptive norm condition on  intentions.

In our pilot data, participants\u2019 behavioral intentions and belief were already high, and there was a ceiling effect in the extent that norm conditions can shift participants in these two areas, hence we frame them as secondary analyses. With regards to perceived norms of close friends and family, we expect that participants will base their norm perceptions of close friends and family on social interactions and daily communications, and thus we were uncertain whether descriptive norm manipulation can successfully shift people\u2019s perception in this area. These analyses will be conducted in participants in descriptive norm and in message control condition. \n\n5. Investigate the effect of descriptive norm condition on participant's social distancing intentions. This effect will be tested using a linear regression model specified as below:\nmd = lm(social distancing intentions ~ condition + age)\n\n6. Investigate the effect of condition on participant's COVID-19 beliefs. We will separately investigate the effect of condition on participants\u2019 social distancing self beliefs, social distancing other beliefs, and social distancing norm beliefs (described below).

All our descriptive norm messages were written using one of the following three pronouns: \u201cI\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cmost people\u201d. For instance:\n\u201cI\u201d message: Social distancing is critical for reducing exposure to #covid19.  I am staying home to stop hundreds of others from being infected.\n\u201cWe\u201d message: Social distancing is critical for reducing exposure to #covid19.  We are staying home to stop hundreds of others from being infected.\n\u201cMost people\u201d message: Social distancing is critical for reducing exposure to #covid19.  Most people are staying home to stop hundreds of others from being infected.\n\nWe will investigate if different wording of descriptive norm messages (using either \u201cI\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, or \u201cmost people\u201d) has an effect on participants\u2019 ratings on message favorability, motivation, and relevance, compared to the control condition. This analysis will be conducted in participants in the descriptive norm and message control conditions, and this will be tested using multilevel models specified as below:\n\nlmer(self motivation ~ message type +  age + (1 | participant) + (1 | message))\nlmer(other motivation ~ message type +  age + (1 | participant) + (1 | message))\nlmer(self relevance ~ message type +  age + (1 | participant) + (1 | message))\nlmer(social relevance   ~ message type +  age + (1 | participant) + (1 | message))\nlmer(message favorability ~ message type +  age + (1 | participant) + (1 | message))\nlmer(sharing intention ~ message type +  age + (1 | participant) + (1 | message))\n\nWe will also explore how covariates (e.g. gender, interdependence self-construal, independence self-construal, SES, political orientation and partisanship etc.) affect the primary analyses. To do so, we will use specification curve analysis to assess the robustness of exploratory effects across different model specifications.

See below for descriptions of DVs and covariates used for secondary analyses. \n\nAnalyses 1 - 4 are related message level ratings other than social relevance and favorability. Based on pilot data, descriptive norm condition (relative to message control condition) had a smaller effect on these message ratings (self relevance, self motivation, other motivation, and sharing intention). As such, we propose these analyses in the secondary section. These analyses will be conducted in participants in descriptive norm and in message control condition, at participant x message level. \n\n1. Investigate the effect of descriptive norm condition on  intentions. This effect will be tested using a multilevel mixed effects model specified as below:\nmd = lmer(message favorability ~ condition + age + (1|participant ID) + (1|message ID))\n\n2.

In our pilot data, participants\u2019 behavioral intentions and belief were already high, and there was a ceiling effect in the extent that norm conditions can shift participants in these two areas, hence we frame them as secondary analyses. With regards to perceived norms of close friends and family, we expect that participants will base their norm perceptions of close friends and family on social interactions and daily communications, and thus we were uncertain whether descriptive norm manipulation can successfully shift people\u2019s perception in this area. These analyses will be conducted in participants in descriptive norm and in message control condition. \n\n5. Investigate the effect of descriptive norm condition on participant's social distancing intentions. This effect will be tested using a linear regression model specified as below:\nmd = lm(social distancing intentions ~ condition + age)\n\n6. Investigate the effect of condition on participant's COVID-19 beliefs. We will separately investigate the effect of condition on participants\u2019 social distancing self beliefs, social distancing other beliefs, and social distancing norm beliefs (described below).

All our descriptive norm messages were written using one of the following three pronouns: \u201cI\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cmost people\u201d. For instance:\n\u201cI\u201d message: Social distancing is critical for reducing exposure to #covid19.  I am staying home to stop hundreds of others from being infected.\n\u201cWe\u201d message: Social distancing is critical for reducing exposure to #covid19.  We are staying home to stop hundreds of others from being infected.\n\u201cMost people\u201d message: Social distancing is critical for reducing exposure to #covid19.  Most people are staying home to stop hundreds of others from being infected.\n\nWe will investigate if different wording of descriptive norm messages (using either \u201cI\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, or \u201cmost people\u201d) has an effect on participants\u2019 ratings on message favorability, motivation, and relevance, compared to the control condition. This analysis will be conducted in participants in the descriptive norm and message control conditions, and this will be tested using multilevel models specified as below:\n\nlmer(self motivation ~ message type +  age + (1 | participant) + (1 | message))\nlmer(other motivation ~ message type +  age + (1 | participant) + (1 | message))\nlmer(self relevance ~ message type +  age + (1 | participant) + (1 | message))\nlmer(social relevance   ~ message type +  age + (1 | participant) + (1 | message))\nlmer(message favorability ~ message type +  age + (1 | participant) + (1 | message))\nlmer(sharing intention ~ message type +  age + (1 | participant) + (1 | message))\n\nWe will also explore how covariates (e.g. gender, interdependence self-construal, independence self-construal, SES, political orientation and partisanship etc.) affect the primary analyses.

solving", "description": "While misinformation has been a feature of human experience for as long as people could formulate arguments, the rise of the internet and social media\nhas created conditions in which individuals or groups can create fake news capable of reaching millions of people in short order. Fast circulation of fake news has become particularly pernicious during the state of social panic created by the COVID-19 pandemic, where people are forced to make fast decisions and solve problems in a very short time. In this study we aim to understand how fear and the feeling of panic modulate believing in fake news, and investigate what reasoning abilities (specifically insight problem solving) might diminish\nsusceptibility to believing in misinformation. Previous research from our group has shown that performance of insight problem solving predicts differences in susceptibility to fake news, bullshit receptivity, and overclaiming.

How can we harness the collective (\u201cwe\u201d) instead of the individual (\u201cI\u201d), in curbing its spread? As the pandemic unfolds, some people might mitigate the negative situation by cooperating by default (Drury, Cocking &amp; Reicher, 2009). However, others might be more inclined to act in a more individualistic way (e.g., panic buying) instead of more collectively (e.g., buying enough for themselves and preserving more for others). In the current pandemic, the general advice is that people need to (1) act not only to protect themselves, but also the most vulnerable and (2) do something counterintuitive: protect the more vulnerable by increasing the physical distance to them, when in fact decreasing social distance is a natural tendency in cooperation (Klein, 2020). How can we overcome the \u2018individualistic\u2019 impulse and adopt counter-intuitive behaviour? In three studies, we will test three methods that can improve the public\u2019s response to the current pandemic, based on social identity theories and individual differences that tell us who is more and less likely to follow recommendations (e.g., trust, political ideology, conspiracy mentality, individualism, susceptibility to the virus).", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "",
