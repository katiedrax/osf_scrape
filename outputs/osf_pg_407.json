Thus, each participant can make a maximum of 10 selections. -For testing our selective exposure hypotheses, we will code source partisanship as follows: *pro-Republican: Fox News, Breitbart *pro-Democratic: MSNBC, Huffington Post *neutral/non-partisan: Associated Press, Newsday -Note that we also include the New York Times and Wall Street Journal as sources. While these sources have ideological reputations, they are arguably less overtly partisan than the other sources we use. Thus, we do not consider the New York Times or Wall Street Journal in our main analyses. We may report additional results using these two sources in an appendix to assess robustness. -For testing the fact-checker hypotheses, we will merge all star-level ratings into a single category (e.g., 1 star ratings from PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, and WashingtonPost Fact-Checker will be treated as a single attribute). We may report additional results treating ratings from different fact-checkers as separate attributes in an appendix to assess robustness. Statistical analyses We will use the \u201ccjoint\u201d package (Strezhnev et al. 2016) in R to estimate Average Marginal Component Effects and Average Component Interaction Effects. See Hainmueller et al. 2013 for a discussion of these two estimands. H1a: Participants will be more likely to select articles that fact-checkers have found to be accurate compared to articles that have not been fact-checked. H1b: Participants will be less likely to select articles that fact-checkers have found to be inaccurate compared to articles that have not been fact-checked. We will estimate AMCEs for all 5 levels of fact-checker rating (no fact-check information will be the omitted baseline group). H2: Partisans will be more (less) likely to select articles from co-partisan (out-partisan) sources compared to non-partisan sources. As discussed above, we will code news sources as pro-Democratic, pro-Republican, or non-partisan. We will then use participants\u2019 self-reported partisanship to recode each source as co-partisan, out-partisan, or neutral (leaners will be treated as partisans and pure independents will be excluded from this test). We will estimate AMCEs for co-partisan and out-partisan source (neutral will be the omitted baseline). H3: Negative fact-checker ratings will decrease partisan selective exposure. We will interact the two attributes of interest\u2014partisanship of source and fact-checker rating\u2014and report ACIEs. RQ1: Are strong partisans more likely to engage in partisan selective exposure (compared to weak partisans and independent leaners)? We will re-run the test of H2 on the subsample of strong partisans and report whether the AMCE associated with source is larger for strong partisans compared to weak partisans. RQ2: Are participants who are high in political knowledge and political interest more likely to engage in partisan selective exposure (compared to participants low in knowledge and interest, respectively)? We will re-run the test of H2 on the subsample of high knowledge participants and report whether the AMCE associated with source is larger for high knowledge participants compared to low knowledge participants. Similarly, we will re-run the test of H2 on the subsample of highly politically interested participants and report whether the AMCE associated with source is larger for high interest participants compared to low interest participants. (For both knowledge and interest, we will divide the sample into high and low by dichotomizing at the empirical median.) Notes: -We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models, including AMCEs and ACIEs by subgroups. -\u201dDon\u2019t know\u201d responses will be considered as missing data. -We will also compute and report summary statistics for our sample. We will also collect and may report response timing data as a proxy for respondent attention. -The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity. -We reserve the right to present our results graphically and report AMCEs and ACIEs in an appendix.", "q18": "United States of America", "q19": "1,700", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "",
