Recent developments in priming have suggested that pragmatic representations are involved in inferencing and these representations include alternatives. Building on the current work on pragmatic priming, three priming experiments are proposed to test whether children\u2019s improvement in inferencing is related to pragmatic representations. \n\nExperiment 1 will use quantifiers, Experiment 2 will use numbers, and Experiment 3 will investigate cross expression priming between numbers and quantifiers."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "If there are pragmatic representations that can be activated (and deactivated) then it would be expected that inference derivation can be manipulated within the same overall context.

In trials that raise the salience of the alternative then it is expected that this will also prime inference derivation. However, if there are not specific pragmatic representations then it is expected that there will be no difference in inference derivation regardless of the trial types.

How does the alternative help children to derive the inference? This paper investigates how children make use of alternatives to derive quantity inferences. Recent developments in priming have suggested that pragmatic representations are involved in inferencing and these representations include alternatives. Building on the current work on pragmatic priming, three priming experiments are proposed to test whether children\u2019s improvement in inferencing is related to pragmatic representations. \n\nExperiment 1 will use quantifiers, Experiment 2 will use numbers, and Experiment 3 will investigate cross expression priming between numbers and quantifiers.", "q4": "If there are pragmatic representations that can be activated (and deactivated) then it would be expected that inference derivation can be manipulated within the same overall context.

Following trials in which inferences are derived participants should be more likely to subsequently derive an inference whereas there should be no such increase in trials requiring no inference. In trials that raise the salience of the alternative then it is expected that this will also prime inference derivation. However, if there are not specific pragmatic representations then it is expected that there will be no difference in inference derivation regardless of the trial types.

their associated counter-norms) like communality (vs. secrecy), disinterestedness (vs. self-interestedness), universalism (vs. particularism), and organized skepticism (vs. organized dogmatism) (Merton, 1973; Mitroff, 1974) are widely considered important in promoting Responsible Research Practices (RRPs) that help create trustworthy research. An earlier survey has shown that US-based scientists overwhelmingly subscribe more to the good norms of science as opposed to the associated counter-norms (Anderson et al., 2007), but also that the majority of researchers indicated that their typical academic peer does not always behave according to those norms. Such deviations from RRPs might lower the trustworthiness of research findings. In the current survey involving Dutch academics in the four disciplinary fields of science, we study whether researcher\u2019s own norm subscriptions, their assessments of the normative behavior of their academic peers, competitiveness of the scientific field, and open science practices predict researchers\u2019 trust in the published findings in their field. \n\nThe current study is part of a larger project entitled \u201cThe National Survey on Research Integrity\u201d (www.nsri2020.nl). The National Survey on Research Integrity is a globally unique endeavor in which the Dutch scientific community will take the lead in acquiring the necessary solid empirical basis for building strategies to reduce Questionable Research Practices (QRPs) and thereby foster RRPs in the Netherlands and beyond. In this pilot study, we will administer an anonymous survey with newly developed and adapted (existing) scales that are meant to explain researchers\u2019 engagement in RRPs or QRPs in the ultimate larger survey. This pilot will be used to validate these scales and check their psychometric properties. \n\nThe current survey will not ask about any particular engagement of QRPs by the respondents, but rather focuses on what predicts respondents\u2019 trust in published findings in their disciplinary field. We expect that the degree to which respondents subscribe to the norms of good science will be associated with their own open science practices. We also expect, based on earlier work (Anderson et al., 2007) and the notion that norms are ultimately social constructions, that a researcher\u2019s own norm subscription is associated with norm-abiding behaviors of the researchers working in their academic field (i.e., their academic peers). Even though responsible conduct of research goes well beyond open science practices, and might differ across scientific fields because of diverging research methods (e.g., openly sharing of computer codes does not apply to studies lacking in statistical analyses such as case studies or other qualitative type research), we consider open science practices as one transparent way to practice the good norms of science. Norm-abiding behaviors by researchers in scientific fields might be evidenced by a higher prevalence of open science practices that might, in turn, breed trust in published findings. \nAt the same time, more competitive disciplinary fields might exhibit fewer normative behaviors overall, because of the pressures on researchers to become more focused on career-promoting behaviors rather than on behaviors that align with the good norms of science, such as openly sharing findings and the motivation driven by the desire for knowledge and discovery (disinterestedness; Merton, 1973). Hence, we expect competitiveness of the scientific field to be negatively associated with normative behavior (Anderson et al., 2007), which might, in turn, be reflected by fewer open science practices and lower trust in scientific findings. \nTo measure open science practices, we ask respondents how often they themselves and how commonly those in their disciplinary field: (1) share their data, (2) share code or computer syntaxes, (3) share materials/reagents/equipment, (4) publish under open access, and (5) openly register or publish protocols or research plans. Here we will allow respondents to indicate whether these practices would not be applicable to their research (e.g. because no empirical data are collected). We expect respondents\u2019 assessment of the competitiveness of their field, the normative behaviors of their academic peers, and open science practices in their field to predict respondents\u2019 trust in published findings in their field. This trust is measured by asking responding researchers to indicate the percentage of published findings in their field that are reproducible, replicable, and generalizable (National Academies of Sciences &amp; Medicine, 2019), while again allowing respondents to indicate if these concepts fail to apply to the methodologies used in their field.\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "We seek to test the following hypotheses:\n1.\tOwn norm subscription is positively associated with Peer\u2019s normative behavior and Own Open Science practices\n2.\tPeer\u2019s normative behavior is positively associated with Open Science practices in the disciplinary field and Trust in published findings\n3.\tCompetitiveness of the field is negatively associated with Own Open Science practices, Field Open Science practices, Trust in published findings, and Peer\u2019s normative behavior\n4.\tField Open Science practices are positively associated with Trust in published findings.\n\nThese hypotheses are summarized in Table 1.

The power analyses below focuses on obtaining sufficient power to detect bivariate correlations as indicated in Table 1 above and the Structural Equation Model (SEM) analyses that we discuss below. We use a nominal alpha level of .05, two-tailed tests, and aim to obtain a power of at least .85 within the four disciplinary fields. Expected correlations are based on earlier findings by Anderson et al. (2007) among over 3000 US-based researchers. Relevant to the first part of hypothesis 1, Anderson et al. found correlations varying from .08 to .19 (mean r = .16) between own norm subscription and peer\u2019s normative behavior. Similarly, Anderson et al. found competitiveness to correlate between -.30 and .00 with peer\u2019s normative behavior (mean r = -.18). We consider other relations to be at least as strong as these relations. Taking a two-tailed test for r = |.18|, we will obtain a power in excess of .85 within each disciplinary field if we sample 350 participants per disciplinary field (based on Fisher-transformed normality tests). Any test that combines the samples across fields will have higher power. Moreover, with this sample size (N=350 per field), an omnibus test for homogeneity across the four disciplinary fields will have a power in excess of .80 to uncover heterogeneity in a scenario in which two of the fields have a population correlation of zero and two other fields have a population correlation of r = |.18| (based on a non-central Chi-square test; Valentine et al., 2010).\n\nThe structural equation model in Figure 1 features 21 observed variables and 54 parameters (DF = 177).

Here, after reverse coding the contra-indicative items, we will delete items from each scale that show IRC values below .20 in two or more of the disciplinary fields. This heightens (overall) reliability of the scales. For the indices (Open Science practices and Trust in published findings), we will consider for each science domain how often respondents indicated that an item was not applicable to the work in their scientific field.

Both the open science practices and the four normative variables will be considered as an index (based on the unweighted mean over the open science practices and the four Mertonian norms) in this analysis. We will first assess with a chi-square homogeneity test (against Alpha = .05 and DF = 3) whether Fisher-transformed correlations differ across the four disciplinary fields. If we fail to reject homogeneity test, inference will be based on the standard normal test for the estimated mean Fisher-transformed correlation. If the homogeneity test is significant for a given correlation, we will use standard z- test for the correlations in each disciplinary field.\n\n12.3.\tStructural Equation Model\n\nWe will fit the following confirmatory structural equation model for the four disciplinary fields using Maximum Likelihood estimation (and the Satorra-Bentler correction to deal with any non-normality) in Lavaan (version 0.6) in the R environment.

An earlier survey has shown that US-based scientists overwhelmingly subscribe more to the good norms of science as opposed to the associated counter-norms (Anderson et al., 2007), but also that the majority of researchers indicated that their typical academic peer does not always behave according to those norms. Such deviations from RRPs might lower the trustworthiness of research findings. In the current survey involving Dutch academics in the four disciplinary fields of science, we study whether researcher\u2019s own norm subscriptions, their assessments of the normative behavior of their academic peers, competitiveness of the scientific field, and open science practices predict researchers\u2019 trust in the published findings in their field. \n\nThe current study is part of a larger project entitled \u201cThe National Survey on Research Integrity\u201d (www.nsri2020.nl). The National Survey on Research Integrity is a globally unique endeavor in which the Dutch scientific community will take the lead in acquiring the necessary solid empirical basis for building strategies to reduce Questionable Research Practices (QRPs) and thereby foster RRPs in the Netherlands and beyond. In this pilot study, we will administer an anonymous survey with newly developed and adapted (existing) scales that are meant to explain researchers\u2019 engagement in RRPs or QRPs in the ultimate larger survey. This pilot will be used to validate these scales and check their psychometric properties. \n\nThe current survey will not ask about any particular engagement of QRPs by the respondents, but rather focuses on what predicts respondents\u2019 trust in published findings in their disciplinary field. We expect that the degree to which respondents subscribe to the norms of good science will be associated with their own open science practices. We also expect, based on earlier work (Anderson et al., 2007) and the notion that norms are ultimately social constructions, that a researcher\u2019s own norm subscription is associated with norm-abiding behaviors of the researchers working in their academic field (i.e., their academic peers). Even though responsible conduct of research goes well beyond open science practices, and might differ across scientific fields because of diverging research methods (e.g., openly sharing of computer codes does not apply to studies lacking in statistical analyses such as case studies or other qualitative type research), we consider open science practices as one transparent way to practice the good norms of science. Norm-abiding behaviors by researchers in scientific fields might be evidenced by a higher prevalence of open science practices that might, in turn, breed trust in published findings. \nAt the same time, more competitive disciplinary fields might exhibit fewer normative behaviors overall, because of the pressures on researchers to become more focused on career-promoting behaviors rather than on behaviors that align with the good norms of science, such as openly sharing findings and the motivation driven by the desire for knowledge and discovery (disinterestedness; Merton, 1973). Hence, we expect competitiveness of the scientific field to be negatively associated with normative behavior (Anderson et al., 2007), which might, in turn, be reflected by fewer open science practices and lower trust in scientific findings. \nTo measure open science practices, we ask respondents how often they themselves and how commonly those in their disciplinary field: (1) share their data, (2) share code or computer syntaxes, (3) share materials/reagents/equipment, (4) publish under open access, and (5) openly register or publish protocols or research plans. Here we will allow respondents to indicate whether these practices would not be applicable to their research (e.g. because no empirical data are collected). We expect respondents\u2019 assessment of the competitiveness of their field, the normative behaviors of their academic peers, and open science practices in their field to predict respondents\u2019 trust in published findings in their field. This trust is measured by asking responding researchers to indicate the percentage of published findings in their field that are reproducible, replicable, and generalizable (National Academies of Sciences &amp; Medicine, 2019), while again allowing respondents to indicate if these concepts fail to apply to the methodologies used in their field.\n", "q4": "We seek to test the following hypotheses:\n1.\tOwn norm subscription is positively associated with Peer\u2019s normative behavior and Own Open Science practices\n2.\tPeer\u2019s normative behavior is positively associated with Open Science practices in the disciplinary field and Trust in published findings\n3.\tCompetitiveness of the field is negatively associated with Own Open Science practices, Field Open Science practices, Trust in published findings, and Peer\u2019s normative behavior\n4.\tField Open Science practices are positively associated with Trust in published findings.\n\nThese hypotheses are summarized in Table 1.

The power analyses below focuses on obtaining sufficient power to detect bivariate correlations as indicated in Table 1 above and the Structural Equation Model (SEM) analyses that we discuss below. We use a nominal alpha level of .05, two-tailed tests, and aim to obtain a power of at least .85 within the four disciplinary fields. Expected correlations are based on earlier findings by Anderson et al. (2007) among over 3000 US-based researchers. Relevant to the first part of hypothesis 1, Anderson et al. found correlations varying from .08 to .19 (mean r = .16) between own norm subscription and peer\u2019s normative behavior. Similarly, Anderson et al. found competitiveness to correlate between -.30 and .00 with peer\u2019s normative behavior (mean r = -.18). We consider other relations to be at least as strong as these relations. Taking a two-tailed test for r = |.18|, we will obtain a power in excess of .85 within each disciplinary field if we sample 350 participants per disciplinary field (based on Fisher-transformed normality tests). Any test that combines the samples across fields will have higher power. Moreover, with this sample size (N=350 per field), an omnibus test for homogeneity across the four disciplinary fields will have a power in excess of .80 to uncover heterogeneity in a scenario in which two of the fields have a population correlation of zero and two other fields have a population correlation of r = |.18| (based on a non-central Chi-square test; Valentine et al., 2010).\n\nThe structural equation model in Figure 1 features 21 observed variables and 54 parameters (DF = 177).

Respondents are allowed to indicate per item that this particular practice does not apply to their work or work in their field.\n\u2003\n\n\nField Open Science practices\n1\tFor what percentage of recently published studies in your field are study materials/reagents/equipment publicly available?\n2\tFor what percentage of recently published studies in your field are the underlying data publicly available?\n3\tFor what percentage of recently published studies in your field are study code or computer syntaxes publicly available?\n4\tFor what percentage of recently published studies in your field are research plans, registrations, or protocols publicly available?\n5\tWhat percentage of recently published studies in your field are published under open access?\n\t\nOwn Open Science practices\n1\tFor what percentage of your recently published studies did you publicly share study materials/reagents/equipment online?\n2\tFor what percentage of your recently published studies did you publicly share underlying data?\n3\tFor what percentage of your recently published studies did you publicly share study code or computer syntaxes online?\n4\tFor what percentage of your recently published studies did you publicly share the research plan, registration, or protocol?\n5\tWhat percentage of your recently published studies did you publish under open access?\n\nFinally, we will measure trust in science using an index involving items measuring trust in the reproducibility of science, replicability of science, and generalizability of science. These items are newly formulated by us based on definitions in the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 (2019) report entitled \u201cReproducibility and Replicability in Science\u201d.\n\nTrust in published findings in the field\n1\tFor what percentage of recently published studies in your field do you think it is possible to obtain consistent computational results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis?\n2\tFor what percentage of recently published studies in your field do you think it is possible to obtain consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has obtained its own data?\n3\tFor what percentage of recently published studies in your field do you think that the results apply in other contexts or populations that differ from the original one?\n\nThe indices measuring Open Science practices and Trust in science can be answered by using a slider bar ranging from 0% to 100%. Realizing that not all types of studies involve computations or would be amenable to replication, we allow respondents to indicate whether these items do not apply to their scientific field. \n", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "The confirmatory hypotheses will be tested within each of the four disciplinary fields. The main tests are based on two-tailed t-tests of the standard Pearson Product Moment Correlations for the scales and indices that are first checked for missingness (in the case of Open Science practices and Trust in science) and altered to obtain sufficient psychometric properties (see below). We will also run a full structural equation model within each of the disciplinary fields to test the conceptual framework in a more comprehensive manner.\n\n12.\tStatistical models \n\n12.1.\tPsychometric analyses and indices\nFor the scales (Competitiveness, Universalism, Disinterestedness, Communality, Organized Skepticism), we will run classical test theory analyses based on unidimensional models that focus on the item-rest correlations (IRC) to enhance the Cronbach\u2019s Alpha. Here, after reverse coding the contra-indicative items, we will delete items from each scale that show IRC values below .20 in two or more of the disciplinary fields. This heightens (overall) reliability of the scales. For the indices (Open Science practices and Trust in published findings), we will consider for each science domain how often respondents indicated that an item was not applicable to the work in their scientific field. We will not include in the index used to test the hypotheses in a given disciplinary field those items that are not applicable for more than 20% of the respondents. We will run sensitivity analyses using pairwise missingness for each disciplinary field.\n\n12.2.\tBivariate relations \n\nThe main confirmatory tests of our hypotheses concern the Fisher transformed Pearson Product Moment Correlations for the scales and indices that are first checked for missingness and possibly revised to deal with items showing weak item-rest correlations. Both the open science practices and the four normative variables will be considered as an index (based on the unweighted mean over the open science practices and the four Mertonian norms) in this analysis. We will first assess with a chi-square homogeneity test (against Alpha = .05 and DF = 3) whether Fisher-transformed correlations differ across the four disciplinary fields. If we fail to reject homogeneity test, inference will be based on the standard normal test for the estimated mean Fisher-transformed correlation. If the homogeneity test is significant for a given correlation, we will use standard z- test for the correlations in each disciplinary field.\n\n12.3.\tStructural Equation Model\n\nWe will fit the following confirmatory structural equation model for the four disciplinary fields using Maximum Likelihood estimation (and the Satorra-Bentler correction to deal with any non-normality) in Lavaan (version 0.6) in the R environment. For exploratory purposes, we will add missing paths that are reflected in modification indices (MI) in excess of 10.83 (the critical value for the DF = 1 test at alpha =.001) in two or more of the disciplinary fields. Next, we will check for invariance of the measurement parameters across the disciplinary fields using the omnibus likelihood ratio test (against alpha = .001) and allow at most two non-invariant indicators based on modification indices. Next, we will test whether the structural paths, factor (co)variances, and factor means or factor intercepts differ across the disciplinary fields, again using an omnibus ratio likelihood test against alpha .001 (and consider MI = 10.83 for freeing parameters). \n", "q19.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e46935b3e86a801046e8730", "file_name": "fig1.docx", "file_urls": {"html":

In the context of growing support for violence in Islamic Africa, Equal Access hoped that programming on the channel would diminish popular support for violence and associated religious intolerance or, at least, stem the tide of such support. This channel is the first of its kind, presenting culturally appropriate content in Hausa written, produced, and filmed by veterans of the Hausa-language film industry based in Kano, Nigeria. The intended audience for this channel includes all of Muslim Northern Nigeria. This paper presents a preliminary assessment of the impact of this attempt to use television to change (or resist change) in attitudes in the context of violence and social change in Northern Nigeria and the Muslim world. The channel has 4 prosocial goals: (1) to increase tolerance towards religious and ethnic outgroups; (2) to decrease acceptance for violence as a means to achieve goals; (3) to increase support for the empowerment of women; and (4) increase support for the empowerment of youth. This paper will present three analyses to determine if the channel is having an effect on these three attitudes. First, a matching analysis in which viewers in 2015 are compared with non-viewers in 2015 and non-viewers in 2013. Second, a pre-post survey difference in which individuals and neighborhoods in 2017 are compared to individuals and neighborhoods in 2014. And third, a randomized encouragement experiment in which treatment subjects are encouraged to watch an Arewa24 program, placebo subjects are encouraged to watch a rival network, and control subjects are not encouraged to change their viewing habits. To be clear: the first matching analysis of 2015 viewers with 2015 and 2013 non-viewers is already underway; this registration is retrospective for that analysis. This registration is prospective for the pre/post survey comparison -- we have the data but have not yet looked at it. And the analysis is prospective for the randomized encouragement experiment -- we have only conducted a small pilot study to test the IVR system and develop a protocol for how to conduct a large-scale, 6 month panel experiment using IVR technology. (the following was added to this registration on 26 August 2017) We are now adding a fourth analysis for which we have not analyzed any data. This is an IVR difference-in-differences design where \"control\" observations are those who call into Arewa24's inbound line in the two hours before their flagship prosocial program airs, and \"treatment\" observations are those who call into Arewa24's inbound line in the two hours after their flagship prosocial program airs."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "We hypothesize that Arewa24 viewers, compared to non-viewers, are: (1) more tolerant of religious and ethnic outgroups (2) less supportive of violence (3) more supportive of women's empowerment (4) more supportive of youth empowerment We believe these effects will be strongest among youth, who should have less ingrained attitudes, and strongest for those who view the channel most frequently. We also believe we will see the strongest effect on women's empowerment for women, and the strongest effect on youth empowerment for youth.

First, a matching analysis that compares viewers in 2015 with non-viewers in 2015 and non-viewers in 2013. A large-scale survey was undertaken by the US Department of State in 2013, before Arewa24 launched. That same survey, plus questions relating to Arewa24, was conducted again in late 2015, after the channel had been airing content for more than 1 year. We first match 2015 viewers with 2015 non-viewers and compare the differences on our four outcomes of interest (tolerance, violence, women's empowerment, youth empowerment). We then match 2015 viewers with 2013 non-viewers and compare them in a difference-in-differences design with 2015 non-viewers. This difference-in-differences should account for changes over time that occur orthogonal to Arewa24. The analysis will match on every variable we think could affect viewing Arewa24, missingness on those variables, and the proportions of those variables in the individual's neighborhood. From that list, we will use a LASSO to select variables that do predict viewing Arewa24. Second, we will analyze a pre/post survey conducted in conjunction with Arewa24. Arewa24 conducted a baseline survey in late 2014, just before it began airing its flagship, award-winning drama program, Dadin Kowa. Arewa24 then conducted an endline survey in early 2017, going to the same neighborhoods and, where possible, talking with the same people. We will compare these neighborhoods over time, conditional on the percentage of Arewa24 viewers (expecting more change in places with more Arewa24 viewers). We will also compare the people we were able to contact at both times points (2015 and 2017).

And perhaps a difference-in-differences design, predicting that Arewa24 viewers will change more than non-Arewa24 viewers over this period of time. Third, we will conduct a randomized encouragement experiment using Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology. We will encourage people in Northern Nigeria to watch either (1) Dadin Kowa, Arewa24's flagship program, or (2) AIT, a rival channel; a control group (3) will not be asked to change their viewing habits. We will assign viewers in blocks based on their previous exposure to Arewa24 and their gender, since we believe men and women will respond differently to the program, especially to the women's empowerment programming.

In the context of growing support for violence in Islamic Africa, Equal Access hoped that programming on the channel would diminish popular support for violence and associated religious intolerance or, at least, stem the tide of such support. This channel is the first of its kind, presenting culturally appropriate content in Hausa written, produced, and filmed by veterans of the Hausa-language film industry based in Kano, Nigeria. The intended audience for this channel includes all of Muslim Northern Nigeria. This paper presents a preliminary assessment of the impact of this attempt to use television to change (or resist change) in attitudes in the context of violence and social change in Northern Nigeria and the Muslim world. The channel has 4 prosocial goals: (1) to increase tolerance towards religious and ethnic outgroups; (2) to decrease acceptance for violence as a means to achieve goals; (3) to increase support for the empowerment of women; and (4) increase support for the empowerment of youth. This paper will present three analyses to determine if the channel is having an effect on these three attitudes. First, a matching analysis in which viewers in 2015 are compared with non-viewers in 2015 and non-viewers in 2013. Second, a pre-post survey difference in which individuals and neighborhoods in 2017 are compared to individuals and neighborhoods in 2014. And third, a randomized encouragement experiment in which treatment subjects are encouraged to watch an Arewa24 program, placebo subjects are encouraged to watch a rival network, and control subjects are not encouraged to change their viewing habits. To be clear: the first matching analysis of 2015 viewers with 2015 and 2013 non-viewers is already underway; this registration is retrospective for that analysis. This registration is prospective for the pre/post survey comparison -- we have the data but have not yet looked at it.

(the following was added to this registration on 26 August 2017) We are now adding a fourth analysis for which we have not analyzed any data. This is an IVR difference-in-differences design where \"control\" observations are those who call into Arewa24's inbound line in the two hours before their flagship prosocial program airs, and \"treatment\" observations are those who call into Arewa24's inbound line in the two hours after their flagship prosocial program airs.", "q16": "We hypothesize that Arewa24 viewers, compared to non-viewers, are: (1) more tolerant of religious and ethnic outgroups (2) less supportive of violence (3) more supportive of women's empowerment (4) more supportive of youth empowerment We believe these effects will be strongest among youth, who should have less ingrained attitudes, and strongest for those who view the channel most frequently.

{"extra": [], "value": "Eleonore Schmitt"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "The influence of schemata on the inflection of masculine nouns in German has been well examined in corpora (K\u00f6pcke 1995, 2000a, 2000b, 2005, Sch\u00e4fer 2016). Prototypically, polysyllabic nouns stressed on the penultimate syllable ending with schwa and referring to human beings belong to the so-called weak declension class. Variation can be observed if a noun diverges from the formal (polysyllabic, stress on the penultimate syllable, schwa) or semantic (referring to human beings) features: These nouns vary between weak and strong forms. The strong conjugation class is the type frequent class concerning masculine nouns. Besides the schema of weak nouns, token frequency influences the membership of classes: Token frequent nouns are more likely to stay in the weak class than token infrequent nouns (Sch\u00e4fer 2016).\n\nTo my knowledge, psycholinguistic studies concerning this topic are missing so far. Psycholinguistic studies on declension in German examine, e.g., the processing of regular and irregular plural forms (Penke and Krause 2002; Sonnenstuhl and Huth 2002) but do not examine effects of schemata. An exception to this is Schmitt (2019). Here, effects of schemata are examined with the help of a self-paced reading task using pseudo nouns. Schmitt (2019) could not measure differences between reading times for weak and strong genitive endings of the pseudo noun \"Schettose\" which perfectly matches the schema of the weak masculine class and thus should facilitate the processing of weak endings. An effect of schemata is therefore not observable in reaction times. However, participants had a clear preference for the weak ending in the production task within the study. Hence, there seems to be conflicting evidence for effects of schemata. \n\nThis study aims to further examine effects of schemata with the help of a lexical decision task. Participants judge weak (-n) and strong (-s) genitive forms of real existing nouns (des Kollegen/Kolleges 'the colleague.GEN'). Each test word is presented twice, once with a  weak suffix and once with a strong suffix, so that both forms are judged.  Hence, the design allows to test the influence of infrequent and thus unexpected suffixes (e.g., a strong suffix for a noun belonging to the weak declension class) on reaction times. \n\nThe test words belong to the schema of the weak declension class to different degrees: nouns that fully match the schema are compared to nouns that are in the periphery of the schema as they do not meet the schema\u2019s formal criteria. Additionally, nouns are used that do not belong to the weak declension class but are similar to the nouns belonging to the periphery of the schema. The degree of animacy of the test nouns is constant, as the test items refer to human beings. The token frequency of the test nouns was controlled as well: all test nouns have a relative frequency of max. 2 hits per million tokens.\n\nThe study design allows to test the influence of schemata on processing as well as the influence of forms that are typcially used or typically not used with the test words."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "1. reaction times\n\nAn interaction between schematicity and inflection is expected. Reaction times are expected to be fast for the combination of weak inflection and nouns that prototypically or peripherally belong to the schema of weak masculine nouns and for the combination of strong inflection and nouns belonging to the strong declination class. Reaction times are expected to be higher if strong inflection and nouns belonging to the schema (prototypically and peripherally) are combined and weak inflection and strong masculine nouns. Hence, the degree of schematicity does not influence the reaction times. This hypothesis is based on the results of a prestudy (see data_prestudy_schema_decision.csv for the data and prestudy_schema_decision.R for the code analysing the data). Originally, an effect of schematicity was expected for reaction times: Higher reaction times were expected for nouns in the periphery as theoretically more than one form can be produced. The opposite was expected for nouns belonging to the strong class or to the prototype of the schema as here only one possible form exists (see https://osf.io/834nz for the preregistration of the prestudy).\n\n2. acceptance of strong and weak inflection\n\nThe acceptance of the weak inflection (-n) depends on the form of the noun. If the form matches the criteria of weak masculine nouns completely, -n will be accepted. Weak endings of nouns that do not belong to the weak class will not be accepted. The opposite is expected regarding strong inflection (-s). For nouns in the periphery, acceptance for both endings is expected. However, it is expected that weak endings will show a higher acceptance rate (100 %) than strong endings (ca. 50%). Again, this distribution was observable for the data of the prestudy.\nIt is hypothesized that participants judge the nouns belonging to the schema and those not belonging to the weak class consistently, whereas inconsistent answers are expected for the nouns in the periphery of the schema. This should be observable in the distributions of answers (no clearly distributed response behaviour for nouns in the periphery, predominately acceptance for weak forms but rejection for strong forms regarding nouns belonging to the schema and vice versa for nouns not belonging to the weak declension class) as well as for individual participants (rejection/acceptance for both forms in the periphery, opposite answers to weak and strong forms of a single test noun for nouns belonging to the schema/not belonging to the weak declension class).

Per level of schematicity, five test words are used. The test words are presented with weak as well as strong inflection (e.g., des Kollegen/des Kolleges) and participants are asked to decide whether they know the word (\"Kennen Sie dieses Wort bzw. diese Wortabfolge?\" 'Do you know this word/ word sequence?'). The answer (yes/no) as well as the reaction times are used for data analysis. \nVerbs belonging to the strong conjugation class with weak and strong inflection are used as fillers. They serve as test items for a study on the influence of frequency on variation. Additionally, strong genitive forms ending with -es are used as fillers. The genitive form -es is used for nouns that normally have -s as genitive ending as they do not allow -es phonotactically (*des Abendes 'the evening.GEN') (Szczepaniak 2010).  \nTo test the design, reaction times elicited by long (-es) and short (-s) genitive endings of two nouns not allowing long genitive endings are contrasted (Ultimatum, Internet) as well as reaction times elicited by regular and irregular forms of the irregular verbs \"gehen\" 'to go' and \"bringen\" 'to bring'. These items will only be relevant if the statistical analysis of the test items does not hint to differences in reaction times.  The items allow to test whether the design can elicit differences in reaction times in general. The following mixed linear model will be used  if the design needs to be tested: reaction time ~ acceptance + (1|item)+(1+acceptance|participant). Acceptance is the manipulated variable. The variabel has two levels: accepted (short ending/irregular form) and not accepted (long ending/regular form). Additionally, the response behaviour (yes/no) of the participants will be analysed with the following logistic mixed linear model (response ~ acceptance + (1|item)+(1+form|participant). \n\nPsychoPy3, version 3.1.5,  (Peirce 2019) is used to implement the study. \n\nTest items\n\nPrototype of the schema: Franzose \u2018frenchman\u2019, Geselle \u2018journeyman\u2019, Kollege \u2018colleague\u2019, Neffe \u2018nephew\u2018, Sch\u00fctze \u2018marksman\u2018 \n\nPeriphery of the schema: F\u00fcrst \u2018ruler\u2019, Graf \u2018count\u2019, Held \u2018hero\u2019, Nachbar \u2018neighbor\u2019, Zar \u2018tsar\u2019, \n\nNot belonging to the weak declension class: Dieb \u2018thief\u2019, Feind \u2018enemy\u2019, Freund \u2018friend\u2019, Kerl \u2018guy\u2019, Vogt \u2018reeve\u2019\n\nIn order to avoid frequency effects, nouns are used that have a frequency of up to two hits per million tokens in 2018 in the word frequencies provided by digital dictionary for the German language (Digitales W\u00f6rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache, Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften). However, there are slight differences in frequency within the test words: Three nouns that prototypically match the schema have a frequency of 0.4 to 1.6 hits per million tokens but the other two are less frequent (up to 0.05 hits per million tokens). The words that are in the periphery of the schema have a frequency of 0.3 to 0.9 hits per million tokens. Two of the words not belonging to the weak class have a comparable frequency (0.3 to 0.5 hits per million tokens), but the other three are far less frequent (up to 0.04 hits per million tokens). Hence, the nouns not belonging to the weak declension class tend to be less frequent than the other test words. However, \"des Gesellen\" and \"des Neffen\", belonging to the prototype of the schema, are comparable infrequent as these nouns. All in all, the token frequencies of the test words are on a comparable level. Note, however, that the prestudy of a similar experiment using a sentence maze task indicated effects of frequency despite trying to control for frequency (see https://osf.io/bhxpz for the preregistration of the main study for the sentence maze study). \nAs the prestudy of the present study does not point to differences due to frequency (see Exploratory Analysis, data_prestudy_schema_decision.csv for the data as well as prestudy_schema_decision.R for the code), an influence of frequency is not expected for the main study but will be tested within an exploratory analysis. See the attached file (testwords.csv) for an overview over the test words and their relative frequencies.\n\nThe frequency of the test nouns is estimated using the word frequencies for the year 2018 provided by the Digital Dictionary of the German Language (Digitales W\u00f6rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache, Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften).

Prototypically, polysyllabic nouns stressed on the penultimate syllable ending with schwa and referring to human beings belong to the so-called weak declension class. Variation can be observed if a noun diverges from the formal (polysyllabic, stress on the penultimate syllable, schwa) or semantic (referring to human beings) features: These nouns vary between weak and strong forms. The strong conjugation class is the type frequent class concerning masculine nouns. Besides the schema of weak nouns, token frequency influences the membership of classes: Token frequent nouns are more likely to stay in the weak class than token infrequent nouns (Sch\u00e4fer 2016).\n\nTo my knowledge, psycholinguistic studies concerning this topic are missing so far. Psycholinguistic studies on declension in German examine, e.g., the processing of regular and irregular plural forms (Penke and Krause 2002; Sonnenstuhl and Huth 2002) but do not examine effects of schemata. An exception to this is Schmitt (2019). Here, effects of schemata are examined with the help of a self-paced reading task using pseudo nouns. Schmitt (2019) could not measure differences between reading times for weak and strong genitive endings of the pseudo noun \"Schettose\" which perfectly matches the schema of the weak masculine class and thus should facilitate the processing of weak endings. An effect of schemata is therefore not observable in reaction times. However, participants had a clear preference for the weak ending in the production task within the study. Hence, there seems to be conflicting evidence for effects of schemata. \n\nThis study aims to further examine effects of schemata with the help of a lexical decision task. Participants judge weak (-n) and strong (-s) genitive forms of real existing nouns (des Kollegen/Kolleges 'the colleague.GEN'). Each test word is presented twice, once with a  weak suffix and once with a strong suffix, so that both forms are judged.  Hence, the design allows to test the influence of infrequent and thus unexpected suffixes (e.g., a strong suffix for a noun belonging to the weak declension class) on reaction times. \n\nThe test words belong to the schema of the weak declension class to different degrees: nouns that fully match the schema are compared to nouns that are in the periphery of the schema as they do not meet the schema\u2019s formal criteria. Additionally, nouns are used that do not belong to the weak declension class but are similar to the nouns belonging to the periphery of the schema. The degree of animacy of the test nouns is constant, as the test items refer to human beings. The token frequency of the test nouns was controlled as well: all test nouns have a relative frequency of max. 2 hits per million tokens.\n\nThe study design allows to test the influence of schemata on processing as well as the influence of forms that are typcially used or typically not used with the test words.", "q4": "1. reaction times\n\nAn interaction between schematicity and inflection is expected. Reaction times are expected to be fast for the combination of weak inflection and nouns that prototypically or peripherally belong to the schema of weak masculine nouns and for the combination of strong inflection and nouns belonging to the strong declination class. Reaction times are expected to be higher if strong inflection and nouns belonging to the schema (prototypically and peripherally) are combined and weak inflection and strong masculine nouns. Hence, the degree of schematicity does not influence the reaction times. This hypothesis is based on the results of a prestudy (see data_prestudy_schema_decision.csv for the data and prestudy_schema_decision.R for the code analysing the data). Originally, an effect of schematicity was expected for reaction times: Higher reaction times were expected for nouns in the periphery as theoretically more than one form can be produced. The opposite was expected for nouns belonging to the strong class or to the prototype of the schema as here only one possible form exists (see https://osf.io/834nz for the preregistration of the prestudy).\n\n2. acceptance of strong and weak inflection\n\nThe acceptance of the weak inflection (-n) depends on the form of the noun. If the form matches the criteria of weak masculine nouns completely, -n will be accepted. Weak endings of nouns that do not belong to the weak class will not be accepted. The opposite is expected regarding strong inflection (-s). For nouns in the periphery, acceptance for both endings is expected. However, it is expected that weak endings will show a higher acceptance rate (100 %) than strong endings (ca. 50%). Again, this distribution was observable for the data of the prestudy.\nIt is hypothesized that participants judge the nouns belonging to the schema and those not belonging to the weak class consistently, whereas inconsistent answers are expected for the nouns in the periphery of the schema. This should be observable in the distributions of answers (no clearly distributed response behaviour for nouns in the periphery, predominately acceptance for weak forms but rejection for strong forms regarding nouns belonging to the schema and vice versa for nouns not belonging to the weak declension class) as well as for individual participants (rejection/acceptance for both forms in the periphery, opposite answers to weak and strong forms of a single test noun for nouns belonging to the schema/not belonging to the weak declension class).

Per level of schematicity, five test words are used. The test words are presented with weak as well as strong inflection (e.g., des Kollegen/des Kolleges) and participants are asked to decide whether they know the word (\"Kennen Sie dieses Wort bzw. diese Wortabfolge?\" 'Do you know this word/ word sequence?'). The answer (yes/no) as well as the reaction times are used for data analysis. \nVerbs belonging to the strong conjugation class with weak and strong inflection are used as fillers. They serve as test items for a study on the influence of frequency on variation. Additionally, strong genitive forms ending with -es are used as fillers. The genitive form -es is used for nouns that normally have -s as genitive ending as they do not allow -es phonotactically (*des Abendes 'the evening.GEN') (Szczepaniak 2010).  \nTo test the design, reaction times elicited by long (-es) and short (-s) genitive endings of two nouns not allowing long genitive endings are contrasted (Ultimatum, Internet) as well as reaction times elicited by regular and irregular forms of the irregular verbs \"gehen\" 'to go' and \"bringen\" 'to bring'. These items will only be relevant if the statistical analysis of the test items does not hint to differences in reaction times.  The items allow to test whether the design can elicit differences in reaction times in general. The following mixed linear model will be used  if the design needs to be tested: reaction time ~ acceptance + (1|item)+(1+acceptance|participant). Acceptance is the manipulated variable. The variabel has two levels: accepted (short ending/irregular form) and not accepted (long ending/regular form). Additionally, the response behaviour (yes/no) of the participants will be analysed with the following logistic mixed linear model (response ~ acceptance + (1|item)+(1+form|participant). \n\nPsychoPy3, version 3.1.5,  (Peirce 2019) is used to implement the study. \n\nTest items\n\nPrototype of the schema: Franzose \u2018frenchman\u2019, Geselle \u2018journeyman\u2019, Kollege \u2018colleague\u2019, Neffe \u2018nephew\u2018, Sch\u00fctze \u2018marksman\u2018 \n\nPeriphery of the schema: F\u00fcrst \u2018ruler\u2019, Graf \u2018count\u2019, Held \u2018hero\u2019, Nachbar \u2018neighbor\u2019, Zar \u2018tsar\u2019, \n\nNot belonging to the weak declension class: Dieb \u2018thief\u2019, Feind \u2018enemy\u2019, Freund \u2018friend\u2019, Kerl \u2018guy\u2019, Vogt \u2018reeve\u2019\n\nIn order to avoid frequency effects, nouns are used that have a frequency of up to two hits per million tokens in 2018 in the word frequencies provided by digital dictionary for the German language (Digitales W\u00f6rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache, Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften). However, there are slight differences in frequency within the test words: Three nouns that prototypically match the schema have a frequency of 0.4 to 1.6 hits per million tokens but the other two are less frequent (up to 0.05 hits per million tokens). The words that are in the periphery of the schema have a frequency of 0.3 to 0.9 hits per million tokens. Two of the words not belonging to the weak class have a comparable frequency (0.3 to 0.5 hits per million tokens), but the other three are far less frequent (up to 0.04 hits per million tokens). Hence, the nouns not belonging to the weak declension class tend to be less frequent than the other test words. However, \"des Gesellen\" and \"des Neffen\", belonging to the prototype of the schema, are comparable infrequent as these nouns. All in all, the token frequencies of the test words are on a comparable level. Note, however, that the prestudy of a similar experiment using a sentence maze task indicated effects of frequency despite trying to control for frequency (see https://osf.io/bhxpz for the preregistration of the main study for the sentence maze study). \nAs the prestudy of the present study does not point to differences due to frequency (see Exploratory Analysis, data_prestudy_schema_decision.csv for the data as well as prestudy_schema_decision.R for the code), an influence of frequency is not expected for the main study but will be tested within an exploratory analysis. See the attached file (testwords.csv) for an overview over the test words and their relative frequencies.\n\nThe frequency of the test nouns is estimated using the word frequencies for the year 2018 provided by the Digital Dictionary of the German Language (Digitales W\u00f6rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache, Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften). Test nouns are searched in the genitive singular (with the more frequently used ending). In order to avoid false positives, determiners are used in the search (e.g. @des @Kollegen \u2018the colleague\u2019).\n\nThe attached file (stimulus file.csv) gives an overview over stimuli and filler items. The file contains the following columns:\n\nStimulus_Art: unique coding for each stimulus \t\nStimulus: the stimulus as presented to the participant\t\nSchema: coding for the masculine test nouns; levels: Schema, Peripherie, nichtschwach\nFrequenz: coding for the test verbs; levels: frequent, infrequ_m, infrequ_o (not relevant for this study)\nAkzeptanz: coding for the items testing the design; levels: nichtakzeptiert, akzeptiert\t\nEvaluation: \"ev\" highlights the items evaluating the concentration of the participants (if over 10 % of the nouns have been answered wrong, participant will be excluded)\t\nFlexion: coding for the test verbs and nouns; levels: stark/schwach\t\nItem: naming the test items in their base form (test nouns and strong verbs which are not relevant for this study)\nFormakzeptiert: (expected) acceptence/inacceptance of the forms, j (yes), n (no), b (both)\ncorrectKey: correct response key (based on Fromakzeptiert); levels: f (no), j (yes, both)\nBlock: block in which the item is presented\t\nPositionimBlock: position within the block\n\nFurther explanation for the columns \"Formakzeptiert\" and \"correctKey\": For the test nouns, the coding of these columns followed the hypotheses. For the level \"Schema\", weak forms were coded as accepted and strong forms as not accepted. The opposite pattern was used for the level \"nichtschwach\". For \"Peripherie\" both forms were coded as accepted.", "q8.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e15e31b7545840289f9be04", "file_name": "testwords.csv", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/yx3tv/files/osfstorage/5e15e31b7545840289f9be04", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e15e31b7545840289f9be04"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "a4c0d2ca4f26138fba8f3f3cd1b707bf231ff672eac9f2e045c1f6351180044e"}}, {"file_id": "5e15e31b7545840289f9be02", "file_name": "stimulus file.csv", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/yx3tv/files/osfstorage/5e15e31b7545840289f9be02", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e15e31b7545840289f9be02"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "c67ddb3d7f2c010bce94a1d7b2e2980793c035ffd4ea504226c97feb881cde7c"}}], "q12.question": "Participants will be recruited by asking teachers at German universities to distribute the study among their students.

Additionally, participants will be excluded whose response behaviour points to them not focussing on the task. This evaluation will be based on 31 items. For these items, participants should not vary in their answers (the 31 items are fillers as well as words that are used in the example block and words that are used to evaluate the design of the study).
