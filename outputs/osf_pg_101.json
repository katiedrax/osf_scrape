Repeatedly directing attention to one\u2019s inner state has previously been shown to increase trait mindfulness and emotional differentiation, constructs which are conceptually greatly overlapping with emotional awareness. The question that we propose in this study is whether repeated measures of ESM similarly increase participants\u2019 emotional awareness over time and if this increase is related to the sampling frequency. Our goal is to analyze how the participation in ESM affects emotional awareness of the participants.  To this end, 164 participants were randomly assigned to receive questionnaires 3, 6, or 9 times per day over 14 days. Different measures will be used to study within-subject changes in trait and momentary emotional awareness over time, as well as to compare these changes between the different conditions.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-02T10:50:21.005588", "date_modified": "2020-04-01T16:24:41.454542", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Mariam Chichua", "Peter Kuppens", "Gudrun Eisele"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "646b3c8e5803c2f34d77476068d66fad1e670f7e12c8c35c326d26ef2088e7f9810c9fa62c583bdd3a1e6b88da1d28adf42aaf1f7f66d683145ee3b84c434293a766be995b8023c2cb2e401d70b47e38b9234f92a98be061f20943700f4c73ff35138eda5c3b47dd3bc307bd4b5a5453f5d7192cfbd8fc6af65c9fc41ebd3236971dd54fbee4b6535d5a413aec96b2c1", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-02T10:50:20.973617", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Mariam Chichua, Gudrun Eisele, Peter Kuppens, Peter Kuppens"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "I.\tTrait emotional awareness\na.\tWithin person: higher trait emotional awareness in the post-test compared to the pre-test\nb.\tBetween persons: the increase between pre- and post-tests is bigger in higher sampling frequency groups\nII.\tDaily emotional awareness\na.\tWithin person: increase of momentary emotional awareness over the period of 14 days\nb.\tBetween persons: higher increase in momentary emotional awareness with higher sampling frequency\n"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

A baseline session was followed by a 14 day ESM period. After the ESM period participants returned to the lab for a follow-up session. The individual parts of the study are described in the following paragraphs in more detail.\n\nBaseline session\nAfter providing informed consent, participants were randomly assigned to one of the six experimental conditions and asked to fill out the baseline questionnaires (trait emotional awareness, previous or current psychopathology, alcohol use, smoking, drug use, demographics &amp; contact information, smartphone use, personality, depression, anxiety, self-esteem, emotion regulation, perceived stress, &amp; momentary and trait affect). The six conditions were: a short ESM questionnaire 3 times per day, a short ESM questionnaire 6 times per day, a short ESM questionnaire 9 times per day, a long ESM questionnaire 3 times per day, a long ESM questionnaire 6 times per day, a long ESM questionnaire 9 times per day. The short questionnaire consisted of \u00b1 30 items (depending on branching logic) and the long questionnaire consisted of \u00b1 60 items (depending on branching logic). All participants were tested on trait emotional awareness (Neumann et al., 2010). Participants were briefed individually about the ESM testing period and practiced filling in the ESM questionnaire to assure that all items were understood by the participants. The briefing lasted approximately 20 minutes. As determined by the randomization procedure, participants were also told how many times per day they would be signaled to complete the questionnaire and how much money they would receive for their participation (the incentive was dependent on the condition; participants in the conditions with 3 beeps per day received 40 euro, while those in the 6 and 9 beep conditions received 60 and 80 euro, respectively). The briefing was conducted in Dutch or English, depending on the researcher conducting the session.\n\n\n14 Days of ESM\nThe lab visit was followed by the ESM testing period of 14 days. During this time, participants, depending on the experimental condition, received 3, 6, or 9 prompts per day to fill in a short or long questionnaire. Participants had the option to contact the researchers in case of problems.\n\nPosttest session\nAfter the two weeks of ESM, a second session was conducted during which participants were asked to fill out the posttest questionnaires (emotional awareness, burden, social norm &amp; ideal affect, depression, anxiety, self-esteem, emotion regulation, momentary and retrospective affect). A (randomly chosen) subsample of 10 participants per experimental condition was invited to a qualitative interview lasting approximately 10 minutes, at the end of the posttest session. The qualitative interview was semi-structured, in the sense that participants were asked a series of predetermined questions and follow-up questions were asked depending on the answers. All participants received their compensation and were debriefed about the study after the posttest session. During the debriefing, it was explained that the study consisted of different groups that received different numbers of beeps per day and different questionnaires. Participants received 40, 60, or 80 euro in form of gift vouchers depending on the number of beeps per day. The amounts of the incentives were decided during focus groups and based on experiences of researchers with student recruitment at KU Leuven in the past, as well as the available budget. We reduced the incentive to 25, 30, and 40 euro if a participant responded to less than a third of the scheduled beeps during the study (i.e., to less than 14, 28, and 42 beeps in the 3, 6, and 9 beep conditions, respectively). The reduced amount corresponds to the full payment for both lab sessions (20 euro) plus roughly a third of the payment for the ESM period (no exact payments were possible because the payments needed to be made in vouchers of 5 euro).

Participants received 3, 6, or 9 beeps, depending on the condition they have been assigned to during the baseline session. Beeps were semi-randomly spread between 9 am and 10:30 pm. In the 3-beep condition, beeps were scheduled randomly in each of three 4 h 30 min windows. In the 6-beep condition, the day was split into six 2 h 15 min windows and a beep was scheduled randomly in each of the windows. In the 9-beep condition, the day was split into 9 1h 30 min windows and one beep scheduled in each of them. There was a no beep window of 20 minutes between consecutive beeps.\n\nOn day 3, 6, 9, and 12, an instructed response item (i.e., a trick item that was supposed to function as a test if participants were paying attention to the questionnaire) was added to one of the questionnaires. It was always presented at the middle beep in the 3 beep condition and switched between the third and fourth beep in the 6 beep condition. In the 9 beep condition, it was shown once at the fourth beep, once at the sixth beep, and twice at the fifth beep. Due to constraints by the program used, no no-beep window of 20 minutes could be guaranteed between the last beep before the questionnaire with the instructed response item and the questionnaire with instructed response item (i.e., the last beep before the beep with the instructed response item could be less than 20 minutes before the beep with the instructed response item). The same applies to the first questionnaire after the questionnaire with the instructed response item.\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned to receive either a short (~30 items) or long questionnaire (~60 items) during the study. Following a pilot test, we estimated the completion time for the short questionnaire to be around 1,5 min and 2,5 min for the long questionnaire. The phone beeped or vibrated for 90 seconds or until the participant started filling in the questionnaire. After 90 seconds, the questionnaire became unavailable. Once participants started filling in the questionnaire, they had 90 seconds until time out per question (in case of time out, the questionnaire stopped and no subsequent questions were shown). Participants received a phone (motorola DEFY+) with the app mobileQ (Meers et al., 2019) installed on it. Other functions of the phone were fully disabled. At every beep, a start screen of the questionnaire was displayed automatically. Participants had to press \u201cstart survey\u201d on this start screen to proceed to the first question.

Cyberbullying is prominent in today\u2019s society, as well as other online behaviors such as trolling. Trolling involves being deceptive online for no reason and towards people the person doesn\u2019t know, and tricking people into humiliating themselves (Buckels, Trapnell, &amp; Paulhus, 2014). Online trolls are individuals who partake in deceptive, destructive, or disruptive behavior in a social setting on the Internet with no apparent instrumental purpose (Buckels, Trapnell &amp; Paulhus, 2014).

To begin to conduct research in order to understand trolling behaviors, one has to understand why these behaviors are prevalent in certain individuals. Research also indicates that those who are narcissists and those with antisocial personality disorder use social media more often than others (Rosen, Whaling, Rab, Carrier &amp; Cheever, 2013). An online \u201ctroll\u201d is a separate personality related entity, and in order to understand this identity, one must understand the self- presentation that\u2019s goes into its construction (Fox &amp; Rooney, 2015).\n\n \n\nThe behavior displayed by trolls over the Internet can not only give a lot of insight into the psychosocial disorders an individual may or may not possess or develop, but can also have severe effects on the individual on the receiving end of the trolls\u2019 malicious behavior. By understanding the psychosocial predictors of social media trolling, the online behavior may be prevented along with its substantial and negative consequences to its victims (Howard, Zolnierek, Critz, Dailey &amp; Ceballos, 2019). There is a relationship believed to be between the Big Five personality traits, Dark Triad traits, and sadism with bullying and/ or cyberbullying (van Geel, Goemans, Toprak &amp; Vedder, 2017).If there is a relation between theses personality disorders and cyberbullying, as well as with increased social media use, then the negative behavior of online trolls can be predicted and prevented. This would solve the issue of the negative consequences trolling can have, while addressing the psychosocial disorder the \u2018troll\u2019 is experiencing. Understanding the meaning of an online \u201ctroll\u201d and what traits they possess can also help society establish constructs of identity, as traits from the Dark Triad can manifest in both trolls and victims (Linton &amp; Power, 2013).", "q4": "Individuals who participate more in negative social media interactions are more likely to possess or develop the personality disorders which make up the Dark Tetrad.
