The reason for this is because the two sectors are much more integrated than scholars typically presume: informal workers anticipate being in the formal sector in the future, and/or many are married to formal workers. This leads to the second hypothesis: I DO expect a gap in attitudes between \"stable\" informal workers and \"stable\" formal workers, with stable informals preferring more noncontributory welfare policies and formals preferring more contributory ones. Stable informals are those who do not expect to be formal in the next five years, and stable formals are those who do not expect to be informal over the next five years. The third hypothesis is that there will be a similar gap in attitudes between informals married to informals and formals married to formals, but being married to someone who is different on this dimension weakens or eliminates the gap. In the second piece of the project, there are two experiments. One is a conjoint analysis. It has respondents choose between two hypothetical job offers in which various features of the job--salary, pension, health coverage, severance pay, and ease of dismissal rules are randomly varied. The hypotheses about how these will affect job choice are rather straightforward: more salary, presence of pension deposits and health coverage, greater severance pay, and rules against dismissal will increase the probability the respondent choose the job. What is more important is to observe the tradeoff between salary and fringe benefits. Do citizens implicitly value fringe benefits at their true monetary values or do they over- or undervalue fringe benefits? My hypothesis is that respondents will fringe benefits, which is why they tend to oppose labor market and welfare state reforms that would monetize benefits and create more flexibility and less paternalism. The other experiment is inspired by a labor- and welfare-reform proposal made by economist Santiago Levy. In it, respondents will look at a grid (as in a conjoint analysis) and choose between two scenarios. One scenario is a low inflation, low cost-of-living scenario and the other is a high salary, high cost-of-living scenario. The percentage increase in the cost of living over the status quo is the only thing that is varied (which is why this isn't really a conjoint analysis), and the percentage varies randomly between 5% and 25% (reported to the whole number). The goal here is to see where the break-even point is. Are respondents indifferent between a salary increase of x% and inflation of x%, or are they more sensitive to one or the other? My hypothesis is that respondents will be more averse to price increases than numerically equivalent wage decreases."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "The hypotheses for the first piece will be tested observationally. The survey has several measures of informality, and I will create an informality index for the independent variable.

There are several different dependent variables that measure support for social policy (contributory versus noncontributory) and labor market policy (more versus less rigid). One of the experiments is a conjoint analysis, so I will assess treatment effects in the standard way of analyzing conjoint designs. I will also see how respondents collectively \"monetize\" the fringe benefits by calculating the revealed tradeoff between salary and the benefits.

The reason for this is because the two sectors are much more integrated than scholars typically presume: informal workers anticipate being in the formal sector in the future, and/or many are married to formal workers. This leads to the second hypothesis: I DO expect a gap in attitudes between \"stable\" informal workers and \"stable\" formal workers, with stable informals preferring more noncontributory welfare policies and formals preferring more contributory ones. Stable informals are those who do not expect to be formal in the next five years, and stable formals are those who do not expect to be informal over the next five years. The third hypothesis is that there will be a similar gap in attitudes between informals married to informals and formals married to formals, but being married to someone who is different on this dimension weakens or eliminates the gap. In the second piece of the project, there are two experiments. One is a conjoint analysis. It has respondents choose between two hypothetical job offers in which various features of the job--salary, pension, health coverage, severance pay, and ease of dismissal rules are randomly varied. The hypotheses about how these will affect job choice are rather straightforward: more salary, presence of pension deposits and health coverage, greater severance pay, and rules against dismissal will increase the probability the respondent choose the job. What is more important is to observe the tradeoff between salary and fringe benefits. Do citizens implicitly value fringe benefits at their true monetary values or do they over- or undervalue fringe benefits? My hypothesis is that respondents will fringe benefits, which is why they tend to oppose labor market and welfare state reforms that would monetize benefits and create more flexibility and less paternalism. The other experiment is inspired by a labor- and welfare-reform proposal made by economist Santiago Levy. In it, respondents will look at a grid (as in a conjoint analysis) and choose between two scenarios. One scenario is a low inflation, low cost-of-living scenario and the other is a high salary, high cost-of-living scenario. The percentage increase in the cost of living over the status quo is the only thing that is varied (which is why this isn't really a conjoint analysis), and the percentage varies randomly between 5% and 25% (reported to the whole number). The goal here is to see where the break-even point is. Are respondents indifferent between a salary increase of x% and inflation of x%, or are they more sensitive to one or the other? My hypothesis is that respondents will be more averse to price increases than numerically equivalent wage decreases.", "q17": "The hypotheses for the first piece will be tested observationally. The survey has several measures of informality, and I will create an informality index for the independent variable. The survey also measures the two key moderators: expectations of informality/formality in the future and informality/formality status of one's spouse. There are several different dependent variables that measure support for social policy (contributory versus noncontributory) and labor market policy (more versus less rigid). One of the experiments is a conjoint analysis, so I will assess treatment effects in the standard way of analyzing conjoint designs. I will also see how respondents collectively \"monetize\" the fringe benefits by calculating the revealed tradeoff between salary and the benefits. For the other experiment, I can also calculate the revealed salary value of the different cost-of-living changes.", "q18": "Mexico", "q19": "1200", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "",

Treatment groups of 10 to 20 people (depending on the site coordinator\u2019s capacity for outreach) were randomly selected as the treatment group. Intervention The outreach effort varied somewhat by site but basically consists of the following elements: (1) an initial handwritten letter/postcard that introduced the canvasser (and gave contact information) and emphasized the importance of the election, (2) a visit to the target voter\u2019s address, culminating in either a conversation about the importance of the election, communication with friends or relatives, or a note saying that the canvasser had visited, and (3) follow-up text messages or calls. Data and Outcome Measures Voter turnout will be assessed by obtaining updated voter files and calculating turnout rates for the randomly assigned treatment and control groups. Method for Estimating Average Treatment Effects Since the experiment is blocked by location with somewhat different probabilities of assignment, our regression models will include indicator variables for each block in the hopes of reducing disturbance variability. We will report 95% confidence intervals for the intent-to-treat effect, using a margin of error equal to the estimated standard error multiplied by the appropriate critical value from the t-distribution. This estimate will be generated by regressing turnout on treatment assignment, using the covariates listed below to generate more precise estimates. We will also estimate the CACE using instrumental variables regression of turnout on (any form of) contact, with random assignment to treatment as an instrument. To assess robustness, we will also report a simple regression result with only block and treatment indicator, omitting prior turnout statistics. We expect these results to be similar but less precisely estimated due to the exclusion of prognostic covariates.
