WM flexibility allows humans to select and prioritize information depending on its current relevance2 and to hold novel items in mind by combining arbitrary features into coherent representations (\u201cfeature binding\u201d)3,4. In this study, we will use behavioural measures, electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking to investigate whether selecting one feature of a multi-feature item in WM automatically privileges associated item features, as predicted by recent computational models of WM flexibility5,6.\n\nAccording to recent models of WM flexibility, features in WM are retrieved through pattern completion, perhaps via strengthened connectivity between features belonging to the same objects5,6. If so, a retrieval cue that directs attention to one item-feature in memory should automatically privilege all features of the same object, even if these are not currently relevant. To test this prediction, we present participants with two oriented, coloured bars on each trial. After a delay, a probe prompts them to report the orientation angle of one of the remembered items. During the delay, participants are additionally presented with a non-predictive retro-cue (i.e. \u2018incidental\u2019 cueing7,8) and asked to make a speeded response if the cued colour did not match the colour of either of the remembered items. On congruent trials, the item that was incidentally cued is also probed during memory recall; on incongruent trials, the other item is probed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that selecting information in WM is associated with faster and more accurate behavioural performance9\u201311 and improved neural decoding of relevant features from fMRI and EEG12\u201315. Here we will test if this is similarly true for object-features that are not currently relevant. First, if selecting the cued colour for the incidental task automatically privileges associated, but currently redundant item-features, orientation judgements should be faster and more precise on congruent than on incongruent trials. This would replicate previous behavioural findings8. Alternatively, it may be possible to selectively attend the cued colour without associated benefits to orientation judgements for the same item. If so, there should be no difference in performance between congruent and incongruent trials.\n\nSecond, using alpha lateralization and gaze bias as indices of spatial attention in WM16,17, we will test if spatial attention is directed toward the original position of the cued item following the non-predictive colour cue, despite location being a fully redundant feature in this task. If so, we expect contralateral minus ipsilateral alpha power to be reduced relative to the original location of the cued item. We also expect gaze position to be biased toward the cued item\u2019s original position. Alternatively, there may be no significant alpha lateralization or gaze bias relative to the cued item\u2019s original location, which would suggest a mechanism for colour retrieval in WM without involvement of spatial attention.\n\nFinally, if selecting the incidentally cued colour by extension strengthens the representation of the orientation of the cued item, neural decodability should improve for the cued item\u2019s orientation relative to the orientation of the uncued item following the cue, even though the item\u2019s orientation is irrelevant to the \u2018incidental\u2019 change-detection judgement. Alternatively, it may be possible to selectively access a single feature in memory, similar to selective coding for only relevant item features observed during encoding18,19. We expect the orientation of the cued item to be decodable from EEG activity patterns following incidental cue onset and decoding accuracy to be greater for the cued than the uncued item. Alternatively, patterns of activity in the EEG channels may contain no information about the cued item and/or may contain equal information about the orientations of both items following the incidental cue.\n\nAt the time of writing, data collection for this study is ongoing but the data have not yet been analysed. \n\nMethods\n\nParticipants\nWe plan to recruit a total of 35 participants (see below for power calculations). Participants must be aged 18-40 years old, have normal or corrected-to-normal vision (including normal colour vision), and not have any history of neurological or neuropsychiatric disorders. Participants provide informed consent prior to participating in the study. They are reimbursed for their time at a rate of \u00a315/hour or with course credit. The study has been approved by the Oxford Central University Research Ethics Committee (R55073/RE008). \n\n\n \nFigure 1. Task design. Participants remember two oriented, coloured bars on each trial. During the delay, they are presented with a non-predictive colour cue that asks them to make a speeded mismatch-response (i.e., does it differ from the colours in memory?; \u2018incidental task\u2019). At the end of the trial, they report the orientation of one of the items, cued by colour. This item may be the same as was also cued on the incidental task (congruent condition, 50%), or the other item (incongruent condition, 50%).\n\nProcedure\nParticipants perform a computerised experimental task (see Figure 1 for task design). It consists of a continuous report WM task, in which participants report the orientation angle of one of two items in memory at the end of a delay. During the delay, participants perform a dual \u201cincidental task\u201d, where a non-predictive colour cue, presented centrally, requires a speeded mismatch response: does the colour differ from the colours of the two memory items. At the end of the trial, a probe indicates which of the two items participants should report. This can either be the same item as the one that was cued on the incidental task (congruent condition, 50% of trials) or the other item in memory (incongruent condition, 50% of trials). \n\nFollowing an initial fixation period of 300 ms, participants are presented with a WM display consisting of two oriented, coloured bars. The WM items are presented on screen for 250 ms followed by a delay period of 750 ms. For the incidental task, participants are presented with a colour cue for 200 ms. On mismatch trials (20 %), participants press the space bar within 1000 ms of incidental cue onset, after which the rest of the trial is skipped. Participants receive feedback for correct or incorrect responses. On match trials (80 %), participants make no response and the trial continues (unless they accidentally press the space bar, in which case the trial is also discontinued). After another delay of 500 ms, the probe appears on the screen. The colour of the probe indicates which of the two items participants should report. Participants use the arrow keys to turn the on-screen dial to match the orientation of the probed item and press the space bar to respond. There is no maximum time to respond, but once participants initiate a response the trial will time-out 2500 ms after response initiation. They receive visual feedback of the correct orientation for 100 ms. The inter-trial-interval is jittered between 400-800 ms. At the end of each block, they receive feedback of their incidental colour change-detection rate and on their mean absolute error.\n\nParticipants complete a total of 1400 trials. The 20% non-match incidental trials are excluded, leaving 1120 trials per participant for analyses. Participants practice the task beforehand until they reach a criterion of &gt;80% correct incidental task change-detection rate and &lt;25 degrees mean absolute error relative to the target orientation. \n\nApparatus and stimuli\nThe task is programmed and stimuli presented in Matlab with Psychtoolbox20,21.  The task is presented on a 24 inch, 1920x1080 pixel monitor running at 100 Hz.\n\nStimuli are presented on a grey background (RGB = 0.5, 0.5, 0.5). A fixation target is presented at the centre of the screen throughout the trial. It consists of a filled black circle (0.5\u00b0 diameter) with a white cross inside (width: 0.15\u00b0). To signal trial onset and to encourage fixation, a black dot (0.15\u00b0 diameter) appears inside the fixation target 300 ms before the onset of the memory array. The memory array consists of two oriented, coloured bars inside circles (diameter: 6\u00b0, width: 0.3\u00b0). The colours are picked at random without replacement out of four possible colours on each trial: red (RGB: 153, 0, 27), purple (122, 39, 150), green (16, 83, 0), and blue (0, 72, 136), chosen to be isoluminant in CieLab space. On every trial, the orientation of each stimulus is randomly selected without replacement from a uniform distribution of 160 orientation angles between 1.1250 and 180 degrees. The two WM items are presented laterally 6\u00b0 from the fixation target. For the incidental task, participants are presented with a colour cue appearing around the fixation target (diameter: 1\u00b0, width: 0.5\u00b0). The probe is a tilted bar inside a circle (6\u00b0; same size as memory items) and matches the colour of the probed memory item. The orientation angle of the probe is selected at random on each trial between 1 and 180 degrees. The probe is presented 6\u00b0 above or below the fixation target, with equal probability, pseudorandomised for the full experimental session. This type of probe display has been reported to reduce the risk of stimulus-specific eye-movements22. Feedback of the correct target orientation is presented as a white line on top of their reported orientation for comparison.\n\nEEG data acquisition\nElectroencephalography (EEG) is recorded at a sampling rate of 1kHz using Synamps amplifiers (Neuroscan, Inc., Albany, CA) and Curry Neuroimaging Suite (v7.0.12 X) software. Sixty-one electrodes are positioned according to the 10-10 system23. Eye movements are recorded from bipolar EOG derivations from electrodes above and below the right eye (vertical) and lateral to each eye (horizontal). A ground electrode is placed on the left elbow and the left mastoid is used as the active reference. \n\nIn addition, we record participants\u2019 eye movements using an eye tracking camera (EyeLink) tracking at least one eye at a rate of 1kHz.\n\nAnalyses\n\nBehavior\nOur behavioural measures of interest are mean absolute error from the target angle and median response initiation times (henceforth RT).  We will perform paired samples t-tests (one-tailed) to test for a main effect of congruency for both measures. We predict that mean absolute error and median RTs will be significantly lower for congruent relative to incongruent trials. \n\nTo explore the sources of errors, we will also fit a swap model to the data24. The model is an extension of the Zhang &amp; Luck (2008)25 model and estimates the precision, target rate, non-target rate and guess rate of responses. As above, we will perform paired samples t-tests (two-tailed) for each measure to test for a main effect of congruency. \n\nPreprocessing of eye-movement data \nThe EyeLink EDF file is converted to ASCII format and read into Matlab using the Fieldtrip toolbox26. The data is epoched around the onset of the WM array (-1 to 4 seconds). We will take the mean of the right and the left eye and downsample the data to 500 Hz. Eye-blinks will be detected (zeros in the eye-position data) and interpolated from -100 to +100 ms around the blink onset and offset using linear interpolation.\n\nEEG Preprocessing\nPreprocessing of the EEG data will be performed in Matlab using the Fieldtrip toolbox26. The ERPs are re-referenced offline to the mean of the right and left mastoid and down-sampled to 500 Hz. We will apply a high-pass filter of 0.1 Hz and a low-pass filter of 40 Hz to all channels.  The data will be epoched around the onset of the WM array (-1 to 4 seconds). We will perform ICA to remove any heartbeat artefacts and/or artefacts due to eye-blinks. Artefact rejection will be performed separately for the time-window following WM array onset (0-1 s) and the cue onset (1-2.5 s). We will mark epochs with a high degree of variance using the Fieldtrip summary plot for visual artefact rejection and further mark epochs that exceed a cut-off threshold of 50 of the z-transformed value of the pre-processed data to detect any large artefacts due to muscle movements. We will further exclude epochs with saccades identified from the eye-tracking data. In case eye-tracking data is missing, we will visually inspect EOGs to reject saccade epochs.\n\nWe will exclude participants with fewer than 80% of epochs remaining following artefact rejection from further analyses. We expect to reject about 5% of trials on average per participant, based on the experiment used for computing our power analyses27.\n\nTime frequency decomposition and alpha lateralization\nTo test whether a centrally presented, non-predictive colour cue draws spatial attention to the original position of the cued item, we will compute the alpha lateralization index relative to the cued item in the time window after incidental cue onset (1.2\u20131.8 s; to avoid carry over from probe onset). Spectral decomposition of the data will be performed in Matlab with the FieldTrip toolbox26. We will apply Hanning tapers with a time window width of five cycles per frequency, with frequencies of interest between 8 Hz and 14 Hz in steps of 1 Hz. We will log-transform the power at each frequency (10*log10) and calculate the mean power over contralateral and ipsilateral posterior channels (P8/7, P6/5, P4/3, PO8/7, PO4/3, O2/1) relative to the cued and uncued item. To get a lateralization index we will take the difference between contralateral and ipsilateral alpha power averaged over the specified time-window and test for significant lateralization using a one-sample t-test (one-tailed, &gt;0).\n\nGaze bias analysis\nA recent study has shown that human gaze may be biased toward attended spatial locations in WM17. Here, we will similarly use gaze bias as an index of spatial attention towards the original position of the cued item. If spatial attention is drawn to the original position of the incidentally cued item, we expect horizontal gaze position to be biased toward the left (i.e. negative values) for left cue trials and toward the right (i.e. positive values) for right cue trials. First, we will centre the data to the mean position during fixation (300\u2013100 ms before stimulus onset). We will then normalize the data according to the eccentricity of the memory items, so +/-100% corresponds to the eyes being focused on the original position of the memory items (e.g. 6 dva) and 0% corresponds to fixation. We will plot the horizontal gaze position following incidental cue onset separately for left and right cue trials. To obtain an aggregate measure of \u2018towardness\u201917, we will take the mean gaze position for right cue trials minus the mean gaze position for left cue trials, divided by two, averaged across the time-window following incidental cue onset (1.2\u20131.8). We will test for significant gaze bias toward the cued item (i.e. \u2018towardness\u2019) using a one-sample t-test (one-tailed, &gt;0). \n\nOrientation decoding\nTo test whether the patterns of activity in the EEG channels contain information about the orientation angles of the items in memory, we will use Mahalanobis distance to calculate the trial-wise distances between the multidimensional activity at each time point for each of the 160 possible orientation angles in memory, grouped into 16 angle bins distributed around a 180 degree angle space. The left and right memory items will be decoded separately and independently for each participant. As in Wolff et al. (2017), we will perform the analyses on the 17 posterior channels (P7, P5, P3, P1, Pz, P2, P4, P6, P8, PO7, PO3, POz, PO4, PO8, O1, Oz and O2). \n\nThe decoding procedure will follow an 8-fold cross-validation approach to calculate the decoding accuracy of the orientation of interest for each trial. The activity pattern of the trials of the testing fold at a particular time-point will be compared to the trials of k-1 training folds. The trials of the training folds are averaged into 16 orientation bins relative to the test trial orientation, each bin containing trials with orientations within a range of 11.25\u00b0 (variable bins, see below). As we expect to exclude trials due to artefacts, we will ensure equal trial-numbers in each bin by random subsampling. We will compute the pairwise Mahalanobis distances between the test trials and each of the orientation bins using the covariance matrix estimated from trials in the k-1 training folds, using a shrinkage estimator28. To obtain a visual representation of a tuning curve, the 16 distances will be ordered as a function of orientation difference, mean-centered, and sign-reversed, so higher values represent greater similarity between the test trial and the training set. This will be repeated for all train and test fold combinations. To obtain reliable estimates, the above procedure will be repeated 100 times (with random folds each time), separately for two orientation spaces (bin centres: 5.625\u00b0 to 174.015\u00b0 and 11.25\u00b0 to 180\u00b0, each in steps of 11.25\u00b0), and averaged across the resulting 200 samples for each of the 16 Mahalanobis distance values at each time-point.\n\nFinally, to obtain a summary measure of decoding accuracy, we will compute the cosine-weighted means of the tuning curves12,27, and compute the mean of the resulting 16 values. Higher values will reflect greater orientation tuning and thereby greater decoding accuracy for that trial. We will take the mean over trials, resulting in a single decoding value for each time-point for each participant.\n\nTo test for significant orientation decoding of the two items in memory following the onset of the WM array of the incidental cue, we will take the mean decoding accuracy within the time-window following array onset (0\u20131 s) and following cue onset (1\u20132 s). During the WM array window, we expect significant orientation decoding for both items. We will use one sample t-tests, to test for significant decoding of each item (one-tailed, &gt;0). During the cue window, we expect orientation decoding to be significant for the cued item. We expect orientation decoding for the uncued item to be significantly lower than the cued item. Again, we will use one sample t-tests, to test for significant decoding of each item (one-tailed, &gt;0) and paired sample t-tests (one-tailed, cued&gt;uncued) to test for any difference in decoding for the two items. \n\nFor completeness, we will also test for significant decoding of each memory item and for any difference between them at each time-point (one-sample t-test, one-tailed, &gt;0, paired samples t-test, two-tailed) using a cluster-based permutation test (10,000 permutations) to correct for multiple comparisons over time. We will use a cluster-forming and cluster significance threshold of p &lt;.05. \n\nPower analyses\nWe have based our power analyses on a previous dataset that decodes the orientation angles of two items in WM using EEG (Experiment 1, Wolff et al., 2017)27. We have re-analysed the data using the same methods as will be used in this study. Based on these analyses, we expect the effect size for detecting a difference in orientation decoding accuracy between the cued and uncued item to be d = 0.43. Consequently, in this study, to detect an estimated effect size of 0.43 with a power of 0.8 using a paired samples t-test (one-tailed, cued &gt; uncued), we will need a total sample size of n = 35. Power calculations were performed using G*Power29.\n\nReferences\n1.\tBaddeley, A. D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 4, 829\u2013839 (2003).\n2.\tBundesen, C. Psychol.

During the delay, they are presented with a non-predictive colour cue that asks them to make a speeded mismatch-response (i.e., does it differ from the colours in memory?; \u2018incidental task\u2019). At the end of the trial, they report the orientation of one of the items, cued by colour. This item may be the same as was also cued on the incidental task (congruent condition, 50%), or the other item (incongruent condition, 50%).\n\nProcedure\nParticipants perform a computerised experimental task (see Figure 1 for task design). It consists of a continuous report WM task, in which participants report the orientation angle of one of two items in memory at the end of a delay. During the delay, participants perform a dual \u201cincidental task\u201d, where a non-predictive colour cue, presented centrally, requires a speeded mismatch response: does the colour differ from the colours of the two memory items. At the end of the trial, a probe indicates which of the two items participants should report. This can either be the same item as the one that was cued on the incidental task (congruent condition, 50% of trials) or the other item in memory (incongruent condition, 50% of trials). \n\nFollowing an initial fixation period of 300 ms, participants are presented with a WM display consisting of two oriented, coloured bars. The WM items are presented on screen for 250 ms followed by a delay period of 750 ms. For the incidental task, participants are presented with a colour cue for 200 ms. On mismatch trials (20 %), participants press the space bar within 1000 ms of incidental cue onset, after which the rest of the trial is skipped. Participants receive feedback for correct or incorrect responses. On match trials (80 %), participants make no response and the trial continues (unless they accidentally press the space bar, in which case the trial is also discontinued). After another delay of 500 ms, the probe appears on the screen. The colour of the probe indicates which of the two items participants should report. Participants use the arrow keys to turn the on-screen dial to match the orientation of the probed item and press the space bar to respond. There is no maximum time to respond, but once participants initiate a response the trial will time-out 2500 ms after response initiation. They receive visual feedback of the correct orientation for 100 ms. The inter-trial-interval is jittered between 400-800 ms. At the end of each block, they receive feedback of their incidental colour change-detection rate and on their mean absolute error.\n\nParticipants complete a total of 1400 trials. The 20% non-match incidental trials are excluded, leaving 1120 trials per participant for analyses. Participants practice the task beforehand until they reach a criterion of &gt;80% correct incidental task change-detection rate and &lt;25 degrees mean absolute error relative to the target orientation. \n\nApparatus and stimuli\nThe task is programmed and stimuli presented in Matlab with Psychtoolbox20,21.  The task is presented on a 24 inch, 1920x1080 pixel monitor running at 100 Hz.\n\nStimuli are presented on a grey background (RGB = 0.5, 0.5, 0.5). A fixation target is presented at the centre of the screen throughout the trial. It consists of a filled black circle (0.5\u00b0 diameter) with a white cross inside (width: 0.15\u00b0). To signal trial onset and to encourage fixation, a black dot (0.15\u00b0 diameter) appears inside the fixation target 300 ms before the onset of the memory array. The memory array consists of two oriented, coloured bars inside circles (diameter: 6\u00b0, width: 0.3\u00b0). The colours are picked at random without replacement out of four possible colours on each trial: red (RGB: 153, 0, 27), purple (122, 39, 150), green (16, 83, 0), and blue (0, 72, 136), chosen to be isoluminant in CieLab space. On every trial, the orientation of each stimulus is randomly selected without replacement from a uniform distribution of 160 orientation angles between 1.1250 and 180 degrees. The two WM items are presented laterally 6\u00b0 from the fixation target. For the incidental task, participants are presented with a colour cue appearing around the fixation target (diameter: 1\u00b0, width: 0.5\u00b0). The probe is a tilted bar inside a circle (6\u00b0; same size as memory items) and matches the colour of the probed memory item. The orientation angle of the probe is selected at random on each trial between 1 and 180 degrees. The probe is presented 6\u00b0 above or below the fixation target, with equal probability, pseudorandomised for the full experimental session. This type of probe display has been reported to reduce the risk of stimulus-specific eye-movements22. Feedback of the correct target orientation is presented as a white line on top of their reported orientation for comparison.\n\nEEG data acquisition\nElectroencephalography (EEG) is recorded at a sampling rate of 1kHz using Synamps amplifiers (Neuroscan, Inc., Albany, CA) and Curry Neuroimaging Suite (v7.0.12 X) software. Sixty-one electrodes are positioned according to the 10-10 system23. Eye movements are recorded from bipolar EOG derivations from electrodes above and below the right eye (vertical) and lateral to each eye (horizontal). A ground electrode is placed on the left elbow and the left mastoid is used as the active reference. \n\nIn addition, we record participants\u2019 eye movements using an eye tracking camera (EyeLink) tracking at least one eye at a rate of 1kHz.\n\nAnalyses\n\nBehavior\nOur behavioural measures of interest are mean absolute error from the target angle and median response initiation times (henceforth RT).  We will perform paired samples t-tests (one-tailed) to test for a main effect of congruency for both measures. We predict that mean absolute error and median RTs will be significantly lower for congruent relative to incongruent trials. \n\nTo explore the sources of errors, we will also fit a swap model to the data24. The model is an extension of the Zhang &amp; Luck (2008)25 model and estimates the precision, target rate, non-target rate and guess rate of responses. As above, we will perform paired samples t-tests (two-tailed) for each measure to test for a main effect of congruency. \n\nPreprocessing of eye-movement data \nThe EyeLink EDF file is converted to ASCII format and read into Matlab using the Fieldtrip toolbox26. The data is epoched around the onset of the WM array (-1 to 4 seconds). We will take the mean of the right and the left eye and downsample the data to 500 Hz. Eye-blinks will be detected (zeros in the eye-position data) and interpolated from -100 to +100 ms around the blink onset and offset using linear interpolation.\n\nEEG Preprocessing\nPreprocessing of the EEG data will be performed in Matlab using the Fieldtrip toolbox26. The ERPs are re-referenced offline to the mean of the right and left mastoid and down-sampled to 500 Hz. We will apply a high-pass filter of 0.1 Hz and a low-pass filter of 40 Hz to all channels.  The data will be epoched around the onset of the WM array (-1 to 4 seconds). We will perform ICA to remove any heartbeat artefacts and/or artefacts due to eye-blinks. Artefact rejection will be performed separately for the time-window following WM array onset (0-1 s) and the cue onset (1-2.5 s). We will mark epochs with a high degree of variance using the Fieldtrip summary plot for visual artefact rejection and further mark epochs that exceed a cut-off threshold of 50 of the z-transformed value of the pre-processed data to detect any large artefacts due to muscle movements. We will further exclude epochs with saccades identified from the eye-tracking data. In case eye-tracking data is missing, we will visually inspect EOGs to reject saccade epochs.\n\nWe will exclude participants with fewer than 80% of epochs remaining following artefact rejection from further analyses. We expect to reject about 5% of trials on average per participant, based on the experiment used for computing our power analyses27.\n\nTime frequency decomposition and alpha lateralization\nTo test whether a centrally presented, non-predictive colour cue draws spatial attention to the original position of the cued item, we will compute the alpha lateralization index relative to the cued item in the time window after incidental cue onset (1.2\u20131.8 s; to avoid carry over from probe onset). Spectral decomposition of the data will be performed in Matlab with the FieldTrip toolbox26. We will apply Hanning tapers with a time window width of five cycles per frequency, with frequencies of interest between 8 Hz and 14 Hz in steps of 1 Hz. We will log-transform the power at each frequency (10*log10) and calculate the mean power over contralateral and ipsilateral posterior channels (P8/7, P6/5, P4/3, PO8/7, PO4/3, O2/1) relative to the cued and uncued item. To get a lateralization index we will take the difference between contralateral and ipsilateral alpha power averaged over the specified time-window and test for significant lateralization using a one-sample t-test (one-tailed, &gt;0).\n\nGaze bias analysis\nA recent study has shown that human gaze may be biased toward attended spatial locations in WM17. Here, we will similarly use gaze bias as an index of spatial attention towards the original position of the cued item. If spatial attention is drawn to the original position of the incidentally cued item, we expect horizontal gaze position to be biased toward the left (i.e. negative values) for left cue trials and toward the right (i.e. positive values) for right cue trials. First, we will centre the data to the mean position during fixation (300\u2013100 ms before stimulus onset). We will then normalize the data according to the eccentricity of the memory items, so +/-100% corresponds to the eyes being focused on the original position of the memory items (e.g. 6 dva) and 0% corresponds to fixation. We will plot the horizontal gaze position following incidental cue onset separately for left and right cue trials. To obtain an aggregate measure of \u2018towardness\u201917, we will take the mean gaze position for right cue trials minus the mean gaze position for left cue trials, divided by two, averaged across the time-window following incidental cue onset (1.2\u20131.8). We will test for significant gaze bias toward the cued item (i.e. \u2018towardness\u2019) using a one-sample t-test (one-tailed, &gt;0). \n\nOrientation decoding\nTo test whether the patterns of activity in the EEG channels contain information about the orientation angles of the items in memory, we will use Mahalanobis distance to calculate the trial-wise distances between the multidimensional activity at each time point for each of the 160 possible orientation angles in memory, grouped into 16 angle bins distributed around a 180 degree angle space. The left and right memory items will be decoded separately and independently for each participant. As in Wolff et al. (2017), we will perform the analyses on the 17 posterior channels (P7, P5, P3, P1, Pz, P2, P4, P6, P8, PO7, PO3, POz, PO4, PO8, O1, Oz and O2). \n\nThe decoding procedure will follow an 8-fold cross-validation approach to calculate the decoding accuracy of the orientation of interest for each trial. The activity pattern of the trials of the testing fold at a particular time-point will be compared to the trials of k-1 training folds. The trials of the training folds are averaged into 16 orientation bins relative to the test trial orientation, each bin containing trials with orientations within a range of 11.25\u00b0 (variable bins, see below). As we expect to exclude trials due to artefacts, we will ensure equal trial-numbers in each bin by random subsampling. We will compute the pairwise Mahalanobis distances between the test trials and each of the orientation bins using the covariance matrix estimated from trials in the k-1 training folds, using a shrinkage estimator28. To obtain a visual representation of a tuning curve, the 16 distances will be ordered as a function of orientation difference, mean-centered, and sign-reversed, so higher values represent greater similarity between the test trial and the training set. This will be repeated for all train and test fold combinations. To obtain reliable estimates, the above procedure will be repeated 100 times (with random folds each time), separately for two orientation spaces (bin centres: 5.625\u00b0 to 174.015\u00b0 and 11.25\u00b0 to 180\u00b0, each in steps of 11.25\u00b0), and averaged across the resulting 200 samples for each of the 16 Mahalanobis distance values at each time-point.\n\nFinally, to obtain a summary measure of decoding accuracy, we will compute the cosine-weighted means of the tuning curves12,27, and compute the mean of the resulting 16 values. Higher values will reflect greater orientation tuning and thereby greater decoding accuracy for that trial. We will take the mean over trials, resulting in a single decoding value for each time-point for each participant.\n\nTo test for significant orientation decoding of the two items in memory following the onset of the WM array of the incidental cue, we will take the mean decoding accuracy within the time-window following array onset (0\u20131 s) and following cue onset (1\u20132 s). During the WM array window, we expect significant orientation decoding for both items. We will use one sample t-tests, to test for significant decoding of each item (one-tailed, &gt;0). During the cue window, we expect orientation decoding to be significant for the cued item. We expect orientation decoding for the uncued item to be significantly lower than the cued item. Again, we will use one sample t-tests, to test for significant decoding of each item (one-tailed, &gt;0) and paired sample t-tests (one-tailed, cued&gt;uncued) to test for any difference in decoding for the two items. \n\nFor completeness, we will also test for significant decoding of each memory item and for any difference between them at each time-point (one-sample t-test, one-tailed, &gt;0, paired samples t-test, two-tailed) using a cluster-based permutation test (10,000 permutations) to correct for multiple comparisons over time. We will use a cluster-forming and cluster significance threshold of p &lt;.05. \n\nPower analyses\nWe have based our power analyses on a previous dataset that decodes the orientation angles of two items in WM using EEG (Experiment 1, Wolff et al., 2017)27. We have re-analysed the data using the same methods as will be used in this study. Based on these analyses, we expect the effect size for detecting a difference in orientation decoding accuracy between the cued and uncued item to be d = 0.43. Consequently, in this study, to detect an estimated effect size of 0.43 with a power of 0.8 using a paired samples t-test (one-tailed, cued &gt; uncued), we will need a total sample size of n = 35. Power calculations were performed using G*Power29.\n\nReferences\n1.\tBaddeley, A. D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 4, 829\u2013839 (2003).\n2.\tBundesen, C. Psychol.

In particular, the division between Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. is incredibly acrimonious and damaging for American society as a whole. Researchers have not found an effective intervention that can easily be introduced on a large scale to reduce affective polarization, but there have recently been attempts to investigate the effect of contemplative practices.\n\nPetersen &amp; Mitkidis (2019) did not find support for the hypothesis that a brief mindfulness intervention reduces political intolerance, but a brief befriending intervention is likely to have an observable effect on intergroup attitudes and emotions since compassion-based programs have a greater impact on compassionate skills (e.g. identification with all humanity and empathic concern) than mindfulness-based programs (Brito-Pons 2018).\n\nThe aim of this project is to assess whether brief contemplative practice interventions can reduce affective polarization between Democrats and Republicans in the U.S.", "q4": "H1: Trait compassion (but not trait mindfulness) will negatively correlate with baseline affective polarization scores.\n\nH2: Participants in the befriending condition will have a greater reduction in affective polarization than participants in the mindfulness and control conditions.", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Therefore, we will look for relationships between demographic variables (age, gender, and education) and the composite affective polarization measure.\n\nIt is possible that the contemplative practices, mindfulness meditation and befriending meditation, will affect the individual measures that comprise the composite affective polarization measure (warm/cold feelings, trait ratings, and trust) to different extents. Therefore, we will examine the effect of the contemplative practice condition on the individual affective polarization measures independently by performing paired-samples t-tests (comparing scores at time one and time two).\n\nThe effect(s) of contemplative practices on affective polarization may differ depending on the participant\u2019s previous meditation experience. For example, individuals who meditate regularly may not exhibit a change in affective polarization scores at time two, relative to baseline (time one scores). To assess whether previous meditation experience moderates the effect(s) of contemplative practices on affective polarization we will categorize individuals as either novices (never practice meditation) or meditators (practice meditation at least once per month) and examine the effects of contemplative practices on affective polarization for each group.\n\nThe effect(s) of contemplative practices on affective polarization may be moderated by the strength of party identification. For example, individuals who do not identify strongly with their favored political party may not exhibit a change in affective polarization scores at time two, relative to baseline (time one scores). To assess whether strength of party identification moderates the effect(s) of contemplative practices on affective polarization we will categorize individuals as either strong identifiers or weak identifiers by performing a median split and examine the effects of contemplative practices on affective polarization for each group.\n\nWe will assess whether the difference in hypothetical helping for Democrats and Republicans at time one correlates with baseline scores on trait compassion, mindfulness and affective polarization by performing bivariate and partial correlations. We will also examine whether there is an effect of the contemplative practice (between-subjects) condition on hypothetical helping of Democrats and Republicans.", "q25": "References:\nBrito-Pons, G., Campos, D., &amp; Cebolla, A.

Several guidelines stress the importance of direct observation of the trainee\u2019s competence (see for example, Borders, 2014). Besides audio- or videotape supervision, where the supervision is based on recorded therapy sessions, another approach is the so-called live supervision (LS). In LS, the supervisor observes the session of the trainee directly (e.g. via camera connection, one-way mirror) and offers immediate feedback and support, but also intervenes and corrects the procedure of the trainee if necessary (e.g. via microphone, text messages, phone-ins). \n\nInitial randomized controlled studies provide evidence that LS might be at least as effective as supervision as usual to improve therapeutic skills (J. L. Smith et al., 2012; Weck et al., 2016). It might be particularly effective when skills of trainees are low (Carpenter, 2012) or when trainees show reduced problem actuation (Probst et al., 2018). More qualitative study designs found that LS strengthens trust in one\u2019s own competences (Andrews &amp; Harris, 2017) and that therapists find the feedback from LS less frightening than from traditional supervision (Carmel et al., 2016). Despite these promising findings, most evidence so far is grounded on qualitative studies and the validity of the few quantitative studies is often limited due to a number of methodological problems (e.g. small samples, no control groups, no objective competence assessment; diverse approaches and outcomes, LS combined with other training methods, uncertainties on what was done in LS). \n\nThus, further experimental studies on live supervision are needed. Therefore, we will use a randomized controlled study design to examine the effects of LS on psychology students in comparison to a no-LS condition.\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "The main objective of this trial is to test the efficacy of live-supervision in terms of improved therapeutic competencies of novice therapists.

More precisely, there will be four measurement points (Table 1): before (t1) and after (t2) the first therapy session (Baseline) as well as before (t3) and after (t4) the second therapy session (Main assessment). Table 1 provides an overview on the outcome variables and time points used in the study process. We created all surveys using the software SoSci-Survey\u00ae. \n\nScreening for eligibility criteria. Eligibility criteria will be presented to participants for self-assessment before they make an appointment and will be checked again by the experimenter in the laboratory.\n\nPrimary outcome. The primary outcome will be the level of therapeutic competences shown in the therapy sessions (t2, t4) as judged by independent raters. \n\nTherapist competence. We will apply three measurements to assess therapist competence. First, the German version of the Competence Therapy Scale (Weck et al., 2010; Young &amp; Beck, 1980) will be used, which consists of 14 items with a 7-point rating scale format: 0 = poor, 1 = barely adequate, 2 = mediocre, 3 = satisfactory, 4 = good, 5 = very good, and 6 = excellent. Two items (i.e., Item 12: Selection of appropriate strategies and Item 13: Appropriate implementation of techniques) will be excluded as they are considered to be difficult to judge given the specific task in this study. On average, Cronbach\u2019s Alpha is good, \u03b1 = 0.86, and the interrater rater reliability varies between fair to excellent, ICC = 0.42 \u2013 0.97 (K\u00fchne et al., 2019).\nSecond, a short version of the Clinical Communication Skills Scale (CCSS-S; Maa\u00df et al., in prep.) will be applied. The original scale (CCSS; K\u00fchne et al., in prep.) measures basic clinical communication skills with 37 items on a 4-point rating scale ranging from 1 = extremely inadequate to 4 = extremely adequate. In case any item cannot be rated, the option \u201cnot applicable\u201d can be used. In addition, one item evaluates the overall impression of therapeutic communication on a 6-point rating scale ranging from 1 = insufficient to 6 = very good. Internal consistency is very high, \u03b1 = 0.90. The CCSS-S contains 15 items and will be validated. Example items are \u201cThe therapist summarizes results (in between, at the end.\u201d and \u201cThe therapist uses open questions to motivate the patient to talk\u201d.\nThird, following the additional item of the CCSS, four items will be presented to evaluate the overall impression of the participant\u2019s general therapeutic skills (GTS) in communication, empathy, and ability to form a trustworthy alliance (6-point rating scale ranging from 1 = insufficient to 6 = very good; e.g.).\n\nSecondary outcomes. The secondary outcomes contain variables based on the self-, supervisor- and SP-ratings. Therefore, depending on the perspective and the measurement point (t1-t4), the wording of the according items will be slightly adjusted. For example, while the supervisor judges the item \u201cThink about the session you just observed. How do you evaluate the communication skills of the therapist overall?\u201d, participants judge the item \u201cThink about your last session. How do you evaluate your communication skills overall?\u201d. See Table 1 for an overview of the measurement points and the different perspectives for each instrument. \nTherapist Competence. Three items of the CTS (i.e., Setting the Agenda, Discussing Homework, Response to questions and problems), the CCSS-S as well as the GTS will be chosen to capture therapist competence. \n\nEmpathy and alliance. To examine the actual expressed empathy and therapeutic alliance in session, the German version of the Patient\u2019s Report of the Therapy Session (PRTS; Partschefeld et al., 2013; Persons &amp; Burns, 1985) will be applied. The 10-item questionnaire assesses the interpersonal relationship between therapist and patients focusing on warmth, trust, and empathy. The scale is 4-pointed, ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree. Example items are \u201cThe things my therapist says and does make me feel I can trust him.\u201c or \u201cHe understands my words, but not the way I feel.\u201c Partschefeld et al. (2013) report good internal consistencies between \uf061 = .84 and \uf061 = .89 and ICCs between .82 and .85 (depending on time point and study group in their study). \n\nState anxiety. The short version of the Test Anxiety Inventory (Hodapp, 1991; TAI-GS; Wacker et al., 2008) is a 15-item self-report measure to examine test anxiety with the subscales emotionality (i.e., the perception of one\u2019s own arousal; four items; \uf061 = .85; e.g., \u201cI feel anxious\u201d), worry (i.e., thoughts focusing task demands, failure and its consequences; five items; \uf061 = .86; e.g., \u201cI am worried about my performance\u201d), confidence (three items; \uf061 = .82; e.g., \u201cI know that I can rely on myself\u201d), and interference (i.e., irrelevant thoughts that impede with the focus on the task; three items; \uf061 = .77; e.g., \u201cI suddenly have thoughts in my head that block me.\u201d). A four-point rating scale will be used (1 = \u201cdo not agree at all\u201d, 4 = \u201cagree completely\u201d). The authors report a satisfactory Cronbach\u2019s alpha of  \uf061 = .89 for the total score in a German sample of college students. \n\nState self-efficacy. The confidence subscale of the original version of the Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI-G; Hodapp, 1991) will serve as a proxy to assess therapist self-efficacy. The subscale consists of six items. The reported internal consistency is very good, \uf061 = .90. \n\nUsefulness of feedback on observed skills (UFOS). We developed a new scale to examine the subjective usefulness of feedback on the therapist\u2019s demonstrated skills within observational supervision formats. The usefulness of such feedback is defined as the extent to which the supervisee thinks that the feedback induces a discernible improvement of therapeutically relevant aspects and does more good than harm. The items and subscales were derived from quantitative and qualitative literature in the field of supervision research (Alfonsson et al., 2018; Bartle-Haring et al., 2009; Bender &amp; Dykeman, 2016; Berger, 2004; Carmel et al., 2016; Champe &amp; Kleist, 2003; Efstation, 1990; Carol A Falender, 2014; Carol A. Falender &amp; Shafranske, 2014; Getzelman, 2003; Gonsalvez et al., 2016; Gray et al., 2001; Hendrickson et al., 2002; Jakob et al., 2013, 2015; Kilminster et al., 2007; Ladany, 2007; Lehrman-Waterman &amp; Ladany, 2001; Livni et al., 2012; Machuca, 2015; Palomo, 2010; Probst et al., 2018; Rizvi et al., 2016; Rousmaniere &amp; Frederickson, 2013; Rousmaniere &amp; Renfro-Michel, 2016; Scherl &amp; Haley, 2000; Wark, 1995a, 1995b; Watkins, 2014; Weck et al., 2016; West &amp; Pinsoneault, 1993; Wilson et al., 2016; Wong, 1997; Worthen, 2004; G. Zarbock et al., 2011; Gerhard Zarbock et al., 2009). We created two versions, one for live- and one for delayed feedback. The first item pool included 32 items that were further revised based on the feedback of two psychologists and two non-psychologists regarding item comprehensibility. The final versions share 22 items and contain five subscales with additional seven items being unique for live feedback. Except for two items with an open answer format, a 6-point-rating scale is used (1 = completely disagree, 6 = completely agree). Only the version for live feedback is used in this study and is described in the following.\nThe subscale \u201eImprovement of therapeutic skills\u201c measures the extent to which the feedback (a) contributed to an improvement of therapeutic skills within the session (five items, e.g., \u201cDue to the feedback I could improve my communication within the session.\u201d), (b) will contribute to an improvement in the future (five items, example item: \u201eDue to the feedback I now know how to structure the session better in future.\u201d), or (c) contributed to insights into one\u2019s own strength and weaknesses (two items, e.g., \u201cI now know my strengths.\u201d).\nThe subscale \u201eCharacteristics of the received feedback\u201c measures the quantity, type, purpose, and feasibility of the feedback. (nine items, e.g., \u201eI found the suggestions useful.\u201c or \u201cI was able to implement the suggestions.\u201d). Two open-ended items ask for suggestions that were difficult to implement and what the supervisee would have wished for regarding the feedback.\nTwo items each assess the scales \u201cSupervisory Alliance\u201c (e.g., \u201eI had the impression that the supervisor treated me on equal terms.\u201c), \u201cEvaluation of being observed\u201c (i.e., wellbeing and cognitive load during the observational supervision e.g., \u201eI felt comfortable being observed by the supervisor.\u201c), and \u201eIntention of use\u201c (i.e., intention to use an observational supervision in the future, e.g., \u201eI would use this kind of supervision in psychotherapy training if it was available.\u201c).\n\nUsefulness of repetition. It is highly likely that all participants will perform better in the main assessments since they repeat the task. However, live feedback in the EG is expected to improve the skills beyond this repetition effect. To separate the LS effect from a mere repetition effect, we will ask all participants for their personal opinion on the impact of both. Thus, we took three subscales of the UFOS (i.e., 16 items) and rephrased them to stress the repetition effect: The subscales \u201eImprovement of therapeutic skills\u201c (12 items, e.g., \u201cDue to the repetition, I could improve my communication within the session.\u201d), \u201cEvaluation of being observed\u201c (two items, example item: \u201eI felt comfortable being observed.\u201c), and \u201eIntention of use\u201c (two items, e.g.: \u201eI would use the opportunity to repeat standardized therapy situations in psychotherapy training if it was available.\u201c).\n\nAdherence. The adherence to the acting script (SP) and the guidelines (Supervisor) will be examined using own adherence scales. \nSupervisor adherence will be assessed with four items on a 3-point rating scale (not adherent, partly adherent, adherent): (1) \u201cThe supervisor has provided suggestions on the agreed points (i.e., setting an agenda, discuss the homework, improve communication / relationships) and has not introduced any other interventions.\u201d, (2) \u201cThe supervisor has given brief instructions (max. 9 words).\u201d, (3) \u201cThe supervisor has provided concrete, behavior-related suggestions (participant should do something or say something).\u201d, and (4) \u201cThe supervisor provided positive feedback.\u201d Eighty percent adherence will be considered sufficient (i.e., 10 of 12 possible points).\nSP adherence will be assessed with 12 items checklist that ask whether a certain behavior was or was not shown by the SP (e.g., \u201cis unsure if therapy will do her any good\u201d, \u201ctries to elaborate on many topics\u201d, \u201cis motivated to adjust her sleep behavior and to try out new things\u201d etc.). Eighty percent adherence will be considered sufficient (i.e., 10 of 12 possible points).\nControl variables. The demographic information (i.e., age, gender, course of study, university degree, current semester) and the prior therapeutic experiences will be assessed before the first therapeutic sessions.\n\nTherapeutic experience. We developed eight items that assess current (five items, e.g., \u201cMy friends/family seek comfort and/or advice from me for their problems.\u201d) and prior (three items; e.g., \u201cWithin the last five years, I have completed internships in a consulting or therapeutic setting.\u201d) therapeutic or counselling experience (rating scale: 1= never, 2= at least 1/year, 3= 2-10/year, 4 =at least 1/month, 5= at least 1/week).\n\nInterview. The semi-structured interview consists of five deductive categories with 27 questions in total: (1) Learning results (five questions), (2) Motivational aspects that are based on Expectancy-Value Theory of Achievement Motivation (Wigfield &amp; Eccles, 2000) and that are related to performance (i.e., self-efficacy, importance of task, intrinsic value, extrinsic value, costs; 7 questions), (3) LS or repetition as training methods (nine questions), (4) application of LS (3 questions), and (5) harms or side effects of participation (1 question). The interviews will last between 30 and 45 minutes.\n\nData Management and Storage\nPersonal data. The storage and evaluation of the study-related data is carried out according to legal provisions without the participants name or IP address. As part of the registration process, participants can voluntarily provide their telephone number or email. This information will be used to reschedule appointments only. For the experiment, participants generate an 8-numbered personal code (letters and numbers), which is linked to a study code that will be used for the questionnaires and hence, in the data set. This pseudo-anonymization (using a personal code and a study code) will be saved in a coding list, which exists on paper and only in one version. As long as the coding list exists, the study participants will be able to request the deletion of all data collected from them based on their personal code. The personal codes will be deleted after data collection. Then, all data of the study will be completely anonymous and the personal data of participants can no longer be identified. The video and audio recordings will be deleted after the independent ratings and transcriptions will be completed. The transcription will be anonymized using the study code. We will store the digital data set on secured servers at Potsdam University for at least ten years. After expiration of the retention obligation, we will delete the data set. \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "All outcome or dependent variables will be analyzed using sum scores (i.e., total scale scores or subscale scores)."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q19": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Statistical Analyses\nPreliminary analyses.

Cronbach\u2019s Alpha will be calculated to judge the internal consistencies of the measurements.\n\nMain analyses. We will use a series of ANCOVAs and LMMs to test the main hypotheses. O\u2019Connell et al. (2017) conclude that the ANCOVA model is the most powerful method to analyse pre-post control group designs in the case that missing data are completely at random (MCAR) or that there are no missing data. However, in case of missings at random (MAR), linear mixed models (LMM) may be superior. Consequently, we will test for the distribution of missings using the MissMech package. In case of MCAR, we will calculate ANCOVAs for those variables that are assessed twice (i.e., pre-post design; judge-based ratings). In case of MAR, we will calculate LMMs. Also, we will use LMMs for analyses including at least three measurement points (i.e., therapist-based ratings). \n\nTraining effects. To examine the overall training effect of conducting the same therapy session twice, we will calculate one LMM using data from both measurement points of the total sample, allowing for random intercepts and controlling for PHE.\n\nANCOVA. We will use ANCOVAs to examine the group differences over time for those outcome measures that will be assessed twice (i.e., at baseline and main assessment; the judge-based CTS, CCSS, GTC, EAS). The scores from the main assessment (t4) will be the dependent variables, the group variable (i.e., EG = 1 vs. CG = 0) will be the independent variable and the baseline scores (t2) as well as PHE will be the control variables.\n\nLMM. We will use LMMs to examine the group differences over time for those outcome measures that will be assessed at least three times (i.e., before (t1) and after (2) baseline and before (t3) and after (t4) main assessment; the therapist-based CCSS, GTC, EAS, TAI-GS). The study group will be at Level-2 (i.e., CG = 0, EG = 1) as will be the sum scores from the PHE, which will be grand-mean centered, to control for previous therapeutic experiences. Time will be at Level-1 (first measurement point coded = 0). At first, we will fit an unconditional model, then a model with random intercepts and finally, a random-intercepts-random-slopes model. We will compare the models regarding their model fits using \uf0632 statistic and calculate the ICC, as well as the Pseudo-R2.\n\nEffect sizes. We will apply Cohen\u2019s d as the effect sizes for the time-effect (i.e., pre-post) and the Time x Group interaction. Effect sizes will be calculated according to Morris and DeShon (2002) for simple pre-post effects and Morris (2008) for pre-post control group designs. Cohen\u2019s d will be defined as small (d &lt; 0.50), moderate (0.50 \uf0a3 d \uf0a3 0.80), or large (d &gt; 0.80; Cohen, 1988).\n\nMixed-Methods Approach\nTo answer Research Questions 3 and 4, we will combine qualitative (i.e., qualitative content analysis) and quantitative (i.e., frequency analyses) methodologies.\n\nQualitative content analysis. The aim of qualitative content analysis (QCA) is to extract the manifest content of qualitative text material through categorization (D\u00f6ring &amp; Bortz, 2016). Using the MAXQDA 2020 (VERBI Software, 2019), we will apply QCA (a) to the transcripts of the interviews, and (b) to the live-supervisor\u2019s written feedback. We will base the analyses on recommendations of R\u00e4diker and Kuckartz (2019).\n\nInterviews. The interviews will be audio-taped, transcribed by two undergraduate students following the \u201ctranscription rules\u201d that are described by Kuckartz and R\u00e4diker (2019), and anonymized afterwards. The final transcripts will be content analyzed based on an inductive-deductive procedure. The deductive categories are the interview\u2019s main themes (research questions): (1) Learning results from the experiment (RQ: What did the participants learn?), (2) Motivational aspects, that are based on the Expectation-Value Theory of Achievement Motivation (Wigfield &amp; Eccles, 2000) and that are related to performance, such as, self-efficacy, importance of task, intrinsic value, extrinsic value, and costs (RQ: What was their motivation during the experiment?), (3) Feedback on LS and the supervisory suggestions or feedback on repetition as training method (RQ: How did they evaluate repetition of practice and LS as training methods? How useful are both?), and (4) Harms or side effects of participation (RQ: Did the tasks lead to any harm or side effects?). The inductive approach will then be used to identify sub-categories. At first, we will conduct a within-case analysis, and afterwards, a cross-case analysis. \nThe within-case analysis is sequential, which means that an interview transcript is worked through from front to back to gather an initial rough understanding of the text. Then, the rater begins the process of coding (i.e., to categorize each analysis unit with respect to the research questions), whereby the level of abstraction can vary between one sentence and a statement comprising several sentences. Each code will be recorded in a code list and will be explained by a code book (e.g., definition of codes, differentiation from similar codes, rules for the application of the codes). Once a code or a category will be created, the next eligible unit will be either subsumed in it (if it will meet the definition of the category), or a new category will be created. In addition, a case summary of each interviewee (i.e., a summary of the most important results) will be created. At first, both raters will read three transcripts to familiarize themselves with the data. Then, a preliminary coding system including sub-categories will be developed and discussed with the first author. After another three transcripts the coding system will be refined, again. \nThe cross-case analysis aims to further refine the categories (e.g. to connect codes to subordinate categories). We will use the thematic analysis approach, which summarizes the themes of the research questions across all cases. \n\nWritten Feedback. To answer research question 3, two undergraduate students will analyze the written suggestions of the supervisor. The messages will be content analyzed based on an inductive-deductive procedure. The deductive category is the type of feedback (RQ: What aspects does the supervisor report back?). The process of the QCA will be the same as for the interviews.\n\nQuantitative content analysis. In addition to the QCA, we will also analyze frequencies of each (sub-)category per person and in the total sample. Further, independent rater will watch the videos from the LS sessions and judge the implementation of feedback by the participants (RQ: When and to what extent is the feedback implemented by the participants?) on a 4-point rating scale (0 = not implemented at all, 3 = fully implemented). The time span between message presentation and implementation will be recorded, as well.\n\nInterrater reliability. Two raters will code the interviews and the written feedback. After the process of consensual coding for the first six interviews or feedback is finished, the second raters will code a randomly selected subsample (10%) of the original interviews (approx. n = 6) or feedback (approx. n = 3). To determine the intercoder agreement, Brennan and Prediger (1981) suggest the chance-corrected kappa coefficient that is based on the percentage agreement and the expected agreement by chance. Kappa is judged as \u201csubstantial\u201d when \u0138n \u2265 0.61 and as \u201calmost perfect\u201d when \u0138n \u2265 0.81. \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Categorical variables (i.e., group allocation or Time Points) will be coded so that the control group or the first time point is the reference category.\nPredictors in the LMM will be grand-mean-centered.

Several guidelines stress the importance of direct observation of the trainee\u2019s competence (see for example, Borders, 2014). Besides audio- or videotape supervision, where the supervision is based on recorded therapy sessions, another approach is the so-called live supervision (LS). In LS, the supervisor observes the session of the trainee directly (e.g. via camera connection, one-way mirror) and offers immediate feedback and support, but also intervenes and corrects the procedure of the trainee if necessary (e.g. via microphone, text messages, phone-ins). \n\nInitial randomized controlled studies provide evidence that LS might be at least as effective as supervision as usual to improve therapeutic skills (J. L. Smith et al., 2012; Weck et al., 2016). It might be particularly effective when skills of trainees are low (Carpenter, 2012) or when trainees show reduced problem actuation (Probst et al., 2018). More qualitative study designs found that LS strengthens trust in one\u2019s own competences (Andrews &amp; Harris, 2017) and that therapists find the feedback from LS less frightening than from traditional supervision (Carmel et al., 2016). Despite these promising findings, most evidence so far is grounded on qualitative studies and the validity of the few quantitative studies is often limited due to a number of methodological problems (e.g. small samples, no control groups, no objective competence assessment; diverse approaches and outcomes, LS combined with other training methods, uncertainties on what was done in LS). \n\nThus, further experimental studies on live supervision are needed. Therefore, we will use a randomized controlled study design to examine the effects of LS on psychology students in comparison to a no-LS condition.\n", "q4": "The main objective of this trial is to test the efficacy of live-supervision in terms of improved therapeutic competencies of novice therapists. More precisely, our research questions and according hypotheses are:\n1.\tIs there a difference between subjects in the experimental group (EG) and those who are in the control group (CG) regarding therapeutic skills, empathy, alliance skills, self-efficacy, and anxiety? More precisely, is there a difference between subjects who receive LS (i.e. are instructed directly during a therapy session) and those who do not receive LS?\na.\tSubjects with LS show significantly better psychotherapeutic skills than subjects without LS.\nb.\tSubjects with LS show significantly more empathy and establish better alliances than subjects without LS.\nc.\tSubjects with LS report significantly higher self-efficacy and less anxiety than subjects without LS.\n2.\tIs there a difference between subjects who receive LS and those who do not receive LS regarding the self-perceived skills? Do subjects with LS rate their own therapeutic skills higher, similar, or lower than subjects without LS?\n3.\tWhat aspects does the supervisor report back and are these aspects implemented by the subjects with LS (if yes, to what extent and when)?\n4.\tHow do subjects evaluate repetition of practice and LS as training methods? \na.\tHow useful are (a) the repetition of practice and (b) the LS from the perspectives of the subjects? \nb.\tWhat do they learn? \nc.\tWhat is their motivation during the experiment? \nd.\tDo the tasks lead to any harm or side effects?\n\nWe do not formulate more specific hypotheses for Research Questions 2 to 4 as they are exploratory and qualitative in nature.

After all results will be finalized, the independent researcher will reveal the correct group identification to the authors. \n\nWe pretested whether group allocation could be correctly identified simply by observing the therapists eye movements and communication with 10 practice videos and 7 test persons (i.e., non-/psychologists). Although the judgement was clearly by chance (i.e., kappa = -0.04), we decided to refrained from informing the final raters completely about the study design, because 2 test persons reported to have based their allocation on changes in the conversations right after participants had looked at the screen.

More precisely, there will be four measurement points (Table 1): before (t1) and after (t2) the first therapy session (Baseline) as well as before (t3) and after (t4) the second therapy session (Main assessment). Table 1 provides an overview on the outcome variables and time points used in the study process. We created all surveys using the software SoSci-Survey\u00ae. \n\nScreening for eligibility criteria. Eligibility criteria will be presented to participants for self-assessment before they make an appointment and will be checked again by the experimenter in the laboratory.\n\nPrimary outcome. The primary outcome will be the level of therapeutic competences shown in the therapy sessions (t2, t4) as judged by independent raters. \n\nTherapist competence. We will apply three measurements to assess therapist competence. First, the German version of the Competence Therapy Scale (Weck et al., 2010; Young &amp; Beck, 1980) will be used, which consists of 14 items with a 7-point rating scale format: 0 = poor, 1 = barely adequate, 2 = mediocre, 3 = satisfactory, 4 = good, 5 = very good, and 6 = excellent. Two items (i.e., Item 12: Selection of appropriate strategies and Item 13: Appropriate implementation of techniques) will be excluded as they are considered to be difficult to judge given the specific task in this study. On average, Cronbach\u2019s Alpha is good, \u03b1 = 0.86, and the interrater rater reliability varies between fair to excellent, ICC = 0.42 \u2013 0.97 (K\u00fchne et al., 2019).\nSecond, a short version of the Clinical Communication Skills Scale (CCSS-S; Maa\u00df et al., in prep.) will be applied. The original scale (CCSS; K\u00fchne et al., in prep.) measures basic clinical communication skills with 37 items on a 4-point rating scale ranging from 1 = extremely inadequate to 4 = extremely adequate. In case any item cannot be rated, the option \u201cnot applicable\u201d can be used. In addition, one item evaluates the overall impression of therapeutic communication on a 6-point rating scale ranging from 1 = insufficient to 6 = very good. Internal consistency is very high, \u03b1 = 0.90. The CCSS-S contains 15 items and will be validated. Example items are \u201cThe therapist summarizes results (in between, at the end.\u201d and \u201cThe therapist uses open questions to motivate the patient to talk\u201d.\nThird, following the additional item of the CCSS, four items will be presented to evaluate the overall impression of the participant\u2019s general therapeutic skills (GTS) in communication, empathy, and ability to form a trustworthy alliance (6-point rating scale ranging from 1 = insufficient to 6 = very good; e.g.).\n\nSecondary outcomes. The secondary outcomes contain variables based on the self-, supervisor- and SP-ratings. Therefore, depending on the perspective and the measurement point (t1-t4), the wording of the according items will be slightly adjusted. For example, while the supervisor judges the item \u201cThink about the session you just observed. How do you evaluate the communication skills of the therapist overall?\u201d, participants judge the item \u201cThink about your last session. How do you evaluate your communication skills overall?\u201d. See Table 1 for an overview of the measurement points and the different perspectives for each instrument. \nTherapist Competence. Three items of the CTS (i.e., Setting the Agenda, Discussing Homework, Response to questions and problems), the CCSS-S as well as the GTS will be chosen to capture therapist competence. \n\nEmpathy and alliance. To examine the actual expressed empathy and therapeutic alliance in session, the German version of the Patient\u2019s Report of the Therapy Session (PRTS; Partschefeld et al., 2013; Persons &amp; Burns, 1985) will be applied. The 10-item questionnaire assesses the interpersonal relationship between therapist and patients focusing on warmth, trust, and empathy. The scale is 4-pointed, ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree. Example items are \u201cThe things my therapist says and does make me feel I can trust him.\u201c or \u201cHe understands my words, but not the way I feel.\u201c Partschefeld et al. (2013) report good internal consistencies between \uf061 = .84 and \uf061 = .89 and ICCs between .82 and .85 (depending on time point and study group in their study). \n\nState anxiety. The short version of the Test Anxiety Inventory (Hodapp, 1991; TAI-GS; Wacker et al., 2008) is a 15-item self-report measure to examine test anxiety with the subscales emotionality (i.e., the perception of one\u2019s own arousal; four items; \uf061 = .85; e.g., \u201cI feel anxious\u201d), worry (i.e., thoughts focusing task demands, failure and its consequences; five items; \uf061 = .86; e.g., \u201cI am worried about my performance\u201d), confidence (three items; \uf061 = .82; e.g., \u201cI know that I can rely on myself\u201d), and interference (i.e., irrelevant thoughts that impede with the focus on the task; three items; \uf061 = .77; e.g., \u201cI suddenly have thoughts in my head that block me.\u201d). A four-point rating scale will be used (1 = \u201cdo not agree at all\u201d, 4 = \u201cagree completely\u201d). The authors report a satisfactory Cronbach\u2019s alpha of  \uf061 = .89 for the total score in a German sample of college students. \n\nState self-efficacy. The confidence subscale of the original version of the Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI-G; Hodapp, 1991) will serve as a proxy to assess therapist self-efficacy. The subscale consists of six items. The reported internal consistency is very good, \uf061 = .90. \n\nUsefulness of feedback on observed skills (UFOS). We developed a new scale to examine the subjective usefulness of feedback on the therapist\u2019s demonstrated skills within observational supervision formats. The usefulness of such feedback is defined as the extent to which the supervisee thinks that the feedback induces a discernible improvement of therapeutically relevant aspects and does more good than harm. The items and subscales were derived from quantitative and qualitative literature in the field of supervision research (Alfonsson et al., 2018; Bartle-Haring et al., 2009; Bender &amp; Dykeman, 2016; Berger, 2004; Carmel et al., 2016; Champe &amp; Kleist, 2003; Efstation, 1990; Carol A Falender, 2014; Carol A. Falender &amp; Shafranske, 2014; Getzelman, 2003; Gonsalvez et al., 2016; Gray et al., 2001; Hendrickson et al., 2002; Jakob et al., 2013, 2015; Kilminster et al., 2007; Ladany, 2007; Lehrman-Waterman &amp; Ladany, 2001; Livni et al., 2012; Machuca, 2015; Palomo, 2010; Probst et al., 2018; Rizvi et al., 2016; Rousmaniere &amp; Frederickson, 2013; Rousmaniere &amp; Renfro-Michel, 2016; Scherl &amp; Haley, 2000; Wark, 1995a, 1995b; Watkins, 2014; Weck et al., 2016; West &amp; Pinsoneault, 1993; Wilson et al., 2016; Wong, 1997; Worthen, 2004; G. Zarbock et al., 2011; Gerhard Zarbock et al., 2009). We created two versions, one for live- and one for delayed feedback. The first item pool included 32 items that were further revised based on the feedback of two psychologists and two non-psychologists regarding item comprehensibility. The final versions share 22 items and contain five subscales with additional seven items being unique for live feedback. Except for two items with an open answer format, a 6-point-rating scale is used (1 = completely disagree, 6 = completely agree). Only the version for live feedback is used in this study and is described in the following.\nThe subscale \u201eImprovement of therapeutic skills\u201c measures the extent to which the feedback (a) contributed to an improvement of therapeutic skills within the session (five items, e.g., \u201cDue to the feedback I could improve my communication within the session.\u201d), (b) will contribute to an improvement in the future (five items, example item: \u201eDue to the feedback I now know how to structure the session better in future.\u201d), or (c) contributed to insights into one\u2019s own strength and weaknesses (two items, e.g., \u201cI now know my strengths.\u201d).\nThe subscale \u201eCharacteristics of the received feedback\u201c measures the quantity, type, purpose, and feasibility of the feedback. (nine items, e.g., \u201eI found the suggestions useful.\u201c or \u201cI was able to implement the suggestions.\u201d). Two open-ended items ask for suggestions that were difficult to implement and what the supervisee would have wished for regarding the feedback.\nTwo items each assess the scales \u201cSupervisory Alliance\u201c (e.g., \u201eI had the impression that the supervisor treated me on equal terms.\u201c), \u201cEvaluation of being observed\u201c (i.e., wellbeing and cognitive load during the observational supervision e.g., \u201eI felt comfortable being observed by the supervisor.\u201c), and \u201eIntention of use\u201c (i.e., intention to use an observational supervision in the future, e.g., \u201eI would use this kind of supervision in psychotherapy training if it was available.\u201c).\n\nUsefulness of repetition. It is highly likely that all participants will perform better in the main assessments since they repeat the task. However, live feedback in the EG is expected to improve the skills beyond this repetition effect. To separate the LS effect from a mere repetition effect, we will ask all participants for their personal opinion on the impact of both. Thus, we took three subscales of the UFOS (i.e., 16 items) and rephrased them to stress the repetition effect: The subscales \u201eImprovement of therapeutic skills\u201c (12 items, e.g., \u201cDue to the repetition, I could improve my communication within the session.\u201d), \u201cEvaluation of being observed\u201c (two items, example item: \u201eI felt comfortable being observed.\u201c), and \u201eIntention of use\u201c (two items, e.g.: \u201eI would use the opportunity to repeat standardized therapy situations in psychotherapy training if it was available.\u201c).\n\nAdherence. The adherence to the acting script (SP) and the guidelines (Supervisor) will be examined using own adherence scales. \nSupervisor adherence will be assessed with four items on a 3-point rating scale (not adherent, partly adherent, adherent): (1) \u201cThe supervisor has provided suggestions on the agreed points (i.e., setting an agenda, discuss the homework, improve communication / relationships) and has not introduced any other interventions.\u201d, (2) \u201cThe supervisor has given brief instructions (max. 9 words).\u201d, (3) \u201cThe supervisor has provided concrete, behavior-related suggestions (participant should do something or say something).\u201d, and (4) \u201cThe supervisor provided positive feedback.\u201d Eighty percent adherence will be considered sufficient (i.e., 10 of 12 possible points).\nSP adherence will be assessed with 12 items checklist that ask whether a certain behavior was or was not shown by the SP (e.g., \u201cis unsure if therapy will do her any good\u201d, \u201ctries to elaborate on many topics\u201d, \u201cis motivated to adjust her sleep behavior and to try out new things\u201d etc.). Eighty percent adherence will be considered sufficient (i.e., 10 of 12 possible points).\nControl variables. The demographic information (i.e., age, gender, course of study, university degree, current semester) and the prior therapeutic experiences will be assessed before the first therapeutic sessions.\n\nTherapeutic experience. We developed eight items that assess current (five items, e.g., \u201cMy friends/family seek comfort and/or advice from me for their problems.\u201d) and prior (three items; e.g., \u201cWithin the last five years, I have completed internships in a consulting or therapeutic setting.\u201d) therapeutic or counselling experience (rating scale: 1= never, 2= at least 1/year, 3= 2-10/year, 4 =at least 1/month, 5= at least 1/week).\n\nInterview. The semi-structured interview consists of five deductive categories with 27 questions in total: (1) Learning results (five questions), (2) Motivational aspects that are based on Expectancy-Value Theory of Achievement Motivation (Wigfield &amp; Eccles, 2000) and that are related to performance (i.e., self-efficacy, importance of task, intrinsic value, extrinsic value, costs; 7 questions), (3) LS or repetition as training methods (nine questions), (4) application of LS (3 questions), and (5) harms or side effects of participation (1 question). The interviews will last between 30 and 45 minutes.\n\nData Management and Storage\nPersonal data. The storage and evaluation of the study-related data is carried out according to legal provisions without the participants name or IP address. As part of the registration process, participants can voluntarily provide their telephone number or email. This information will be used to reschedule appointments only. For the experiment, participants generate an 8-numbered personal code (letters and numbers), which is linked to a study code that will be used for the questionnaires and hence, in the data set. This pseudo-anonymization (using a personal code and a study code) will be saved in a coding list, which exists on paper and only in one version. As long as the coding list exists, the study participants will be able to request the deletion of all data collected from them based on their personal code. The personal codes will be deleted after data collection. Then, all data of the study will be completely anonymous and the personal data of participants can no longer be identified. The video and audio recordings will be deleted after the independent ratings and transcriptions will be completed. The transcription will be anonymized using the study code. We will store the digital data set on secured servers at Potsdam University for at least ten years. After expiration of the retention obligation, we will delete the data set. \n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "All outcome or dependent variables will be analyzed using sum scores (i.e., total scale scores or subscale scores).", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Statistical Analyses\nPreliminary analyses. All analyses will be conducted with R (RStudio Team, 2015). All outcome variables will be analyzed using sum scores (i.e., total scale scores or subscale scores).\n\nParticipants. We will present means, standard deviations (SD), and frequencies on the demographics of the total sample, by study group (i.e., EG vs. CG), and by completer status (i.e., completer versus dropouts). We do not expect any differences between the study groups due the randomization. Thus, we will not conduct significance tests (de Boer et al., 2015; Moher et al., 2010). In addition, we expect a relatively low dropout rate of about 5% (n = 4) and thus, we will not test for significance between completers and dropouts.\n\nRater agreement. Interrater reliability (i.e., rater judged CTS, CCSS, EAS, GTC, and SV adherence) will be analyzed based on intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) using model 2, ICC(2, n) (Shrout &amp; Fleiss, 1979). The mean of both ratings will be used in the subsequent analyses.\n\tAdherence. Descriptive statistics (in %, M, SD, Range) for SP and SV adherence will be calculated and tested for significant differences between the study groups. We do not expect any significant differences and thus, we will use equivalence testing using the TOSTER package in R (Lakens, 2017).\n\nReliability. Cronbach\u2019s Alpha will be calculated to judge the internal consistencies of the measurements.\n\nMain analyses. We will use a series of ANCOVAs and LMMs to test the main hypotheses. O\u2019Connell et al. (2017) conclude that the ANCOVA model is the most powerful method to analyse pre-post control group designs in the case that missing data are completely at random (MCAR) or that there are no missing data. However, in case of missings at random (MAR), linear mixed models (LMM) may be superior. Consequently, we will test for the distribution of missings using the MissMech package. In case of MCAR, we will calculate ANCOVAs for those variables that are assessed twice (i.e., pre-post design; judge-based ratings). In case of MAR, we will calculate LMMs. Also, we will use LMMs for analyses including at least three measurement points (i.e., therapist-based ratings). \n\nTraining effects. To examine the overall training effect of conducting the same therapy session twice, we will calculate one LMM using data from both measurement points of the total sample, allowing for random intercepts and controlling for PHE.\n\nANCOVA. We will use ANCOVAs to examine the group differences over time for those outcome measures that will be assessed twice (i.e., at baseline and main assessment; the judge-based CTS, CCSS, GTC, EAS). The scores from the main assessment (t4) will be the dependent variables, the group variable (i.e., EG = 1 vs. CG = 0) will be the independent variable and the baseline scores (t2) as well as PHE will be the control variables.\n\nLMM. We will use LMMs to examine the group differences over time for those outcome measures that will be assessed at least three times (i.e., before (t1) and after (2) baseline and before (t3) and after (t4) main assessment; the therapist-based CCSS, GTC, EAS, TAI-GS). The study group will be at Level-2 (i.e., CG = 0, EG = 1) as will be the sum scores from the PHE, which will be grand-mean centered, to control for previous therapeutic experiences. Time will be at Level-1 (first measurement point coded = 0). At first, we will fit an unconditional model, then a model with random intercepts and finally, a random-intercepts-random-slopes model. We will compare the models regarding their model fits using \uf0632 statistic and calculate the ICC, as well as the Pseudo-R2.\n\nEffect sizes. We will apply Cohen\u2019s d as the effect sizes for the time-effect (i.e., pre-post) and the Time x Group interaction. Effect sizes will be calculated according to Morris and DeShon (2002) for simple pre-post effects and Morris (2008) for pre-post control group designs. Cohen\u2019s d will be defined as small (d &lt; 0.50), moderate (0.50 \uf0a3 d \uf0a3 0.80), or large (d &gt; 0.80; Cohen, 1988).\n\nMixed-Methods Approach\nTo answer Research Questions 3 and 4, we will combine qualitative (i.e., qualitative content analysis) and quantitative (i.e., frequency analyses) methodologies.\n\nQualitative content analysis. The aim of qualitative content analysis (QCA) is to extract the manifest content of qualitative text material through categorization (D\u00f6ring &amp; Bortz, 2016). Using the MAXQDA 2020 (VERBI Software, 2019), we will apply QCA (a) to the transcripts of the interviews, and (b) to the live-supervisor\u2019s written feedback. We will base the analyses on recommendations of R\u00e4diker and Kuckartz (2019).\n\nInterviews. The interviews will be audio-taped, transcribed by two undergraduate students following the \u201ctranscription rules\u201d that are described by Kuckartz and R\u00e4diker (2019), and anonymized afterwards. The final transcripts will be content analyzed based on an inductive-deductive procedure. The deductive categories are the interview\u2019s main themes (research questions): (1) Learning results from the experiment (RQ: What did the participants learn?), (2) Motivational aspects, that are based on the Expectation-Value Theory of Achievement Motivation (Wigfield &amp; Eccles, 2000) and that are related to performance, such as, self-efficacy, importance of task, intrinsic value, extrinsic value, and costs (RQ: What was their motivation during the experiment?), (3) Feedback on LS and the supervisory suggestions or feedback on repetition as training method (RQ: How did they evaluate repetition of practice and LS as training methods? How useful are both?), and (4) Harms or side effects of participation (RQ: Did the tasks lead to any harm or side effects?). The inductive approach will then be used to identify sub-categories. At first, we will conduct a within-case analysis, and afterwards, a cross-case analysis. \nThe within-case analysis is sequential, which means that an interview transcript is worked through from front to back to gather an initial rough understanding of the text. Then, the rater begins the process of coding (i.e., to categorize each analysis unit with respect to the research questions), whereby the level of abstraction can vary between one sentence and a statement comprising several sentences. Each code will be recorded in a code list and will be explained by a code book (e.g., definition of codes, differentiation from similar codes, rules for the application of the codes). Once a code or a category will be created, the next eligible unit will be either subsumed in it (if it will meet the definition of the category), or a new category will be created. In addition, a case summary of each interviewee (i.e., a summary of the most important results) will be created. At first, both raters will read three transcripts to familiarize themselves with the data. Then, a preliminary coding system including sub-categories will be developed and discussed with the first author. After another three transcripts the coding system will be refined, again. \nThe cross-case analysis aims to further refine the categories (e.g. to connect codes to subordinate categories). We will use the thematic analysis approach, which summarizes the themes of the research questions across all cases. \n\nWritten Feedback. To answer research question 3, two undergraduate students will analyze the written suggestions of the supervisor. The messages will be content analyzed based on an inductive-deductive procedure. The deductive category is the type of feedback (RQ: What aspects does the supervisor report back?). The process of the QCA will be the same as for the interviews.\n\nQuantitative content analysis. In addition to the QCA, we will also analyze frequencies of each (sub-)category per person and in the total sample. Further, independent rater will watch the videos from the LS sessions and judge the implementation of feedback by the participants (RQ: When and to what extent is the feedback implemented by the participants?) on a 4-point rating scale (0 = not implemented at all, 3 = fully implemented). The time span between message presentation and implementation will be recorded, as well.\n\nInterrater reliability. Two raters will code the interviews and the written feedback. After the process of consensual coding for the first six interviews or feedback is finished, the second raters will code a randomly selected subsample (10%) of the original interviews (approx. n = 6) or feedback (approx. n = 3). To determine the intercoder agreement, Brennan and Prediger (1981) suggest the chance-corrected kappa coefficient that is based on the percentage agreement and the expected agreement by chance. Kappa is judged as \u201csubstantial\u201d when \u0138n \u2265 0.61 and as \u201calmost perfect\u201d when \u0138n \u2265 0.81. \n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": [[{"id":

This has prompted the development and deployment of point-of-care (POC) diagnostics for screening COVID 19 in order to curb the spread of the disease and alleviate the health system burden.

Rapid diagnosis of COVID 19 is crucial for prevention on wards transmission and for early access to healthcare. Appropriate screening procedure can inform policy makers on about the disease prevalence and disease spots to guide implementation of targeted disease prevention interventions. It is anticipated that the results of our scoping review will help guide future research and inform health professionals in the forefront of COVID 19 prevention on currently available POC diagnostics for this condition.
