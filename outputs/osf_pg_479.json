Since the beta-amyloids hypothesis was first proposed almost three decades ago, a number of clinical trials have been conducted around pharmacotherapies that can modify the pathological course of AD by affecting beta-amyloid levels in the blood or brain (Mangialasche, Solomon, Winblad, Mecocci and Kivipelto, 2010; Mullane and Williams, 2013). However, trials testing the effects of amyloid-centric therapies so far have shown no major effects on clinical symptoms and do not seem to modify the underlying pathogenic processes (Karran and Hardy, 2014; Mangialasche et al., 2010; Mullane and Williams, 2013).

To test this, we will look at data from before and after commitments were made and in countries with and without commitments. We will also consider other factors, like changes in the law and illnesses that kill hens, that could affect how they are housed. We suspect that commitments and housing affect each other, so we will use advocacy groups' campaigns as a statistical tool to further clarify the cause-and-effect relationship.
