The independent/predictor variable is level of technological immersion (low/high) when watching the documentary which is the between-subjects element. There are six moderating variables (self-direction and stimulation values; openness, extraversion and neuroticism traits; immersive tendency). The one outcome variable is attitude change towards the homeless, represented as changes in attitudes that a homeless individual is responsible for homelessness. There is a pre-test element where participants fill out the personality measures and the attitude survey, and a post-test element where, after watching the documentary, they fill out the attitudes questionnaire again. ", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Participants will be obtained from a population at the University of Bath in the UK, likely to be mostly students. Recruitment will be performed via posts on social media by the lead researcher, recruitment emails sent via the Department of Psychology, and adverts posted on noticeboards where allowed. No payment will be made for participation, however participants will be entered into a prize draw to win a \u00a325 Amazon voucher. \nThere is an exhaustive list of exclusion criteria, these are\n\u2022\tParticipant who have suffered from epilepsy, have a family history of epilepsy, febrile convulsions in infancy or recurrent fainting spells \n\u2022\tParticipants fitted with a heart pacemaker, cochlear implant, medication pump or surgical clip \n\u2022\tParticipants who are pregnant \n\u2022\tParticipants who are under 18 \n\u2022\tParticipants under the influence of alcohol \n\u2022\tParticipants who have previously watched \u2018Life on the Streets of San Francisco\u2019 (was previously used in a second-year research project) \n\u2022\tParticipants who have experienced homelessness or have a family member who is or was homeless \n\u2022\tParticipants with a history of nausea or motion sickness \n\u2022\tParticipants who have experience a recent injury to eyes, face, neck or arms that would prevent comfortable use of the Oculus Go. \n\u2022\tParticipants who have hearing problems \n\u2022\tParticipants who are transplant patients or who have had a stroke \n\u2022\tParticipants who do not understand the goals or the study and those who do not provide informed consent \n\u2022\tParticipants under the influence of alcohol \nThe study aims to run from 28th January 2020 until early April 2020. \n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "Manipulated variable: Technological immersion: two levels\n\u2022\tHigh immersion, represented by the use of a virtual reality headset or head-mounted display to view the documentary, the Oculus Go.\n\u2022\tLow immersion, represented by the use of a desktop with VLC Player to view the documentary on a HP Pavilion laptop.\nThese variables are consistent in other ways, such as the way participants hear sound (same headphones) and that videos in both conditions are both navigable in 360-degrees.\n", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Moderators:\nPersonality traits: Extraversion, openness to change and neuroticism measured on a 5 point scale (1 \u2013 strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree).

Stimulation and self-direction (including self-direction-action and self-direction thought) measured on a 6 point scale (1 = not at all like me, 6 = very much like me). Measured using the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ-5X; Schwartz et al., 2012). 9 items total. 6 items for self-direction and 3 items for stimulation.\n\nImmersive tendency. Measured on a 7 point scale. Uses a few different endpoints (e.g. 1 = Never, 7 = Often, 1 = Not At All, 7 = Very Well). Measured using the Immersive Tendencies Questionnaire (Witmer &amp; Singer, 1998). 18 items total. \n\nOutcome variable: \nAttitudes towards the homeless. Specifically, the attitude that it is the individuals\u2019 responsibility for homelessness is measured, as the documentary concerns individual experiences of homelessness. Measured on a 5 point scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree). Measured using the \u2018Individual Responsibility\u2019 subscale of the Systems and Individual Responsibility for Poverty scale (SIRP; Shor et al., 2018). The scale has been revised by the author and all references to poverty are replaced by \u2018homelessness\u2019. 8 items out of 17 items total on the full questionnaire. Measured twice (before watching video and after watching video).\n\nOther measured variables that will not be used in the main analyses but are kept as variables of interest is the level of presence (measured using the Igroup Presence Questionnaire, Schubert et al., 2001, 13 items), and the other half of the SIRP scale, measuring \u2018System Responsibility\u2019 for homelessness (9 items). ", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "The means for each of the scales (values, personality traits, immersive tendency, attitude, etc.) will be used to create single measures for each of these factors.\n\nAttitude change will be calculated by subtracting the mean score on the pre-test attitudes survey from the mean score on the post-test attitudes survey. For example, if a participant had a post-test attitudes score of 4 and a pre-test score of 3, this leaves an attitude change score of +1. This score can also be negative (e.g. pre-test = 4, post-test = 3, score = -1.)\n", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "An independent samples t-test will be used for H1.

Six single moderated regressions will be performed, as detailed below. All moderated regressions will be performed using the PROCESS macro for SPSS. \n1. Predictor: Technological Immersion (low/high), moderator: self-direction value, outcome: change in attitudes towards the homeless.\n2. Predictor: Technological Immersion (low/high), moderator: stimulation value, outcome: change in attitudes towards the homeless.\n3.

Predictor: Technological Immersion (low/high), moderator: immersive tendency, outcome: change in attitudes towards the homeless.\nIf interaction effects are found simple slopes analysis will be performed to uncover the nature of moderation.\nSimple slopes analysis will be performed via the PROCESS macro for SPSS, which uses t-tests to judge the effect of the predictor (immersion) on the outcome (attitude change) at different levels of the moderating variable. Additionally, the Johnson-Neyman output will be explored through PROCESS, which allows a researcher to see at which boundaries of the moderator the relationship between the predictor and outcome variables are significant.\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecac48", "text": "Social and Behavioral Sciences"}, {"id": "584240da54be81056cecac68", "text":
