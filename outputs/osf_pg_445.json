Over the last decade, fact\u00adchecking has begun to spread among professional news organizations in the US and overseas. Prominent fact\u00adchecking organizations such as FactCheck.org and PolitiFact have achieved high visibility and acceptance in the media world. Their work has won major journalism awards, including a Pulitzer Prize for PolitiFact; they have established partnerships with well\u00adknown outlets such as NPR, CNN, and USA Today; and they are cited and quoted heavily in print and broadcast media. As the genre has gained professional acceptance, it has become somewhat more common in elite political coverage and is seen as part of a trend toward more frequent accountability reporting. This trend appears to be the result of a fairly rapid shift in attitudes among a growing cohort of national political journalists at the center of the profession. Fact\u00adchecking seems to be contagious. The relatively quick spread of fact\u00adchecking among elite news sources necessitates a better understanding of its causes, and of the factors which may drive its further adoption by individual journalists and/or news organizations. One explanation for the spread of fact\u00adchecking is social influence through comparison to peers. Journalists and the news organizations they work for define professional success in relation to their peers and may prove sensitive to peer comparisons that highlight the embrace of fact\u00adchecking by standard\u00adbearers in the field. An alternative account is that the growth of fact\u00adchecking has been driven primarily by reader demand. Fact\u00adchecking has frequently been identified by practitioners as a genre that can potentially broaden the audience for political coverage. Established fact\u00adcheckers often cite traffic statistics to demonstrate rising interest in this form of journalism. This study investigates these two competing accounts of the spread of fact-checking among professional journalists. We randomly assign political journalists to be sent emails and letters that use either supply\u00adside or demand\u00adside messages to promote the use of fact\u00adchecking. In the supply treatments (whose full text are included below), the messages note that prestigious journalists are doing fact\u00adchecking, present fact\u00adchecking as consistent with the highest ideals of journalism, and inform reporters that we will be monitoring coverage to look for the best examples of fact\u00adchecking. In the demand treatments (whose full texts are also included below), the messages assert that readers want fact\u00adchecking, present evidence of consumer enthusiasm for fact\u00adchecking content, and inform reporters that we will be monitoring coverage to see who is best meeting reader demand for fact\u00adchecking."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "We specifically propose to test three hypotheses about the effect of these messages on subsequent political coverage by the treated journalists and news outlets: Hypothesis 1a: Journalists and media outlets that are assigned to receive the supply\u00ad-side treatment will be more likely to incorporate fact\u00adchecking into their political coverage than those that are not. Hypothesis 1b: Journalists and media outlets that are assigned to receive the demand\u00ad-side treatment will be more likely to incorporate fact\u00adchecking into their political coverage than those that are not. Hypothesis 2: The supply\u00ad-side treatment will generate more fact\u00adchecking coverage than the demand\u00ad-side treatment. \ufffc We will also investigate the following research questions where we do not have clear a priori theoretical expectations. First, we are interested in testing whether outlets and journalists that already incorporate fact\u00adchecking into their coverage to some extent are more or less likely to engage in additional fact\u00adchecking when they receive a message promoting its use. This is not only an important statistical concern (heterogeneous treatment effects) but a question with substantively important implications for understanding how fact\u00adchecking spreads. Research question 1: Are messages promoting greater use of fact\u00adchecking more or less effective among outlets who already fact\u00adcheck relatively frequently and the reporters who work at them? (Note: As we discuss below, outlets with dedicated fact\u00adchecking operations are excluded from our sample. As such, the research question investigates differences among media organizations that have not made a formal commitment to the approach.) A second research question we plan to investigate is whether fact\u00adchecking by geogprahically nearby outlets accelerates or hinders the spread of fact\u00adchecking. It is possible that reporters are more responsive to fact\u00adchecking when it is practiced by their journalistic peers in a given state, but an alternate hypothesis (described above) is that media outlets and the reporters they employ engage in product differentiation and would thus actually be less responsive when fact\u00adchecking is already in use nearby. We propose to test this research question using reporters and outlets in states where a PolitiFact affiliate or dedicated fact\u00adchecking project (e.g., the Truth in Numbers project at the Cleveland Plain Dealer) is in operation in 2014. Research question 2: Are messages promoting greater use of fact\u00adchecking more or less effective among journalists and outlets in states in which an outlet has a dedicated fact\u00adchecking operation? Finally, we are interested in the effects of competitive political campaigns on fact\u00adchecking. One possibility is that the intense debate and reader interest generated by these races motivate media outlets to devote more resources to coverage, including fact\u00adchecking. In this sense, fact\u00adchecking might act as a complement to existing political coverage, which typically takes a more agnostic approach to factual claims and counter\u00adclaims between candidates. However, an alternate possibility is that fact\u00adchecking acts as a substitute for traditional forms of campaign coverage. When a campaign is less competitive or an important politician faces little opposition, fact\u00adchecking may help provide an alternate form of accountability for their public statements. Conversely, competitive campaigns might tax the resources of media outlets, which are forced to devote more coverage to traditional \"\"horse\u00adrace\"\" coverage of campaign events such as stump speeches, television advertisements, polls, and debates, leaving little capacity for fact\u00adchecking. We propose the following research question, which we will also evaluate: Research question 3: Are messages promoting greater use of fact\u00adchecking more or less effective in states with competitive statewide campaigns?"}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "Trial design In this study, we randomly assign political journalists to be sent emails that use either supply-side or demand-side messages to promote the use of fact-checking or to a control group. Specifically, we utilize a multilevel randomization strategy to ensure that we obtain a valid estimate of the individual-level effects of our treatments (our primary outcomes of interest) as well as estimates of any potential intra-organizational spillovers within media outlets. Each outlet (newspaper) is assigned to one of five conditions: -Supply side (low): One half of the eligible journalists in that organization will be sent the supply-side treatment; -Supply side (high): All of the eligible journalists in that organization will be sent the supply-side treatment; -Demand side (low): One half of the eligible journalists in that organization will be sent the demand-side treatment; -Demand side (high): All of the eligible journalists in that organization will be sent the demand-side treatment; -Control: No reporters in that organization will receive either the supply-side or demand-side treatment. By randomly varying the level of saturation of pro-factchecking messages within a given outlet, we can directly estimate whether and to what extent the treatments are affecting journalists in the control group within the outlet -- a possible complication in an experimental design of this type. Under certain assumptions, this design allows us to estimate whether there are intra-organizational spillovers in which reporters who were not assigned to treatment are influenced by its content through some form of contact with members of the treatment groups, whose prevalence will vary exogenously with the level of saturation. Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants Our sample at the outlet level comprises newspapers that meet the following conditions: A newspaper with a minimum circulation of 100,000 in 2007 that is still in operation and not online-only or free (excludes the Examiner [CA], Washington Examiner, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Rocky Mountain News, and am New York; the Honolulu Star-Advertiser is treated as the sum of the circulations of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser). We used circulation in 2007 because it is prior to significant growth in fact-checking in the 2008 election and allows for the lag between changes in newspaper economics and newsroom staffing. Despite the downturn in newspaper circulation, the relative ordering of newspapers by circulation is highly consistent -- for instance, all of the top 50 newspapers by circulation in 2014 are in our sample (excluding those dropped based on the criteria listed below) and virtually all of the outlets in our sample remain among the top 100 daily or Sunday newspapers by circulation. (This criterion also allows us to ensure that our results are comparable with an ongoing retrospective study of fact-checking in previous elections, which used the same 2007 circulation data as part of the sample construction criteria.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The newspaper must have full-text availability for content published during the study period in the LexisNexis Academic, Proquest, or Access World News databases (the news databases we use for this study, which cover almost all of the outlets selected using the first criterion). Names and email contact information for political reporting staff must be available for the outlet (necessary for randomization at the journalist level) and qualifying articles must be published by newspaper staff (all qualifying articles in the Press Enterprise were written by Orange County Register staff writers). All outlets that were already affiliated with PolitiFact were excluded because they had already made an institutional commitment to fact-checking. The New York Times was excluded because one of the PIs is affiliated with that outlet (Nyhan). It was also necessary to exclude the Wall Street Journal, an outlier in the number of qualifying reporters (these created balance problems for the multilevel randomization design). The full list of 82 qualifying outlets is available upon request from the authors. At the journalist level, our sample was drawn from the political reporting staff of outlets that meet the study inclusion criteria listed above. Eligible reporters were determined by compiling bylines on political news coverage in eligible outlets during June 2014 (6/1/14 to 6/30/14) using a standard political keyword search in Lexis Nexis, ProQuest, or Access World News as applicable. Specifically, the total number of political articles written by reporters was measured by searching for this list of political keywords during the June 1-30, 2014 period: election OR presidential OR Senate OR Senator OR Sen. OR Congress OR Congressman OR Congresswoman OR Legislature OR Legislator OR \"\"House of Representatives\"\" OR \"\"State House\"\" OR Capitol OR \"\"state assembly\"\" OR \"\"general assembly\"\" OR \"\"legislative assembly\"\" OR assemblyman OR assemblywoman OR Democrat OR Republican OR Democratic OR DFL OR GOP OR governor OR Gov. OR Mayor OR constitution OR \"\"city council\"\" OR councilman OR councilwoman Authors of three or more political news articles during the sample period were counted as political reporters for the purposes of the study (opinion columns, op-eds, and editorials were excluded; co-bylines were counted). The set of 1689 qualifying reporters in the sample is available upon request from the authors. More specifically, we generated the list of political reporters for each outlet by applying following procedure to keyword search results and applying the coding rules below: a. Research assistants (RAs) who were blind to the details and hypotheses of the study design performed the keyword search above with date range and outlet specified. b. RAs searched within results for the author with first staff byline. c. RAs recorded reporter first and last names and total articles returned for journalists who meet the coding rules below (if articles >= 3): i.\u00a0 Double bylines (or more) were counted for each author. ii.\u00a0 All reporters in the sample had to be staff at their respective papers. Any reporter identified as NOT being affiliated with the given outlet was excluded. If they have an email address listed that corresponds to a different newspaper, they were also excluded even if not explicitly identified with that paper. iii. Journalists whose byline identifies them as an editor were excluded. iv. Journalists for whom >=25% of returned articles on first page appear to be opinion or >=50% of articles on the first page are calendars, compilations of event listings, obituaries, sports, TV listings, or the history of street names were excluded. v. Unattributed articles with the author\u2019s name in the headline and a colon count toward that author\u2019s total (e.g., \u201cDoug Bonjour: \u201c). If the authors are listed at the end of the article and the person in question is one of them, they should be counted toward the given journalist\u2019s total. vi. Authors for whom >=50% of articles are .gov URLs that are otherwise unrelated were excluded. vii. Authors who cames up for more than one affiliated paper were searched for in Google and were deleted for the paper where they were NOT on staff of. d. RAs repeated keyword search adding AND NOT byline(XXX) e. RAs searched within results - first author in new results with a valid staff (non-opinion or external) byline. RAs noted total articles returned again. f. RAs repeated keyword search adding AND NOT byline(XXX OR YYY) to exclude last two authors (and so forth). g. Steps a-f were repeated until the list of valid journalists at the outlet was complete. h. During the process of compiling the sample of reporters, the following notes or adjustments were made to the coding procedures: NOTE: For the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, \u201cDemocrat\u201d was omitted from the search terms because including \u201cDemocrat\u201d returned every article the paper published from 6/1-6/30. NOTE: For the Press-Register (CA), content frequently appeared in both the Press-Enterprise and the Orange County Register. We treated them as separate papers. NOTE: We excluded reporters whose email addresses were either (a) from the domain of a different newspaper (e.g., articles in Orlando Sentinel written by reporters with LA Times domain email addresses like name@latimes.com rather than name@orlandosentinel.com) or (b) are from the corporate parent and not the local paper (e.g., Orlando Sentinel articles written by reporters with email address of name@tribune.com rather than name@orlandosentinel.com). This rule did not exclude reporters who use a personal email address (e.g., name@earthlink.net). Randomization approach To account for differences across different types of outlets, we utilize block randomization in a multilevel context. We block randomized at the outlet level within groups defined the presence of competitive statewide campaign for governor or U.S. Senate (those with at least one \u201ctossup\u201d or \u201clean D\u201d/\u201clean R\u201d race for those offices as classified by the Cook Political Report on September 15, 2014), maximizing balance in the number of qualifying reporters at the outlet. We then block randomized within each outlet at the reporter level according to the design described above while maximizing balance in the frequency of political coverage by reporters during the June 1-30, 2014 period. The use of a multilevel block randomized design ensures that our treatment and control groups are as balanced as possible on key covariates at both the outlet and journalist level. All randomizations were performed using the blockTools package for R with the default optimal greedy algorithm. Data collection and blinding All outcome data will be collected online using post-election searches of news coverage by research assistants in the electronic databases described above for the study period of September 22, 2014 (the day the first messages were sent) through Election Day (November 4, 2014). The research assistants will be blind to outlet and reporter treatment assignment and will follow the coding rules described below.

Over the last decade, fact\u00adchecking has begun to spread among professional news organizations in the US and overseas. Prominent fact\u00adchecking organizations such as FactCheck.org and PolitiFact have achieved high visibility and acceptance in the media world. Their work has won major journalism awards, including a Pulitzer Prize for PolitiFact; they have established partnerships with well\u00adknown outlets such as NPR, CNN, and USA Today; and they are cited and quoted heavily in print and broadcast media. As the genre has gained professional acceptance, it has become somewhat more common in elite political coverage and is seen as part of a trend toward more frequent accountability reporting. This trend appears to be the result of a fairly rapid shift in attitudes among a growing cohort of national political journalists at the center of the profession. Fact\u00adchecking seems to be contagious. The relatively quick spread of fact\u00adchecking among elite news sources necessitates a better understanding of its causes, and of the factors which may drive its further adoption by individual journalists and/or news organizations. One explanation for the spread of fact\u00adchecking is social influence through comparison to peers. Journalists and the news organizations they work for define professional success in relation to their peers and may prove sensitive to peer comparisons that highlight the embrace of fact\u00adchecking by standard\u00adbearers in the field. An alternative account is that the growth of fact\u00adchecking has been driven primarily by reader demand. Fact\u00adchecking has frequently been identified by practitioners as a genre that can potentially broaden the audience for political coverage. Established fact\u00adcheckers often cite traffic statistics to demonstrate rising interest in this form of journalism. This study investigates these two competing accounts of the spread of fact-checking among professional journalists. We randomly assign political journalists to be sent emails and letters that use either supply\u00adside or demand\u00adside messages to promote the use of fact\u00adchecking. In the supply treatments (whose full text are included below), the messages note that prestigious journalists are doing fact\u00adchecking, present fact\u00adchecking as consistent with the highest ideals of journalism, and inform reporters that we will be monitoring coverage to look for the best examples of fact\u00adchecking. In the demand treatments (whose full texts are also included below), the messages assert that readers want fact\u00adchecking, present evidence of consumer enthusiasm for fact\u00adchecking content, and inform reporters that we will be monitoring coverage to see who is best meeting reader demand for fact\u00adchecking.", "q16": "We specifically propose to test three hypotheses about the effect of these messages on subsequent political coverage by the treated journalists and news outlets: Hypothesis 1a: Journalists and media outlets that are assigned to receive the supply\u00ad-side treatment will be more likely to incorporate fact\u00adchecking into their political coverage than those that are not. Hypothesis 1b: Journalists and media outlets that are assigned to receive the demand\u00ad-side treatment will be more likely to incorporate fact\u00adchecking into their political coverage than those that are not. Hypothesis 2: The supply\u00ad-side treatment will generate more fact\u00adchecking coverage than the demand\u00ad-side treatment. \ufffc We will also investigate the following research questions where we do not have clear a priori theoretical expectations. First, we are interested in testing whether outlets and journalists that already incorporate fact\u00adchecking into their coverage to some extent are more or less likely to engage in additional fact\u00adchecking when they receive a message promoting its use. This is not only an important statistical concern (heterogeneous treatment effects) but a question with substantively important implications for understanding how fact\u00adchecking spreads. Research question 1: Are messages promoting greater use of fact\u00adchecking more or less effective among outlets who already fact\u00adcheck relatively frequently and the reporters who work at them? (Note: As we discuss below, outlets with dedicated fact\u00adchecking operations are excluded from our sample. As such, the research question investigates differences among media organizations that have not made a formal commitment to the approach.) A second research question we plan to investigate is whether fact\u00adchecking by geogprahically nearby outlets accelerates or hinders the spread of fact\u00adchecking. It is possible that reporters are more responsive to fact\u00adchecking when it is practiced by their journalistic peers in a given state, but an alternate hypothesis (described above) is that media outlets and the reporters they employ engage in product differentiation and would thus actually be less responsive when fact\u00adchecking is already in use nearby. We propose to test this research question using reporters and outlets in states where a PolitiFact affiliate or dedicated fact\u00adchecking project (e.g., the Truth in Numbers project at the Cleveland Plain Dealer) is in operation in 2014. Research question 2: Are messages promoting greater use of fact\u00adchecking more or less effective among journalists and outlets in states in which an outlet has a dedicated fact\u00adchecking operation? Finally, we are interested in the effects of competitive political campaigns on fact\u00adchecking. One possibility is that the intense debate and reader interest generated by these races motivate media outlets to devote more resources to coverage, including fact\u00adchecking. In this sense, fact\u00adchecking might act as a complement to existing political coverage, which typically takes a more agnostic approach to factual claims and counter\u00adclaims between candidates. However, an alternate possibility is that fact\u00adchecking acts as a substitute for traditional forms of campaign coverage. When a campaign is less competitive or an important politician faces little opposition, fact\u00adchecking may help provide an alternate form of accountability for their public statements. Conversely, competitive campaigns might tax the resources of media outlets, which are forced to devote more coverage to traditional \"\"horse\u00adrace\"\" coverage of campaign events such as stump speeches, television advertisements, polls, and debates, leaving little capacity for fact\u00adchecking. We propose the following research question, which we will also evaluate: Research question 3: Are messages promoting greater use of fact\u00adchecking more or less effective in states with competitive statewide campaigns?", "q17": "Trial design In this study, we randomly assign political journalists to be sent emails that use either supply-side or demand-side messages to promote the use of fact-checking or to a control group. Specifically, we utilize a multilevel randomization strategy to ensure that we obtain a valid estimate of the individual-level effects of our treatments (our primary outcomes of interest) as well as estimates of any potential intra-organizational spillovers within media outlets. Each outlet (newspaper) is assigned to one of five conditions: -Supply side (low): One half of the eligible journalists in that organization will be sent the supply-side treatment; -Supply side (high): All of the eligible journalists in that organization will be sent the supply-side treatment; -Demand side (low): One half of the eligible journalists in that organization will be sent the demand-side treatment; -Demand side (high): All of the eligible journalists in that organization will be sent the demand-side treatment; -Control: No reporters in that organization will receive either the supply-side or demand-side treatment. By randomly varying the level of saturation of pro-factchecking messages within a given outlet, we can directly estimate whether and to what extent the treatments are affecting journalists in the control group within the outlet -- a possible complication in an experimental design of this type. Under certain assumptions, this design allows us to estimate whether there are intra-organizational spillovers in which reporters who were not assigned to treatment are influenced by its content through some form of contact with members of the treatment groups, whose prevalence will vary exogenously with the level of saturation. Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants Our sample at the outlet level comprises newspapers that meet the following conditions: A newspaper with a minimum circulation of 100,000 in 2007 that is still in operation and not online-only or free (excludes the Examiner [CA], Washington Examiner, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Rocky Mountain News, and am New York; the Honolulu Star-Advertiser is treated as the sum of the circulations of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser). We used circulation in 2007 because it is prior to significant growth in fact-checking in the 2008 election and allows for the lag between changes in newspaper economics and newsroom staffing. Despite the downturn in newspaper circulation, the relative ordering of newspapers by circulation is highly consistent -- for instance, all of the top 50 newspapers by circulation in 2014 are in our sample (excluding those dropped based on the criteria listed below) and virtually all of the outlets in our sample remain among the top 100 daily or Sunday newspapers by circulation. (This criterion also allows us to ensure that our results are comparable with an ongoing retrospective study of fact-checking in previous elections, which used the same 2007 circulation data as part of the sample construction criteria.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The newspaper must have full-text availability for content published during the study period in the LexisNexis Academic, Proquest, or Access World News databases (the news databases we use for this study, which cover almost all of the outlets selected using the first criterion). Names and email contact information for political reporting staff must be available for the outlet (necessary for randomization at the journalist level) and qualifying articles must be published by newspaper staff (all qualifying articles in the Press Enterprise were written by Orange County Register staff writers). All outlets that were already affiliated with PolitiFact were excluded because they had already made an institutional commitment to fact-checking. The New York Times was excluded because one of the PIs is affiliated with that outlet (Nyhan). It was also necessary to exclude the Wall Street Journal, an outlier in the number of qualifying reporters (these created balance problems for the multilevel randomization design). The full list of 82 qualifying outlets is available upon request from the authors. At the journalist level, our sample was drawn from the political reporting staff of outlets that meet the study inclusion criteria listed above. Eligible reporters were determined by compiling bylines on political news coverage in eligible outlets during June 2014 (6/1/14 to 6/30/14) using a standard political keyword search in Lexis Nexis, ProQuest, or Access World News as applicable. Specifically, the total number of political articles written by reporters was measured by searching for this list of political keywords during the June 1-30, 2014 period: election OR presidential OR Senate OR Senator OR Sen. OR Congress OR Congressman OR Congresswoman OR Legislature OR Legislator OR \"\"House of Representatives\"\" OR \"\"State House\"\" OR Capitol OR \"\"state assembly\"\" OR \"\"general assembly\"\" OR \"\"legislative assembly\"\" OR assemblyman OR assemblywoman OR Democrat OR Republican OR Democratic OR DFL OR GOP OR governor OR Gov. OR Mayor OR constitution OR \"\"city council\"\" OR councilman OR councilwoman Authors of three or more political news articles during the sample period were counted as political reporters for the purposes of the study (opinion columns, op-eds, and editorials were excluded; co-bylines were counted). The set of 1689 qualifying reporters in the sample is available upon request from the authors. More specifically, we generated the list of political reporters for each outlet by applying following procedure to keyword search results and applying the coding rules below: a. Research assistants (RAs) who were blind to the details and hypotheses of the study design performed the keyword search above with date range and outlet specified. b. RAs searched within results for the author with first staff byline. c. RAs recorded reporter first and last names and total articles returned for journalists who meet the coding rules below (if articles >= 3): i.\u00a0 Double bylines (or more) were counted for each author. ii.\u00a0 All reporters in the sample had to be staff at their respective papers. Any reporter identified as NOT being affiliated with the given outlet was excluded. If they have an email address listed that corresponds to a different newspaper, they were also excluded even if not explicitly identified with that paper. iii. Journalists whose byline identifies them as an editor were excluded. iv. Journalists for whom >=25% of returned articles on first page appear to be opinion or >=50% of articles on the first page are calendars, compilations of event listings, obituaries, sports, TV listings, or the history of street names were excluded. v. Unattributed articles with the author\u2019s name in the headline and a colon count toward that author\u2019s total (e.g., \u201cDoug Bonjour: \u201c). If the authors are listed at the end of the article and the person in question is one of them, they should be counted toward the given journalist\u2019s total. vi. Authors for whom >=50% of articles are .gov URLs that are otherwise unrelated were excluded. vii. Authors who cames up for more than one affiliated paper were searched for in Google and were deleted for the paper where they were NOT on staff of. d. RAs repeated keyword search adding AND NOT byline(XXX) e. RAs searched within results - first author in new results with a valid staff (non-opinion or external) byline. RAs noted total articles returned again. f. RAs repeated keyword search adding AND NOT byline(XXX OR YYY) to exclude last two authors (and so forth). g. Steps a-f were repeated until the list of valid journalists at the outlet was complete. h. During the process of compiling the sample of reporters, the following notes or adjustments were made to the coding procedures: NOTE: For the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, \u201cDemocrat\u201d was omitted from the search terms because including \u201cDemocrat\u201d returned every article the paper published from 6/1-6/30. NOTE: For the Press-Register (CA), content frequently appeared in both the Press-Enterprise and the Orange County Register. We treated them as separate papers. NOTE: We excluded reporters whose email addresses were either (a) from the domain of a different newspaper (e.g., articles in Orlando Sentinel written by reporters with LA Times domain email addresses like name@latimes.com rather than name@orlandosentinel.com) or (b) are from the corporate parent and not the local paper (e.g., Orlando Sentinel articles written by reporters with email address of name@tribune.com rather than name@orlandosentinel.com). This rule did not exclude reporters who use a personal email address (e.g., name@earthlink.net). Randomization approach To account for differences across different types of outlets, we utilize block randomization in a multilevel context. We block randomized at the outlet level within groups defined the presence of competitive statewide campaign for governor or U.S. Senate (those with at least one \u201ctossup\u201d or \u201clean D\u201d/\u201clean R\u201d race for those offices as classified by the Cook Political Report on September 15, 2014), maximizing balance in the number of qualifying reporters at the outlet. We then block randomized within each outlet at the reporter level according to the design described above while maximizing balance in the frequency of political coverage by reporters during the June 1-30, 2014 period. The use of a multilevel block randomized design ensures that our treatment and control groups are as balanced as possible on key covariates at both the outlet and journalist level. All randomizations were performed using the blockTools package for R with the default optimal greedy algorithm. Data collection and blinding All outcome data will be collected online using post-election searches of news coverage by research assistants in the electronic databases described above for the study period of September 22, 2014 (the day the first messages were sent) through Election Day (November 4, 2014). The research assistants will be blind to outlet and reporter treatment assignment and will follow the coding rules described below.

Supply email 3 (10/17/14): Dear [name], We\u2019re writing to you again to get your opinion about an important trend that is changing political reporting. Fact-checking is a new form of accountability journalism that reporters around the country are using to fight political misinformation and give voters the information they need to make informed choices. Nearly every major US news outlet fact-checked candidates in the 2012 race, including leading newspapers such as the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal. Dozens of smaller outlets did admirable fact-checking at the state and local level, including the Nashua Telegraph, Texas Tribune, and Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. To date, nonpartisan fact-checkers like PolitiFact and FactC", "q18": "", "q19": "", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "", "q25": "", "q26": "Researchers", "q27": "", "q28":

{"extra": [], "value": "\"Fact-checking has become increasingly widespread in American political journalism and has begun to attract large audiences during past elections, but we know little about how much people learn from fact-checks. Gottfried et al. (2013), for instance, find that people who reported reading fact-checks were more likely to answer political knowledge questions correctly than people who do not read fact-checks even after controlling for other factors. However, this association may not be causal; politically knowledgeable people could be more likely to seek out fact-checks or to report reading them at higher rates. Experimental research (e.g., Nyhan and Reifler 2010, 2012) suggests that fact-checks may not always be successful in correcting myths about controversial issues and can sometimes strengthen misperceptions among the most vulnerable groups. Fact-checks could also inadvertently increase the familiarity of false claims, creating potential \u201cillusion of truth\u201d effects (Schwarz et al. 2007). Similarly, little is known about how attitudes toward fact-checking change as a result of exposure to fact-checks. While audiences for fact-checking websites were once a small niche, they are growing increasingly large. But it is hard to assess the impact of exposure to fact-checking because of the self-selective nature of those who choose to read fact-checking. Some people likely consume fact-checking because their interest in politics leads them to more political content, but others may be directed selectively to attitude-consistent fact-checks via links and referrals to that people regularly encounter or their own tendency to choose pleasing content to read. It is also possible that many non-fact check readers have negative attitudes about fact-checking that are not captured by audience measures. We therefore examine what happens to fact-checking attitudes during a campaign by comparing respondents who were randomly exposed to a series of fact-checks with those who were not. Specifically, we conducted a multi-wave panel study examining how attitudes and beliefs related to fact-checking change during the 2014 election. Respondents were interviewed near the beginning of the fall general election campaign (September 2014) and then again at the conclusion of the campaign (November 2014). Between fielding these two waves, respondents were sent three \u201cmini-waves\u201d of an online survey in which they were randomly assigned to either a fact-checking content condition or a control condition. In each of three mini-waves, respondents were given either three political fact-checks or three recent press releases. To encourage reading the stimuli, respondents were asked a single factual question about each article or press release. To maximize the relevance of the stimulus, we included state-specific fact-checks for residents of states with active PolitiFact affiliates -- the respondents who would be most likely to find fact-checking content relevant to them in a midterm election year and to be familiar with the source of the content (the local media outlet serving as PolitiFact\u2019s partner -- for instance, the Richmond Times-Dispatch in Virginia). We examine how the visibility of fact-checking and attitudes towards fact-checkers change over the course of a campaign. Respondents in Wave 1 were asked a series of diagnostic questions such as whether they have heard of fact-checkers, if they visit fact-checking websites, and how they feel about fact-checkers. In Wave 2, we repeated these questions to determine how answers changed during the campaign. We also asked a series of factual questions about controversial issues covered by the fact-checkers. By using a multi-wave study in which we re-interview the same people, we can assess over-time changes while holding key demographic and attitudinal variables constant, helping us assess the extent to which motivated reasoning - which is often at its peak before elections - turns people against fact-checking and the information that fact-checkers provide. The second component of the survey was an embedded experiment in which some respondents in Wave 1 were randomly assigned to be sent fact-checking information during three mini-waves over the course of the fall campaign. The beliefs and attitudes of respondents who were randomly assigned to received fact-checks from PolitiFact will be compared with those Wave 1 respondents who received placebo content instead (non-political press releases), allowing us to obtain the first over-time causal estimate of the effect of exposure to fact-checks.\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"Waves 1 and 2: Survey evidence (descriptive/observational estimates) Interest in and capacity to consume political news varies widely. We therefore expect that more sophisticated people and those with greater political interest and efficacy will be more interested in fact-checks and more likely to report reading them: H1: Interest in reading a hypothetical fact-check (wave 1) and self-reported fact-checking consumption (wave 2) will be highest among respondents with higher political knowledge, education, political interest, epistemic political efficacy, and general efficacy than among those with correspondingly lower levels of the trait in question. Fact-checking has also become controversial as it has become more prominent within politics and political journalism. Given the greater frequency of belief in media bias among conservatives (Pew 2012), we expect that Republicans will have more negative perceptions of fact-checking, especially among those with high political knowledge. H2a: Republicans will express less favorable views toward fact-checkers and fact-checking than Democrats (including greater perceptions of liberal media bias). H2b: The favorability gap between Democrats and Republicans in their perceptions of fact-checkers and fact-checking will be greater among respondents with high political knowledge than those with less knowledge. For each outcome variable that was measured in both waves, we will present estimates from wave 1 but also analyze whether the observed relationship between the outcome (e.g., attitudes towards fact-checking, interest in reading a hypothetical fact-check, etc.) and our independent variables (e.g., partisanship, political knowledge, political interest, etc.) differs significantly between waves 1 and 2. When there is a significant difference, we will present both sets of results and analyze the observed pattern of change. (The possible existence of patterns of change will be considered a research question given the lack of evidence on how attitudes toward fact-checking change during campaigns.) Wave 2: Experimental estimates How does randomized exposure to real world fact-checking content affect citizen attitudes towards fact-checking and knowledge about contested and controversial political claims? We list our hypotheses and research questions below. Given the semantic complexity of fact-checks and the cognitive effort required to process them, we expect that the informational benefits of exposure to fact-checking will be concentrated among respondents with high levels of political knowledge, while others will find the content of the fact-checks difficult to parse: H3: We expect exposure to fact-checking content will increase knowledge of information in fact-checks among more sophisticated people (those with high levels of pre-existing political knowledge) but not among less sophisticated people (those with less political knowledge). H4: We expect partisans to be more likely to recall belief-consistent facts they were exposed to during fact-checking (Jerit and Barabas 2012), especially those with high political knowledge. We are uncertain about whether exposure to fact-checking will widen existing disparities in favorability toward the format and list it as a research question. One possibility is that people\u2019s views of fact-checking will become more polarized as a result of exposure to so much fact-checking content, which could stimulate motivated reasoning (e.g., confirmation and disconfirmation bias). Under this scenario, people who have favorable views of fact-checking should come to like it even more; those who have unfavorable views it should like it even less. Alternatively, however, exposure might demystify the format or undermine objections, particularly among respondents who have had little exposure to it or expect a less balanced set of findings than what was presented. RQ1: Will exposure to fact-checking polarize people\u2019s views of the practice? A second research question is how fact-checking affects trust in politicians. Reading a number of articles about candidates and elected officials making misleading claims may cause people to feel less trust in politicians, especially for those who are already highly distrustful. There may also be reasons that trust could increase or at least not change in response to exposure to fact-checks, however. First, a number of stimulus articles state that the claims being made are accurate. Given how little trust Americans report in elected officials, the frequency of accurate statements may actually exceed some respondents\u2019 expectations. Also, observing public monitoring of candidates and elected officials may actually make people more trusting by increasing their sense that politicians are being held accountable for the accuracy of their statements. RQ2: Does fact-checking decrease trust in politicians? Will these effects be strongest among people who are already highly distrustful? Finally, we are uncertain how exposure to fact-checking will affect respondents\u2019 feelings of political efficacy. The fact-checks provide a great deal of specific information about political disputes. Receiving this information could make people feel like they are informed about politics and have the skills necessary to participate effectively in politics. Alternatively, however, presenting people with complex and or nuanced information about disputes they may have previously been unaware of could also make people feel less knowledgeable (either by not knowing about the dispute or by having difficulty understanding it). These responses could also differ based on respondents\u2019 prior levels of political knowledge. One possibility is that fact-checking could help people with lower levels of knowledge make sense of politics and thus disproportionately increase their feelings of efficacy. It is also possible, though, that people with higher knowledge will be better able to decode the fact-checks they encounter and therefore more likely to feel an increased sense of political efficacy than people who struggle to make sense of the content.

[], "value": "Xiaowen Xu"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "In the recent years, there has been an increased interest in examining attitudes towards diversity and diversity initiatives. Some of this work has started to investigate potential factors that motivate people\u2019s endorsement for diversity initiatives. One such factor is trait personality. Trait personality has been consistently shown to play a role in predicting many important life outcomes, e.g., academic and workplace performance, relationship outcomes, health issues, social attitudes, etc. (e.g., Soto, 2019). Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that trait personality also likely predicts people\u2019s attitudes towards diversity.\n\nWithin the literature that examined the relationships between attitudes towards diversity and Big Five personality traits, it has been shown that trait Openness to Experience is the most relevant personality variable in predicting receptiveness to diversity, and its relationship to diversity is motivated by an interest to explore and understand differing perspectives. Another relevant trait is Agreeableness, and it is motivated by an interest to care for and empathize with other individuals. Different studies have found significant positive relationships between Openness and Agreeableness with the universal-diverse orientation (UDO), the mostly frequently used diversity measure in the literature (Han &amp; Pistole, 2017; Strauss &amp; Connerley, 2003). The construct of UDO (Miville, 1999) is generally assessed using the M-GUDS Scale, and has been shown to be positively related to positive racial identity (for both Blacks and Whites), empathy, and feminism, as well as negatively related with dogmatism and homophobia. Zhang and Goldberg (2014) found that Openness was positively correlated with pro-diversity belief and sensitivity to diversity, whereas Agreeableness was only related to pro-diversity belief.\n\nAlthough studies have explored the general relationships between the Big Five traits (notably Agreeableness and Openness to Experience) and varying diversity measures, fewer studies have extended these findings into more practical, real-life settings, e.g., the workplace. The studies that do discuss practical implications for diversity trainings and initiatives in light of personality differences (Han &amp; Pistole, 2017; Zhang &amp; Goldberg, 2014), still do not focus on specific workplace outcomes or diversity initiatives. On the other hand, research that does specifically address receptivity to diversity in the workplace fails to consider individual personality differences as variables that may impact diversity attitudes. Instead, these studies tend to focus on basic demographic variables, such as race and gender, interpersonal relationships, and organizational culture (Soni, 2000).\n\nThe current studies aim to fill in these links within the literature by examining both attitudes towards diversity in general and attitudes towards diversity initiatives in the workplace, while focusing on the potential influences of individual differences.

Some of this work has started to investigate potential factors that motivate people\u2019s endorsement for diversity initiatives. One such factor is trait personality. Trait personality has been consistently shown to play a role in predicting many important life outcomes, e.g., academic and workplace performance, relationship outcomes, health issues, social attitudes, etc. (e.g., Soto, 2019). Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that trait personality also likely predicts people\u2019s attitudes towards diversity.\n\nWithin the literature that examined the relationships between attitudes towards diversity and Big Five personality traits, it has been shown that trait Openness to Experience is the most relevant personality variable in predicting receptiveness to diversity, and its relationship to diversity is motivated by an interest to explore and understand differing perspectives. Another relevant trait is Agreeableness, and it is motivated by an interest to care for and empathize with other individuals. Different studies have found significant positive relationships between Openness and Agreeableness with the universal-diverse orientation (UDO), the mostly frequently used diversity measure in the literature (Han &amp; Pistole, 2017; Strauss &amp; Connerley, 2003). The construct of UDO (Miville, 1999) is generally assessed using the M-GUDS Scale, and has been shown to be positively related to positive racial identity (for both Blacks and Whites), empathy, and feminism, as well as negatively related with dogmatism and homophobia. Zhang and Goldberg (2014) found that Openness was positively correlated with pro-diversity belief and sensitivity to diversity, whereas Agreeableness was only related to pro-diversity belief.\n\nAlthough studies have explored the general relationships between the Big Five traits (notably Agreeableness and Openness to Experience) and varying diversity measures, fewer studies have extended these findings into more practical, real-life settings, e.g., the workplace. The studies that do discuss practical implications for diversity trainings and initiatives in light of personality differences (Han &amp; Pistole, 2017; Zhang &amp; Goldberg, 2014), still do not focus on specific workplace outcomes or diversity initiatives. On the other hand, research that does specifically address receptivity to diversity in the workplace fails to consider individual personality differences as variables that may impact diversity attitudes. Instead, these studies tend to focus on basic demographic variables, such as race and gender, interpersonal relationships, and organizational culture (Soni, 2000).\n\nThe current studies aim to fill in these links within the literature by examining both attitudes towards diversity in general and attitudes towards diversity initiatives in the workplace, while focusing on the potential influences of individual differences. Study 1 explored the relationships between Big Five personality and attitudes that employees have toward diversity in the workplace. Study 2 aimed to in part replicate the findings of Study 1, as well as extend Study 1 by investigating how personality and general attitudes towards diversity related to potential diversity initiatives proposed by the individual\u2019s employer, to capture both past and potential future support.

[], "value": "The dilemma of dual-use technologies is a critical topic in studies of nuclear security. This is especially true in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), a region that has experienced a \u201cnuclear renaissance\u201d since 2000. Many MENA states have sought to develop or acquire civilian nuclear technology. Yet, risks emerge that such civilian nuclear technology could be diverted to building a nuclear weapon, the so-called \u201cdual-use\u201d problem. Even after a state has signed nonproliferation agreements and pledged to reserve nuclear technology for civilian use, such as energy or desalinization, it is conceivable that it could face national security threats that motivate the weaponization of this technology. Examples from outside the MENA, notably North Korea, indicate that states that have signed nonproliferation treaties can opt out to build a nuclear bomb and pursue aggressive nuclear strategies. Different explanations have sought to predict why states choose to weaponize civilian nuclear technology, previously reserved for peaceful purposes. State-centric research emphasizes incentives created by threats in the international system. If one state converts peaceful nuclear technology into a weapon, then neighboring states undertake a similar strategy for deterrence. The fact that all states fear the possible consequences of nuclear war does not discrouage proliferation but it does foster a \u201cnuclear balance\u201d of peace among states. Other studies look at domestic politics, and how individual leaders might earn political points by weaponizing nuclear technology. Egypt\u2019s Jamal \u2018Abdel Nasser and Pakistan\u2019s Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, for example, improved their domestic political positions by re-directing civilian nuclear technology to military programs. Little research, however, has examined the role of citizen attitudes in this process, and public opinion on decisions to weaponize technology in nuclear latent states. The conditions under which citizens express support for the weaponization of nuclear technology previously reserved for peaceful, civilian purposes has been underexplored. How might the identity of an enemy state posing a hostile threat affect citizen attitudes toward weaponization? In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, does a hypothetical threat from Iran, Israel, or another Arab state have a larger effect in raising (or depressing) Arab public support for building and, ultimately, using a nuclear bomb? Because Iran, Israel, and neighboring Arab states vary in their military strength, nuclear capacities, and cultural traits, it is likely that citizens of an Arab state receiving the threat\u2014in this study, Morocco\u2014will not perceive these threats equally. Rather, threats issued from one of these states may be more (or less) likely to increase citizens\u2019 support for building and using a nuclear bomb. To investigate this topic, this project proposes to use a population-based survey experiment to explore citizen attitudes toward the dual-use problem of nuclear technology. Specifically, the project will use funding from the University of Tennessee\u2019s Institute for Nuclear Security to conduct a 2000 person survey experiment in Morocco, a nuclear latent state in the MENA region that has an active civilian nuclear program since the 1980s.
