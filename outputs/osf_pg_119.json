This inference seems intuitive, yet there is not much discussion about this kind of inference, let alone empirical research on it. Theoretical discussion about desires generally focus on the desires expressed by the verb \"want\", and the discussion is centered on how the expressed desires are related to the attitude holder's beliefs and on what the relevant set is that the desired objects are compared to (see e.g. Heim 1992, Villalta 2008, Rubinstein 2012).
