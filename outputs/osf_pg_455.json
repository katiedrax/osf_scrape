I have already explored disfluency in relation to the Cognitive Reflection Test, a three-item measure of the ability to reject intuitive wrong answers and arrive at the correct response (Frederick, 2005). When given the CRT on paper, participants in the disfluent condition received higher average scores, replicating the results of Alter et al. (2007). Disfluency did not correspond with higher CRT scores when the test was given online \u2013 either with a university student sample or on SurveyMonkey \u2013 and led to lower scores among smartphone users. Therefore, I am conducting my political misinformation study on paper. The sample is of approximately 300 Dartmouth College students. While the sample will most likely be more liberal and have a higher level of political knowledge than the country as a whole, disfluency affects everyone. It alters the visual and mental information processing that everyone must engage in and has been shown to have significant effects on university samples in the past (see, e.g., Swami et al. 2014). Participants were offered a $2 bill to complete the survey. The survey asks participants to fill out a consent form and write down the time at which they begin. After asking basic questions about demographics and political affiliation, the experiment gives participants two short \u201carticles\u201d on political topic, which both look like real articles. The first is about President Obama\u2019s promise that, under the Affordable Care Act, \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep it.\u201d The second describes the comments of Representative Peter King, R-NY, about the Senate\u2019s recent CIA report on U.S. interrogation methods. King \u2013 a Republican and chairman of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterintelligence & Terrorism \u2013 says there were no lasting injuries from the interrogations. The articles\u2019 order is randomized. Participants in the experimental conditions see a fact check after each article, which they are told is from a non-partisan organization. One fact check says that 4 million people lost their health care plans under the Affordable Care Act, while the other says that one person died and another lost an eye due to U.S. interrogation methods. Participants in the control condition do not see fact checks after the articles. After reading each article or article and fact check, all participants answer a series of DV questions. First is a Likert scale of how accurate they think Obama\u2019s/King\u2019s statement is, followed by a question asking how difficult they found it to arrive at this answer. Next is a free-response question on why they think the statement is accurate or inaccurate, followed by a yes-no question about whether they think Obama/King was being intentionally deceptive. They are then asked to recall a small detail from the article. At the end of the survey, all participants are asked to name the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and the British Prime Minister. They are also asked whether they were already familiar with the experiment, and to record the time at which they finished the survey. Works cited: Alter, Adam L., Daniel M.

Even more, we know very little about what is behind this political behavior or, to put it differently, which factors lead a citizen to vote strategically. On the other side, there is an important discussion related to the influence of electoral polls on voting behavior. In several Latin American countries, pre election polls are considered extremely influential on voters\u2019 decisions, and politicians promote their regulation in order to minimize that influence. However, it\u2019s uncertain how this influence works. When does strategic voting increase? Taking this background into consideration, the primary goal of this experiment is to determine if polling results showing different outcomes generate a strategic voting. In Uruguayan local elections, political parties can compete with more than one candidate, and the winner is the candidate that gets more votes in the most voted party. In the 2015 local election in Montevideo there are two main political parties: one center-left party Frente Amplio, and one center-right party named Partido de la Concertaci\u00f3n (an electoral alliance between the two traditional parties: Partido Nacional and Partido Colorado). Since the beginning of the political campaign, polls predicted that Frente Amplio would be the winner with a difference of around 20 percent points from Concertaci\u00f3n. This prevalence endured the whole campaign. In the Frente Amplio the competition was among three candidates. Two of them, Daniel Mart\u00ednez and Lucia Topolanski shared the 99% of the Frente Amplio\u2019s preferences. Daniel Mart\u00ednez is a moderate candidate while Luc\u00eda Topolanski is a more extreme one, placed to the left of Mart\u00ednez. Therefore, voters whose first preference was voting for Concertaci\u00f3n were inclined to change their vote for their second preference (Mart\u00ednez, the most moderate inside the Frente Amplio\u2019s offer) in order to avoid Topolanski\u2019s victory. A survey experiment was applied on a sample of 504 respondents living in Montevideo, the capital city of Uruguay. The survey is a pre electoral survey carried out by Opci\u00f3n Consultores, a Uruguayan polling firm, during the week before election day. Respondents should answer the following voting preference question: \u201cIf departamental elections to chose the Major of Montevideo would be next Sunday, and the candidates would be the following: from the Frente Amplio - Daniel Mart\u00ednez , Luc\u00eda Topolansky and Virginia Cardozo; from the Partido de la Concertaci\u00f3n - \u00c1lvaro Garc\u00e9, Ricardo Rachetti and Edgardo Novick; from the Partido Independiente - Ivan Posada and from Unidad Popular Gustavo L\u00f3pez, for which candidate would you vote? At the end of the survey, respondents would be randomly asked one of the following two questions: 1) If one week before the departmental election, polls say that the Frente Amplio would win the election in Montevideo and show a tie between Luc\u00eda Topolansky and Daniel Mart\u00ednez, for which candidate from the pool of all political parties would you vote for Major in Montevideo? 2) If one week before the departmental election, polls say that the Frente Amplio would win the election in Montevideo and show that Daniel Mart\u00ednez would win the election without any doubt, for which candidate from the pool of all political parties would you vote for Major in Montevideo?"}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: Voters that receive polling information that the election would be highly competitive will show a strategic behavior.
