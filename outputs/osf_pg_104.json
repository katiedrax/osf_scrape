fluent speech, listeners must rely on a combination of different cues. In this study, we investigate the role of two cues: statistical ones and prosodic ones, and how they interact in French adults.\n\nIn the learning phase of the study, participants will hear an artificial language made of four trisyllabic words. These four words will be repeated in a random order (with the same word never appearing twice in a row), without pauses between them, for 3 to 4 minutes. An excerpt of the speech stream would be: /gu-do-la-lo-ga-bi-gu-do-la-ba-ti-pu/[\u2026], with gu-do-la being a word.\nOnly two cues will be available to perform lexical segmentation (i.e. the action of perceiving a group of syllables as one complete word): statistical and prosodic information. Statistical information (that is, how often two syllables follow one another) will always be present. Prosodic information will vary between participants: no prosody (flat), prosodic cues consistent with statistical cues (consistent), and prosodic cues inconsistent with statistical cues (inconsistent). \nWhile hearing the language, participants will also watch a quick succession of simple images. This will allow us to compare these conditions to a future experiment, where participants will listen to the same languages, but will have to devote their attention to the stream in an attentional one-back task (i.e. they will have to press a button every time they detect the same picture appearing twice in a row).\n\nIn the test phase of the experiment, participants will hear 16 different sequences made up of two words they heard in the learning phase. For each sequence, they will have to choose which of the two words correspond to a word of the language they just heard. This choice reflects which words the participants segmented during the learning phase.\nFor every sequence, one of the words will be a statistical word (e.g. /gu-do-la/ in the sequence /gu-do-la-lo-ga-bi-gu-do-la-ba-ti-pu/[\u2026]). Segmentation of statistical word should have been facilitated by statistical cues.  The other word will be a part-word (e.g. /la-lo-ga/ in the sequence /gu-do-la-lo-ga-bi-gu-do-la-ba-ti-pu/[\u2026]). Segmentation of a part-word should have been impeded by statistical cues. Crucially, when prosodic cues are consistent with statistical cues, prosodic cues should also have facilitated statistical word segmentation, and impeded part-word segmentation. When prosodic cues are inconsistent with statistical cues, however, they should have facilitated part-word segmentation, and impeded statistical-word segmentation.\nThere will also be four catch trials in the test phase, to ensure participants correctly followed instructions during the learning and test phases."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Participants listening to the language with no prosodic cues (flat condition) should pick statistical words more than by chance.\n\nParticipants listening to the language with prosodic cues consistent with statistical cues (consistent condition) should pick statistical words more than in the no prosodic cue condition, and more than by chance.\n\nParticipants listening to the language with prosodic cues inconsistent with statistical cues (inconsistent condition), will pick statistical words less than in the no prosodic cue condition.

Prosodic information will vary between participants: no prosody (flat), prosodic cues consistent with statistical cues (consistent), and prosodic cues inconsistent with statistical cues (inconsistent). \nWhile hearing the language, participants will also watch a quick succession of simple images. This will allow us to compare these conditions to a future experiment, where participants will listen to the same languages, but will have to devote their attention to the stream in an attentional one-back task (i.e. they will have to press a button every time they detect the same picture appearing twice in a row).\n\nIn the test phase of the experiment, participants will hear 16 different sequences made up of two words they heard in the learning phase. For each sequence, they will have to choose which of the two words correspond to a word of the language they just heard. This choice reflects which words the participants segmented during the learning phase.\nFor every sequence, one of the words will be a statistical word (e.g. /gu-do-la/ in the sequence /gu-do-la-lo-ga-bi-gu-do-la-ba-ti-pu/[\u2026]). Segmentation of statistical word should have been facilitated by statistical cues.  The other word will be a part-word (e.g. /la-lo-ga/ in the sequence /gu-do-la-lo-ga-bi-gu-do-la-ba-ti-pu/[\u2026]). Segmentation of a part-word should have been impeded by statistical cues. Crucially, when prosodic cues are consistent with statistical cues, prosodic cues should also have facilitated statistical word segmentation, and impeded part-word segmentation. When prosodic cues are inconsistent with statistical cues, however, they should have facilitated part-word segmentation, and impeded statistical-word segmentation.\nThere will also be four catch trials in the test phase, to ensure participants correctly followed instructions during the learning and test phases.", "q4": "Participants listening to the language with no prosodic cues (flat condition) should pick statistical words more than by chance.\n\nParticipants listening to the language with prosodic cues consistent with statistical cues (consistent condition) should pick statistical words more than in the no prosodic cue condition, and more than by chance.\n\nParticipants listening to the language with prosodic cues inconsistent with statistical cues (inconsistent condition), will pick statistical words less than in the no prosodic cue condition.

Nevertheless, since most prior studies are observational, it is not clear whether these external factors are actually causing these changes in ethnic identification or whether they are mere byproducts of ethnicity. A separate literature on immigration studies has found that punitive immigration policies may have extra-legal social consequences. Ethnographers have found that high profile anti- immigrant policies like Arizona\u2019s SB 1070 have led immigrants to become anxious about being in public out of fear of being apprehended (Menjivar). Quantitative researchers have found that subnational anti-immigrant policies may have decreased the size of the immigrant Latino population in some communities that considered these laws (Parrado). Though some scholars have argued that immigrants may have fled these communities out of fear, the involved mechanisms are still not well understood. In this study, we test a novel mechanism. In line with prior constructivist approaches to the study of identity, we propose that ethnic identity is contextual and malleable. On the face of perceived political xenophobia, some individuals may shift their identities away from stigmatized categories. This may drive the reduction in Hispanic immigrants as captured in surveys. This protective behavior would be in line with prior research that shows an upsurge in citizenship acquisition. In other words, Latino immigrants may not be physically fleeing these communities. Instead, by choosing not to identify as Latino or as immigrant, they may be becoming invisible for survey researchers. In summary, in this study we test whether exposure to political xenophobia in the form of anti-immigrant policies leads individuals to shift their ethnic identification. Further, to illuminate the mechanisms that mediate this relationship, we will test whether different political acts have distinct consequences. More specifically, we will prime simple immigration statements by a politician, a symbolic policy, and a non-symbolic policy.

majority of information proficient language users store pertains to lexical semantics [1]. A multilingual\u2019s accumulated lexical knowledge is by definition distributed over more than one language. In the current study, we aim to investigate lexico-semantic knowledge and processing of emerging English speakers and the effects of their exposure to other languages. What is the nature of such influence? Are its effects generalizable across multilinguals with different language combinations?\nA common finding in the bilingual and multilingual literature is that individuals knowing more than one language perform poorer than monolinguals on monolingual standardized vocabulary tests [e.g., 2,3]. The main source of discrepancies in individual languages\u2019 vocabulary sizes has been attributed to differences in the proportion of time a multilingual is exposed to them [3\u20138]. For example, Cattani et al. [3] estimate a 60% L1 exposure threshold above which bilinguals perform like monolinguals in the L1: if \u2013 for example \u2013 an English-Spanish bilingual child is exposed to English and Spanish at a 70-30% ratio, their English vocabulary scores should fall within the range of a monolingual English child, while their Spanish score would be significantly lower than the Spanish monolingual norm. However, other factors than time might be of importance too. Our goal is to better understand the elements of multilinguals\u2019 environment contributing to multilingual lexical development, with particular attention to the effects of linguistic distance between languages.\nLanguages\u2019 lexicons overlap cross-linguistically to different degrees. Such overlap can be quantified through e.g., comparisons of word lists and computational tools [cf. 9], providing a formalized index of lexical distance between a pair of languages. Our focus is on whether thus quantified relative overlap (similarities) and differences between multilingual children\u2019s languages contribute to the behavioral and neural signatures of lexical knowledge and processing in their dominant (L1) language. Crucially, we gauge both the amount of exposure to other languages and the lexical overlaps between them in order to isolate the effects of the linguistic diversity of children\u2019s environments. \nAlthough the effect of linguistic distance seems robust for second language (L2) attainment [10\u201316], direct evidence for its role in L1 is somewhat contradictory and virtually nonexistent for multilingual (as opposed to bilingual) populations. In a recent study performed in a Dutch-speaking environment [17], L1 (Dutch) receptive vocabulary scores of 6-7-year-olds were related to their L2\u2019s distance to Dutch. Lower scores were reported for children whose L2 overlapped least with Dutch; children exposed to languages with a small distance to Dutch, did not differ in terms of their receptive vocabulary from their monolingual peers. Contrastingly, in a study by Floccia et al., [18] smaller linguistic distance between 2-year-olds\u2019 two languages was shown to be related to greater vocabulary outcomes in their L2 but not L1. Children with an L2 whose word forms were close to L1 (English) had a larger expressive L2 vocabulary, and those learning languages whose morphological or syntactic structure was close to English had larger receptive L2 vocabulary scores. There were no significant effects on children\u2019s L1 (English) scores, a finding interpreted along the lines of children\u2019s English acquisition benefitting from growing up in an English-speaking environment, and not from exposure to other languages. Furthermore, the results of Keuleers and colleagues [19] show that multilingualism can in fact have positive effects on L1 vocabulary development in that multilinguals possibly acquire L1 vocabulary indirectly through L2 which outweighs vocabulary loss through decreased L1 exposure. This effect was especially salient for L2s with a relatively small lexical distance with respect to the L1 (i.e., those sharing a large number of vocabulary items). Note however that the study only reported linguistic distance effects of the \u201cbest foreign language\u201d, not accounting for lexical overlaps between multilinguals\u2019 other languages, even though some of the participants reported knowledge of six or more languages.\nIn terms of L1 lexical processing, it has been shown that multilinguals\u2019 processing system is not selective: given a certain proficiency level, other languages than the L1 can influence the processing of multilinguals\u2019 dominant language, be it in the visual [20,21] or auditory domain [22,23]. On neural level, studies show that L1 processing among bilingual subjects is different from that of monolinguals (see [24] for an overview). Overall higher levels of neural activity in bilinguals have been argued to be tied to increased language processing demands in bilingual compared with monolingual participants, a phenomenon referred to as the brain\u2019s \u201cbilingual signature\u201d [25]. \nWhether and to what degree these effects apply to multilinguals with different language combinations is, to the best of our knowledge, unknown. Studies tackling linguistic distance effects on neural level have concentrated on overlaps and dissociations in neural activity across L1 and L2, and not processing differences as a function of multilinguals\u2019 experience. In short, although some studies have reported processing of languages with varied levels of similarity to converge on the same neuronal populations irrespective of linguistic distance [26], others tied larger linguistic distance to the use of additional neural resources during reading [27], or syntactic processing [28], along with evidence for stronger leftward lateralization for L2 auditory processing that is more similar to L1 [29].\nThe current study seeks to answer the question of whether typology and relative lexical dis-tance between a multilingual\u2019s languages explain variance in their L1 vocabulary knowledge in addition to language exposure measures accounting for time only [cf. 3\u20137]. Furthermore, we are interested in the neural mechanisms driving these effects, aiming at establishing the neural signatures of linguistic diversity of the environment in which multilingual children grow up and develop their language skills. \nTreating multilingualism as a spectrum of experiences and not a dichotomous category [cf. 30\u201332], our approach is to describe multilingual children\u2019s language experiences as closely as possible (see however [e.g., 33,34] for language environment estimates much more extensive than ours). We used a detailed parental questionnaire and in-person interviews and calculated the length of cumulative exposure to any language each child in the sample came into contact with during their lives. We then gathered information pertaining to relative linguistic distances between each child\u2019s languages, based on languages\u2019 lexicons. From these data, we derived three indices representing children\u2019s cumulative language exposure, putatively influencing the L1 (English) vocabulary knowledge and processing in our sample: (1) proportion of CUMULATIVE LENGTH OF EXPOSURE to English, (2) DIVERSITY OF LANGUAGE EXPOSURE, describing the variability of language input irrespective of language combinations but accounting for cumulative length of exposure to all languages, and (3) TYPOLOGICAL DIVERSITY OF LANGUAGE EXPOSURE \u2013 an index accounting for the linguistic distance between participants\u2019 languages and relative lengths of exposure at the same time. Using English receptive and expressive vocabulary scores as our outcome variables on one hand, and cortical activation levels during two lexical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks on the other, we aim to run separate regression models to assess whether our language diversity index accounting for the linguistic distance between participants\u2019 languages will account for variance above and beyond the other two indices. Voxel-wise visualizations of model assessment applied to the fMRI data [35] will be used to specify the spatial scope of these effects.\nOur approach is novel is several respects. From a methodological point of view, we leverage computational tools from information technology \u2013 Shannon\u2019s [36] entropy, and the study of ecological diversity \u2013 Rao\u2019s [37] quadratic entropy index of diversity, thus offering a pioneering, multi-dimensional quantification of language exposure in multilinguals. By modelling language exposure of our sample as is, and not handpicking our groups of interest, we therefore offer an ecologically valid way of describing the multilingual language experience, an approach rarely followed (see e.g. [30,38] for noteworthy exceptions) but highly called for in the multilingual literature [cf. 32,39]. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate linguistic distance effects in a group of multilingual children, accounting for typological relations between all their languages. Lastly, we offer an insight not only into the behavioral manifestations of multilingual upbringing but also its neural correlates, thus filling an important gap in research on L2-learning-induced neuroplasticity driven by language typology [cf. 40]."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "I.\tWe expect to replicate the established correlations between children\u2019s L1 (English) vocabulary knowledge and measures accounting for the relative proportion of time they were exposed to English [cf. 3\u20136].\nII.\tMore variance in children\u2019s vocabulary knowledge and lexical processing neuroimaging data will be explained by the measure of language exposure that accounts for the linguistic distance between their languages than by measures modeling the time aspect only.\nIII.\tLinguistic distance will moderate the relationship between language exposure and behavioral and neural markers of lexical processing in that exposure to more distant languages will result in (a) lower English vocabulary scores [cf. 17,19], and (b) L1 processing on neural level being characterized by the neural signature [cf. 25] with the activation levels linearly contingent on the degree of linguistic overlap between the languages [cf. 27,28]."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

A detailed description of the way the basic measurements were combined for the final analyses can be found in the Section \u2018Indices\u2019 below. The following pieces of data will be included in the calculation of the indices:\n(1)\tLanguage Exposure data were collected using detailed parental questionnaires and in-person interviews. The length of cumulative exposure to any language each child in the sample came into contact with during their lives was calculated following methods de-scribed in [44] and using an adapted (from three to five languages) version of the \u2018Amount of language exposure in the past\u2019 section of the Bilingual Language Experience Calculator (BiLEC) form. The following information was used: \n        a.\thow many and which languages a child has been exposed to so far at home, (if applicable) at daycare and in any other structured way (e.g., through a baby-sitter or a play group). We include also relatively short language experiences (\u201c1 hour a week for 6 months\u201d), since even limited language exposure have been reported to have a significant impact on individual\u2019s cognitive outcomes [45,46];\n        b.\twhat proportion of time each adult or sibling living in the house spoke English or another language for each one-year period in the child\u2019s life; \n        c.\tif the child attended daycare, or other out-of-school activities, how much time did they spend there per week and what was the approximate time ratio of languages used for instruction for each one-year period in the child\u2019s life;\n        d.\ttime spent at school and language use at school quantified based on data available on San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD)  website (http://www.sfusd.edu/en/enroll-in-sfusd-schools/language-pathways.html) and individual schools\u2019 websites.\n(2)\tLexical Distances between each child\u2019s languages were collected through the Automated Similarity Judgment Program (ASJP) Database (http://asjp.clld.org/) [41]. ASJP is a tool aimed at objective, data-driven evaluation of similarity between words with the same mean-ing from different languages, and computational classification of languages based on their lexical similarity. The distance values were collected by comparing lists of words pertaining to a set of 40 concepts specified in [47]. The word lists were transcribed using a system called \u201cASJPcode\u201d \u2013 a transcription into a simplified standard orthography, described in [48]. Words were compared with each other based on their Levenshtein Distance [49], being the minimum number of changes (insertions, deletions or substitutions) necessary to convert one word into another. Levenshtein Distance Normalized Divided (LDND) was used in the present study, given its robustness against chance resemblances [50]. LDND is a result of, first, a correction for differences in word length by dividing the raw Levenshtein distance by the number of symbols of the longer of the two words being compared (resulting in LDN \u2013 Levenstein Distance Normalized), followed by dividing the LDN by the average LDN of words not referring to the same concept. The distances were computed using the program ASJP.R by Wichmann (https://github.com/Sokiwi/InteractiveASJP01). All data are freely available from [41] (http://asjp.clld.org/).\n\n\nDependent variables \n\nBehavioral data\nTwo outcome variables are used in the study: a measure of RECEPTIVE and EXPRESSIVE English vocabulary. \n(1)\tReceptive (Standard American) English vocabulary was measured with the Peabody Pic-ture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), 4th Edition, Form A [51]. In this test, the participant is asked to pick one out of four pictures that best described a word stated by the examiner for each question by either pointing at the picture or stating the number assigned to a picture. The test takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. The test has been shown to have good to excellent internal consistency (.89\u2013.97) and test-retest reliability (.87\u2013.93).\n(2)\tExpressive English vocabulary was measured with the Picture Vocabulary subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson, 4th Edition (WJ-IV-PV), Tests of Oral Language [52,53]. The Picture Vocabulary subtest is an expressive language measure at the single-word level, where the participant is asked to name pictures. It measures oral language development and lexical knowledge. Participants are asked to identify pictured objects. The items become increasingly difficult as the selected pictures appear less frequently in the environment. The basal level is established when 6 of the lowest consecutive items are answered correctly. The test is terminated if the participant misses 6 items in a row. The test takes approximately 8 minutes to complete. Extensive information on the WJ\u2019s internal and external validity evidence can be found in [54]. \nCovariates of no-interest. The following covariates of no-interest will be used in the analyses: participant\u2019s age at the moment of testing, their gender, socioeconomic status (SES), and depending on the relations observed in the data (i.e., existence of associations with both the independent and dependent variables), nonverbal reasoning skills measured by the Kauffman Brief Intelligence Test, 2nd Edition (KBIT-2) [55]. See Section \u2018Indices\u2019 below for the description of how the SES index was calculated.\n\nNeuroimaging data\nDescription of tasks. Two experimental tasks will be analyzed: (1) English Auditory Word-Form Match Task (henceforth Word-Form Match Task) and (2) English Auditory Semantic Word Match Task (henceforth Semantic Match Task). See [56] for a full description of task (1). For clarity, both tasks are also described in detail below. The tasks consisted of consecutive auditory presentation of two English words. Children were asked to indicate (with a button press) whether the words matched in form [task (1)] or were semantically related [task (2)]. Each task was presented in a separate 3.8 min functional run and consisted of 6 blocks separated by 12 s inter-block rest periods. 24 trials were included in each block, half of which were matching in form or were semantically related. Each 6 s trial consisted of Word 1, followed by Word 2 2000 ms later, followed by a 2000 ms question mark (see attached 'in-scanner-tasks-illustration.pdf'). \nStimuli. \n(1)\tWord-Form Match Task: Participants heard two words and were asked to indicate via but-ton press whether the two words were the same or not (e.g., \u201cpants\u201d \u2013 \u201cpants\u201d = yes, \u201chole\u201d \u2013 \u201cmop\u201d = no). For each individual trial, stimuli were matched for the number of syllables and phonemes. All words had one or two syllables and were an average of 4.23 phonemes long. \n(2)\tSemantic Match Task: Participants heard two words and were asked to indicate via button press whether or not the two words \u201cgo together,\u201d or are semantically related (e.g., \u201csing \u2013 dance\u201d = yes, \u201crabbit \u2013 stroller\u201d = no). As defined by the University of South Florida Free Association Norms, semantically related pairs had a mean forward association strength of 0.35, ranging from 0.05 (\u201cnotebook \u2013 pencil\u201d) to 0.76 (\u201ctable \u2013 chair\u201d). Non-matching pairs had no association [57]. Although we attempted to match the number of syllables and pho-nemes across the two words in each trial, many strongly associated words varied in length (e.g., \u201cgift \u2013 birthday,\u201d or \u201cforest \u2013 tree.\u201d Nevertheless, all words had one or two syllables, and were an average of 4.19 phonemes long. There were no significant differences in pho-neme length, age of acquisition, verbal frequency, written frequency or imageability be-tween words semantically associated trials as compared to non-matching trials [58]. \nPre-processing parameters. Imaging data were processed using FSL software Version 6.0.0 (FMRIB's Software Library, http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl [59]). Pre-processing was carried out using FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool) Version 6.00. The pre-statistics processing steps included: removal of the first 11 volumes for signal equilibration (173 volumes retained); motion correction using MCFLIRT [60]; non-brain removal using BET [61]; grand-mean intensity normalization of the entire 4D dataset by a single multiplicative factor; spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of 5 mm FWHM; B0 unwarping using BBR (Boundary-Based Registration; https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FLIRT_BBR; [60,62]), which also performs simultaneous registration to the high resolution T1-image (rigid body, 6 degrees of freedom). After this, T1-images were registered to MNI-152 standard space using 12-parameter affine transformation and non-linear registration with a warp resolution of 10\u2009mm in FNIRT [63,64]. After conducting standard data preprocessing, in order to identify and remove head motion-related artefacts from functional MRI data, ICA-AROMA (Independent Component Analysis-based Automatic Removal of Motion Artifacts; https://github.com/maartenmennes/ICA-AROMA; [65]) was performed, but only on data that passed motion quality control (i.e., data where the absolute mean displacement during the run was less than 5mm). The de-noised data were then high-pass filtered with a cutoff of 36\u2009s (0.036\u2009Hz) and the registration parameters were reapplied. \nSingle-level statistical analysis. Time-series statistical analysis was carried out using FILM with local autocorrelation correction [66]. The design matrices for each run for each participant included task blocks as events of interest with signal from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as nuisance regressor. \nDependent variables. Relative levels of BOLD signal during task blocks compared to rest blocks derived from the single-level statistical analyses of each of the experimental runs (Word-Form and Semantic Match Tasks).\nCovariates of no-interest. Participants\u2019 demographic variables will be the same as for the behavioral data. In addition, each statistical model at individual level included white matter and CSF signal as nuisance regressors. Group-level analyses will additionally include participant\u2019s handedness (coded as -1,0,1 for left-handed, ambidextrous and right-handed respectively) and an index of their behavioral performance on the task (see Section \u2018Indices\u2019 below).\n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "in-scanner-tasks-illustration.pdf"}, "nodeId": "s5j42", "sha256": "ff4a96e0de475de5fae1ea1814f9eef4d206bf616a04436ea1d9ed07be1f53d8", "viewUrl": "/project/7wq3k/files/osfstorage/5e77f71b0cd06c067a009ce8/", "selectedFileName": "in-scanner-tasks-illustration.pdf"}], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Cumulative Length of Exposure to English. \nThe Cumulative Length of Exposure to English was calculated using information gathered with the BiLEC form (see Section \u2018Measured variables\u2019 above). Details with regards to exact calculations can be found in the instrument\u2019s manual available at https://www.iris-database.org/iris/app/home/detail?id=york%3A928327&amp;ref=search. As per authors\u2019 instructions some country-specific and participant-specific data were changed in the form, including values for average number of hours at school, number of weeks\u2019 holiday per year. In our analyses, we used the proportion of Cumulative Length of Exposure to English, which was calculated by dividing the total English exposure BiLEC-derived value (in years) by participant\u2019s age at testing.\n\nDiversity of Language Exposure. \nThe Diversity of Language Exposure indexed how variable each participant\u2019s language exposure was irrespective of particular language combinations but accounting for cumulative length of exposure to all languages. We computed it using the Shannon\u2019s entropy (H) equation [36]: (see attached)\nwhere, n stands for the total number of languages a participant has been exposed to and pi is the proportion of time (in years) a participant was exposed to that language during their life. We calculated the Diversity of Language Exposure index using the \u201centropy\u201d R package (https://rdrr.io/cran/entropy/). \n\nTypological Diversity of Language Exposure. \nThe Typological Diversity of Language Exposure index was created using Rao's quadratic entropy equation (QE) [37,67,68]. The summed lexical distances between all language pairs for each child were weighted by the length of exposure to each language as follows:\nIf the proportion of cumulative length of exposure to i-th language in a child\u2019s repertoire is pi and the dissimilarity between language i and j is dij, then Typological Diversity of Language Exposure has the form: (see attached)\nwhere dij varies from 0 (i.e., the two languages have exactly the same lexicons) to 1 (i.e., where the two languages have completely different lexicons). We calculated the Typological Diversity of Language Exposure index using the \u201cSYNCSA\u201d R package (https://rdrr.io/cran/SYNCSA/).\n\nSocio-economic status (SES). \nFollowing our previous work [69], SES was indexed as the highest level of education in years attained by each parent. We created one SES metric by averaging education levels of both parents.\n\nAccuracy on the fMRI tasks. \nTo account for response bias participants\u2019 responses on the two fMRI tasks were transformed into d\u2019 scores [70], representing the standardized difference between the means of Hit Rate (HR) \u2013 proportion of YES trials to which subject responded YES, and False Alarm Rate (FAR) \u2013 proportion of NO trials to which subject responded YES:\n(see attached)\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "indices-with-formulas.pdf"}, "nodeId": "s5j42", "sha256": "a628295a47d3fd63a87c2d8df34f0cf2ab3f748e3bd26f9fd63cf3a83bf4e9a0", "viewUrl": "/project/7wq3k/files/osfstorage/5e77f71b0cd06c067a009ce6/", "selectedFileName": "indices-with-formulas.pdf"}], "value": ""}}}, "q19": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypothesis I: L1 vocabulary knowledge is related to the cumulative length of exposure to English (replication)\n\nL1 vocabulary and length of exposure correlations\n\nWe expect to replicate the established correlations between children\u2019s L1 (English) vocabulary knowledge and measures accounting for the relative proportion of time they were exposed to English [cf. 3\u20136].\nMethod. Linear models with covariates of no-interest will be used to determine the existence and strength of the effect of cumulative length of exposure to English on L1 knowledge. Two separate analyses will be done, each for one of the two outcome variables: (1) receptive vocabulary scores (indexed by PPVT) and (2) expressive vocabulary scores (indexed by WJ-IV-PV). We will follow model comparison procedure [cf. 71] by (in each case) fitting a baseline model (containing only the covariates of no-interest) and a model additionally containing the Cumulative Length of Exposure variable. See \u2018Inference criteria\u2019 Section for further information on significance testing.\n\nExposure threshold for monolingual-like performance \n\nIn addition, we aim to replicate Cattani et al.\u2019s [3] finding of a 60% exposure to English cut-off point above which bilinguals (multilinguals in our case) should perform on a par with English monolinguals. \nMethod. We will follow a procedure similar to [3], i.e., a two-stage cluster analysis consisting of (1) approximation of data grouping via a hierarchical cluster analysis, and (2) its refinement with a k-means cluster analysis. In addition, we will perform curve-fitting analyses, estimating linear, quadratic and cubic relationships between the dependent and independent variables [8], which will be followed by a rolling regression analysis. This last step will be performed in order to provide further evidence for whether the model parameters are constant over the whole range of English cumulative exposure data. We will compute parameter estimates over a rolling window with a fixed sample size through the entire sample. No (or negligible) change in the estimates over the rolling windows will point to the parameters being truly constant over our entire sample. A change in parameters with a certain exposure threshold value will be signified by a change in the estimates.\n\n\nHypothesis II: Linguistic distance explains variance above length of exposure \n\nHere, we hypothesize that more variance in children\u2019s vocabulary knowledge and lexical processing neuroimaging data (i.e., the two fMRI tasks data) will be explained by the measure of language exposure that accounts for the linguistic distance between their languages than by measures modeling the time aspect only.\n\nBehavioral data\n\nMethod. Two separate analyses will be done, each for one of the two outcome variables: (1) receptive vocabulary scores (indexed by PPVT) and (2) expressive vocabulary scores (indexed by WJ-IV-PV). We will employ model comparison procedure by fitting three linear models (plus a baseline model) to our two outcome variables. The baseline model will only include the covariates of no-interest. The other three models will additionally include the three indices of language exposure (i.e., Cumulative Length of Exposure to English, Diversity of Language Exposure and Typological Diversity of Language Exposure). See \u2018Inference criteria\u2019 Section for further information on significance testing.\n\nNeuroimaging data\n\nA similar logic will be applied to the neuroimaging data, i.e., we will aim at establishing which of our indices of language exposure best predicts group-level BOLD data acquired during the (1) Word-Form Match Task and the (2) Semantic Match Task. We will fit General Linear Models (GLMs) to the group-level data and assess their quality. The models will similarly include covariates of no-interest along with regressors of interest (i.e., the three language exposure indices). We will follow model assessment procedures described in [35,72,73].\n\n\nHypothesis III: Linguistic distance moderates the relationship between language exposure and behavioral and neural markers of lexical processing\n\nBehavioral data\n\nGiven that being exposed to more than 2 languages in total means that these languages\u2019 lexicons also \u2018interact\u2019 with one another, in order to isolate the moderating effect of linguistic distance on the language exposure \u2013 vocabulary knowledge relation, we will only test this hypothesis in a sub-sample of participants who reported exposure to English and only one other language, i.e., bilinguals. In terms of directionality of the effect, we expect that exposure to more distant languages results in lower English vocabulary scores [cf. 17,19].\nMethod. The moderating effect of language distance on the relationship between the length of language exposure and (1) receptive and (2) expressive vocabulary will be tested by looking for significant interactions between the language distance variable and the length of exposure variable using multiple regression analyses. The existence of the moderating effect will be established through model comparison procedure, strength of the effect by inspecting the parameter estimates and visual inspection of slopes of the moderating effect.\n\nNeuroimaging data \n\nMethod. Group-level General Linear Model analyses will be performed. Similarly, we will look for a significant interaction term between the language distance variable and the length of exposure variable, controlling for covariates of no-interest as indicated above.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "inference-criteria-with-formulas.pdf"}, "nodeId": "s5j42", "sha256": "087977de3bba7a8701ad1c664d8951b57bcccb5e8560cb2879cad592589d5fd5", "viewUrl": "/project/7wq3k/files/osfstorage/5e77f71b0cd06c067a009ce4/", "selectedFileName": "inference-criteria-with-formulas.pdf"}], "value": ""}}}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "All data will be mean centered for the analyses."}, "q21": {"extra": [], "value": "Three types of inference criteria will be employed: frequentist, Bayesian and visual inspection of the data.

A multilingual\u2019s accumulated lexical knowledge is by definition distributed over more than one language. In the current study, we aim to investigate lexico-semantic knowledge and processing of emerging English speakers and the effects of their exposure to other languages. What is the nature of such influence? Are its effects generalizable across multilinguals with different language combinations?\nA common finding in the bilingual and multilingual literature is that individuals knowing more than one language perform poorer than monolinguals on monolingual standardized vocabulary tests [e.g., 2,3]. The main source of discrepancies in individual languages\u2019 vocabulary sizes has been attributed to differences in the proportion of time a multilingual is exposed to them [3\u20138]. For example, Cattani et al. [3] estimate a 60% L1 exposure threshold above which bilinguals perform like monolinguals in the L1: if \u2013 for example \u2013 an English-Spanish bilingual child is exposed to English and Spanish at a 70-30% ratio, their English vocabulary scores should fall within the range of a monolingual English child, while their Spanish score would be significantly lower than the Spanish monolingual norm. However, other factors than time might be of importance too. Our goal is to better understand the elements of multilinguals\u2019 environment contributing to multilingual lexical development, with particular attention to the effects of linguistic distance between languages.\nLanguages\u2019 lexicons overlap cross-linguistically to different degrees. Such overlap can be quantified through e.g., comparisons of word lists and computational tools [cf. 9], providing a formalized index of lexical distance between a pair of languages. Our focus is on whether thus quantified relative overlap (similarities) and differences between multilingual children\u2019s languages contribute to the behavioral and neural signatures of lexical knowledge and processing in their dominant (L1) language. Crucially, we gauge both the amount of exposure to other languages and the lexical overlaps between them in order to isolate the effects of the linguistic diversity of children\u2019s environments. \nAlthough the effect of linguistic distance seems robust for second language (L2) attainment [10\u201316], direct evidence for its role in L1 is somewhat contradictory and virtually nonexistent for multilingual (as opposed to bilingual) populations. In a recent study performed in a Dutch-speaking environment [17], L1 (Dutch) receptive vocabulary scores of 6-7-year-olds were related to their L2\u2019s distance to Dutch. Lower scores were reported for children whose L2 overlapped least with Dutch; children exposed to languages with a small distance to Dutch, did not differ in terms of their receptive vocabulary from their monolingual peers. Contrastingly, in a study by Floccia et al., [18] smaller linguistic distance between 2-year-olds\u2019 two languages was shown to be related to greater vocabulary outcomes in their L2 but not L1. Children with an L2 whose word forms were close to L1 (English) had a larger expressive L2 vocabulary, and those learning languages whose morphological or syntactic structure was close to English had larger receptive L2 vocabulary scores. There were no significant effects on children\u2019s L1 (English) scores, a finding interpreted along the lines of children\u2019s English acquisition benefitting from growing up in an English-speaking environment, and not from exposure to other languages. Furthermore, the results of Keuleers and colleagues [19] show that multilingualism can in fact have positive effects on L1 vocabulary development in that multilinguals possibly acquire L1 vocabulary indirectly through L2 which outweighs vocabulary loss through decreased L1 exposure. This effect was especially salient for L2s with a relatively small lexical distance with respect to the L1 (i.e., those sharing a large number of vocabulary items). Note however that the study only reported linguistic distance effects of the \u201cbest foreign language\u201d, not accounting for lexical overlaps between multilinguals\u2019 other languages, even though some of the participants reported knowledge of six or more languages.\nIn terms of L1 lexical processing, it has been shown that multilinguals\u2019 processing system is not selective: given a certain proficiency level, other languages than the L1 can influence the processing of multilinguals\u2019 dominant language, be it in the visual [20,21] or auditory domain [22,23]. On neural level, studies show that L1 processing among bilingual subjects is different from that of monolinguals (see [24] for an overview). Overall higher levels of neural activity in bilinguals have been argued to be tied to increased language processing demands in bilingual compared with monolingual participants, a phenomenon referred to as the brain\u2019s \u201cbilingual signature\u201d [25]. \nWhether and to what degree these effects apply to multilinguals with different language combinations is, to the best of our knowledge, unknown. Studies tackling linguistic distance effects on neural level have concentrated on overlaps and dissociations in neural activity across L1 and L2, and not processing differences as a function of multilinguals\u2019 experience. In short, although some studies have reported processing of languages with varied levels of similarity to converge on the same neuronal populations irrespective of linguistic distance [26], others tied larger linguistic distance to the use of additional neural resources during reading [27], or syntactic processing [28], along with evidence for stronger leftward lateralization for L2 auditory processing that is more similar to L1 [29].\nThe current study seeks to answer the question of whether typology and relative lexical dis-tance between a multilingual\u2019s languages explain variance in their L1 vocabulary knowledge in addition to language exposure measures accounting for time only [cf. 3\u20137]. Furthermore, we are interested in the neural mechanisms driving these effects, aiming at establishing the neural signatures of linguistic diversity of the environment in which multilingual children grow up and develop their language skills. \nTreating multilingualism as a spectrum of experiences and not a dichotomous category [cf. 30\u201332], our approach is to describe multilingual children\u2019s language experiences as closely as possible (see however [e.g., 33,34] for language environment estimates much more extensive than ours). We used a detailed parental questionnaire and in-person interviews and calculated the length of cumulative exposure to any language each child in the sample came into contact with during their lives. We then gathered information pertaining to relative linguistic distances between each child\u2019s languages, based on languages\u2019 lexicons. From these data, we derived three indices representing children\u2019s cumulative language exposure, putatively influencing the L1 (English) vocabulary knowledge and processing in our sample: (1) proportion of CUMULATIVE LENGTH OF EXPOSURE to English, (2) DIVERSITY OF LANGUAGE EXPOSURE, describing the variability of language input irrespective of language combinations but accounting for cumulative length of exposure to all languages, and (3) TYPOLOGICAL DIVERSITY OF LANGUAGE EXPOSURE \u2013 an index accounting for the linguistic distance between participants\u2019 languages and relative lengths of exposure at the same time. Using English receptive and expressive vocabulary scores as our outcome variables on one hand, and cortical activation levels during two lexical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks on the other, we aim to run separate regression models to assess whether our language diversity index accounting for the linguistic distance between participants\u2019 languages will account for variance above and beyond the other two indices. Voxel-wise visualizations of model assessment applied to the fMRI data [35] will be used to specify the spatial scope of these effects.\nOur approach is novel is several respects. From a methodological point of view, we leverage computational tools from information technology \u2013 Shannon\u2019s [36] entropy, and the study of ecological diversity \u2013 Rao\u2019s [37] quadratic entropy index of diversity, thus offering a pioneering, multi-dimensional quantification of language exposure in multilinguals. By modelling language exposure of our sample as is, and not handpicking our groups of interest, we therefore offer an ecologically valid way of describing the multilingual language experience, an approach rarely followed (see e.g. [30,38] for noteworthy exceptions) but highly called for in the multilingual literature [cf. 32,39]. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate linguistic distance effects in a group of multilingual children, accounting for typological relations between all their languages. Lastly, we offer an insight not only into the behavioral manifestations of multilingual upbringing but also its neural correlates, thus filling an important gap in research on L2-learning-induced neuroplasticity driven by language typology [cf. 40].", "q4": "I.\tWe expect to replicate the established correlations between children\u2019s L1 (English) vocabulary knowledge and measures accounting for the relative proportion of time they were exposed to English [cf. 3\u20136].\nII.\tMore variance in children\u2019s vocabulary knowledge and lexical processing neuroimaging data will be explained by the measure of language exposure that accounts for the linguistic distance between their languages than by measures modeling the time aspect only.\nIII.\tLinguistic distance will moderate the relationship between language exposure and behavioral and neural markers of lexical processing in that exposure to more distant languages will result in (a) lower English vocabulary scores [cf. 17,19], and (b) L1 processing on neural level being characterized by the neural signature [cf. 25] with the activation levels linearly contingent on the degree of linguistic overlap between the languages [cf. 27,28].", "q5": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

Data collection started in October 2015 and finished in January 2019. Each year a new cohort of kindergartners (5-6-year-olds) participated in the study between October and January of their first year of formal schooling. Behavioral and neuroimaging data were collected on separate occasions, with \u2013 on average \u2013 23 days between the two appointments (for participants included in the current analyses).\nFor each appointment, participants were paid $40 in cash. The behavioral assessments were administered by trained research staff on a one-to-one basis. For language exposure data, we used detailed parental questionnaires and in-person interviews. Information about relative linguistic distances between each child\u2019s languages was gathered through the Automated Similarity Judgment Program (ASJP) Database (http://asjp.clld.org/) [41].\nNeuroimaging data were collected using a 3-T Siemens Prisma Fit MRI scanner equipped with a 64-channel head coil. Children were familiarized with the experimental procedures prior to scanning. We used padding to dampen scanner noise and reduce motion, and delivered sound (experimenter instructions, movie during structural scans and auditory stimuli during the fMRI runs) through an MRI compatible sound-system. Participants responses were recorded with a button box. All tasks were created and presented in E-Prime software [42].\nWhole-brain functional images were acquired using a gradient-echo echo-planar pulse sequence (TR = 1250ms, TE = 33.40ms, FA = 45\u00ba, FOV = 220mm, voxel size = 2.2mm3, 64 contiguous 2.20mm axial slices, 0mm inter-slice gap). High resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired with a matrix size of 256*256; 160 contiguous axial slices; voxel resolution 1 mm, TR =2300ms, TE = 2.98ms, T1 = 900ms; and FA = 9.\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Independent variables\n\nOur predictor variables used in both the behavioral and neuroimaging analyses are a combination of LANGUAGE EXPOSURE data and LEXICAL DISTANCE between languages. A detailed description of the way the basic measurements were combined for the final analyses can be found in the Section \u2018Indices\u2019 below. The following pieces of data will be included in the calculation of the indices:\n(1)\tLanguage Exposure data were collected using detailed parental questionnaires and in-person interviews. The length of cumulative exposure to any language each child in the sample came into contact with during their lives was calculated following methods de-scribed in [44] and using an adapted (from three to five languages) version of the \u2018Amount of language exposure in the past\u2019 section of the Bilingual Language Experience Calculator (BiLEC) form. The following information was used: \n        a.\thow many and which languages a child has been exposed to so far at home, (if applicable) at daycare and in any other structured way (e.g., through a baby-sitter or a play group). We include also relatively short language experiences (\u201c1 hour a week for 6 months\u201d), since even limited language exposure have been reported to have a significant impact on individual\u2019s cognitive outcomes [45,46];\n        b.\twhat proportion of time each adult or sibling living in the house spoke English or another language for each one-year period in the child\u2019s life; \n        c.\tif the child attended daycare, or other out-of-school activities, how much time did they spend there per week and what was the approximate time ratio of languages used for instruction for each one-year period in the child\u2019s life;\n        d.\ttime spent at school and language use at school quantified based on data available on San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD)  website (http://www.sfusd.edu/en/enroll-in-sfusd-schools/language-pathways.html) and individual schools\u2019 websites.\n(2)\tLexical Distances between each child\u2019s languages were collected through the Automated Similarity Judgment Program (ASJP) Database (http://asjp.clld.org/) [41]. ASJP is a tool aimed at objective, data-driven evaluation of similarity between words with the same mean-ing from different languages, and computational classification of languages based on their lexical similarity. The distance values were collected by comparing lists of words pertaining to a set of 40 concepts specified in [47]. The word lists were transcribed using a system called \u201cASJPcode\u201d \u2013 a transcription into a simplified standard orthography, described in [48]. Words were compared with each other based on their Levenshtein Distance [49], being the minimum number of changes (insertions, deletions or substitutions) necessary to convert one word into another. Levenshtein Distance Normalized Divided (LDND) was used in the present study, given its robustness against chance resemblances [50]. LDND is a result of, first, a correction for differences in word length by dividing the raw Levenshtein distance by the number of symbols of the longer of the two words being compared (resulting in LDN \u2013 Levenstein Distance Normalized), followed by dividing the LDN by the average LDN of words not referring to the same concept. The distances were computed using the program ASJP.R by Wichmann (https://github.com/Sokiwi/InteractiveASJP01). All data are freely available from [41] (http://asjp.clld.org/).\n\n\nDependent variables \n\nBehavioral data\nTwo outcome variables are used in the study: a measure of RECEPTIVE and EXPRESSIVE English vocabulary. \n(1)\tReceptive (Standard American) English vocabulary was measured with the Peabody Pic-ture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), 4th Edition, Form A [51]. In this test, the participant is asked to pick one out of four pictures that best described a word stated by the examiner for each question by either pointing at the picture or stating the number assigned to a picture. The test takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. The test has been shown to have good to excellent internal consistency (.89\u2013.97) and test-retest reliability (.87\u2013.93).\n(2)\tExpressive English vocabulary was measured with the Picture Vocabulary subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson, 4th Edition (WJ-IV-PV), Tests of Oral Language [52,53]. The Picture Vocabulary subtest is an expressive language measure at the single-word level, where the participant is asked to name pictures. It measures oral language development and lexical knowledge. Participants are asked to identify pictured objects. The items become increasingly difficult as the selected pictures appear less frequently in the environment. The basal level is established when 6 of the lowest consecutive items are answered correctly. The test is terminated if the participant misses 6 items in a row. The test takes approximately 8 minutes to complete. Extensive information on the WJ\u2019s internal and external validity evidence can be found in [54]. \nCovariates of no-interest. The following covariates of no-interest will be used in the analyses: participant\u2019s age at the moment of testing, their gender, socioeconomic status (SES), and depending on the relations observed in the data (i.e., existence of associations with both the independent and dependent variables), nonverbal reasoning skills measured by the Kauffman Brief Intelligence Test, 2nd Edition (KBIT-2) [55]. See Section \u2018Indices\u2019 below for the description of how the SES index was calculated.\n\nNeuroimaging data\nDescription of tasks. Two experimental tasks will be analyzed: (1) English Auditory Word-Form Match Task (henceforth Word-Form Match Task) and (2) English Auditory Semantic Word Match Task (henceforth Semantic Match Task). See [56] for a full description of task (1). For clarity, both tasks are also described in detail below. The tasks consisted of consecutive auditory presentation of two English words. Children were asked to indicate (with a button press) whether the words matched in form [task (1)] or were semantically related [task (2)]. Each task was presented in a separate 3.8 min functional run and consisted of 6 blocks separated by 12 s inter-block rest periods. 24 trials were included in each block, half of which were matching in form or were semantically related. Each 6 s trial consisted of Word 1, followed by Word 2 2000 ms later, followed by a 2000 ms question mark (see attached 'in-scanner-tasks-illustration.pdf'). \nStimuli. \n(1)\tWord-Form Match Task: Participants heard two words and were asked to indicate via but-ton press whether the two words were the same or not (e.g., \u201cpants\u201d \u2013 \u201cpants\u201d = yes, \u201chole\u201d \u2013 \u201cmop\u201d = no). For each individual trial, stimuli were matched for the number of syllables and phonemes. All words had one or two syllables and were an average of 4.23 phonemes long. \n(2)\tSemantic Match Task: Participants heard two words and were asked to indicate via button press whether or not the two words \u201cgo together,\u201d or are semantically related (e.g., \u201csing \u2013 dance\u201d = yes, \u201crabbit \u2013 stroller\u201d = no). As defined by the University of South Florida Free Association Norms, semantically related pairs had a mean forward association strength of 0.35, ranging from 0.05 (\u201cnotebook \u2013 pencil\u201d) to 0.76 (\u201ctable \u2013 chair\u201d). Non-matching pairs had no association [57]. Although we attempted to match the number of syllables and pho-nemes across the two words in each trial, many strongly associated words varied in length (e.g., \u201cgift \u2013 birthday,\u201d or \u201cforest \u2013 tree.\u201d Nevertheless, all words had one or two syllables, and were an average of 4.19 phonemes long. There were no significant differences in pho-neme length, age of acquisition, verbal frequency, written frequency or imageability be-tween words semantically associated trials as compared to non-matching trials [58]. \nPre-processing parameters. Imaging data were processed using FSL software Version 6.0.0 (FMRIB's Software Library, http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl [59]). Pre-processing was carried out using FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool) Version 6.00. The pre-statistics processing steps included: removal of the first 11 volumes for signal equilibration (173 volumes retained); motion correction using MCFLIRT [60]; non-brain removal using BET [61]; grand-mean intensity normalization of the entire 4D dataset by a single multiplicative factor; spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of 5 mm FWHM; B0 unwarping using BBR (Boundary-Based Registration; https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FLIRT_BBR; [60,62]), which also performs simultaneous registration to the high resolution T1-image (rigid body, 6 degrees of freedom). After this, T1-images were registered to MNI-152 standard space using 12-parameter affine transformation and non-linear registration with a warp resolution of 10\u2009mm in FNIRT [63,64]. After conducting standard data preprocessing, in order to identify and remove head motion-related artefacts from functional MRI data, ICA-AROMA (Independent Component Analysis-based Automatic Removal of Motion Artifacts; https://github.com/maartenmennes/ICA-AROMA; [65]) was performed, but only on data that passed motion quality control (i.e., data where the absolute mean displacement during the run was less than 5mm). The de-noised data were then high-pass filtered with a cutoff of 36\u2009s (0.036\u2009Hz) and the registration parameters were reapplied. \nSingle-level statistical analysis. Time-series statistical analysis was carried out using FILM with local autocorrelation correction [66]. The design matrices for each run for each participant included task blocks as events of interest with signal from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as nuisance regressor. \nDependent variables. Relative levels of BOLD signal during task blocks compared to rest blocks derived from the single-level statistical analyses of each of the experimental runs (Word-Form and Semantic Match Tasks).\nCovariates of no-interest. Participants\u2019 demographic variables will be the same as for the behavioral data. In addition, each statistical model at individual level included white matter and CSF signal as nuisance regressors. Group-level analyses will additionally include participant\u2019s handedness (coded as -1,0,1 for left-handed, ambidextrous and right-handed respectively) and an index of their behavioral performance on the task (see Section \u2018Indices\u2019 below).\n\n", "q17.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e77f71b0cd06c067a009ce8", "file_name": "in-scanner-tasks-illustration.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/7wq3k/files/osfstorage/5e77f71b0cd06c067a009ce8", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e77f71b0cd06c067a009ce8"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "ff4a96e0de475de5fae1ea1814f9eef4d206bf616a04436ea1d9ed07be1f53d8"}}], "q18.question": "Cumulative Length of Exposure to English. \nThe Cumulative Length of Exposure to English was calculated using information gathered with the BiLEC form (see Section \u2018Measured variables\u2019 above). Details with regards to exact calculations can be found in the instrument\u2019s manual available at https://www.iris-database.org/iris/app/home/detail?id=york%3A928327&amp;ref=search. As per authors\u2019 instructions some country-specific and participant-specific data were changed in the form, including values for average number of hours at school, number of weeks\u2019 holiday per year. In our analyses, we used the proportion of Cumulative Length of Exposure to English, which was calculated by dividing the total English exposure BiLEC-derived value (in years) by participant\u2019s age at testing.\n\nDiversity of Language Exposure. \nThe Diversity of Language Exposure indexed how variable each participant\u2019s language exposure was irrespective of particular language combinations but accounting for cumulative length of exposure to all languages. We computed it using the Shannon\u2019s entropy (H) equation [36]: (see attached)\nwhere, n stands for the total number of languages a participant has been exposed to and pi is the proportion of time (in years) a participant was exposed to that language during their life. We calculated the Diversity of Language Exposure index using the \u201centropy\u201d R package (https://rdrr.io/cran/entropy/). \n\nTypological Diversity of Language Exposure. \nThe Typological Diversity of Language Exposure index was created using Rao's quadratic entropy equation (QE) [37,67,68]. The summed lexical distances between all language pairs for each child were weighted by the length of exposure to each language as follows:\nIf the proportion of cumulative length of exposure to i-th language in a child\u2019s repertoire is pi and the dissimilarity between language i and j is dij, then Typological Diversity of Language Exposure has the form: (see attached)\nwhere dij varies from 0 (i.e., the two languages have exactly the same lexicons) to 1 (i.e., where the two languages have completely different lexicons). We calculated the Typological Diversity of Language Exposure index using the \u201cSYNCSA\u201d R package (https://rdrr.io/cran/SYNCSA/).\n\nSocio-economic status (SES). \nFollowing our previous work [69], SES was indexed as the highest level of education in years attained by each parent. We created one SES metric by averaging education levels of both parents.\n\nAccuracy on the fMRI tasks. \nTo account for response bias participants\u2019 responses on the two fMRI tasks were transformed into d\u2019 scores [70], representing the standardized difference between the means of Hit Rate (HR) \u2013 proportion of YES trials to which subject responded YES, and False Alarm Rate (FAR) \u2013 proportion of NO trials to which subject responded YES:\n(see attached)\n", "q18.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e77f71b0cd06c067a009ce6", "file_name": "indices-with-formulas.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/7wq3k/files/osfstorage/5e77f71b0cd06c067a009ce6", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e77f71b0cd06c067a009ce6"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "a628295a47d3fd63a87c2d8df34f0cf2ab3f748e3bd26f9fd63cf3a83bf4e9a0"}}], "q19.question": "Hypothesis I: L1 vocabulary knowledge is related to the cumulative length of exposure to English (replication)\n\nL1 vocabulary and length of exposure correlations\n\nWe expect to replicate the established correlations between children\u2019s L1 (English) vocabulary knowledge and measures accounting for the relative proportion of time they were exposed to English [cf. 3\u20136].\nMethod. Linear models with covariates of no-interest will be used to determine the existence and strength of the effect of cumulative length of exposure to English on L1 knowledge. Two separate analyses will be done, each for one of the two outcome variables: (1) receptive vocabulary scores (indexed by PPVT) and (2) expressive vocabulary scores (indexed by WJ-IV-PV). We will follow model comparison procedure [cf. 71] by (in each case) fitting a baseline model (containing only the covariates of no-interest) and a model additionally containing the Cumulative Length of Exposure variable. See \u2018Inference criteria\u2019 Section for further information on significance testing.\n\nExposure threshold for monolingual-like performance \n\nIn addition, we aim to replicate Cattani et al.\u2019s [3] finding of a 60% exposure to English cut-off point above which bilinguals (multilinguals in our case) should perform on a par with English monolinguals. \nMethod. We will follow a procedure similar to [3], i.e., a two-stage cluster analysis consisting of (1) approximation of data grouping via a hierarchical cluster analysis, and (2) its refinement with a k-means cluster analysis. In addition, we will perform curve-fitting analyses, estimating linear, quadratic and cubic relationships between the dependent and independent variables [8], which will be followed by a rolling regression analysis. This last step will be performed in order to provide further evidence for whether the model parameters are constant over the whole range of English cumulative exposure data. We will compute parameter estimates over a rolling window with a fixed sample size through the entire sample. No (or negligible) change in the estimates over the rolling windows will point to the parameters being truly constant over our entire sample. A change in parameters with a certain exposure threshold value will be signified by a change in the estimates.\n\n\nHypothesis II: Linguistic distance explains variance above length of exposure \n\nHere, we hypothesize that more variance in children\u2019s vocabulary knowledge and lexical processing neuroimaging data (i.e., the two fMRI tasks data) will be explained by the measure of language exposure that accounts for the linguistic distance between their languages than by measures modeling the time aspect only.\n\nBehavioral data\n\nMethod. Two separate analyses will be done, each for one of the two outcome variables: (1) receptive vocabulary scores (indexed by PPVT) and (2) expressive vocabulary scores (indexed by WJ-IV-PV). We will employ model comparison procedure by fitting three linear models (plus a baseline model) to our two outcome variables. The baseline model will only include the covariates of no-interest. The other three models will additionally include the three indices of language exposure (i.e., Cumulative Length of Exposure to English, Diversity of Language Exposure and Typological Diversity of Language Exposure). See \u2018Inference criteria\u2019 Section for further information on significance testing.\n\nNeuroimaging data\n\nA similar logic will be applied to the neuroimaging data, i.e., we will aim at establishing which of our indices of language exposure best predicts group-level BOLD data acquired during the (1) Word-Form Match Task and the (2) Semantic Match Task. We will fit General Linear Models (GLMs) to the group-level data and assess their quality. The models will similarly include covariates of no-interest along with regressors of interest (i.e., the three language exposure indices). We will follow model assessment procedures described in [35,72,73].\n\n\nHypothesis III: Linguistic distance moderates the relationship between language exposure and behavioral and neural markers of lexical processing\n\nBehavioral data\n\nGiven that being exposed to more than 2 languages in total means that these languages\u2019 lexicons also \u2018interact\u2019 with one another, in order to isolate the moderating effect of linguistic distance on the language exposure \u2013 vocabulary knowledge relation, we will only test this hypothesis in a sub-sample of participants who reported exposure to English and only one other language, i.e., bilinguals. In terms of directionality of the effect, we expect that exposure to more distant languages results in lower English vocabulary scores [cf. 17,19].\nMethod. The moderating effect of language distance on the relationship between the length of language exposure and (1) receptive and (2) expressive vocabulary will be tested by looking for significant interactions between the language distance variable and the length of exposure variable using multiple regression analyses. The existence of the moderating effect will be established through model comparison procedure, strength of the effect by inspecting the parameter estimates and visual inspection of slopes of the moderating effect.\n\nNeuroimaging data \n\nMethod. Group-level General Linear Model analyses will be performed. Similarly, we will look for a significant interaction term between the language distance variable and the length of exposure variable, controlling for covariates of no-interest as indicated above.\n", "q19.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e77f71b0cd06c067a009ce4", "file_name": "inference-criteria-with-formulas.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/7wq3k/files/osfstorage/5e77f71b0cd06c067a009ce4", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e77f71b0cd06c067a009ce4"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "087977de3bba7a8701ad1c664d8951b57bcccb5e8560cb2879cad592589d5fd5"}}]}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=7wq3k", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "7wq3k", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "7wq3k", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/d6ejs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "d6ejs", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s5j42/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "s5j42", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/7wq3k/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/7wq3k/"}}, {"id": "d3u7g", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "The Relationship between Grandiose and Vulnerable Narcissism: Individual Data Meta-Analysis", "description": "Large-scale investigation of nonlinearity hypothesis, according to which grandiose and vulnerable narcissism are unrelated in the general population but become related at high levels of grandiosity.

The NPI/HSNS are long-lasting standard measures of grandiose and vulnerable narcissism, the FFNI is the to date most comprehensive inventory for the assessment of grandiose and vulnerable narcissism based on the Five-Factor Model.
