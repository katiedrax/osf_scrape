{"extra": [], "value": "Inke Frickus, Thorsten Michael Erle"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Smileys have been developed as the digital counterpart to a real smile. Thereby, they allow the composer of a digital text to convey their emotions non-verbally. Though the use of smileys in computer-mediated-communication (CMC) has proliferated, there is surprisingly little research on the effects of smileys on consumer behavior. This is remarkable, especially with the rise of internet shopping which requires consumers to rely more and more on CMC to communicate their experiences related to consumption in online customer reviews (OCRs), also called 'electronic word-of-mouth' (eWOM). Although recent research suggests that smileys enhance the perceived valence of text messages and lead to emotional contagion, their role within OCRs remains unclear. \n\nAn important distinction in OCRs needs to be made between hedonic products, products that are purchased and consumed for fun, and utilitarian products, products that are purchased and consumed for their functionality.\n\nThe present study investigates whether smileys in OCRs affect the affective reaction of a person to an OCR, how credible a person perceives the OCR to be, and the intention to purchase the product described in the OCR. Given the affective nature of hedonic and the cognitive nature of utilitarian purchasing decisions, purchase intentions for hedonic and utilitarian products should be affected by different mediating variables, which are differently affected by smileys. \n\nIt is expected that the use of smileys in hedonic product reviews will enhance experienced affect, which in turn is expected to influence purchase intentions. In contrast, smileys are expected to have a different effect on utilitarian purchase intentions, as they reduce the perceived credibility of the review. To test this, participants will be presented with positive and negative OCRs of hedonic and utilitarian products that contain a smiley or not. Their experienced affect, the perceived credibility of the OCR, and their purchase intentions will be assessed. "}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypothesis 1: Smileys will increase the perceived valence of an OCR. Therefore, participants will perceive positive OCRs including smileys as more positive and negative OCRs including smileys as more negative than comparable OCRs with only plain text.\n\nHypothesis 2: Smileys are seen as inappropriate in the more formal context of an OCR. Therefore, using smileys (in either positive or negative OCRs) will reduce the perceived credibility of the review.\n \nHypothesis 3: Purchase intentions for hedonic and utilitarian products are based on different considerations. Whereas the intention to purchase hedonic products is primarily guided by the anticipated joy of consuming the product, for utilitarian products usually more objective arguments are used to justify purchases. Since smileys enhance the perceived affect of texts, for hedonic prodcuts positive OCRs including a smiley should lead to higher purchase intentions than plain text positive OCRs. Conversely, negative OCRs of hedonic products including a smiley should lead to lower purchase intentions than plain text negative OCRs. For utilitarian purchase intentions, on the other hand, smileys reduce the credibility of OCRs and therefore positive OCRs of utilitarian products including a smiley should lead to lower purchase intentions compared to plain text positive OCRs because a less credible positive review is a weaker argument for purchasing something. For negative OCRs of utilitarian products, however, including a smiley increases purchase intentions compared to plain text negative OCRs, because a less credible negative review affects purchase intentions less strongly than a high credible negative OCR. \n\nHypotheses 4 and 5: The effects of smileys on purchase intentions should not be direct, but rather be mediated by the affective reaction to an OCR (for hedonic products: Hypothesis 4) or the credibility of an OCR (for utilitarian products: Hypothesis 5)."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Thus, to achieve a power of (1-\u03b2) = 0.80 for the whole set of eight hypothesis tests, every individual test should exhibit a power of (1-\u03b2) = 0.975, because 0.975^6 = 0.817.

Paired samples t-tests will be used for the post-hoc tests of the simple effects.\n\nHypothesis 1 concerns the effect of smileys on affective reactions towards OCRs. It is predicted that smileys will amplify both positive reactions towards positive OCRs and negative reactions towards negative OCRs. This pattern corresponds to the two-way interaction between the factors of Review Valence and Smileys. The simple effects of smileys on affective reactions will be tested separately for positive and negative messages.\n\nHypothesis 2 concerns the effect of smileys on perceived credibility. The hypothesis that smileys lower perceived credibility corresponds to a main effect of Smiley. Although no interaction is predicted, the same post-hoc tests as for affective reactions will be computed.\n\nHypothesis 3 concerns the effect of smileys on purchase intentions. It is predicted that for hedonic products, smileys increase purchase intentions (compared to plain text) for positive OCRs, and reduce purchase intentions for negative OCRs. For utilitarian products, the opposite is predicted: Smileys reduce purchase intentions for positive OCRs, and increase purchase intentions for negative OCRs.

Both for positive and negative OCRs, a mediation of the effect of smileys on purchase intention via Affect is predicted.

Thus, the overall indirect effect should have a positive sign. For negative OCRs, on the other hand, the relation between smileys and affective reactions will be negative. Since affect will still positively predict purchase intentions, this indirect effect will have a negative sign. No effect via Credibility is predicted for hedonic products.\n\nFor utilitarian products, on the other hand, the moderator will affect the path from the mediator to the criterion (model 14 in PROCESS). Both for positive and negative OCRs, a mediation of the effect of smileys on purchase intention via Credibility is predicted. However, the sign of these indirect effects will differ: For all OCRs, smileys will negatively predict credibility.

Thereby, they allow the composer of a digital text to convey their emotions non-verbally. Though the use of smileys in computer-mediated-communication (CMC) has proliferated, there is surprisingly little research on the effects of smileys on consumer behavior. This is remarkable, especially with the rise of internet shopping which requires consumers to rely more and more on CMC to communicate their experiences related to consumption in online customer reviews (OCRs), also called 'electronic word-of-mouth' (eWOM). Although recent research suggests that smileys enhance the perceived valence of text messages and lead to emotional contagion, their role within OCRs remains unclear. \n\nAn important distinction in OCRs needs to be made between hedonic products, products that are purchased and consumed for fun, and utilitarian products, products that are purchased and consumed for their functionality.\n\nThe present study investigates whether smileys in OCRs affect the affective reaction of a person to an OCR, how credible a person perceives the OCR to be, and the intention to purchase the product described in the OCR. Given the affective nature of hedonic and the cognitive nature of utilitarian purchasing decisions, purchase intentions for hedonic and utilitarian products should be affected by different mediating variables, which are differently affected by smileys. \n\nIt is expected that the use of smileys in hedonic product reviews will enhance experienced affect, which in turn is expected to influence purchase intentions. In contrast, smileys are expected to have a different effect on utilitarian purchase intentions, as they reduce the perceived credibility of the review. To test this, participants will be presented with positive and negative OCRs of hedonic and utilitarian products that contain a smiley or not. Their experienced affect, the perceived credibility of the OCR, and their purchase intentions will be assessed. ", "q4": "Hypothesis 1: Smileys will increase the perceived valence of an OCR. Therefore, participants will perceive positive OCRs including smileys as more positive and negative OCRs including smileys as more negative than comparable OCRs with only plain text.\n\nHypothesis 2: Smileys are seen as inappropriate in the more formal context of an OCR. Therefore, using smileys (in either positive or negative OCRs) will reduce the perceived credibility of the review.\n \nHypothesis 3: Purchase intentions for hedonic and utilitarian products are based on different considerations. Whereas the intention to purchase hedonic products is primarily guided by the anticipated joy of consuming the product, for utilitarian products usually more objective arguments are used to justify purchases. Since smileys enhance the perceived affect of texts, for hedonic prodcuts positive OCRs including a smiley should lead to higher purchase intentions than plain text positive OCRs. Conversely, negative OCRs of hedonic products including a smiley should lead to lower purchase intentions than plain text negative OCRs. For utilitarian purchase intentions, on the other hand, smileys reduce the credibility of OCRs and therefore positive OCRs of utilitarian products including a smiley should lead to lower purchase intentions compared to plain text positive OCRs because a less credible positive review is a weaker argument for purchasing something. For negative OCRs of utilitarian products, however, including a smiley increases purchase intentions compared to plain text negative OCRs, because a less credible negative review affects purchase intentions less strongly than a high credible negative OCR. \n\nHypotheses 4 and 5: The effects of smileys on purchase intentions should not be direct, but rather be mediated by the affective reaction to an OCR (for hedonic products: Hypothesis 4) or the credibility of an OCR (for utilitarian products: Hypothesis 5).", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

To be able to detect such an effect size with a power of (1-\u03b2) = 0.80 in a paired samples t-test, N = 41 participants are needed. However, in the current study eight such comparisons are planned (differences between plain messages and messages with a smiley on affective reactions and credibility separate for positive and negative OCRs (four tests), plus differences between plain messages and messages with a smiley on purchase intentions for hedonic and utilitarian products, separately for positive and negative OCRs, also four tests). Thus, to achieve a power of (1-\u03b2) = 0.80 for the whole set of eight hypothesis tests, every individual test should exhibit a power of (1-\u03b2) = 0.975, because 0.975^6 = 0.817.
