Each kiosk features 55\u2019\u2019 high definition displays that show content including advertising and transit information, as well as tablets for accessing city services and maps, free USB charging stations, and phones for making domestic calls. On September 21st, 2018, LinkNYC launched a voter registration drive to encourage voter registration on kiosk tablets, which connect users to an electronic voter registration page. While these devices are designed to bring internet access and city services to users\u2019 fingertips, their ability to promote electoral participation is an open question; their usage for this purpose \u2013 and whether messages encouraging participation actually work \u2013 has not been studied. An important question is whether increasing access to, and the visibility of, voter registration resources improves electoral participation. The present study is a randomized implementation of registration encouragement using LinkNYC large screens to display either (1) a localized neighborhood-identity based participation appeal; (2) an urgency appeal; or (3) no appeal (a control group). Randomization occurs at the Census tract level (n = 828). Outcomes measured include individual counts of voter registration site usage, with date-times, duration of use, and location of specific kiosks where each use occurred, as well as voter registration and turnout data. From 9/21/18 through 10/12/18 (registration deadline), all kiosks in a given census tract will display their assigned message, or lack of a message, at regular intervals, alongside other usual (non-experimental) content. At the end of that period, the implementing organization (CityBridge LLC, which operates the kiosks) will provide timestamped counts of registrations on each kiosk during the study period. Although we will not have information about individual registrants, we use the NYC voter file to obtain characteristics of people who registered during the study period under each of the three conditions based on the census tract in which they live and the kiosks nearest their home address."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Outcomes are measured from two main sources: (1) counts of individuals who use LinkNYC kiosks to register at the kiosk level, provided by CityBridge, which can be aggregated up to the tract level, and (2) voter information from the NYC voter file. The former includes date and time information, while the latter includes dates, allowing us to determine which registrations occurred during the message campaign and to study heterogeneous effects by proximity to the registration deadline. Moreover, we will obtain an updated NYC voter file after Election Day to determine whether those who registered after exposure to the interventions actually turned out to vote. Though we will be unable to identity which individuals registered on a LinkNYC kiosk, since treatment is randomized at the tract level we can treat all registrants in a tract as having been treated to some degree (i.e., it is plausible that individuals saw the ads and subsequently registered via another medium). The following hypotheses will be tested with data from both sources unless otherwise specified. H1: Encouragement effect: Registration will be higher in tracts where the messages are shown compared to those in which they were not shown. H2: Neighborhood-specific vs. countdown message: We will test the efficacy of two different messages. The first appeals to neighborhood identity (e.g., \u201cGreenpoint added XXX new voters in 2017. Tap \u2018register now\u2019 on the tablet to join in\u201d ) and the second shows a dynamic countdown to the registration deadline (\u201c06 days 04 hours 22 seconds until the voter registration deadline for the November general elections. Tap \u2018register now\u2019 on the tablet to join in\u201d). H3: Heterogeneous effects: Subject to sample size constraints, we plan to explore the possibility of heterogeneous treatment effects by attributes of individuals\u2019 context, as well as by individual characteristics. Are the effect of the messages moderated by local racial or socioeconomic context, or by individual characteristics? Since the literature is largely silent on these effects with respect to voter registration, this exercise is largely exploratory. See pre-analysis plan for details. H4: Subsequent voting: How likely to vote are people who registered during the messaging campaign in treated tracts vs. those who registered in control tracts? Are people who were exposed to the neighborhood identity message vs. the countdown message more or less likely to vote?"}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "The main outcome variable is the tract level registration rate, calculated as the number of new registrants divided by the number of people eligible to register. The numerator comes from either the number of people who register at LinkNYC kiosks, or from the number of people who register via any method, during the study period. Subject to data availability we also calculate a registration rate out of the typical number of sessions on each kiosk per day. H1: Encouragement effect: We conduct t-tests of the difference in means of the tract-level registration rate in treatment tracts (pooled) vs. control tracts. We also run OLS regressions controlling for pre-treatment registration rates, which we were unable to block on, as well as poverty status, educational attainment, age distribution, residential mobility, homeownership, and employment, in order to increase precision. In order to account for upward trending registration rates as the election approaches, we will calculate the difference-in-differences from the NYC voter file: (registration rate in treatment tracts at t0 - registration rate in control tracts at t0) - (registration rate in treatment tracts at t1 - registration rate in control tracts at t1), where t0 includes the 22 days prior to 9/21 and t1 includes 9/21 \u2013 10/12 (same number of days in t0 and t1).

Each kiosk features 55\u2019\u2019 high definition displays that show content including advertising and transit information, as well as tablets for accessing city services and maps, free USB charging stations, and phones for making domestic calls. On September 21st, 2018, LinkNYC launched a voter registration drive to encourage voter registration on kiosk tablets, which connect users to an electronic voter registration page. While these devices are designed to bring internet access and city services to users\u2019 fingertips, their ability to promote electoral participation is an open question; their usage for this purpose \u2013 and whether messages encouraging participation actually work \u2013 has not been studied. An important question is whether increasing access to, and the visibility of, voter registration resources improves electoral participation. The present study is a randomized implementation of registration encouragement using LinkNYC large screens to display either (1) a localized neighborhood-identity based participation appeal; (2) an urgency appeal; or (3) no appeal (a control group). Randomization occurs at the Census tract level (n = 828). Outcomes measured include individual counts of voter registration site usage, with date-times, duration of use, and location of specific kiosks where each use occurred, as well as voter registration and turnout data. From 9/21/18 through 10/12/18 (registration deadline), all kiosks in a given census tract will display their assigned message, or lack of a message, at regular intervals, alongside other usual (non-experimental) content. At the end of that period, the implementing organization (CityBridge LLC, which operates the kiosks) will provide timestamped counts of registrations on each kiosk during the study period. Although we will not have information about individual registrants, we use the NYC voter file to obtain characteristics of people who registered during the study period under each of the three conditions based on the census tract in which they live and the kiosks nearest their home address.", "q16": "Outcomes are measured from two main sources: (1) counts of individuals who use LinkNYC kiosks to register at the kiosk level, provided by CityBridge, which can be aggregated up to the tract level, and (2) voter information from the NYC voter file. The former includes date and time information, while the latter includes dates, allowing us to determine which registrations occurred during the message campaign and to study heterogeneous effects by proximity to the registration deadline. Moreover, we will obtain an updated NYC voter file after Election Day to determine whether those who registered after exposure to the interventions actually turned out to vote. Though we will be unable to identity which individuals registered on a LinkNYC kiosk, since treatment is randomized at the tract level we can treat all registrants in a tract as having been treated to some degree (i.e., it is plausible that individuals saw the ads and subsequently registered via another medium). The following hypotheses will be tested with data from both sources unless otherwise specified. H1: Encouragement effect: Registration will be higher in tracts where the messages are shown compared to those in which they were not shown. H2: Neighborhood-specific vs. countdown message: We will test the efficacy of two different messages. The first appeals to neighborhood identity (e.g., \u201cGreenpoint added XXX new voters in 2017. Tap \u2018register now\u2019 on the tablet to join in\u201d ) and the second shows a dynamic countdown to the registration deadline (\u201c06 days 04 hours 22 seconds until the voter registration deadline for the November general elections. Tap \u2018register now\u2019 on the tablet to join in\u201d). H3: Heterogeneous effects: Subject to sample size constraints, we plan to explore the possibility of heterogeneous treatment effects by attributes of individuals\u2019 context, as well as by individual characteristics. Are the effect of the messages moderated by local racial or socioeconomic context, or by individual characteristics? Since the literature is largely silent on these effects with respect to voter registration, this exercise is largely exploratory. See pre-analysis plan for details. H4: Subsequent voting: How likely to vote are people who registered during the messaging campaign in treated tracts vs. those who registered in control tracts? Are people who were exposed to the neighborhood identity message vs. the countdown message more or less likely to vote?", "q17": "The main outcome variable is the tract level registration rate, calculated as the number of new registrants divided by the number of people eligible to register. The numerator comes from either the number of people who register at LinkNYC kiosks, or from the number of people who register via any method, during the study period. Subject to data availability we also calculate a registration rate out of the typical number of sessions on each kiosk per day. H1: Encouragement effect: We conduct t-tests of the difference in means of the tract-level registration rate in treatment tracts (pooled) vs. control tracts. We also run OLS regressions controlling for pre-treatment registration rates, which we were unable to block on, as well as poverty status, educational attainment, age distribution, residential mobility, homeownership, and employment, in order to increase precision. In order to account for upward trending registration rates as the election approaches, we will calculate the difference-in-differences from the NYC voter file: (registration rate in treatment tracts at t0 - registration rate in control tracts at t0) - (registration rate in treatment tracts at t1 - registration rate in control tracts at t1), where t0 includes the 22 days prior to 9/21 and t1 includes 9/21 \u2013 10/12 (same number of days in t0 and t1). H2: Neighborhood-specific vs. countdown message: We will regress tract level registration rates on indicators for which type of message was received as well as the controls described above. H3: Heterogeneous effects: See pre-analysis plan for details. H4: Subsequent voting: We regress an indicator for whether the individual voted on tract-level treatment indicators and controls for individual characteristics (race, age, gender) and contextual variables, clustering standard errors at the tract level.", "q18": "United States", "q19": "The experiment will involve 838 Census tracts", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "", "q23": "", "q24": "Not

Citizens in corrupt countries loathe corruption and acknowledge its pervasiveness but return corrupt politicians into office, continue to pay bribes and generally refrain from reporting corruption (C\u00e1belkov\u00e1 and Hanousek 2004; Manzetti and Wilson 2008; Zechmeister and Zizumbo-Colunga 2013; Chong et al. 2015; Pereira and Mello 2015; Fernandez-Vazquez et al. 2016; Corbacho et al. 2016). A compelling explanation for why corruption is so persistent is given by scholars that frame it as a collective action problem (Persson et al 2013; Rothstein 2011; Johnston 2014; Mungiu-Pippidi 2006). Although widespread corruption may demobilize citizens (Kostadinova 2009; Chong et al 2014; Bauhr and Grimes 2014) and depress trust in institutions (Anderson and Tverdova 2003; Bowler and Karp 2004; Warren 2004; Seligson 2006; Hakhverdian and Mayne 2015, Seligson 2002, Mishler and Rose 2001), there is evidence that perceptions of government effectiveness can lead to anti-corruption activism (Peiffer and Alvarez 2016), even in high-corruption equilibrium countries. Before this background, this paper proposes a mechanism starts from the way courts perform in analyzing a corruption case. Courts display positive or negative signals through their performance but how citizens perceive this also depends on the specific corruption case. In terms of performance, efficiency, impartiality, and effectiveness are regarded as positive outcomes. The better the courts perform, the more it will be expected to foster engagement against corruption. Regarding the characteristics of the case, the status of the public official (high or low ranking) implicated in the corruption case moderates the magnitude of the signals of court performance. Ultimately, effective corruption sanctioning influences attitudes towards corruption through the channels of trust in courts and citizens\u2019 efficacy, by addressing expectations about impunity."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "The main outcome variables are \u201cacceptability to pay bribes\u201d, \u201csupport anti-corruption policies\u201d, and \u201cengagement against corruption\u201d. There are four main hypotheses, subdivided into sub- hypotheses: H1: Court effectiveness in analyzing corruption cases fosters citizens\u2019 engagement against corruption. H2: The characteristics of the corruption case, conveyed by the defendants\u2019 ranking, shape the magnitude and the type of engagement against corruption, but less so than courts\u2019 performance H3: Court effectiveness operates through the channels of trust in courts and citizens\u2019 efficacy by decreasing expectations about impunity; H4: Trust, sense of efficacy, the salience of corruption, proneness to strategically use corruption and personality traits mediate the extent to which the mechanism works."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "We use a conjoint experiment where respondents are read a vignette describing a fictional court investigation. There are three components in the vignette that vary: the defendant\u2019s ranking, court efficiency and court impartiality.

Citizens in corrupt countries loathe corruption and acknowledge its pervasiveness but return corrupt politicians into office, continue to pay bribes and generally refrain from reporting corruption (C\u00e1belkov\u00e1 and Hanousek 2004; Manzetti and Wilson 2008; Zechmeister and Zizumbo-Colunga 2013; Chong et al. 2015; Pereira and Mello 2015; Fernandez-Vazquez et al. 2016; Corbacho et al. 2016). A compelling explanation for why corruption is so persistent is given by scholars that frame it as a collective action problem (Persson et al 2013; Rothstein 2011; Johnston 2014; Mungiu-Pippidi 2006). Although widespread corruption may demobilize citizens (Kostadinova 2009; Chong et al 2014; Bauhr and Grimes 2014) and depress trust in institutions (Anderson and Tverdova 2003; Bowler and Karp 2004; Warren 2004; Seligson 2006; Hakhverdian and Mayne 2015, Seligson 2002, Mishler and Rose 2001), there is evidence that perceptions of government effectiveness can lead to anti-corruption activism (Peiffer and Alvarez 2016), even in high-corruption equilibrium countries. Before this background, this paper proposes a mechanism starts from the way courts perform in analyzing a corruption case. Courts display positive or negative signals through their performance but how citizens perceive this also depends on the specific corruption case. In terms of performance, efficiency, impartiality, and effectiveness are regarded as positive outcomes. The better the courts perform, the more it will be expected to foster engagement against corruption. Regarding the characteristics of the case, the status of the public official (high or low ranking) implicated in the corruption case moderates the magnitude of the signals of court performance. Ultimately, effective corruption sanctioning influences attitudes towards corruption through the channels of trust in courts and citizens\u2019 efficacy, by addressing expectations about impunity.", "q16": "The main outcome variables are \u201cacceptability to pay bribes\u201d, \u201csupport anti-corruption policies\u201d, and \u201cengagement against corruption\u201d. There are four main hypotheses, subdivided into sub- hypotheses: H1: Court effectiveness in analyzing corruption cases fosters citizens\u2019 engagement against corruption. H2: The characteristics of the corruption case, conveyed by the defendants\u2019 ranking, shape the magnitude and the type of engagement against corruption, but less so than courts\u2019 performance H3: Court effectiveness operates through the channels of trust in courts and citizens\u2019 efficacy by decreasing expectations about impunity; H4: Trust, sense of efficacy, the salience of corruption, proneness to strategically use corruption and personality traits mediate the extent to which the mechanism works.", "q17": "We use a conjoint experiment where respondents are read a vignette describing a fictional court investigation.

However, very few studies have examined the impact of multiple forms of support found in the educational context on the character, emotional development, and performance of adolescence. Increasingly, educators have attempted to determine the role character development plays in the performance outcomes of adolescents, given that both production and character have been linked to long-term positive results (Lerner &amp; Castellino, 2002). The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of the climate of support provided by (parents, teachers, peers) found in educational settings on the character, emotional development, and academic performance of adolescents. Negative outcomes such as stress, depression, dropout rates, and risky behaviors have been associated with disengagement and dissatisfaction from school (Guti\u00e9rrez, Tom\u00e1s, Romero, &amp; Barrica, 2017). While social support from family, teachers, and peers has been associated with greater school engagement and more positive outcomes in adolescents such as better academic performance, life satisfaction and subjective well-being (Lewis, Huebner, Malone, &amp; Valois, 2011; Gilman &amp; Heubner, 2006; Suldo, Shaffer, &amp; Riley, 2008). Results from these studies indicate that further exploration is necessary to determine what aspects of the educational support environment impacts specific elements of character and emotional development and whether there is a difference in performance and character outcomes based on the amount/type of social support received by an adolescent. Teachers and administrators are committed to the success of their students but often lack detailed information into how they can best serve the whole student.

However, very few studies have examined the impact of multiple forms of support found in the educational context on the character, emotional development, and performance of adolescence. Increasingly, educators have attempted to determine the role character development plays in the performance outcomes of adolescents, given that both production and character have been linked to long-term positive results (Lerner &amp; Castellino, 2002). The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of the climate of support provided by (parents, teachers, peers) found in educational settings on the character, emotional development, and academic performance of adolescents. Negative outcomes such as stress, depression, dropout rates, and risky behaviors have been associated with disengagement and dissatisfaction from school (Guti\u00e9rrez, Tom\u00e1s, Romero, &amp; Barrica, 2017). While social support from family, teachers, and peers has been associated with greater school engagement and more positive outcomes in adolescents such as better academic performance, life satisfaction and subjective well-being (Lewis, Huebner, Malone, &amp; Valois, 2011; Gilman &amp; Heubner, 2006; Suldo, Shaffer, &amp; Riley, 2008). Results from these studies indicate that further exploration is necessary to determine what aspects of the educational support environment impacts specific elements of character and emotional development and whether there is a difference in performance and character outcomes based on the amount/type of social support received by an adolescent. Teachers and administrators are committed to the success of their students but often lack detailed information into how they can best serve the whole student.
