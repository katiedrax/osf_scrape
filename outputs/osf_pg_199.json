We ask how participants think about the fairness of iterated votes between two social groups. Specifically, we test whether people\u2019s perceptions of voting depend more on a majority group winning or on a minority group losing. \n\nIn our previous studies, participants saw several stories about five characters making a decision together about whether to eat popcorn or chips for snack time. Participants were told that these characters would make a decision by voting. We asked participants how fair it was to vote across three repeated trials. We found that voting was evaluated as increasingly less fair across iteration, but only when preferences were stable and unchanging (and especially if preferences were linked to group membership)\u2014that is, when a majority group consistently got their way over a minority group. Interestingly, this was also true before participants viewed the outcome of any votes: participants evaluated voting as less fair in situations where characters belonged to clear social groups than in situations where characters were not grouped. This finding suggests that adults may infer fixed preferences from the presence of social group membership and use this inference to predict that voting will lead to an unfair outcome. These results highlight how the presence of groups informs adults\u2019 evaluations of voting. However these past studies confound a majority group repeatedly winning with a minority group repeatedly losing. It is unclear whether participants\u2019 evaluations result more from a majority group winning, from a minority group losing, or from both. \n\nIn this next study, we will examine the salience of winners and losers in participants\u2019 evaluations of voting as a process. We will show participants one of two conditions: a Group Minority condition and a Group Majority condition. Across the conditions, all characters will be identified with a different color, but some characters will be the only character of their color (e.g., one Pink, one Orange, etc.) and others will be grouped by color (e.g., two Blues). In each condition, participants will see a classroom with five children who are making a collective decision about what to eat for snack time. In each case, a majority of children will always vote for popcorn. Thus, the same three children will win three times in a row. In the Group Majority condition, these winning children will all be part of the same social group (e.g., all Blue), and the losing children will not be grouped (e.g., one Pink, one Orange). In the Group Minority condition, the losing children will be grouped (e.g., all Blue), and the winning children will not be grouped (e.g., one Pink, one Orange, one Green). In other words, we will vary between conditions whether the majority or minority are groups or sets of individuals. This design will allow us to test whether participants are particularly sensitive towards the same group winning or losing across iterations, or whether both outcomes are equally disliked. \n\nHere, we have three competing hypotheses: \n\nH1: People\u2019s tendency to view voting as less fair over iterated trials is driven by people disliking a majority group repeatedly getting its way. Thus, voting will be viewed as less fair in the Majority Group condition compared to in the Minority Group condition. We could see this at two different time points: one possibility is that the presence of a majority group makes voting seem less fair at Timepoint 1 (before any decision is made using the procedure) than when participants see a minority group present. Another possibility (that is not mutually exclusive), is that the difference between the two cases is only apparent after some iterations (at Timepoint 3). If the mere presence of a majority group makes participants more sensitive to the fact that voting is likely to yield the same outcome across iterations of voting (because participants expect the majority itself may vote by group lines), then we would expect to see a difference at T1 across conditions. If instead we expect that both the majority and minority are required to be in groups to make an inference about preferences by group lines, then this difference may only appear after iterated trials. Thus we would not expect to see a difference at T1 across conditions, but would expect to see this difference at T3.\n\nH2: People\u2019s tendency to view voting as less fair over iterated trials is driven by people disliking a minority group repeatedly NOT getting their way. It could be that participants are particularly focused on the oppression of the losing group in regard to voting, and dislike when some characters never get their way as a result of a winner-takes-all voting system. If this is the case, then we would expect participants to evaluate voting as less fair in the Minority Group condition compared to the Majority Group condition. As above, if this difference results from the mere presence of a minority group, we would expect to see this difference at T1. In contrast, if this difference depends on seeing that these preferences are fixed, this difference may only emerge at T3. \n\nH3: Finally, a third possibility is that people are equally sensitive to a majority group repeatedly winning and to a minority group repeatedly losing. In this case, we would expect voting to be evaluated as increasingly less fair across iterations in both conditions.   \n"}, "study_type": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment"}, "study_type_other": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"data": "No, no data have been collected for this study yet.", "name": "Iteration and voting -- Majority &amp; Minority groups", "other": "These are additional measures we are collecting for exploration and do not have strong hypotheses on: \nWhat decision rule should the group should use if they are to decide again?

This design will allow us to test whether participants are particularly sensitive towards the same group winning or losing across iterations, or whether both outcomes are equally disliked. \n\nHere, we have three competing hypotheses: \n\nH1: People\u2019s tendency to view voting as less fair over iterated trials is driven by people disliking a majority group repeatedly getting its way. Thus, voting will be viewed as less fair in the Majority Group condition compared to in the Minority Group condition. We could see this at two different time points: one possibility is that the presence of a majority group makes voting seem less fair at Timepoint 1 (before any decision is made using the procedure) than when participants see a minority group present. Another possibility (that is not mutually exclusive), is that the difference between the two cases is only apparent after some iterations (at Timepoint 3). If the mere presence of a majority group makes participants more sensitive to the fact that voting is likely to yield the same outcome across iterations of voting (because participants expect the majority itself may vote by group lines), then we would expect to see a difference at T1 across conditions. If instead we expect that both the majority and minority are required to be in groups to make an inference about preferences by group lines, then this difference may only appear after iterated trials. Thus we would not expect to see a difference at T1 across conditions, but would expect to see this difference at T3.\n\nH2: People\u2019s tendency to view voting as less fair over iterated trials is driven by people disliking a minority group repeatedly NOT getting their way. It could be that participants are particularly focused on the oppression of the losing group in regard to voting, and dislike when some characters never get their way as a result of a winner-takes-all voting system. If this is the case, then we would expect participants to evaluate voting as less fair in the Minority Group condition compared to the Majority Group condition. As above, if this difference results from the mere presence of a minority group, we would expect to see this difference at T1. In contrast, if this difference depends on seeing that these preferences are fixed, this difference may only emerge at T3. \n\nH3: Finally, a third possibility is that people are equally sensitive to a majority group repeatedly winning and to a minority group repeatedly losing. In this case, we would expect voting to be evaluated as increasingly less fair across iterations in both conditions.   \n", "study_type": "Experiment"}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children":

M\u00fcsseler, &amp; Hommel, 2012). Closely linked is the question whether assigning a certain valence to an action effect results in increased relevance and therefore altered binding effects. One first indicator for such an influence of action effect valence on binding is a study showing that rewarding actions can strengthen action-effect bindings (Eder, Erle, &amp; Kunde, 2019). Here, participants learned in an acquisition phase that certain actions (i.e., button presses) result in auditory effects while some but not all actions are financially rewarded. In a test phase, they found prime compatibility effects in RTs to be larger for previously rewarded keypresses in comparison to previously unrewarded or punished keypresses\nThe present research attempts to shed further light on this by altering typically observed binding effects, that is, partial overlap costs when body-related and body-external action effect features partly overlap vs. fully repeat/alternate. Such binding effects manifest in 2 x 2 interactions between body-related and body-external effect feature overlap in RTs and error rates for action B in an ABBA paradigm (Stoet &amp; Hommel, 1999). Depending on the affective value (positive, negative or neutral), that is, the result of assigning valence to the superficially identical body-external action effects, this interaction should turn out more or less pronounced. \n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Individual analysis of valence conditions:\nFunctional equivalence benefit: lower RTs and error rates when distal action effect (towards vs. away movement) repeats vs. alternates.\nBinding effect (Partial overlap cost): lower RTs and error rates when both body-related and body-external effect features alternate / repeat vs. partial feature repetition \nComparison of valence conditions:\nThe binding effect (partial overlap \u2013 full alternation/repetition) differs between the valence conditions\nThe functional equivalence benefit (body-external effect repeats vs. changes) differs between the valence conditions\nPossible Outcomes (in orthogonal contrast codes, linear and quadratic):\n\nAs in Eder et al.

Closely linked is the question whether assigning a certain valence to an action effect results in increased relevance and therefore altered binding effects. One first indicator for such an influence of action effect valence on binding is a study showing that rewarding actions can strengthen action-effect bindings (Eder, Erle, &amp; Kunde, 2019). Here, participants learned in an acquisition phase that certain actions (i.e., button presses) result in auditory effects while some but not all actions are financially rewarded. In a test phase, they found prime compatibility effects in RTs to be larger for previously rewarded keypresses in comparison to previously unrewarded or punished keypresses\nThe present research attempts to shed further light on this by altering typically observed binding effects, that is, partial overlap costs when body-related and body-external action effect features partly overlap vs. fully repeat/alternate. Such binding effects manifest in 2 x 2 interactions between body-related and body-external effect feature overlap in RTs and error rates for action B in an ABBA paradigm (Stoet &amp; Hommel, 1999). Depending on the affective value (positive, negative or neutral), that is, the result of assigning valence to the superficially identical body-external action effects, this interaction should turn out more or less pronounced. \n", "q4": "Individual analysis of valence conditions:\nFunctional equivalence benefit: lower RTs and error rates when distal action effect (towards vs. away movement) repeats vs. alternates.\nBinding effect (Partial overlap cost): lower RTs and error rates when both body-related and body-external effect features alternate / repeat vs. partial feature repetition \nComparison of valence conditions:\nThe binding effect (partial overlap \u2013 full alternation/repetition) differs between the valence conditions\nThe functional equivalence benefit (body-external effect repeats vs. changes) differs between the valence conditions\nPossible Outcomes (in orthogonal contrast codes, linear and quadratic):\n\nAs in Eder et al.

local and idiosyncratic features to perceptually segment auditory information that does not contain any outstanding acoustic landmarks, such as periodic white noise. The aim of the proposed study is to show that individuals differ in how they perceptually segment periodic noise while each listener is consistent with oneself. This finding would support the claim that memory representations are established for features which are idiosyncratic in nature."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "If listeners rely on idiosyncratic features for perceptual segmentation, this should result in a high temporal consistency across presentations of the same periodic noise sequence within one individual, assuming that one person would always perceive the same time point within the cycle (at which the chosen feature occurs) as cycle onset. Conversely, the subjective repetition onset might be shifted in time between listeners because each of them relies on a different subtle feature as a cue for segmentation of the sequence, leading to a low temporal consistency between subjects. \nConsequently, periodicity-related event-related potentials (ERPs) to fully periodic noise sequences (in which essentially any time point could be perceived as cycle onset; see Question 16 for a more detailed description of the stimulus conditions) are expected to be levelled out on the group level while cyclic ERPs time-locked to the perceived cycle onset (a negativity peaking between 150 and 350 ms after cycle onset, sometimes preceded by an early positive component) should be observable on the single-subject level. Similarly, periodicity-related ERPs are assumed to be time-shifted between fully periodic sequences formed of different specific noise patterns also within one individual. \nIn contrast, if the subtle structure of a noise sequence is semi-periodic and only allows time points within a narrower time window to be perceived as cycle onset, periodicity-related ERPs time-locked to cycle onset should also be present at the group level as the possible time-shift between subjects is considerably reduced, thus the temporal between-subject consistency is enhanced. \nHigh temporal consistency of perceptual segmentation within one subject as well as low temporal consistency between subjects should also be reflected in the phase coherence of brain responses evoked by the periodicity in the stimuli. Concretely, we hypothesize that inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) of oscillatory activity at the frequency of the stimulation will be comparably high within each subject for both fully periodic and semi-periodic sequences. In contrast, the two types of periodicity are expected to differ with regard to phase coherence between listeners: inter-subject phase coherence (ISPC) is assumed to be considerably weaker in response to fully periodic compared to semi-periodic sequences."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

The filtered continuous data will be cut into epochs starting 100 ms before and ending 6000 ms after sequence onset (i.e. approximately 500 ms after sequence offset). Following this, an independent component analysis (ICA) will be used to clean the data from physiological and technical artefacts. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio for decomposition, ICA will be computed on a copy of the data that has been filtered with a 1 Hz high-pass (Kaiser-windowed sinc FIR filter, transition bandwidth: 0.5 Hz, maximum passband deviation: 0.001) and a 35 Hz low-pass filter (Kaiser-windowed sinc FIR filter, transition bandwidth 5 Hz, maximum passband deviation: 0.001) and epoched as described above. Epochs whose maximal peak-to-peak difference exceeds 750 \u00b5V will be excluded from the ICA decomposition and the data will be down-sampled to 128 Hz before extracting independent components to shorten computation time. ICA weights will then be transferred to the EEG data pre-processed with the final parameters and independent components will be classified using the EEGLAB ICLabel plug-in (Pion-Tonachini, Kreutz-Delgado, &amp; Makeig, 2019). Artefactual components such as those classified as eye blinks, muscle activity or channel noise will be removed. \nFor the analysis of ERPs, shorter epochs will be extracted ranging from -100 ms to 500 ms relative to the onset of a repeated segment (or corresponding time points in random noise sequences). The first and the last full cycle within each epoch will be excluded to minimize the influence of sequence onset and offset effects, resulting in 240 epochs per condition for each subject and each of the four different noise patterns. Epochs still exceeding a 150 \u00b5V peak-to-peak difference will be discarded from further analysis and, finally, the remaining epochs will be averaged separately for each of the four noise patterns as well as across them and re-referenced to the algebraic mean of the two mastoid electrode sites (M1, M2). \nFor analysis in the frequency domain, sequence-epochs will be cut ranging from periodicity onset to periodicity offset, thus covering the ten full periodic cycles (or a corresponding time window for random sequences). In two parallel analyses, ITPC within each subject and ISPC across subjects will be estimated for each channel within each periodicity condition and each noise pattern. For both analyses, a convolution with Morlet wavelets will be applied, either subject-wise across trials belonging to the same condition and noise pattern (ITPC) or trial-wise across subjects (ISPC). Parameters of the Morlet wavelet will be adjusted linearly from five to ten wavelet cycles over a range from 0.4 to 10 Hz. Noise pattern-specific ITPC and ISPC maps within each periodicity condition will subsequently be averaged to improve signal-to-noise ratio. For statistical evaluation between conditions, both ITPC and ISPC will be averaged across a 0.4 Hz wide frequency window centered around the frequency of the periodicity in the stimulation, i.e. 2 Hz, in a time window ranging from the onset of the first repetition to the end of the sequence, i.e. the second to the tenth cycle.\nAdditionally, a fast Fourier transform (FFT) will be performed on the sequence-wise epochs within each subject and averaged across the four noise patterns within each periodicity condition to extract power in a frequency bin centered around 2 Hz (+/- 0.2 Hz) for each periodicity condition and each noise pattern.

Thus, if the signal-to-noise ratio in our data turns out to be poor, analysis of phase coherence might not provide conclusive results with regard to the temporal consistency of cyclic periodicity-related brain responses within and between subjects. Therefore, we propose an alternative approach to analyze time-shifts of periodicity-related ERPs within a cycle occurring on the within- and between-subject level. This procedure will be followed if the ITPC coefficients (at 2 Hz; averaged across all four noise patterns) in the semi-periodic condition fail to reach statistical significance from those in the random condition (as assessed with a paired t-test on the group-level). \nSingle-subject average ERPs for each noise pattern in fully and semi-periodic conditions will be denoised applying a wavelet denoising method (Quian Quiroga &amp; Garcia, 2003). ERP peak latencies of minima within a cycle will then be extracted relative to cycle onset from the denoised ERPs. Subsequently, variance of the latencies across subjects will be compared between the two different types of periodicity (separately for each pattern as well as averaged across them), assuming that larger variance in latencies reflects a larger phase-shift of periodicity-related ERPs. It is expected that variance between subjects will be considerably higher in the fully periodic compared to semi-periodic condition.

The aim of the proposed study is to show that individuals differ in how they perceptually segment periodic noise while each listener is consistent with oneself. This finding would support the claim that memory representations are established for features which are idiosyncratic in nature.", "q4": "If listeners rely on idiosyncratic features for perceptual segmentation, this should result in a high temporal consistency across presentations of the same periodic noise sequence within one individual, assuming that one person would always perceive the same time point within the cycle (at which the chosen feature occurs) as cycle onset. Conversely, the subjective repetition onset might be shifted in time between listeners because each of them relies on a different subtle feature as a cue for segmentation of the sequence, leading to a low temporal consistency between subjects. \nConsequently, periodicity-related event-related potentials (ERPs) to fully periodic noise sequences (in which essentially any time point could be perceived as cycle onset; see Question 16 for a more detailed description of the stimulus conditions) are expected to be levelled out on the group level while cyclic ERPs time-locked to the perceived cycle onset (a negativity peaking between 150 and 350 ms after cycle onset, sometimes preceded by an early positive component) should be observable on the single-subject level. Similarly, periodicity-related ERPs are assumed to be time-shifted between fully periodic sequences formed of different specific noise patterns also within one individual. \nIn contrast, if the subtle structure of a noise sequence is semi-periodic and only allows time points within a narrower time window to be perceived as cycle onset, periodicity-related ERPs time-locked to cycle onset should also be present at the group level as the possible time-shift between subjects is considerably reduced, thus the temporal between-subject consistency is enhanced. \nHigh temporal consistency of perceptual segmentation within one subject as well as low temporal consistency between subjects should also be reflected in the phase coherence of brain responses evoked by the periodicity in the stimuli. Concretely, we hypothesize that inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) of oscillatory activity at the frequency of the stimulation will be comparably high within each subject for both fully periodic and semi-periodic sequences. In contrast, the two types of periodicity are expected to differ with regard to phase coherence between listeners: inter-subject phase coherence (ISPC) is assumed to be considerably weaker in response to fully periodic compared to semi-periodic sequences.", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Pilot participants were tested in order to make sure that the procedure that was planned based on theoretical assumptions is actually feasible (e.g. with regard to the duration of an experimental session for the participants and the signal-to-noise ratio in the data).

The expected effect size was estimated from simulations based on the amplitudes of periodicity-related cyclic ERPs reported previously (Andrillon et al., 2015; Berti et al., 2000) assuming a certain noise level based on a dataset acquired earlier with the same EEG system and settings. ", "q15": "Data collection will be stopped when the planned sample size (specified in Question 13) is reached.", "q20": "Firstly, the EEG data will be offline low- and high-pass filtered with Kaiser-windowed sinc FIR filters at 35 Hz (transition bandwidth: 5 Hz, maximum passband deviation: 0.001) and 0.2 Hz (transition bandwidth: 0.4 Hz, maximum passband deviation: 0.001), respectively. If the signal variance of a channel exceeds a z-score of 3.0, this channel will be excluded and spherically spline interpolated after removing artefacts. The filtered continuous data will be cut into epochs starting 100 ms before and ending 6000 ms after sequence onset (i.e. approximately 500 ms after sequence offset). Following this, an independent component analysis (ICA) will be used to clean the data from physiological and technical artefacts. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio for decomposition, ICA will be computed on a copy of the data that has been filtered with a 1 Hz high-pass (Kaiser-windowed sinc FIR filter, transition bandwidth: 0.5 Hz, maximum passband deviation: 0.001) and a 35 Hz low-pass filter (Kaiser-windowed sinc FIR filter, transition bandwidth 5 Hz, maximum passband deviation: 0.001) and epoched as described above. Epochs whose maximal peak-to-peak difference exceeds 750 \u00b5V will be excluded from the ICA decomposition and the data will be down-sampled to 128 Hz before extracting independent components to shorten computation time. ICA weights will then be transferred to the EEG data pre-processed with the final parameters and independent components will be classified using the EEGLAB ICLabel plug-in (Pion-Tonachini, Kreutz-Delgado, &amp; Makeig, 2019). Artefactual components such as those classified as eye blinks, muscle activity or channel noise will be removed. \nFor the analysis of ERPs, shorter epochs will be extracted ranging from -100 ms to 500 ms relative to the onset of a repeated segment (or corresponding time points in random noise sequences). The first and the last full cycle within each epoch will be excluded to minimize the influence of sequence onset and offset effects, resulting in 240 epochs per condition for each subject and each of the four different noise patterns. Epochs still exceeding a 150 \u00b5V peak-to-peak difference will be discarded from further analysis and, finally, the remaining epochs will be averaged separately for each of the four noise patterns as well as across them and re-referenced to the algebraic mean of the two mastoid electrode sites (M1, M2). \nFor analysis in the frequency domain, sequence-epochs will be cut ranging from periodicity onset to periodicity offset, thus covering the ten full periodic cycles (or a corresponding time window for random sequences). In two parallel analyses, ITPC within each subject and ISPC across subjects will be estimated for each channel within each periodicity condition and each noise pattern. For both analyses, a convolution with Morlet wavelets will be applied, either subject-wise across trials belonging to the same condition and noise pattern (ITPC) or trial-wise across subjects (ISPC). Parameters of the Morlet wavelet will be adjusted linearly from five to ten wavelet cycles over a range from 0.4 to 10 Hz. Noise pattern-specific ITPC and ISPC maps within each periodicity condition will subsequently be averaged to improve signal-to-noise ratio. For statistical evaluation between conditions, both ITPC and ISPC will be averaged across a 0.4 Hz wide frequency window centered around the frequency of the periodicity in the stimulation, i.e. 2 Hz, in a time window ranging from the onset of the first repetition to the end of the sequence, i.e. the second to the tenth cycle.\nAdditionally, a fast Fourier transform (FFT) will be performed on the sequence-wise epochs within each subject and averaged across the four noise patterns within each periodicity condition to extract power in a frequency bin centered around 2 Hz (+/- 0.2 Hz) for each periodicity condition and each noise pattern. Power will then be compared between conditions using pairwise t-tests to explore whether there are any power differences which might at least partly account for differences in phase coherence.", "q21": "We will use the standard p&lt;.05 criterion to determine if results are significantly different from those expected if the null hypothesis was correct. False discovery rate (FDR) correction (Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995) will be applied to account for multiple comparisons where appropriate. ", "q22": "Participants will be excluded from the analysis if only less than 120 artefact-free epochs (i.e. less than 50% of all epochs) remain in any condition after artefact rejection (following the procedures described in Question 20).", "q23": "If data of a participant are incomplete, this participant will be excluded from the analysis if the criterion specified in Question 22 applies. ", "q24": "", "q25": "The reliable estimation of the phase of oscillatory activity is crucially dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio in the data. Thus, if the signal-to-noise ratio in our data turns out to be poor, analysis of phase coherence might not provide conclusive results with regard to the temporal consistency of cyclic periodicity-related brain responses within and between subjects. Therefore, we propose an alternative approach to analyze time-shifts of periodicity-related ERPs within a cycle occurring on the within- and between-subject level. This procedure will be followed if the ITPC coefficients (at 2 Hz; averaged across all four noise patterns) in the semi-periodic condition fail to reach statistical significance from those in the random condition (as assessed with a paired t-test on the group-level). \nSingle-subject average ERPs for each noise pattern in fully and semi-periodic conditions will be denoised applying a wavelet denoising method (Quian Quiroga &amp; Garcia, 2003). ERP peak latencies of minima within a cycle will then be extracted relative to cycle onset from the denoised ERPs. Subsequently, variance of the latencies across subjects will be compared between the two different types of periodicity (separately for each pattern as well as averaged across them), assuming that larger variance in latencies reflects a larger phase-shift of periodicity-related ERPs. It is expected that variance between subjects will be considerably higher in the fully periodic compared to semi-periodic condition. Having extracted the individual ERP latency for each subject in each condition, this will allow us to calculate group-level average ERPs that are corrected for potential phase-shifts between subjects and compare (peak) amplitudes between fully periodic and semi-periodic condition (by means of a cluster-based permutation test).  \n\nAfter the EEG experiment and a short break, participants will complete another short behavioral experiment.
