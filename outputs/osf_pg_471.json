For instance, individuals with a diagnosis of anxiety are more likely to use putatively maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (i.e., strategies that ineffectively decrease negative affect or inadvertently increase negative affect), such as rumination, and are less likely to use adaptive strategies, such as reappraisal (Aldao, Nolen-Hoeksema, &amp; Schweizer, 2010). Rumination refers to a cyclical style of thought wherein individuals think about the causes and consequences of negative affect and clinical symptoms such as anxiety and depression (Nolen-Hoeksema, Wisco, &amp; Lyubomirski, 2008), and reappraisal refers to an emotion regulation strategy in which people change their appraisal of situation to modulate subsequent emotional responding\u2013for example, they may substitute a negative interpretation of an ambiguous event for a neutral or positive interpretation (Gross &amp; John, 2003). Of note, most studies on rumination and reappraisal in anxiety focus on intrapersonal use of the strategy, but emotions do not occur in isolation. Rather, they are often experienced within social contexts, and, among the general population, it is not uncommon for other people to help someone regulate their emotions during periods of negative affect. The involvement of another person in the regulation of affect is known as interpersonal emotion regulation. Despite the abundance of research on anxiety and intrapersonal emotion regulation, there is a paucity of research on interpersonal rumination and reappraisal as they relate to anxiety. The current study therefore seeks to examine the nature of interpersonal emotion regulation\u2013specifically rumination and reappraisal\u2013as it relates to individual differences in anxiety. The first two primary questions are as follows: 1) does anxiety relate to the extent to which other people assist with interpersonal rumination and reappraisal?; 2) is anxiety associated with the effectiveness of interpersonal emotion regulation, as indexed by participants\u2019 perception of regulatory effectiveness? In addition to the link between interpersonal emotion regulation and anxiety, this study aims to examine whether the relation between anxiety and the intrapersonal use of rumination and reappraisal varies between social and non-social contexts."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Given the dearth of research on interpersonal rumination and reappraisal as they relate to anxiety, most of the above-mentioned research questions are exploratory in nature. The existing literature does not point to strong a priori hypotheses with respect to the first research question. However, based on research showing that anxiety is related to interpersonal problems (e.g., hostile interactions, avoidance of social situations), it is plausible that greater levels of anxiety are associated with fewer occasions to regulate emotions within interpersonal relations and, thus, are linked to less frequent interpersonal rumination and reappraisal. In regard to the second research question, prior research has linked anxiety to relative reductions in the effectiveness of intrapersonal emotion regulation in general. Therefore, it is possible that interpersonal effectiveness, too, will be negatively associated with individual differences in anxiety. More specifically, individuals who report relatively greater levels of anxiety are hypothesized to report less perceived effectiveness of reappraisal and rumination compared to individuals who endorse relatively less anxiety. Finally, we do not have strong a priori hypotheses in regard to the third research question. That said, anxiety is often characterized by interpersonal distress. Given that anxiety is associated with more use of rumination and less use of reappraisal in general, it is reasonable to expect that associations between anxiety and intrapersonal strategy use will become stronger (i.e., even more rumination and less reappraisal) within social situations \u2013 a context often marked by increased stress for those with an anxiety disorder.

The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5 (Brown &amp; Barlow, 2014) was used to assess for current and past anxiety disorder diagnoses. Self-report measures of anxiety were also collected. These included the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, &amp; Jacobs, 1983), the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; Meyer, Miller, Metzger, &amp; Borkovec, 1990), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; Beck, Epstein, Brown, &amp; Steer, 1988), and the Screening for Child Anxiety and Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED; Birmaher, Brent, Chiappetta, Bridge, Monga, &amp; Baugher, 1999). Self-reported depressive symptoms (i.e., Beck Depression Inventory-II; Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996) and trauma (i.e., Trauma Symptom Checklist-40; Elliot &amp; Briere, 1992) were also collected. Finally, measures of trait emotion regulation strategy use, including the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ; Gross &amp; John, 2003) and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004), were collected prior to the EMA procedure.\nThe EMA surveys asked participants about their self-reported affect (i.e., sadness, fear, anger, happiness) and regulatory strategy use at each time point. Participants rated their affect using a sliding scale from 0 (not at all) to 100 (very much). Strategy use was assessed by having participants select all strategies that were used within the specified time frame (see data collection procedures). Emotion regulation strategies that were assessed within the current study included rumination, acceptance, suppression, distraction, and reappraisal. Engagement in each strategy was measured using a single item, and responses were binary (yes, no). Participants also rated the extent to which they perceived the strategy as effective using a sliding scale from 0 (not at all) to 100 (very much). In addition, information regarding the environmental context was collected. This included whether the person was alone or with others and, if the latter, whom the person was with (e.g., parent, friend, etc.). Engagement with another person via digital conversation (e.g., phone, text message, etc.) was also assessed. Finally, the extent to which another person was involved in using a given regulatory strategy was measured using a sliding scale from 0 (not at all) to 100 (very much). Whereas the first three surveys of each day were focused on the hour immediately preceding the survey, the fourth and final survey of each day asked participants to identify and focus on the period of the day during which they felt the worst. As part of the final EMA survey, participants rated their emotional states at the peak of their \u201cworst moment\u201d, indicated which emotion regulation strategies were used, rated the extent to which other people helped implement a given strategy, and rated emotion states again after emotion regulation. Similar to the first three surveys of each day, participants provided information on the context of their \u201cworst moment\u201d (i.e., if they were alone or around others, if they were engaged in a face-to-face or digital conversation, etc.).

To the extent that teaching evaluations assess academics in a biased way, based on their gender rather than specific behaviours, decisions that are key to academic careers may be unfair. For example, the under-representation of women in senior academic roles, especially in male-dominated disciplines, may be due to unfair decisions early in the careers of female academics (Dick &amp; Nadin, 2006; Moss-Racusin, Dovidio, Brescoll, Graham, &amp; Handelsman, 2012; Newsome, 2008; Sheltzer &amp; Smith, 2014; Way, Larremore, &amp; Clauset, 2016).\n\nThe research question of this study is to specifically assess if gender bias in teaching evaluations depends on the field of study: is there gender bias in male and female stereotypical disciplines?
