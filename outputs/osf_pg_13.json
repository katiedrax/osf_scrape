A systematic review and meta-analysis", "description": "Recent reviews have made an attempt to shed light on the psychosocial outcomes of sport participation for adults (Andersen, Ottesen, &amp; Thing, 2019; Eime et al., 2013; Gayman et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2019). Nevertheless, there is sufficient cause to conduct a meta-analysis examining the psychosocial outcomes of sport participation for middle-aged and older adults. Firstly, the reviews by Andersen et al. (2019) and Eime et al. (2013) have not focused strictly on the middle-aged and older adult population. This presents an issue as the meaning and function of sport participation for middle-aged and older adults is not comparable with that for younger adults (McPherson, 1984). Therefore, it is impossible to isolate the unique psychosocial effects of sport participation for middle-aged and older adults. Secondly, in spite of Kim et al. (2019) and Gayman et al. (2017) focusing solely on older adults, competitive and recreational sports were combined in the reviews. Similarly, both team and individual sports were examined together. This makes it impossible to decipher whether the nature and context of the sport influence these psychosocial outcomes. Thirdly, although Gayman et al. (2017) considered the psychosocial outcomes of older adults\u2019 sport participation, they excluded all cases of recreational and leisure-time sport participation, which accounts for a vast majority of literature in this domain. Further, the studies they included were of mixed quality, and therefore cannot provide complete confidence in their results. Ultimately, it is unclear to what extent these psychosocial benefits are a direct result of sport participation.\nPresently, there lacks a synthesis of the quantitative literature on the psychosocial outcomes of sport participation for middle-aged and older adults in the form of a meta-analysis. A meta-analysis enables such a quantitative synthesis, providing insight into the magnitude and consistency of the psychosocial outcomes of sport participation (Borenstein et al., 2009). Such inferences cannot be drawn from a systematic review. Hence, a meta-analysis is warranted in order to guide future sport-based interventions targeting this age category.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-21T02:34:43.651532", "date_modified": "2020-04-21T02:21:43.320899", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [""], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "c8e522c8c7720ed5e84ac484271f5da5b18453e7a3366cc3666a7426fb3acdc8f13c19a8b19d2a9784856a4ce48714d4cd6374be45a2f4d79293a8cac7309ad76ca75efce152ea83d8cd6b3bd858a320db001b804fa4b1b67e3b5cfd40dcfbf85da5e5d346106e2f857b070cee42cf720b4cbd5c8fc406122895d22bb43ea9c53a8181f0a53d033588ca0f003642de5f", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-21T02:34:43.606896", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Hamsini Sivaramakrishnan, Nikos Ntoumanis, Eleanor Quested, Daniel Gucciardi"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis are to:\n1.\tAssess the psychosocial outcomes of sport participation for middle-aged and older adults, and determine whether these outcomes can be classified into distinct categories (e.g., affective, cognitive and social)\n2.\tAssess the characteristics of sport participation that are found to be related to psychosocial outcomes in middle-aged and older adults (e.g., sport type, competitive context, age, clinical status)\n3.\tExamine whether a dose-response relationship exists between sport participation and psychosocial outcomes (i.e. do the psychosocial outcomes of sport participation vary as a function of the \u201cdose\u201d of sport participation?; \u201cdose\u201d is defined as the total duration of sport participation for interventions, minutes per week of sport participation for observational studies)\n4.\tEvaluate whether existing interventions adopt psychological theories as a framework guiding the interventions\nAn additional aim to be explored (dependent on availability of data) is to:\n5.\tExamine whether the efficacy of sport-based interventions vary as a function of specific features (e.g., individual responsible for delivering intervention \u2013 researcher vs coach)"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": ["No blinding is involved in this study."]}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q6": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Random-effects meta-analysis"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "PRISMA-P Final.docx"}, "nodeId": "mqcu5", "sha256": "1815d24e582ecf06820d5541f953975ff2f4b704f2d92d49b32d98a803611584", "viewUrl": "/project/ezkyq/files/osfstorage/5e9e5d665e9942003ab90a57/", "selectedFileName": "PRISMA-P Final.docx"}], "value": ""}}}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": "Not applicable"}, "q8": {"extra": [], "value": "Registration prior to accessing the data"}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": "Existing data utilised in this study refer to primary studies that will be identified and considered eligible for inclusion in the systematic review and meta-analysis.

Since the sexual domain of the scale has several offensive items and is not necessarily related to BIS, we omit the domain.  2) Perceived Vulnerability to Disease (PVD, (Duncan et al., 2009; Fukukawa et al., 2014) that has the Germ aversion and Perceived infectability subscales, and 3) Five items from the Cleanness and Impurity Scale (POPA, Kitamkura &amp; Matsuo, 2019) that are related to orientation to cleanness.

As such, it is proposed that BIS sometimes leads to exclusionary attitudes toward out-group members, especially those individuals from the contaminated areas/countries. Also, it has been proposed that BIS leads to obedience to the social norms because infective disease control should be done at the group/society/country level.

Heterogeneity will be assessed using the chi-square test (p &lt; 0.10) and its magnitude will be verified by the Higgins and Thompson I-square (I\u00b2). I\u00b2 values from 25% to 50% will be considered moderate and values below 25% will be considered low. For visual inspection, the forest plot graph of the prevalence and confidence intervals of each study will be constructed, as well as the summary measure for all of them will be calculated. \nThe DerSimonian-Laird method will be used for the meta-analysis of random effects to obtain the measure of the global association, odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals. When the results of the cohort study show a relative risk, this measure of association will be converted into an odds ratio according to the criteria defined by Zhang and Yu (1998). Publication bias will be analyzed using the Begg funnel plot and the Egger regression with a 5% significance level. The trim and fill test will be performed to identify the possible effects of the absence of studies related to the summary measurement of the association in the meta-analysis.\nSensitivity analyzes, subgroup analyzes and meta-regressions will be also performed to verify the source of heterogeneity in the studies used in the systematic review. In the analysis of subgroups and meta-regressions, the following covariables will be used: study design (cross-sectional study and prospective cohort), data collection location (hospital, basic health units, community), gestational trimester when the prevalence of maternal iodine deficiency was diagnosed (first, second, third), magnitude of the association measure (&lt;2; \u22652), geographic region (America, Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania), sample size (&lt;1000; \u22651000.

In the pooled analysis, studies using systemic therapy, such as oral tranexamic acid, will be separated from studies using topical therapies, such as topical tranexamic acid. I\u00b2 statistic will be used to asses heterogeneity across studies. Funnel plots will be used to assess for publication bias. The Bonferroni correction will be applied to account for multiple testing in the subgroup analysis, with P &lt; 0.01 being considered significant.
