Setidaknya untuk siap menuju revolusi industri 4.0, Indonesia harus memiliki kemapanan dalam pembangunan industri dalam negeri melalui stabilitas ekonomi nasional terciptanya pertumbuhan ekonomi yang berkualitas. Penelitian ini menggunakan data seunder bersumber dari BPS dan Bank Indonesia. Metode penelitan yang digunakan dalah kuantitatif-deskriptif. Adapun hasil yang didapat adalah rata-rata pertumbuhan nilai output industri sedang dan besar di Indonesia adalah 23,4492% (dalam periode 2013-2017). Adapun melalui analisis regresi linear sederhana didapat persamaan Y \u0302=7240389,66+0,425X_1, dengan korelasi yaitu 0,976. disamping itu guna mengukur faktor yang mempengaruhi nilai output memiliki persamaan regresi yaitu Y \u0302=17,712+31,197X_1-41,524X_2+7,375X_3, serta korelasi yaitu inflasi (0,735), suku bunga (0,140) dan UMR (0,298).

Dalam hal ini menggunakan data bersumber dari BPS, untuk hipotesis 1 menggunakan nilai mutlak pada nilai output industri besar dan sedang, sedangkan untuk hipotesis 2 menggunakan presentase perubahan nilai output dalam bentuk persen (%).\n2.\tPertumbuhan Ekonomi (Economic Growth)/ Produk Domestik Bruto (PDB)\nPertumbuhan ekonomi adalah pertambahan nilai output sektor-sektor ekonomi secara nasional. Dalam hal ini digunakan Produk Domestik Bruto Indonesia periode tahun 2009-2018. Sumber yang digunakan adalah data Produk Domestik Brtuo Indonesia Menurut Lapangan Usaha berdasarkan Harga Konstan 2010 bersumber dari Badan Pusat Statistik. Diolah terlebih dahulu menjadi pertumbuhan dalam persen (%).\n3.\tSuku Bunga\nSuku Bunga adalah Harga uang dalam tansaksi jual beli. Dalam analisis ini menggunakan BI Rate untuk rentang waktu 2009-2015 dan menggunakan BI 7 Day Repo Rate pada rentang waktu 2016-2018. Adapun data berbentuk persen (%).\n4.\tInflasi\nInflasi adalah kenaikan harga barang-barang yang bersifat umum dan terus menerus. Data bersumber dari Badan Pusat Statistik dan diolah kembali untuk membentuk persentase perubahan dalam bentuk persen (%)\n5.\tRata-Rata UMR Nasional\nUMR atau Upah Minimum Regional adalah peraturan yang dikeluarkan pemerintah untuk menetapkan upah minimum yang menjadi batas dalam pemberian upah pada pekerja yang berlaku pada regional/kawasan tertentu.

For concerns (13 items; see \u201cPosttest Survey March 2020\u201d), we will run a factor analysis in order to identify potential clusters. The clusters will then be used for further analysis. For precautions, 6 items (see \u201cmeasured variables\u201d) will be analyzed. For preparatory behaviors, 5 items (see \u201cmeasured variables\u201d) will be analyzed. For estimates of duration, 5 items (see \u201cmeasured variables\u201d) will be analyzed. Binary logistic regression analyses will be completed to analyze the association between personality traits and the individual outcomes that have yes/no responses. For each personality trait, a separate model will be run. In a follow-up model, all five factors will be added simultaneously.

The primary cause of EPISBO is a kind of mechanical and dynamic abdominal adhesion of the intestinal tract due to wall edema and exudation because of injury of abdominal operation and post-operative abdominal inflammation, but intestinal strangulation rarely occurs. EPISBO occurs in the early stage after operation, and the major symptom is abdominal distension with or without mild abdominal pain. Adnominal inflammation-induced intensive intestinal adhesion is the major cause of the disease.Somatostatin was extracted from hypothalamus by Brazeau et al. in 1973 for the first time. Its full name is growth hormone-inhibiting hormone, a kind of cyclic peptide hormone consisting of 14 amino acids. It is widely distributed in pancreatic D cells and gastrointestinal autonomic nerves and can obviously inhibit the secretion of digestive juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Studies have shown that SS is used in treating EPISBO as it can significantly reduce the accumulation of digestive juice in intestinal canal above the obstructed segment, reduce dilatation and ischemia of intestine due to the accumulation of a large amount of fluid, accelerate the recovery of intestinal wall blood circulation and promote inflammation resolution. In order to explore the effectiveness and efficacy of SS as one of conservative therapy in treating EPISBO, we carried out a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the included randomized controlled trials so as to assess its effectiveness and efficacy in an objective manner.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-07T04:41:02.451373", "date_modified": "2020-04-07T04:38:31.994183", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "5f645241e2b314fa4606992ae180cfa288572ef1317764f74145ec48358f2813a501715d475f2f59da672ca4a875571ae6561c9ca26f89c3af6df836a7d9c40590b1576e63b42b490dab2d454dd2bd697938225a8fd0fdac12965e5b687688db48343936f57bc0f05021bb9d3d5d656aa64b9d5dad102df9e122222a6a9e9d1bfef76332458c298c9eef644836d32664", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-07T04:41:02.430666", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Ming Lin, Zhongyong Wu, Suibiao Wang, Shaofei Yuan"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "1.

Regardless of the major result or language, all possibly qualified studies were considered for review. \n5. Condition or domain being studied: Early postoperative inflammatory small bowel obstruction (EPISBO), a very common complication following colorectal operation, often occurs in the early stage after abdominal operation (within 2 to 3 weeks). The primary cause of EPISBO is a kind of mechanical and dynamic abdominal adhesion of the intestinal tract due to wall edema and exudation because of injury of abdominal operation and post-operative abdominal inflammation, but intestinal strangulation rarely occurs. EPISBO occurs in the early stage after operation, and the major symptom is abdominal distension with or without mild abdominal pain. Adnominal inflammation-induced intensive intestinal adhesion is the major cause of the disease.\n  With the continuous rise of abdominal operation rate, the incidence of EPISBO is also improving. If left untreated, intestinal function disorder and a series of other complications such as abdominal infection and peritoneum effusion may be caused, which is not good for patients\u2019 postoperative recovery, increases their pain and prolongs length of stay. Improper treatment measures may lead to intestinal fistula and short-bowel syndrome and even death. Currently, some reported treatment methods include gastrointestinal decompression, oral administration of western medicine, oral administration of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), TCM enema, acupuncture, moxibustion, etc. However, since EPISBO patients with severe abdominal and intestinal adhesions and inflammation, surgical exposure is very difficult and intestinal damage easily happens. Therefore, conservative treatment-based first-line treatment has been gradually developed. Considering that conservative treatment has multiple modalities, they have variant efficacy and safety in clinical applications. As one of conservative treatment methods, drug treatment fuels controversy about the efficacy and safety of various drugs among clinicians. Therefore, research on it is needed.\n6. Participants/population: EPISBO patients undergoing abdominal surgery, regardless of surgical type or surgical method, were included. Patient data were collected without limiting by age, gender or case source. The diagnostic criteria refer to the diagnostic criteria for early inflammatory bowel obstruction in the literature.\n7. Inclusion criteria: (1) There is a recent (within 1~3 weeks) history of abdominal surgery, especially a recent history of repeated surgeries and extensive separation of adhesions. (2) The peristalsis of all patients recovered at one time, but some patients had been discharged and had a bowel movement and developed intestinal obstruction symptoms 3~7 days later. (3) Abdominal X-ray showed many gas-liquid planes or intestinal pneumatosis; abdominal CT showed intestinal wall thickening, edema, adhesions, intestinal effusion and pneumatosis of peritoneal exudate. (4) In addition to external hernia, volvulus and anastomotic stenosis caused by factors such as mechanical intestinal obstruction; in addition to external causes of hypokalemia, visceral nerve injury and tumor metastasis caused by intestinal obstruction.\n8. Exclusion Criteria: (1) Non- RCT documents; (2) Medicines not related to this research; (3) Patients whose baseline data were obviously inconsistent; (4) Patients whose inflammatory intestinal obstruction did not occur following abdominal surgery; (5) Case reports, reviews, animal experiments or important data reports are incomplete but the author does not give a reply; (6) The clinical outcomes included in the research do not involve those clinical outcome we wanted to assess.\n9. Intervention(s), exposure(s): Experimental group: somatostatin combined with conventional treatment (not limited by dosage, times of administration, course of disease, interval of medication, or course of treatment).\n10. Comparator(s)/control: Conventional treatment (not limited by dosage, times of administration, course of disease, interval of medication, or course of treatment).\n11. Types of study to be included: Blinded or non-blinded studies on randomized controlled trials of somatostatin for the treatment of EPISBO in Chinese or English were included.\n12. Main outcome(s): (1) Evaluation measures were patients\u2019 peristaltic sound recovery;\n(2) Time of disappearance of abdominal pain;\n(3) Time until first defecation after operation;\n(4) Gastrointestinal decompression;\n(5) Total effectiveness rate.\n13. Additional outcome(s): (1) Length of stay;\n(2) The occurrence of adverse reactions.\n(3) Serum inflammatory factors;\n(4) Incidence of adverse reactions.\n14. Data extraction (selection and coding): Two evaluators read document titles and abstracts independently and read through them when necessary. Documents were selected according to the pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Evaluators read through the documents that met the inclusion criteria to make further confirmation. Any document on which the two evaluators has different opinions were discussed by the third evaluator to decide whether to include it. After selecting the documents to be included, we prepared a table of extracted data, including research objects (investigator, origin of study, sample size, age, gender, baseline data, diagnostic criteria, inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria), research methods (random method and allocation concealment; blinding of patients, intervention provider and result evaluators; number of dropouts and subjects lost to follow-up), intervention (intervention methods, treatment times and follow-up periods of the experimental group and control group) and clinical outcomes (type of outcome and measuring method).\n15. Risk of bias (quality) assessment: Bias risk assessment tool, which is recommended by Cochrane Review Hand book 5.2, was employed to assess selection bias (stochastic series generation and allocation concealment), implementation bias (blinding of investigators and subjects), measurement bias (blind evaluation of research result), follow-up bias (completeness of result data), report bias (selective report of research results) and other bias. \u201cLow bias risk\u201d, \u201cuncertain bias risk\u201d and \u201chigh bias risk\u201d were used to determine each measure. Low bias risk refers to that the existing bias would not have a great impact on the research result, uncertain bias risk suggests that the existing bias lowers the credibility of the research result, and high bias risk means that the existing bias greatly undermines the credibility of the research result.\n16. Strategy for data synthesis: Statistical software Stata12.0 was used to conduct a meta-analysis of the data collected. Enumeration data were expressed in risk ratio (RR) and continuous variable were expressed in weighted mean difference (WMD) (both confidence interval were 95%). Heterogeneity test (Q test) was conducted on each experimental result. P&gt;0.1 was considered to suggest no heterogeneity; P\u22640.1 was considered to reveal   heterogeneity. The degree of heterogeneity was expressed by Higgins I2 (I2=(Q-df)/Q). If there was statistical homogeneity between various research results (P&gt;0.1, I2\u226450%), meta-analysis was conducted by using the fixed effect model; if there was statistical heterogeneity between various research results (P\u22640.1, I2&gt;50%), meta-analysis was conducted by using the random effects model after eliminating the effect of obvious clinical heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis or sensitivity analysis was performed to process obvious clinical heterogeneity, or only descriptive analysis was provided.\n17. Sensitivity analysis: In order to verify the stability of these results, we carried out sensitivity analysis to eliminate studies having a great impact on the result. No change to the result suggested that the result was stable. In contrast, if there was any change to the result, it was required to carefully analyzes and study the eliminated documents to identify the source(s) of heterogeneity and make a prudent conclusion, or only give a description analysis.  \n18. Assessment of reporting bias.\nPublication bias was assessed when the subgroup included &gt;8 studies. The publication bias was checked by either the visual funnel plot or Egger\u2019s test.\n19.

Searches: The selection procedure for this meta-analysis was performed in strict accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Computer-based retrieval was conducted in the CNKI, WanFang Data, Sino Med, VIP, PubMed, Cochrane Library and Embase databases to collect all relevant published experimental studies in Chinese and English from the date of database creation through August 1, 2018 and to follow up with the references of the studies included. Regardless of the major result or language, all possibly qualified studies were considered for review. \n5. Condition or domain being studied: Early postoperative inflammatory small bowel obstruction (EPISBO), a very common complication following colorectal operation, often occurs in the early stage after abdominal operation (within 2 to 3 weeks). The primary cause of EPISBO is a kind of mechanical and dynamic abdominal adhesion of the intestinal tract due to wall edema and exudation because of injury of abdominal operation and post-operative abdominal inflammation, but intestinal strangulation rarely occurs. EPISBO occurs in the early stage after operation, and the major symptom is abdominal distension with or without mild abdominal pain. Adnominal inflammation-induced intensive intestinal adhesion is the major cause of the disease.\n  With the continuous rise of abdominal operation rate, the incidence of EPISBO is also improving. If left untreated, intestinal function disorder and a series of other complications such as abdominal infection and peritoneum effusion may be caused, which is not good for patients\u2019 postoperative recovery, increases their pain and prolongs length of stay. Improper treatment measures may lead to intestinal fistula and short-bowel syndrome and even death. Currently, some reported treatment methods include gastrointestinal decompression, oral administration of western medicine, oral administration of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), TCM enema, acupuncture, moxibustion, etc. However, since EPISBO patients with severe abdominal and intestinal adhesions and inflammation, surgical exposure is very difficult and intestinal damage easily happens. Therefore, conservative treatment-based first-line treatment has been gradually developed. Considering that conservative treatment has multiple modalities, they have variant efficacy and safety in clinical applications. As one of conservative treatment methods, drug treatment fuels controversy about the efficacy and safety of various drugs among clinicians. Therefore, research on it is needed.\n6. Participants/population: EPISBO patients undergoing abdominal surgery, regardless of surgical type or surgical method, were included. Patient data were collected without limiting by age, gender or case source. The diagnostic criteria refer to the diagnostic criteria for early inflammatory bowel obstruction in the literature.\n7. Inclusion criteria: (1) There is a recent (within 1~3 weeks) history of abdominal surgery, especially a recent history of repeated surgeries and extensive separation of adhesions. (2) The peristalsis of all patients recovered at one time, but some patients had been discharged and had a bowel movement and developed intestinal obstruction symptoms 3~7 days later. (3) Abdominal X-ray showed many gas-liquid planes or intestinal pneumatosis; abdominal CT showed intestinal wall thickening, edema, adhesions, intestinal effusion and pneumatosis of peritoneal exudate. (4) In addition to external hernia, volvulus and anastomotic stenosis caused by factors such as mechanical intestinal obstruction; in addition to external causes of hypokalemia, visceral nerve injury and tumor metastasis caused by intestinal obstruction.\n8. Exclusion Criteria: (1) Non- RCT documents; (2) Medicines not related to this research; (3) Patients whose baseline data were obviously inconsistent; (4) Patients whose inflammatory intestinal obstruction did not occur following abdominal surgery; (5) Case reports, reviews, animal experiments or important data reports are incomplete but the author does not give a reply; (6) The clinical outcomes included in the research do not involve those clinical outcome we wanted to assess.\n9. Intervention(s), exposure(s): Experimental group: somatostatin combined with conventional treatment (not limited by dosage, times of administration, course of disease, interval of medication, or course of treatment).\n10. Comparator(s)/control: Conventional treatment (not limited by dosage, times of administration, course of disease, interval of medication, or course of treatment).\n11. Types of study to be included: Blinded or non-blinded studies on randomized controlled trials of somatostatin for the treatment of EPISBO in Chinese or English were included.\n12. Main outcome(s): (1) Evaluation measures were patients\u2019 peristaltic sound recovery;\n(2) Time of disappearance of abdominal pain;\n(3) Time until first defecation after operation;\n(4) Gastrointestinal decompression;\n(5) Total effectiveness rate.\n13. Additional outcome(s): (1) Length of stay;\n(2) The occurrence of adverse reactions.\n(3) Serum inflammatory factors;\n(4) Incidence of adverse reactions.\n14. Data extraction (selection and coding): Two evaluators read document titles and abstracts independently and read through them when necessary. Documents were selected according to the pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Evaluators read through the documents that met the inclusion criteria to make further confirmation. Any document on which the two evaluators has different opinions were discussed by the third evaluator to decide whether to include it. After selecting the documents to be included, we prepared a table of extracted data, including research objects (investigator, origin of study, sample size, age, gender, baseline data, diagnostic criteria, inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria), research methods (random method and allocation concealment; blinding of patients, intervention provider and result evaluators; number of dropouts and subjects lost to follow-up), intervention (intervention methods, treatment times and follow-up periods of the experimental group and control group) and clinical outcomes (type of outcome and measuring method).\n15. Risk of bias (quality) assessment: Bias risk assessment tool, which is recommended by Cochrane Review Hand book 5.2, was employed to assess selection bias (stochastic series generation and allocation concealment), implementation bias (blinding of investigators and subjects), measurement bias (blind evaluation of research result), follow-up bias (completeness of result data), report bias (selective report of research results) and other bias. \u201cLow bias risk\u201d, \u201cuncertain bias risk\u201d and \u201chigh bias risk\u201d were used to determine each measure. Low bias risk refers to that the existing bias would not have a great impact on the research result, uncertain bias risk suggests that the existing bias lowers the credibility of the research result, and high bias risk means that the existing bias greatly undermines the credibility of the research result.\n16. Strategy for data synthesis: Statistical software Stata12.0 was used to conduct a meta-analysis of the data collected. Enumeration data were expressed in risk ratio (RR) and continuous variable were expressed in weighted mean difference (WMD) (both confidence interval were 95%). Heterogeneity test (Q test) was conducted on each experimental result. P&gt;0.1 was considered to suggest no heterogeneity; P\u22640.1 was considered to reveal   heterogeneity. The degree of heterogeneity was expressed by Higgins I2 (I2=(Q-df)/Q). If there was statistical homogeneity between various research results (P&gt;0.1, I2\u226450%), meta-analysis was conducted by using the fixed effect model; if there was statistical heterogeneity between various research results (P\u22640.1, I2&gt;50%), meta-analysis was conducted by using the random effects model after eliminating the effect of obvious clinical heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis or sensitivity analysis was performed to process obvious clinical heterogeneity, or only descriptive analysis was provided.\n17. Sensitivity analysis: In order to verify the stability of these results, we carried out sensitivity analysis to eliminate studies having a great impact on the result. No change to the result suggested that the result was stable. In contrast, if there was any change to the result, it was required to carefully analyzes and study the eliminated documents to identify the source(s) of heterogeneity and make a prudent conclusion, or only give a description analysis.  \n18. Assessment of reporting bias.\nPublication bias was assessed when the subgroup included &gt;8 studies. The publication bias was checked by either the visual funnel plot or Egger\u2019s test.\n19.

If counselors were not assigned a territory, our assistants selected one at random. Schools with no admissions counselors listed on the website (i.e., only a general email was included) were excluded from our sample for consistency, thus resulting in a final sample of 973 counselors (658 from private institutions, 315 from public institutions).

This accurate assessment of fighting ability and aggressiveness is important for decision making in physical contests (e.g., whether or not one should engage in combat).  In their paper, T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al. reported that perceived aggressiveness predicted actual fighting success, and that perceived fighting ability was associated with greater real-world fighting success. This finding was only observed amongst heavyweight fighters.  T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al. is widely cited in the area of fighting ability and facial perception research. It has generated 65 citations on Google Scholar as of 6th April, 2020, yet there are potential methodological and statistical issues with their research.   \n\nFirstly, T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al. reported that perceived fighting ability predicted actual fighting success only amongst heavyweight fighters (e.g., [pp. 1664 abstract], \u201cIn contrast, perception of fighting ability was confounded by weight, and an association between perceived fighting ability and actual fighting success was restricted to heavyweight fighters\u201d and [pp. 1667 discussion], \u201cPerceived fighting ability was predicted only by weight, and its link to fighting success was restricted to heavy-weights\u201d).  However, T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al. only \u201cfound a close-to-significant correlation between perceived fighting ability and fighting success in heavyweights (n = 33, r = .301, p = .088)\u201d (pp. 1667).  This bivariate correlation was not below an alpha of .05\u2014the widely accepted significance threshold for psychology (Benjamin et al., 2018)\u2014and was their only statistical evidence for their claim that perceived fighting ability predicts real-world fighting success.\n\nFurthermore, T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al. argued that perceived aggressiveness is a sub-component of perceived fighting ability.  As they noted, \u201cFighting ability depends on many factors alongside aggression, so being seen as a powerful fighter does not necessarily equal being seen as aggressive.\u201d  Given that perceived aggressiveness is overarched by perceived fighting ability, this suggests that perceived fighting ability was their most theoretically central variable.  Despite this, there was no empirical support for perceived fighting ability as a predictor of fighting success, and the positive relationship between fighting success and perceived aggressiveness (when controlling for weight) was arguably closely below the significance threshold (F(1, 143) = 4.91, p = .028, R2 = .033).\n\nSecond, geometric morphometric (GMM) analyses were not performed on perceived fighting ability.  T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al. \u201csearched for the specific facial traits associated with actual fighting ability and compared them with traits responsible for perceived aggressiveness\u201d (pp. 1665) but did not examine the specific facial traits associated with perceived fighting ability, nor compared them to those associated with actual fighting ability.  It would seem most logical to compare traits associated with actual fighting ability with those associated with perceived fighting ability, especially as they \u201ccollected ratings of perceived fighting ability to test whether people are able to infer actual fighting ability\u201d (pp. 1665).  While facial traits associated with heavyweight fighting success were examined, this does not mean that these traits were perceived as cues to fighting success (especially because perceived did not predict actual fighting ability).  Without examining the association between facial configuration and perceived fighting ability, it is unclear if there is consistent support for the hypothesis that humans can accurately perceive competitive ability from facial traits.  Thus, we will extend T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al.\u2019s analyses and examine the relationship between perceived fighting ability and facial structure\u2014first in the overall sample, and then specifically for heavyweight fighters.\n\nThird, several decisions made by T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al regarding the inclusion and exclusion of certain MMA fighters are questionable.  Originally, the dataset comprised 336 MMA fighter portraits.  However, the final dataset comprised 146 photographs after the removal of portraits that contained a beard or moustache, hair that obscured the face, faces of perceivably African or Asian origin, or faces that were not directly faced into the camera.  There was no justification for these exclusion criteria reported by T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al. in the paper.  While the presence of a beard might present difficulty in using geometric morphometric techniques (e.g., placing landmarks or semi-landmarks on the chin or jaw), it is unclear why fighters with a moustache were excluded.  It was also puzzling as to why Asian and African fighters were excluded, but not other non-Caucasian ethnic groups (e.g., M\u0101ori, and South, Central, and Native Americans).\n\nFourth, the study relied on an insufficient number of stimuli (i.e., face-based photographs of MMA fighters).  The final dataset comprised 146 photographs.  Thus, the paper\u2019s two most important correlations (i.e., perceived aggressiveness [r = .203] and perceived fighting ability [r = .067] on fighting success) relied on this sample size, but these correlations in samples of this size are unstable and lack statistical power (Sch\u00f6nbrodt &amp; Perugini, 2013).  Furthermore, the relation between facial shape and perceived aggressiveness in their overall sample was close to the significance threshold F(1, 143) = 1.97, p = .055, R2 = .013, suggesting that original study would benefit from a higher-powered design.  The original study would further benefit from a higher-powered design because, when controlling for weight, facial shape predicted perceived aggressiveness closely above (p = .055) and perceived aggressiveness predicted fighting success arguably closely below (p = .028) the significance threshold.\n\nDespite the limited stimuli in the original sample, an even smaller sample was used when the analyses were conducted within each weight distribution.  The finding that perceived fighting ability and actual fighting success were \u201cclose-to-significant\u201d (p = .088; pp. 1667) in heavyweight fighters relied on a collapsed sample of 19 light heavyweight and 14 heavyweight MMA fighters\u2014overall, 33 \u201cheavyweight\u201d MMA fighters.  Furthermore, facial configuration predicted perceived aggressiveness (p = .037)\u2014and similarly for facial configuration on actual fighting success (p = .033)\u2014only in their limited sample of 33 heavyweights.  This study would benefit from a higher-powered design to more appropriately demonstrate the presence, or absence, of these associations.\n\nFifth, it was argued that, \u201craters might have primarily used cues of weight to attribute fighting ability\u201d and therefore, should have also used cues of weight to attribute aggressiveness.  In support of this argument, their interaction between weight and perceived aggressiveness on fighting success was significant, leading them to state that this interaction \u201cindicates that facial features responsible for attribution of aggressiveness are associated with weight distribution.\u201d  Following up this interaction, they found that facial configuration did not predict perceived aggressiveness in their sample of lightweight MMA fighters, F(1, 60) = 1.78, p = .071, R2 = .029, but did in heavyweight fighters, F(1, 31) = 2.13, p = .037, R2 = .064, yielding support for their argument that facial shape predicts perceived aggressiveness in only heavyweight fighters.  While stated as non-significant, their relationship for facial shape and perceived aggressiveness in lightweight MMA fighters was closer to the significance threshold (p = .071) than their other (more central) hypothesised relationships (i.e., perceived fighting ability and fighting success in heavyweights was significant at p = .088).\n\nFor these reasons, it would be beneficial for the research to conduct a direct replication and extension of T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al.\u2019s (2013) seminal paper.\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "In line with T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al.\u2019s a priori predictions, we hypothesise (H1) that perceived aggressiveness and perceived fighting ability would predict fighting success.  As per their post-hoc predictions, we hypothesise (H2) that perceived fighting ability would predict fighting success only in heavyweight fighters.  A limited sub-sample was used when the original study examined facial shape, and their significance rested closely below the significance threshold.  Thus, we hypothesise that these effects will be replicated such that (H3) facial shape would be associated with both perceived aggressiveness and fighting success only in heavyweight fighters.  Given the aforementioned unexplored analyses, we will extend the original study with a novel hypothesis (H4): facial shape will be associated with perceived fighting ability.

(2013) Study", "q2": "Neil Caton, Barnaby Dixson, Sam Pearson", "q3": "T\u0159ebick\u00fd, Havl\u00ed\u010dek, Roberts, Little, and Kleisner (2013) argued that humans have evolved the capability to accurately perceive cues of fighting ability and aggressiveness.  This accurate assessment of fighting ability and aggressiveness is important for decision making in physical contests (e.g., whether or not one should engage in combat).  In their paper, T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al. reported that perceived aggressiveness predicted actual fighting success, and that perceived fighting ability was associated with greater real-world fighting success. This finding was only observed amongst heavyweight fighters.  T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al. is widely cited in the area of fighting ability and facial perception research. It has generated 65 citations on Google Scholar as of 6th April, 2020, yet there are potential methodological and statistical issues with their research.   \n\nFirstly, T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al. reported that perceived fighting ability predicted actual fighting success only amongst heavyweight fighters (e.g., [pp. 1664 abstract], \u201cIn contrast, perception of fighting ability was confounded by weight, and an association between perceived fighting ability and actual fighting success was restricted to heavyweight fighters\u201d and [pp. 1667 discussion], \u201cPerceived fighting ability was predicted only by weight, and its link to fighting success was restricted to heavy-weights\u201d).  However, T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al. only \u201cfound a close-to-significant correlation between perceived fighting ability and fighting success in heavyweights (n = 33, r = .301, p = .088)\u201d (pp. 1667).  This bivariate correlation was not below an alpha of .05\u2014the widely accepted significance threshold for psychology (Benjamin et al., 2018)\u2014and was their only statistical evidence for their claim that perceived fighting ability predicts real-world fighting success.\n\nFurthermore, T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al. argued that perceived aggressiveness is a sub-component of perceived fighting ability.  As they noted, \u201cFighting ability depends on many factors alongside aggression, so being seen as a powerful fighter does not necessarily equal being seen as aggressive.\u201d  Given that perceived aggressiveness is overarched by perceived fighting ability, this suggests that perceived fighting ability was their most theoretically central variable.  Despite this, there was no empirical support for perceived fighting ability as a predictor of fighting success, and the positive relationship between fighting success and perceived aggressiveness (when controlling for weight) was arguably closely below the significance threshold (F(1, 143) = 4.91, p = .028, R2 = .033).\n\nSecond, geometric morphometric (GMM) analyses were not performed on perceived fighting ability.  T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al. \u201csearched for the specific facial traits associated with actual fighting ability and compared them with traits responsible for perceived aggressiveness\u201d (pp. 1665) but did not examine the specific facial traits associated with perceived fighting ability, nor compared them to those associated with actual fighting ability.  It would seem most logical to compare traits associated with actual fighting ability with those associated with perceived fighting ability, especially as they \u201ccollected ratings of perceived fighting ability to test whether people are able to infer actual fighting ability\u201d (pp. 1665).  While facial traits associated with heavyweight fighting success were examined, this does not mean that these traits were perceived as cues to fighting success (especially because perceived did not predict actual fighting ability).  Without examining the association between facial configuration and perceived fighting ability, it is unclear if there is consistent support for the hypothesis that humans can accurately perceive competitive ability from facial traits.  Thus, we will extend T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al.\u2019s analyses and examine the relationship between perceived fighting ability and facial structure\u2014first in the overall sample, and then specifically for heavyweight fighters.\n\nThird, several decisions made by T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al regarding the inclusion and exclusion of certain MMA fighters are questionable.  Originally, the dataset comprised 336 MMA fighter portraits.  However, the final dataset comprised 146 photographs after the removal of portraits that contained a beard or moustache, hair that obscured the face, faces of perceivably African or Asian origin, or faces that were not directly faced into the camera.  There was no justification for these exclusion criteria reported by T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al. in the paper.  While the presence of a beard might present difficulty in using geometric morphometric techniques (e.g., placing landmarks or semi-landmarks on the chin or jaw), it is unclear why fighters with a moustache were excluded.  It was also puzzling as to why Asian and African fighters were excluded, but not other non-Caucasian ethnic groups (e.g., M\u0101ori, and South, Central, and Native Americans).\n\nFourth, the study relied on an insufficient number of stimuli (i.e., face-based photographs of MMA fighters).  The final dataset comprised 146 photographs.  Thus, the paper\u2019s two most important correlations (i.e., perceived aggressiveness [r = .203] and perceived fighting ability [r = .067] on fighting success) relied on this sample size, but these correlations in samples of this size are unstable and lack statistical power (Sch\u00f6nbrodt &amp; Perugini, 2013).  Furthermore, the relation between facial shape and perceived aggressiveness in their overall sample was close to the significance threshold F(1, 143) = 1.97, p = .055, R2 = .013, suggesting that original study would benefit from a higher-powered design.  The original study would further benefit from a higher-powered design because, when controlling for weight, facial shape predicted perceived aggressiveness closely above (p = .055) and perceived aggressiveness predicted fighting success arguably closely below (p = .028) the significance threshold.\n\nDespite the limited stimuli in the original sample, an even smaller sample was used when the analyses were conducted within each weight distribution.  The finding that perceived fighting ability and actual fighting success were \u201cclose-to-significant\u201d (p = .088; pp. 1667) in heavyweight fighters relied on a collapsed sample of 19 light heavyweight and 14 heavyweight MMA fighters\u2014overall, 33 \u201cheavyweight\u201d MMA fighters.  Furthermore, facial configuration predicted perceived aggressiveness (p = .037)\u2014and similarly for facial configuration on actual fighting success (p = .033)\u2014only in their limited sample of 33 heavyweights.  This study would benefit from a higher-powered design to more appropriately demonstrate the presence, or absence, of these associations.\n\nFifth, it was argued that, \u201craters might have primarily used cues of weight to attribute fighting ability\u201d and therefore, should have also used cues of weight to attribute aggressiveness.  In support of this argument, their interaction between weight and perceived aggressiveness on fighting success was significant, leading them to state that this interaction \u201cindicates that facial features responsible for attribution of aggressiveness are associated with weight distribution.\u201d  Following up this interaction, they found that facial configuration did not predict perceived aggressiveness in their sample of lightweight MMA fighters, F(1, 60) = 1.78, p = .071, R2 = .029, but did in heavyweight fighters, F(1, 31) = 2.13, p = .037, R2 = .064, yielding support for their argument that facial shape predicts perceived aggressiveness in only heavyweight fighters.  While stated as non-significant, their relationship for facial shape and perceived aggressiveness in lightweight MMA fighters was closer to the significance threshold (p = .071) than their other (more central) hypothesised relationships (i.e., perceived fighting ability and fighting success in heavyweights was significant at p = .088).\n\nFor these reasons, it would be beneficial for the research to conduct a direct replication and extension of T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al.\u2019s (2013) seminal paper.\n", "q4": "In line with T\u0159ebick\u00fd et al.\u2019s a priori predictions, we hypothesise (H1) that perceived aggressiveness and perceived fighting ability would predict fighting success.  As per their post-hoc predictions, we hypothesise (H2) that perceived fighting ability would predict fighting success only in heavyweight fighters.  A limited sub-sample was used when the original study examined facial shape, and their significance rested closely below the significance threshold.  Thus, we hypothesise that these effects will be replicated such that (H3) facial shape would be associated with both perceived aggressiveness and fighting success only in heavyweight fighters.  Given the aforementioned unexplored analyses, we will extend the original study with a novel hypothesis (H4): facial shape will be associated with perceived fighting ability.

Similar to the original study, we will combine flyweight, bantamweight, featherweight and lightweight divisions into one category called \"lightweight\" (coded as \"0\"), welterweight and middleweight into one category called \"middleweight\" (coded as \"1\"), and light heavyweight and heavyweight into one category called \"heavyweight\" (coded as \"2\").\n\nFacial damage was coded by a research assistant, coding each facial photograph for marks of possible damage (e.g., broken nose, cauliflower ear, scarring) using binary coding (0 = damage absent; 1 = damage present).\n\nA \"facial shape\" variable will be represented by multiple PCA (i.e., principal components analysis) scores, described in further detail in the previous analysis plan section.\n\nThe coding scheme for our exclusion criteria of beards and moustaches is described below, in the data exclusion section.\n", "q21": "Two-tailed tests will be used for all of the analyses, and the p-value cut-off will be .05.", "q22": "Consistent with the original study, no statistical outliers will be excluded from our analyses.  No awareness check will be used.  However, to be consistent with the original study, we have excluded MMA fighters from our analyses (and from being presented to MTurk participants) if they were female, had no photograph, those of perceivably African or Asian origin, those not facing directly into the camera, and those whose face was obscured by their hair.\n\nT\u0159ebick\u00fd et al. also excluded moustached and bearded fighters, but beards and moustaches themselves might not obstruct facial landmarking (e.g., stubble, pencil moustache).  To this end, two independent research assistants experienced in tpsDig2 facial landmarking techniques coded these faces on moustache and beardedness, where: 1 = no beard (i.e., clean shaven, stubble), 2 = some beard (i.e., slight beard, but deemed appropriate for facial landmarking); 3 = full beard (inappropriate for facial landmarking); and 4 = moustache (inappropriate for facial landmarking).  Agreement between the two research assistants was above 90% (i.e., in 675 out of 715 cases).  The remaining cases were discussed and categorised, and fighters whose beards and moustaches were deemed as an obstruction to the accurate placement of facial landmarks were excluded.

We will then visualise the shape data on fighting success in heavyweight fighters using thin-plate spline-deformation grids, again magnified by three times for visibility purposes.  We will then perform similar analyses for perceived fighting ability in the overall sample, and then only for the heavyweight fighters.

Associations between variables will be assessed by Pearson's correlation provided that the data are normally distributed, or Pearson's correlation with bootstrapping with 10,000 iterations or Kendall's test for ordinal data if the data are not normally distributed.  We will first test the relation between potentially confounding variables.  A correlation will be run between fighter's age and perceived aggressiveness, and perceived fighting ability; and then the correlations between male and female judgments of aggressiveness and fighting ability.  We will then run a correlation between perceived aggressiveness and perceived fighting ability.\n\nA correlation will then be run between perceived aggressiveness and fighting success, as well as perceived fighting ability and fighting success.  Linear regression analyses will also be run with perceived fighting ability as a predictor, fighting success as the criterion, and age as a covariate.\n\nCorrelations will then be run between perceived aggressiveness and weight, and perceived fighting ability and weight.  Two linear regressions will then be run with weight as a covariate in both analyses, fighting success as a predictor in both analyses, and each perception variable as a criterion in separate analyses (i.e., perceived aggressiveness in one linear regression, and perceived fighting ability in the other).  We will then run an additional regression with weight, number of wins, and the interaction between weight and the numbers of wins.  In the original study, this was done to compare which of the two previous analyses held a better fit.\n\nA linear regression will then be run with perceived fighting ability as the criterion, and weight and fighting success as predictors.  Then, a one-way ANOVA will be performed with perceived fighting ability as the dependent variable and weight category as the independent variable.  Pairwise comparisons (least significance difference) will be run on weight category to examine the differences between light, middle, and heavyweight fighters.\n\nA correlation will then be run between perceived fighting ability and actual fighting success for the individual light, middle, and heavyweight categories.  A correlation will then be run between facial damage and perceived fighting ability and aggressiveness.\n\nLandmark data will be imported into R, and will be analysed using the \"geomorph\" package.  First, semi-landmarks will be identified using the \"define.sliders\" function.  Factoring in the semi-landmark data generated from the previous function, a generalised Procrustes analysis will be conducted on the landmark data using the \"gpagen\" function.  After which, a principal components analysis will be conducted on the shape coordinates using the \"plotTangentSpace\" function where, in line with the original study, we will retain all of the principal components and use them for further analyses.  This will be referred to as the facial shape variable.\n\nWe will then use the \"procD.lm\" function to perform a series of Procrustes ANOVAs with 9,999 permutations.  First, we will examine shape data (represented by multiple PCA scores) as the outcome variable, and perceived aggressiveness as an explanatory variable.  We will then perform an additional, similar Procrustes ANOVA, but now controlling for weight.  We will then test for the interaction between weight and perceived aggressiveness; thus, we will include both the main effects of weight and perceived aggressiveness, as well as the interaction between the two variables, with facial shape as the outcome variable.  We will then examine the same effect for both heavyweights and lightweights, separately; that is, we will run separately analyses for heavyweights and lightweights, with facial shape as the outcome variable and perceived aggressiveness as the explanatory variable.  We will then employ another Procrustes ANOVA to examine fighting success on facial shape, controlling for weight; and then run the same analysis for both heavyweights and lightweights, in that we will examine fighting success on facial shape in both groups.  In an extension of the original study, we will then run the same analyses but with perceived fighting ability as an explanatory variable.\n\nIn line with the original study, we will then use tpsRegr (Version 1.45) to visualise the results of the shape data.

We will then visualise the shape data on fighting success in heavyweight fighters using thin-plate spline-deformation grids (split into low, average, and high fighting success, as per the original study), again magnified by three times for visibility purposes.  These deformation grids will be accompanied by composite visualisations created in tpsSuper (Version 2.05).  In an extension of the original study, we will visualise the shape data on perceived fighting ability in the entire sample, and then specifically for the heavyweight fighters, using thin-plate
