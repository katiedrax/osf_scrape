intense discussions in most Western societies in recent years.

One important theoretical approach, the one of relative deprivation theory, has recently been complemented by the concept of relative gratification: some studies show that not only relative deprivation, but also the feeling of relative gratification can lead to more prejudice. This non-linear, v-shaped relationship between relative status and prejudice is supposed to be replicated in this study drawing on an experiment by Jetten, Mols and Postmes (2015) that manipulates the feeling of relative deprivation/gratification by randomly assigning participants to an income group in a fictitious society and measuring their attitudes towards immigrants afterwards. Furthermore, the potential moderating effects of both personality-related concepts such as social dominance orientation and belief in a just world, as well as the context-related factor perception of economic instability will be examined.

Explaining negative attitudes and prejudice against immigrants has long been an aim of social psychological research. One important theoretical approach, the one of relative deprivation theory, has recently been complemented by the concept of relative gratification: some studies show that not only relative deprivation, but also the feeling of relative gratification can lead to more prejudice. This non-linear, v-shaped relationship between relative status and prejudice is supposed to be replicated in this study drawing on an experiment by Jetten, Mols and Postmes (2015) that manipulates the feeling of relative deprivation/gratification by randomly assigning participants to an income group in a fictitious society and measuring their attitudes towards immigrants afterwards. Furthermore, the potential moderating effects of both personality-related concepts such as social dominance orientation and belief in a just world, as well as the context-related factor perception of economic instability will be examined. A potential underlying mediation of the effect of relative status on negative attitudes through the fear for the status of the own group will be investigated.

This proposed study received ethical approval from the Psychology Research Ethics Committee.  \n\nProcedure: In Phase 1, all participants will complete a pre-test which will require them to fill out attitude scales towards the target topic (vaccines) and the related topics (e.g. GMO, abortion). Then, participants will be randomly assigned to either the control condition or the inoculation condition. Whilst the control condition will be exposed to a neutral and unrelated article, participants in the inoculation condition will be exposed to a paragraph (1) warning about common arguments against vaccine safety and efficacy (2) and providing counterarguments against these arguments. All participants will then be asked to complete the Post-treatment measures (Threat, perceived resistance, confidence, perceived medical consensus + risk, public support). \n\nAfter a 1 week delay, all participants will be recontacted to take part in Phase 2 of the study. Here, all participants will be presented with one of two attack messages addressing the target topic (vaccines). Specifically, participants will either read an attack message addressing the same arguments as the inoculation message in Phase 1 (attack_same) or an attack message that uses different arguments (attack_diff). After exposure to either attack_target message, all participants will be exposed to 4 attack messages on the related topics (GMO, abortion, blood donations, AV).
