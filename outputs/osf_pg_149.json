Especially in the context of parenting this \u201cfor better and for worse\u201d effect has found support, where it has been shown that due to individual differences such as certain genetic variations or temperament traits, some children are more sensitive to both positive and negative (dysfunctional) parenting than others (Bakermans-Kranenburg and Van IJzendoorn 2015; Slagt et al. 2017). Research indicates that such individual differences may be rooted in so-called endophenotypes, which are genetically informed, stable biobehavioral traits (Wong, Fox, Ng, &amp; Lee, 2011). Endophenotypes are relevant to differential susceptibility research because they might function as biological markers (e.g. heart rate or skin conductance) that are simpler to detect than genetic sequences (APA, 2019). Indeed, it has been advocated for by The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to implement endophenotypes in research as means to bridge genetic complexity and heterogeneity underlying psychiatric disorders (Insel and Cuthbert, 2009).\n          In the child development literature, the search for endophenotypes started with research showing that negative emotionality may moderate the effect of positive and negative parenting on behavioral development in a \u201cfor better and for worse\u201d manner (Kochanska, 1993; Belsky, Hsieh, &amp; Crnic, 1998; Feldman, Greenbaum, &amp; Yirmiya, 1999). High negative emotionality can be characterized by a greater propensity to experience or to react with negative emotions (Kann et al., 2017) and has consistently been associated with increased risk to develop externalizing behavior (e.g. e.g. van den Akker, 2010, Eisenberg et al., 2009; Vitaro, Barker, Boivin, Brendgen, &amp; Tremblay, 2006). Current research indicates that dimensions of temperament, such as negative emotionality, are partly genetically informed and partly shaped by children\u2019s experiences with parenting (Lipscomb et al., 2012). Indeed, from reviewed literature, negative emotionality explains significant variance in child developmental outcomes to rearing experiences (for a meta-analysis see Slagt, 2016; Belsky, 2005). Yet, it remains unclear whether this variance was the result of parenting effects rather than children\u2019s differences in susceptibility and how negative emotionality is related to sensitivity to both negative and positive environments. Lastly, it also remained a question of how negative emotionality may be influenced by endophenotypes that are closely related to biologically pathways, such as heightened physiological reactivity (e.g. heart rate, skin conductance) or cognitive biases (e.g. attentional bias). The advantage of such biological markers is that, because they are more proximal to genetic susceptibility, they might serve as useful susceptibility measures to explain variance in behavioral development. As such, endophenotypical markers might form a bridge between genes and behavior and may therefore be informative as indicators of children\u2019s behavioral development in the context of positive or negative parenting. In the present study, we examined the associations between negative parenting and child externalizing behavior and positive parenting and child empathy. We chose child empathy as an outcome variable of positive behavioral development, as literature consistently demonstrates the beneficial effects of positive parenting on the development of empathy in children (for a recent meta-analysis see Boele et al., 2019).\n        To determine whether a certain endophenotype indeed functions as a differential susceptibility marker (making children more reactive to both negative and positive environmental influences), we would expect to find a small subgroup of children that would display high reactivity on the assessed endophenotype (e.g. increased skin conductance responses) to positive and negative stimuli, separated from a larger group with lower reactivity to both. That is because prior literature on differential susceptibility, and related concepts such as \u201cbiological sensitivity to context\u201d (Ellis &amp; Boyce, 2008; Boyce &amp; Ellis, 2005) and \u201csensory processing sensitivity\u201d (Aron, Aron, &amp; Jagiellowicz, 2012; Aron &amp; Aron, 1997), indicates that only a minority of the population is highly sensitive. Empirical studies examining traits related to heightened sensitivity to environmental influences \u2013such as certain genetic variants (Belsky &amp; Pluess, 2013, 2009), negative emotionality (Slagt, Dubas, Ellis, Van Aken, &amp; Dekovi\u0107, 2019), reactivity in certain physiological and neurological pathways (Kagan, 2002), or heightened sensory processing sensitivity (Jagiellowicz et al., 2011; Aron &amp; Aron, 1997; Aron, Aron, &amp; Jagiellowics, 2012; Borries, 2012; Suomi, 1997)\u2013 indicate that these traits have relatively low population frequencies of 10-35 %. \n        Recent studies specifically targeted to examine sensitivity groups in children and adolescents support this low population frequency (e.g. Lionetti et al. 2018; Slagt et al., 2019; Wolf, van Doorn, &amp; Weissing, 2008). For example, empirical research suggest that only a minority of the population might be highly reactive due to a negative frequency dependence, meaning that heightened reactivity is not beneficial anymore if the majority of the population would have it (Wolf et al., 2008). This is in line with a recent study on kindergarteners that has found two groups of sensitivity: next to a larger group of average reactive children to positive and negative emotions of their mother (87%), there was a smaller highly reactive group (13%) that emerged through latent class analyses, indicating a \u201cfor better and for worse\u2019\u2019 (differential susceptibility) pattern (Slagt et al., 2019). Recently, there has also been empirical evidence which supports the existence of three, rather than two sensitivity groups. For example, in the study by Lionetti and colleagues (2018) latent class analyses revealed that next to a group of highly sensitive adults (31 %), there was also a medium sensitivity group (40 %), and a low sensitivity group (29 %). These findings are in line with other research on children and adolescents aged 8-19 years in a total sample size of N= 3,581, where latent class analysis also revealed three groups of low (approx. 25\u201335%), medium (approx. 41\u201347%), and high (20\u201335%) (Pluess et al., 2018). \n         However, it is important to note that these studies which found three subgroups assessed individuals sensitivity with a self-report measure of general environmental sensitivity (Highly Sensitive Person measure, Aron &amp; Aron, 1997), which markedly differs from observational measures of children\u2019s reactivity to social situations such as parenting, as used in the research by Slagt et al. (2019). Furthermore, those studies did not differentiate between sensitivity to positive versus negative environmental stimuli, as was done by Slagt et al. (2019) by assessing reactivity to positive and negative parenting separately. Combining assessments of positive and negative stimuli (as is done in the Highly Sensitive Person measure, for example) could mask variability which might otherwise be found for positive and negative stimuli individually. In light of this, the authors of the present study conclude that the findings by Slagt et al. (2019) of two sensitivity groups (one small highly reactive group, and one larger average reactive group) might be most informative in guiding the present study\u2019s hypotheses on children\u2019s differential susceptibility to parenting. Therefore, in the present study, we would expect to find a small subgroup, approximately 10-35 % of the study\u2019s sample size, of highly sensitive children, and a larger group of less sensitive children. \n\nPhysiological Endophenotypes\n \tIn the present study we aim to assess the physiological endophenotypes of heart rate variability and skin conductance.\n         Skin conductance. The autonomic nervous system consists of two branches, the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). In situations of stress, the PNS is inhibited due to a reduction in vagal influence on the sino-atrialnode, enabling a fight-or-flight modus to cope with the challenge (Porges, 2007). Electrodermal activity (EDA), controlled by the SNS, is a measure of autonomic arousal, describing autonomic changes in the electrical potential of the sweat glands at the skin surface (Dawson, Schell, Filion, 2007; Critchley, 2002). EDA is most widely assessed with measures of skin conductance. Increases in skin conductance reflect increased autonomic arousal due to increased activation of the SNS (Dawson et al., 2007; Critchley, 2002). There are two types of skin conductance: phasic skin conductance, which are rapidly changing elements of the electrical signal, and are referred to as skin conductance responses (SCR). In the lab, SCR can be assessed in response to a specific stimuli of a short time window (~ 5 seconds), where a temporary spike in the skin conductance amplitude is expected, also known as event-related SCR (ER-SCR). The other measure is tonic skin conductance, which reflects the basal slow changing, constantly running background skin conductance levels in an individual, and is referred to as skin conductance level (SCL). In the lab, SCL is assessed to longer-lasting stimuli (e.g. a film clip of 1-2 minutes), which allow to capture the slower moving SCL changes. \n \tIn general, it has been found that SCR and SCL increase with exposure to unpleasant but also pleasant stimuli. As such, studies show that there is an increase of skin conductance to both positive and negative film clips and pictures of human interactions and faces (SCR: e.g. Balconi, Vanutelli, &amp; Finocchiaro, 2014; Bradley, Codispoti, Cuthbert, &amp; Lang, 2001; Lang, Greenwald, Bradley, &amp; Hamm, 1993; SCL-changes: e.g. Bos, Jentgens, Beckers, &amp; Kindt, 2013; Gomez, Zimmermann, Guttormsen-Sch\u00e4r, &amp; Danuser, 2005). Specifically, these increases in skin conductance to aversive as well as appetitive contexts have been shown to be the highest where subjects reported the strongest emotional arousal (Lang et al., 1993; Bradley &amp; Lang, 2000; Miller, Patrick, &amp; Levenston, 2002). Furthermore, the literature also shows that skin conductance increases when emotional pictures (whether pleasant or unpleasant) are viewed compared to neutral pictures (Lang et al., 1993). It needs to be noted however that only one of the above-named studies have been conducted on children with parenting-related stimuli (Balconi et al., 2014: mean age = 8.75 years; range 6-11 years). Even though literature indicates that psychophysiological activation to emotional stimuli in children are similar to those in adults (Bernat, Cadwallader, Seo, Vizueta, &amp; Patrick, 2011; McManis, Bradley, Berg, Cuthbert, Lang; 2001), there is a lack of research where skin conductance measures were assessed in children in the context of positive and negative parenting-related stimuli. \n \tThese findings indicate that skin conductance could potentially represent a differential susceptibility endophenotype that may indicate whether certain children would show increased sensitivity to both positive and negative environmental influences, such as parenting. In order to examine skin conductance as a differential susceptibility factor, skin conductance should be investigated as a moderator, on the association between e.g. negative parenting and negative child behavior, and on the association between positive parenting and positive child behavior. However, there are only a few studies until now that have even investigated skin conductance as a moderator; and crucially those only assessed the association between negative parenting-related stimuli and child externalizing behavior (e.g. Kochanska, Brock, Chen, Aksan, &amp; Anderson, 2015; El-Sheikh, Keller, &amp; Erath, 2007), thus missing an assessment of the \u201cfor-better\u201d side of the differential susceptibility spectrum. To address this gap in the literature, we aim to assess skin conductance in terms of SCR and SCL-changes to both negative and positive (parenting) stimuli as moderators in the associations between negative parenting and child externalizing parenting, and positive parenting and child empathy behavior. \n         Heart rate variability. Whereas electrodermal activity can inform us about the arousal to stimuli in one\u2019s environment, heart rate variability has been proposed as an index of emotion regulation (for reviews see El Sheik &amp; Erath, 2011; Beauchaine, Gatzke-Kopp, &amp; Mead, 2007; Appelhans &amp; Luecken, 2006). Heart rate variability (HRV) is a measure of flexibility of the continuous interplay between the SNS and PNS branch of the ANS. The more flexible this system is to adapt to changes in physical and emotional states, the better the ability to regulate emotions. HRV is of interest to our present study as it provides a stable measure of autonomic flexibility to positive and negative social contexts (Appelhans &amp; Luecken, 2006; Shahrestani, Stewart, Quintana, Hickie, &amp; Guastell, 2015). Specifically, HRV appears to reflect regulation of emotions in both positive, supportive social interactions and stressful social situations (for a meta-analysis, see Shahrestani et al, 2015; Shahrestani, Stewart, Quintana, Hickie, &amp; Guastella, 2014). In averse situations, this is reflected in the PNS winding down and the SNS taking over, ready to cope with the challenge, resulting in a decline in HRV. Greater HRV declines in response to stressful situations such as negative social interactions as such reflect greater regulation of affective arousal and emotion regulation to actively cope with the stressor (Porges, 2011). Most empirical and meta-analytical research supports that HRV declines in children during a challenging situation, relative to baseline levels (e.g. Porges, 2003, 2007, 2011; Shahrestani et al., 2014; Shahrestani et al, 2015). For example, recent meta-analytical evidence (Shahrestani et al., 2014) shows that in children of 0 to 12 years old, HRV decreased in response to socially stressful tasks (e.g. strange situation or still face paradigm).\n         In regards to positive social situations, theories such as the polyvagal theory hold that an increase in HRV facilitates social interactions (Porges, 2007, 2011) and refines social skills in dyadic interaction contexts (Appelhans &amp; Luecken, 2006). This is in line with research which shows that HRV increases when positive emotions such as cheerfulness and calmness are experienced (Geisler, Vennewald, Kubiak, &amp; Weber, 2010) and that increases in HRV are associated with positive trait emotionality (Oveis, Cohen, Gruber, Shiota, &amp; Haidt, 2009). Furthermore, other studies show a significant increase in HRV in children when they were reunited with their parents (Willemen, Goossens, Koot, &amp; Schuengel, 2008), or after the administration of oxytocin \u2013the social bonding hormone\u2013 facilitating social approach-related behavior (Kemp et al., 2012). \n         Recent meta-analytical evidence reveals that there were no significant changes in HRV relative to baseline HRV levels in tasks of social engagement, but that HRV increased in children when parents and child reunited (social engagement task) after a social disengagement task (strange situation paradigm) (Shahrestani et al., 2014). Another meta-analysis, however, showed that there was no increase in HRV to positive social interactions (Shahrestani, Stewart, Quintana, Hickie, &amp; Guastella, 2015). This meta-analysis however included only four studies, that had stimuli of which it seems questionable that they can be conceptualized as resembling true positive social interactions (e.g. discussion of an upsetting film). Thus, we come to conclude that no clear conclusions regarding HRV change to positive social situations can be drawn from this meta-analysis. In line with aforementioned literature and theories supporting an increase in HRV in response to positive social situations and emotions, we expect to find that children\u2019s HRV increases in response to positive parenting-related stimuli in the present study.\n\tPrior literature examined HRV as a moderator in the association between an aversive family environment and child externalizing behavior (e.g. for a review see El-Sheikh Erath, 2011). Specifically, these studies assessed the role of HRV-changes in children\u2019s responses to parental conflict (simulated by audiotaped interadult arguments) (e.g. El-Sheikh, Harger, &amp; Whitson, 2001; El-Sheikh, 2011), negative coparenting and family processes (Leary &amp; Katz, 2004), marital conflict (for a review see Whitson &amp; El-Sheikh, 2003; Katz &amp; Gottman, 1995; El-Sheikh &amp; Whitson, 2006; Katz &amp; Gottman, 1997), and child maltreatment (Gordis, Feres, Olezeski, Rabkin, &amp; Trickett, 2010) in their development of children\u2019s externalizing behavior. These studies claim to have found support for differential susceptibility, by demonstrating that for children with less HRV-decline in response to an aversive parenting/family environment there were stronger associations between the aversive family environment and later externalizing behavior (\u2018for-worse\u2019 effect) and for those with greater HRV-decline these associations were less strong. Specifically, the decrease in strength of the association was conceptualized by the authors as support for the \u201cfor-better\u201d end of the differential susceptibility spectrum, as a \u201cbuffering\u201d effect to environmental adversity. However, these studies lack a complete assessment of differential susceptibility, which could be addressed by providing a true \u201cfor-better\u201d measure, where e.g. the effect of HRV-changes in response to positive parenting stimuli on the association between positive parenting and positive child behavior outcomes is assessed in addition to the \u201cfor-worse\u201d measure. \n \tLastly, these studies have been primarily conducted on children between the ages of 7-12, which calls for more research in the group of preschoolers (~ 4-6 year olds), where parenting as an environmental influence and thus differential susceptibility effects may be the most prevalent. To complement existing literature, we aim to assess changes in HRV to both negative and positive parenting film clips as moderators in the respective associations of negative parenting and child externalizing behavior and positive parenting and child empathy outcomes in a sample of 4-6 year old children.\n\tCognitive bias. Accumulating literature demonstrates that children, depending on their genetic or physiological susceptibility, differ in their attentional processing of social cues (for a review see Fox &amp; Beever, 2016). For example, in a study by Fox and colleagues (2011), participants were assigned to either a positive or negative attentional bias modification (ABM) procedure. Results showed that following the ABM procedure, individuals with the SS-allelic variant displayed greater attentional bias to both positive and negative affective pictures. The CogBIAS hypothesis was proposed to describe such a phenomenon that early negative or positive environmental events in combination with certain genetic variants may enhance sensitivity to the environment by the formation of \u2018toxic\u2019 or \u2018enhancing\u2019 cognitive biases, which in turn direct sensitivity to future experiences and thereby have the potential to shape positive and negative developmental trajectories (Fox &amp; Beever, 2016).   \n \tWhereas a few studies indicate support for such a hypothesis (Fox, Zougkou, Ridgewell, &amp; Garner, 2011; Miu, Vulturar, Chis, Ungureanu, &amp; Gross, 2013; Kuepper et al., 2012; Osinsky, Hennig, Losch, Alexander, &amp; MacLeod), there is a lack of research which tests explicitly both negative attentional bias as a moderator in the associations between a negative parenting environment and a negative child developmental outcome, and positive attentional bias in the association between positive parenting and a positive child developmental outcome. We aim to close this gap in literature by testing this respective differential susceptibility research question in the present study in the associations between negative parenting and child externalizing behavior and positive parenting and child empathy. \n \tFurthermore, it is also important to recognize that in the attentional bias literature, a distinction is made between attentional engagement and attentional disengagement as two separate, integrative components of attentional bias (Cisler, Bacon, &amp; Williams, 2009; Fox, Russo, &amp; Dutton, 2002; Fox, Russo, Bowles, &amp; Dutton, 2001; Koster Crombez, Verschuere, De Houwer, 2004). Attentional engagement describes the relative ease or speed with which attention is captured by a stimuli, whereas difficulty in attentional disengagement describes the degree by which shifting attention from one stimuli to another is impaired (Cisler &amp; Koster, 2010). Both of these components have shown to play important roles in shaping attentional bias (for a review see Cisler &amp; Koster, 2010). In the present study we utilize a modified version of the Posner (1980) exogenous cuing task (see Koster, De Raedt, Goeleven, Franck, &amp; Crombez, 2005; Waters, Mogg, Bradley, &amp; Pine, 2008), which allows us to distinguish between these two components (Cisler &amp; Koster, 2010).\t\n \tAlso worth noting is that is has been subject of debate of whether cognitive bias is state- or trait-dependent, in which the former would counter the idea of an endophenotype, which by definition is \u201ca quantitative biological trait that is reliable in reflecting the function of a discrete biological system and is reasonably heritable (Wong, Fox, Ng, &amp; Lee, 2011). However, recent research indicates that attentional bias may be directly related to early biologically based temperamental dispositions. For example, a recent longitudinal study showed a concurrent link between attentional bias and anxiety, but crucially only for children who demonstrated early behavioral inhibition (BI) (White et al., 2017). BI is a biologically based temperamental disposition characterized by high levels of fearfulness and withdrawn reactions to ambiguous stimuli in years of early childhood (Fox, Henderson, Marshall, Nichols, &amp; Ghera, 2005). This is furthermore in line with recent research that shows that only for children with high levels of BI, there were stable patterns of attentional bias across tasks (Morales, Taber\u2010Thomas, &amp; P\u00e9rez\u2010Edgar, 2017). As such, recent literature supports the notion that attentional bias may also function as an endophenotypical trait, as it may be predetermined by- or directly related to biologically based early temperamental dispositions. However, further research is necessary to elucidate the role of cognitive bias as an endophenotypical susceptibility factor, specifically in the relationship between parenting and child externalizing behavior.\n\nPresent Study\n               In the present study we aim to investigate children\u2019s differential susceptibility to parenting. We aim to do this by examining the five endophenotypes SCR, SCL-change, HRV-change, attentional disengagement and attentional engagement as moderators in the association between negative parenting and child externalizing behavior, and in the association between positive parenting and child empathy (research aim 1). Furthermore, we aim to examine whether there is a subset of children that reacts strongly to both negative and positive (parenting) stimuli (research aim 2).\n\tResearch aim 1. We aim to test whether the endophenotypes SCR, SCL-change, HRV-change, attentional disengagement and attentional engagement functioned as moderators in the associations between positive parenting and child empathy (\u2018\u2019for-better\u2019\u2019 end of differential susceptibility spectrum), and negative parenting and child externalizing behavior (\u201cfor-worse\u2019\u2019 end of differential susceptibility spectrum). The physiological endophenotypes we will examine are skin conductance responses (SCR), skin conductance level changes (SCL-changes), and heart rate variability changes (HRV-changes), which we assessed in response to both negative and positive dynamic face expressions (SCR) and negative and positive parenting film clips (SCL-changes and HRV-changes, respectively). The two cognitive endophenotypes we will examine are attentional engagement and attentional disengagement to negative and positive parenting stimuli.\n \tResearch aim 2. The second aim is to assess whether a subset of children reacted strongly to both negative and positive (parenting) stimuli (i.e., a differentially reactive group), as assessed by the five endophenotype measures of SCR, SCL-change, HRV-change, attentional disengagement and attentional engagement to both negative and positive (parenting) stimuli. To answer this question, a hierarchical cluster analysis method (Ward\u2019s linkage clustering) will be conducted, where each case begins as its own cluster and cases are merged until merging into one cluster has occurred (one-cluster solution). In line with prior research that found a subgroup of highly reactive versus a larger group of average reactive children to positive and negative emotions of their mother (Slagt et al., 2019), a two-cluster solution will be examined to see if there is a relatively small cluster of children who responded strongly to both the negative and positive (parenting) cues differentiated from another cluster. In line with previous empirical evidence, we expected that the smaller cluster will comprise between 10-35 % of the present study\u2019s sample (Lionetti et al. 2018; Slagt et al., 2019; Wolf, van Doorn, &amp; Weissing, 2008; Aron, Aron, &amp; Jagiellowics, 2012).\n\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "\nHypotheses are directional. \n\n       Hypotheses research aim 1: We hypothesize that the association between negative parenting and child externalizing behavior will be stronger for children with 1) a greater SCR to negative dynamic face expressions, 2a) greater SCL-increase to a negative parenting film clip, 3a) less HRV-decline to a negative parenting film clip, and 4a) greater attentional engagement to- and weaker disengagement from negative parenting stimuli.

Additionally, flyers of the study were handed out on the street to parents in front of schools and spread throughout the city of Amsterdam in public places. The invitation consisted of a short description of the study and a link to a website, where parents could sign up to participate. Parent and child were then invited to the University of Amsterdam Family Lab. There were no inclusion or exclusion criteria for participation, except that the envisioned criteria regarding age of participating children was 6 to 8 years old.\n\nTimeline: The first participant was recruited on April 18th 2018, and the last participant took part in the study on February 21st 2019.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "OSF - Power Analysis.docx"}, "nodeId": "9j8uk", "sha256": "5d099d6636e3389a65a7d85d4d00eb3f5acf7a74a5365834f5c5757c8cbeab6e", "viewUrl": "/project/5wxsu/files/osfstorage/5e78ef044a60a506bcbb58e3/", "selectedFileName": "OSF - Power Analysis.docx"}], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "We collected data from 26 children and 26 parents.

PROCESS estimates the coefficients of a model using OLS regression for continuous outcomes (Hayes, 2012). The negative parenting model will assess the relationship between negative parenting and child externalizing behavior, and the positive parenting model will assess the relationship between positive parenting and child empathy. To answer the primary research question of whether these associations will each be moderated by the examined endophenotypes (SCR, SCL-change, HRV-change, attentional engagement and disengagement), separate moderation analyses will be conducted for each of the five moderators using the Hayes\u2019 PROCESS macro. Specifically, for the moderation of the negative parenting model, the endophenotypes measured in response to the negative, \u201cfor-worse\u201d(parenting) stimuli will be implemented as moderators: SCR to the negative dynamic face expressions, SCL-changes and HRV-changes to the negative parenting film clips, attentional engagement and disengagement to the negative parenting photos. Similarly,, for the positive parenting model, the endophenotypes were measured in response to the positive, \u201dfor-better\u201d (parenting) stimuli and will be implemented as moderators: SCR to the positive dynamic face expressions, SCL-changes and HRV-changes to the positive parenting film clips, attentional engagement and disengagement to the positive parenting photos. Thus, five moderation analyses will be run with the endophenotype measures to negative (parenting) stimuli as moderators in the association between negative parenting and child externalizing behavior (assessing the \u201cfor-worse\u201d end of the differential susceptibility spectrum), and five moderation analyses will be run with the endophenotype measures to positive (parenting) stimuli as moderators in the association between positive parenting and child empathy (\u201cfor-better\u201d end of the differential susceptibility spectrum). All regression and moderation analyses will be run with sex of the child as a covariate.\nWe will generate 95 % bias-corrected confidence intervals using 5,000 bootstrap samples using ordinary least squares estimation (Hayes, 2012). Variables will be centered on their mean prior to analyses within the Hayes macro (Hayes, 2012; 2017). If the analyses will reveal a significant interaction, regions of significance will be generated with the Johnson-Neyman technique (see e.g., Bauer &amp; Curran, 2005; Hayes &amp; Matthes, 2009).\n \nStatistical approach research aim 2: To investigate whether a subset of children reacted strongly to both negative and positive (parenting) stimuli (i.e., a highly reactive group), five hierarchical cluster analyses will be conducted, one for each endophenotype: SCR, SCL-change, HRV-change, attentional engagement, attentional disengagement. To identify whether there might be homogenous groups of cases that indicate a differential susceptibility pattern we will conduct five cluster analyses in total with each following features together: 1) SCR to positive faces and SCR to negative faces, 2) SCL-change to positive parenting film clip and SCL-change to negative parenting film clip, 3) HRV-change to positive parenting film clip and HRV-change to negative parenting film clip, 4) attentional engagement to positive faces and attentional engagement to negative faces, and 5) attentional disengagement to positive faces and attentional disengagement to negative faces. We will use a hierarchical cluster analysis method, specifically Ward\u2019s linkage clustering with the squared Euclidean distances as the distancing metric (measure of similarity) (e.g. Dolnicar, 2002; Doron, Trouillet, Maneveau, Neveu, &amp; Ninot, 2014). We examined the two-cluster solution to see if there was a relatively small cluster of children, comprising between 10-35 % of the present study\u2019s sample, who responded strongly to both the negative and positive (parenting) cues differentiated from another cluster. To visualize the two clusters, scatterplots for measures of SCR, SCL-change, HRV-change, attentional engagement and attentional disengagement to the negative stimuli (y-axis) and positive stimuli (x-axis) were generated in heat-map style, with data points coded in two colors according to cluster-membership. \n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "If data shows skewness or kurtosis, a transformation will be applied to the dependent variable. The type of transformation will depend on two criteria: 1) whether the data is positively or negatively skewed, and 2) whether it is moderately, strongly, or extremely skewed. For the assumption of linearity of regression standardized residuals, the dependent variable will be transformed if the residuals do not roughly follow the normality line of the P-P plot.\nVariables will be centered on their mean prior to analyses within the Hayes macro (Hayes, 2012).\n"}, "q21": {"extra": [], "value": "The standard p-value of .05 will be used as a criterion for statistical significance in the moderation analyses.

We used the method of dealing with outliers as stated in Tabachnick &amp; Fidell (2013, p.112), which states that an option for univariate outliers is to: \u201cto change the score(s) on the variable(s) for the outlying case(s) so that they are deviant, but not as deviant as they were. For instance, assign the outlying case(s) a raw score on the offending variable that is one unit larger (or smaller) than the next most extreme score in the distribution. Because measurement of variables is some-times rather arbitrary anyway, this is often an attractive alternative to reduce the impact of a univariate outlier\u201d (Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2013). Thus, outliers will be assigned with values one unit smaller than the largest non-outlier score on the measured variable of that specific participant (see Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2013, p. 112; Zeegers et al., 2018). If the smallest one-unit (0.01) increase to the next most extreme score still will result in standardized values of or below 3, then the analysis will be run once with the unaltered and once with the altered data. If this outlier imputation will still result in standardized values above, then the unaltered data will be used for analysis (Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2013). \n\nData exclusion for data on the information processing task:\nOutliers will be classified as reaction times of standardized values greater than 3 of a participants individual mean reaction time or reaction times under 200 ms and will be excluded from analysis (e.g. Waters et al., 2008; Koster, 2005). Invalid trials will be trials with either incorrect responses, or trials where no response was made within the valid 3000 ms reaction time window, and will be excluded from analysis (e.g. Waters et al., 2008; Koster, 2005). As a quality check that participants sustained their attention throughout the task and were actively engaged in participation of the paradigm, participants who had over 25 % of trials missing due to outliers and/or invalid responses will be excluded from analysis (Langner &amp; Eickhoff, 2013; Bradley, Mogg, Falla, &amp; Hamilton, 1998).\n\n"}, "q23": {"extra": [], "value": "Mean scores were created from all available data points on a respective variable."}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "n.a."}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "References:\n\n\nAbaied, J.

Especially in the context of parenting this \u201cfor better and for worse\u201d effect has found support, where it has been shown that due to individual differences such as certain genetic variations or temperament traits, some children are more sensitive to both positive and negative (dysfunctional) parenting than others (Bakermans-Kranenburg and Van IJzendoorn 2015; Slagt et al. 2017). Research indicates that such individual differences may be rooted in so-called endophenotypes, which are genetically informed, stable biobehavioral traits (Wong, Fox, Ng, &amp; Lee, 2011). Endophenotypes are relevant to differential susceptibility research because they might function as biological markers (e.g. heart rate or skin conductance) that are simpler to detect than genetic sequences (APA, 2019). Indeed, it has been advocated for by The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to implement endophenotypes in research as means to bridge genetic complexity and heterogeneity underlying psychiatric disorders (Insel and Cuthbert, 2009).\n          In the child development literature, the search for endophenotypes started with research showing that negative emotionality may moderate the effect of positive and negative parenting on behavioral development in a \u201cfor better and for worse\u201d manner (Kochanska, 1993; Belsky, Hsieh, &amp; Crnic, 1998; Feldman, Greenbaum, &amp; Yirmiya, 1999). High negative emotionality can be characterized by a greater propensity to experience or to react with negative emotions (Kann et al., 2017) and has consistently been associated with increased risk to develop externalizing behavior (e.g. e.g. van den Akker, 2010, Eisenberg et al., 2009; Vitaro, Barker, Boivin, Brendgen, &amp; Tremblay, 2006). Current research indicates that dimensions of temperament, such as negative emotionality, are partly genetically informed and partly shaped by children\u2019s experiences with parenting (Lipscomb et al., 2012). Indeed, from reviewed literature, negative emotionality explains significant variance in child developmental outcomes to rearing experiences (for a meta-analysis see Slagt, 2016; Belsky, 2005). Yet, it remains unclear whether this variance was the result of parenting effects rather than children\u2019s differences in susceptibility and how negative emotionality is related to sensitivity to both negative and positive environments. Lastly, it also remained a question of how negative emotionality may be influenced by endophenotypes that are closely related to biologically pathways, such as heightened physiological reactivity (e.g. heart rate, skin conductance) or cognitive biases (e.g. attentional bias). The advantage of such biological markers is that, because they are more proximal to genetic susceptibility, they might serve as useful susceptibility measures to explain variance in behavioral development. As such, endophenotypical markers might form a bridge between genes and behavior and may therefore be informative as indicators of children\u2019s behavioral development in the context of positive or negative parenting. In the present study, we examined the associations between negative parenting and child externalizing behavior and positive parenting and child empathy. We chose child empathy as an outcome variable of positive behavioral development, as literature consistently demonstrates the beneficial effects of positive parenting on the development of empathy in children (for a recent meta-analysis see Boele et al., 2019).\n        To determine whether a certain endophenotype indeed functions as a differential susceptibility marker (making children more reactive to both negative and positive environmental influences), we would expect to find a small subgroup of children that would display high reactivity on the assessed endophenotype (e.g. increased skin conductance responses) to positive and negative stimuli, separated from a larger group with lower reactivity to both. That is because prior literature on differential susceptibility, and related concepts such as \u201cbiological sensitivity to context\u201d (Ellis &amp; Boyce, 2008; Boyce &amp; Ellis, 2005) and \u201csensory processing sensitivity\u201d (Aron, Aron, &amp; Jagiellowicz, 2012; Aron &amp; Aron, 1997), indicates that only a minority of the population is highly sensitive. Empirical studies examining traits related to heightened sensitivity to environmental influences \u2013such as certain genetic variants (Belsky &amp; Pluess, 2013, 2009), negative emotionality (Slagt, Dubas, Ellis, Van Aken, &amp; Dekovi\u0107, 2019), reactivity in certain physiological and neurological pathways (Kagan, 2002), or heightened sensory processing sensitivity (Jagiellowicz et al., 2011; Aron &amp; Aron, 1997; Aron, Aron, &amp; Jagiellowics, 2012; Borries, 2012; Suomi, 1997)\u2013 indicate that these traits have relatively low population frequencies of 10-35 %. \n        Recent studies specifically targeted to examine sensitivity groups in children and adolescents support this low population frequency (e.g. Lionetti et al. 2018; Slagt et al., 2019; Wolf, van Doorn, &amp; Weissing, 2008). For example, empirical research suggest that only a minority of the population might be highly reactive due to a negative frequency dependence, meaning that heightened reactivity is not beneficial anymore if the majority of the population would have it (Wolf et al., 2008). This is in line with a recent study on kindergarteners that has found two groups of sensitivity: next to a larger group of average reactive children to positive and negative emotions of their mother (87%), there was a smaller highly reactive group (13%) that emerged through latent class analyses, indicating a \u201cfor better and for worse\u2019\u2019 (differential susceptibility) pattern (Slagt et al., 2019). Recently, there has also been empirical evidence which supports the existence of three, rather than two sensitivity groups. For example, in the study by Lionetti and colleagues (2018) latent class analyses revealed that next to a group of highly sensitive adults (31 %), there was also a medium sensitivity group (40 %), and a low sensitivity group (29 %). These findings are in line with other research on children and adolescents aged 8-19 years in a total sample size of N= 3,581, where latent class analysis also revealed three groups of low (approx. 25\u201335%), medium (approx. 41\u201347%), and high (20\u201335%) (Pluess et al., 2018). \n         However, it is important to note that these studies which found three subgroups assessed individuals sensitivity with a self-report measure of general environmental sensitivity (Highly Sensitive Person measure, Aron &amp; Aron, 1997), which markedly differs from observational measures of children\u2019s reactivity to social situations such as parenting, as used in the research by Slagt et al. (2019). Furthermore, those studies did not differentiate between sensitivity to positive versus negative environmental stimuli, as was done by Slagt et al. (2019) by assessing reactivity to positive and negative parenting separately. Combining assessments of positive and negative stimuli (as is done in the Highly Sensitive Person measure, for example) could mask variability which might otherwise be found for positive and negative stimuli individually. In light of this, the authors of the present study conclude that the findings by Slagt et al. (2019) of two sensitivity groups (one small highly reactive group, and one larger average reactive group) might be most informative in guiding the present study\u2019s hypotheses on children\u2019s differential susceptibility to parenting. Therefore, in the present study, we would expect to find a small subgroup, approximately 10-35 % of the study\u2019s sample size, of highly sensitive children, and a larger group of less sensitive children. \n\nPhysiological Endophenotypes\n \tIn the present study we aim to assess the physiological endophenotypes of heart rate variability and skin conductance.\n         Skin conductance. The autonomic nervous system consists of two branches, the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). In situations of stress, the PNS is inhibited due to a reduction in vagal influence on the sino-atrialnode, enabling a fight-or-flight modus to cope with the challenge (Porges, 2007). Electrodermal activity (EDA), controlled by the SNS, is a measure of autonomic arousal, describing autonomic changes in the electrical potential of the sweat glands at the skin surface (Dawson, Schell, Filion, 2007; Critchley, 2002). EDA is most widely assessed with measures of skin conductance. Increases in skin conductance reflect increased autonomic arousal due to increased activation of the SNS (Dawson et al., 2007; Critchley, 2002). There are two types of skin conductance: phasic skin conductance, which are rapidly changing elements of the electrical signal, and are referred to as skin conductance responses (SCR). In the lab, SCR can be assessed in response to a specific stimuli of a short time window (~ 5 seconds), where a temporary spike in the skin conductance amplitude is expected, also known as event-related SCR (ER-SCR). The other measure is tonic skin conductance, which reflects the basal slow changing, constantly running background skin conductance levels in an individual, and is referred to as skin conductance level (SCL). In the lab, SCL is assessed to longer-lasting stimuli (e.g. a film clip of 1-2 minutes), which allow to capture the slower moving SCL changes. \n \tIn general, it has been found that SCR and SCL increase with exposure to unpleasant but also pleasant stimuli. As such, studies show that there is an increase of skin conductance to both positive and negative film clips and pictures of human interactions and faces (SCR: e.g. Balconi, Vanutelli, &amp; Finocchiaro, 2014; Bradley, Codispoti, Cuthbert, &amp; Lang, 2001; Lang, Greenwald, Bradley, &amp; Hamm, 1993; SCL-changes: e.g. Bos, Jentgens, Beckers, &amp; Kindt, 2013; Gomez, Zimmermann, Guttormsen-Sch\u00e4r, &amp; Danuser, 2005). Specifically, these increases in skin conductance to aversive as well as appetitive contexts have been shown to be the highest where subjects reported the strongest emotional arousal (Lang et al., 1993; Bradley &amp; Lang, 2000; Miller, Patrick, &amp; Levenston, 2002). Furthermore, the literature also shows that skin conductance increases when emotional pictures (whether pleasant or unpleasant) are viewed compared to neutral pictures (Lang et al., 1993). It needs to be noted however that only one of the above-named studies have been conducted on children with parenting-related stimuli (Balconi et al., 2014: mean age = 8.75 years; range 6-11 years). Even though literature indicates that psychophysiological activation to emotional stimuli in children are similar to those in adults (Bernat, Cadwallader, Seo, Vizueta, &amp; Patrick, 2011; McManis, Bradley, Berg, Cuthbert, Lang; 2001), there is a lack of research where skin conductance measures were assessed in children in the context of positive and negative parenting-related stimuli. \n \tThese findings indicate that skin conductance could potentially represent a differential susceptibility endophenotype that may indicate whether certain children would show increased sensitivity to both positive and negative environmental influences, such as parenting. In order to examine skin conductance as a differential susceptibility factor, skin conductance should be investigated as a moderator, on the association between e.g. negative parenting and negative child behavior, and on the association between positive parenting and positive child behavior. However, there are only a few studies until now that have even investigated skin conductance as a moderator; and crucially those only assessed the association between negative parenting-related stimuli and child externalizing behavior (e.g. Kochanska, Brock, Chen, Aksan, &amp; Anderson, 2015; El-Sheikh, Keller, &amp; Erath, 2007), thus missing an assessment of the \u201cfor-better\u201d side of the differential susceptibility spectrum. To address this gap in the literature, we aim to assess skin conductance in terms of SCR and SCL-changes to both negative and positive (parenting) stimuli as moderators in the associations between negative parenting and child externalizing parenting, and positive parenting and child empathy behavior. \n         Heart rate variability. Whereas electrodermal activity can inform us about the arousal to stimuli in one\u2019s environment, heart rate variability has been proposed as an index of emotion regulation (for reviews see El Sheik &amp; Erath, 2011; Beauchaine, Gatzke-Kopp, &amp; Mead, 2007; Appelhans &amp; Luecken, 2006). Heart rate variability (HRV) is a measure of flexibility of the continuous interplay between the SNS and PNS branch of the ANS. The more flexible this system is to adapt to changes in physical and emotional states, the better the ability to regulate emotions. HRV is of interest to our present study as it provides a stable measure of autonomic flexibility to positive and negative social contexts (Appelhans &amp; Luecken, 2006; Shahrestani, Stewart, Quintana, Hickie, &amp; Guastell, 2015). Specifically, HRV appears to reflect regulation of emotions in both positive, supportive social interactions and stressful social situations (for a meta-analysis, see Shahrestani et al, 2015; Shahrestani, Stewart, Quintana, Hickie, &amp; Guastella, 2014). In averse situations, this is reflected in the PNS winding down and the SNS taking over, ready to cope with the challenge, resulting in a decline in HRV. Greater HRV declines in response to stressful situations such as negative social interactions as such reflect greater regulation of affective arousal and emotion regulation to actively cope with the stressor (Porges, 2011). Most empirical and meta-analytical research supports that HRV declines in children during a challenging situation, relative to baseline levels (e.g. Porges, 2003, 2007, 2011; Shahrestani et al., 2014; Shahrestani et al, 2015). For example, recent meta-analytical evidence (Shahrestani et al., 2014) shows that in children of 0 to 12 years old, HRV decreased in response to socially stressful tasks (e.g. strange situation or still face paradigm).\n         In regards to positive social situations, theories such as the polyvagal theory hold that an increase in HRV facilitates social interactions (Porges, 2007, 2011) and refines social skills in dyadic interaction contexts (Appelhans &amp; Luecken, 2006). This is in line with research which shows that HRV increases when positive emotions such as cheerfulness and calmness are experienced (Geisler, Vennewald, Kubiak, &amp; Weber, 2010) and that increases in HRV are associated with positive trait emotionality (Oveis, Cohen, Gruber, Shiota, &amp; Haidt, 2009). Furthermore, other studies show a significant increase in HRV in children when they were reunited with their parents (Willemen, Goossens, Koot, &amp; Schuengel, 2008), or after the administration of oxytocin \u2013the social bonding hormone\u2013 facilitating social approach-related behavior (Kemp et al., 2012). \n         Recent meta-analytical evidence reveals that there were no significant changes in HRV relative to baseline HRV levels in tasks of social engagement, but that HRV increased in children when parents and child reunited (social engagement task) after a social disengagement task (strange situation paradigm) (Shahrestani et al., 2014). Another meta-analysis, however, showed that there was no increase in HRV to positive social interactions (Shahrestani, Stewart, Quintana, Hickie, &amp; Guastella, 2015). This meta-analysis however included only four studies, that had stimuli of which it seems questionable that they can be conceptualized as resembling true positive social interactions (e.g. discussion of an upsetting film). Thus, we come to conclude that no clear conclusions regarding HRV change to positive social situations can be drawn from this meta-analysis. In line with aforementioned literature and theories supporting an increase in HRV in response to positive social situations and emotions, we expect to find that children\u2019s HRV increases in response to positive parenting-related stimuli in the present study.\n\tPrior literature examined HRV as a moderator in the association between an aversive family environment and child externalizing behavior (e.g. for a review see El-Sheikh Erath, 2011). Specifically, these studies assessed the role of HRV-changes in children\u2019s responses to parental conflict (simulated by audiotaped interadult arguments) (e.g. El-Sheikh, Harger, &amp; Whitson, 2001; El-Sheikh, 2011), negative coparenting and family processes (Leary &amp; Katz, 2004), marital conflict (for a review see Whitson &amp; El-Sheikh, 2003; Katz &amp; Gottman, 1995; El-Sheikh &amp; Whitson, 2006; Katz &amp; Gottman, 1997), and child maltreatment (Gordis, Feres, Olezeski, Rabkin, &amp; Trickett, 2010) in their development of children\u2019s externalizing behavior. These studies claim to have found support for differential susceptibility, by demonstrating that for children with less HRV-decline in response to an aversive parenting/family environment there were stronger associations between the aversive family environment and later externalizing behavior (\u2018for-worse\u2019 effect) and for those with greater HRV-decline these associations were less strong. Specifically, the decrease in strength of the association was conceptualized by the authors as support for the \u201cfor-better\u201d end of the differential susceptibility spectrum, as a \u201cbuffering\u201d effect to environmental adversity. However, these studies lack a complete assessment of differential susceptibility, which could be addressed by providing a true \u201cfor-better\u201d measure, where e.g. the effect of HRV-changes in response to positive parenting stimuli on the association between positive parenting and positive child behavior outcomes is assessed in addition to the \u201cfor-worse\u201d measure. \n \tLastly, these studies have been primarily conducted on children between the ages of 7-12, which calls for more research in the group of preschoolers (~ 4-6 year olds), where parenting as an environmental influence and thus differential susceptibility effects may be the most prevalent. To complement existing literature, we aim to assess changes in HRV to both negative and positive parenting film clips as moderators in the respective associations of negative parenting and child externalizing behavior and positive parenting and child empathy outcomes in a sample of 4-6 year old children.\n\tCognitive bias. Accumulating literature demonstrates that children, depending on their genetic or physiological susceptibility, differ in their attentional processing of social cues (for a review see Fox &amp; Beever, 2016). For example, in a study by Fox and colleagues (2011), participants were assigned to either a positive or negative attentional bias modification (ABM) procedure. Results showed that following the ABM procedure, individuals with the SS-allelic variant displayed greater attentional bias to both positive and negative affective pictures. The CogBIAS hypothesis was proposed to describe such a phenomenon that early negative or positive environmental events in combination with certain genetic variants may enhance sensitivity to the environment by the formation of \u2018toxic\u2019 or \u2018enhancing\u2019 cognitive biases, which in turn direct sensitivity to future experiences and thereby have the potential to shape positive and negative developmental trajectories (Fox &amp; Beever, 2016).   \n \tWhereas a few studies indicate support for such a hypothesis (Fox, Zougkou, Ridgewell, &amp; Garner, 2011; Miu, Vulturar, Chis, Ungureanu, &amp; Gross, 2013; Kuepper et al., 2012; Osinsky, Hennig, Losch, Alexander, &amp; MacLeod), there is a lack of research which tests explicitly both negative attentional bias as a moderator in the associations between a negative parenting environment and a negative child developmental outcome, and positive attentional bias in the association between positive parenting and a positive child developmental outcome. We aim to close this gap in literature by testing this respective differential susceptibility research question in the present study in the associations between negative parenting and child externalizing behavior and positive parenting and child empathy. \n \tFurthermore, it is also important to recognize that in the attentional bias literature, a distinction is made between attentional engagement and attentional disengagement as two separate, integrative components of attentional bias (Cisler, Bacon, &amp; Williams, 2009; Fox, Russo, &amp; Dutton, 2002; Fox, Russo, Bowles, &amp; Dutton, 2001; Koster Crombez, Verschuere, De Houwer, 2004). Attentional engagement describes the relative ease or speed with which attention is captured by a stimuli, whereas difficulty in attentional disengagement describes the degree by which shifting attention from one stimuli to another is impaired (Cisler &amp; Koster, 2010). Both of these components have shown to play important roles in shaping attentional bias (for a review see Cisler &amp; Koster, 2010). In the present study we utilize a modified version of the Posner (1980) exogenous cuing task (see Koster, De Raedt, Goeleven, Franck, &amp; Crombez, 2005; Waters, Mogg, Bradley, &amp; Pine, 2008), which allows us to distinguish between these two components (Cisler &amp; Koster, 2010).\t\n \tAlso worth noting is that is has been subject of debate of whether cognitive bias is state- or trait-dependent, in which the former would counter the idea of an endophenotype, which by definition is \u201ca quantitative biological trait that is reliable in reflecting the function of a discrete biological system and is reasonably heritable (Wong, Fox, Ng, &amp; Lee, 2011). However, recent research indicates that attentional bias may be directly related to early biologically based temperamental dispositions. For example, a recent longitudinal study showed a concurrent link between attentional bias and anxiety, but crucially only for children who demonstrated early behavioral inhibition (BI) (White et al., 2017). BI is a biologically based temperamental disposition characterized by high levels of fearfulness and withdrawn reactions to ambiguous stimuli in years of early childhood (Fox, Henderson, Marshall, Nichols, &amp; Ghera, 2005). This is furthermore in line with recent research that shows that only for children with high levels of BI, there were stable patterns of attentional bias across tasks (Morales, Taber\u2010Thomas, &amp; P\u00e9rez\u2010Edgar, 2017). As such, recent literature supports the notion that attentional bias may also function as an endophenotypical trait, as it may be predetermined by- or directly related to biologically based early temperamental dispositions. However, further research is necessary to elucidate the role of cognitive bias as an endophenotypical susceptibility factor, specifically in the relationship between parenting and child externalizing behavior.\n\nPresent Study\n               In the present study we aim to investigate children\u2019s differential susceptibility to parenting. We aim to do this by examining the five endophenotypes SCR, SCL-change, HRV-change, attentional disengagement and attentional engagement as moderators in the association between negative parenting and child externalizing behavior, and in the association between positive parenting and child empathy (research aim 1). Furthermore, we aim to examine whether there is a subset of children that reacts strongly to both negative and positive (parenting) stimuli (research aim 2).\n\tResearch aim 1. We aim to test whether the endophenotypes SCR, SCL-change, HRV-change, attentional disengagement and attentional engagement functioned as moderators in the associations between positive parenting and child empathy (\u2018\u2019for-better\u2019\u2019 end of differential susceptibility spectrum), and negative parenting and child externalizing behavior (\u201cfor-worse\u2019\u2019 end of differential susceptibility spectrum). The physiological endophenotypes we will examine are skin conductance responses (SCR), skin conductance level changes (SCL-changes), and heart rate variability changes (HRV-changes), which we assessed in response to both negative and positive dynamic face expressions (SCR) and negative and positive parenting film clips (SCL-changes and HRV-changes, respectively). The two cognitive endophenotypes we will examine are attentional engagement and attentional disengagement to negative and positive parenting stimuli.\n \tResearch aim 2. The second aim is to assess whether a subset of children reacted strongly to both negative and positive (parenting) stimuli (i.e., a differentially reactive group), as assessed by the five endophenotype measures of SCR, SCL-change, HRV-change, attentional disengagement and attentional engagement to both negative and positive (parenting) stimuli. To answer this question, a hierarchical cluster analysis method (Ward\u2019s linkage clustering) will be conducted, where each case begins as its own cluster and cases are merged until merging into one cluster has occurred (one-cluster solution). In line with prior research that found a subgroup of highly reactive versus a larger group of average reactive children to positive and negative emotions of their mother (Slagt et al., 2019), a two-cluster solution will be examined to see if there is a relatively small cluster of children who responded strongly to both the negative and positive (parenting) cues differentiated from another cluster. In line with previous empirical evidence, we expected that the smaller cluster will comprise between 10-35 % of the present study\u2019s sample (Lionetti et al. 2018; Slagt et al., 2019; Wolf, van Doorn, &amp; Weissing, 2008; Aron, Aron, &amp; Jagiellowics, 2012).\n\n", "q4": "\nHypotheses are directional. \n\n       Hypotheses research aim 1: We hypothesize that the association between negative parenting and child externalizing behavior will be stronger for children with 1) a greater SCR to negative dynamic face expressions, 2a) greater SCL-increase to a negative parenting film clip, 3a) less HRV-decline to a negative parenting film clip, and 4a) greater attentional engagement to- and weaker disengagement from negative parenting stimuli. In line with the differential susceptibility hypothesis, we expect that the association between positive parenting and child empathy behavior will be stronger for children with 1b) greater SCR to positive dynamic face expressions, 2b) greater SCL-increase to a positive parenting film clip 3b) greater HRV-increase to a positive parenting film clip, and 4b) greater attentional engagement to- and weaker disengagement from positive parenting stimuli.\n\n       Hypotheses research aim 2: To answer research question 2, we will conduct five separate cluster-analyses, one for each endophenotype: SCR, SCL-change, HRV-change, attentional engagement, and attentional disengagement. For all cluster analyses we will examine the two-cluster solutions. For the cluster-analyses on SCR, SCL-change, attentional engagement and attentional disengagement, we hypothesize that there will be a relatively small cluster of children who will respond more strongly to both the negative and positive (parenting) stimuli than children in the other cluster, in terms of greater SCR, greater SCL-increase, and greater attentional engagement and weaker disengagement. For the cluster-analysis on HRV-change, we expect that there will be a relatively small cluster of children who will respond with less HRV-decline to the negative parenting film clips, and with greater HRV-increases to positive parenting film clips, than children in the other cluster. In line with previous empirical evidence, we expect that the smaller cluster will comprise between 10-35 % of the present studies sample (Lionetti et al. 2018; Slagt et al., 2019; Wolf, van Doorn, &amp; Weissing, 2008; Aron, Aron, &amp; Jagiellowics, 2012). \n\n \n\n", "q5": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

The type of transformation will depend on two criteria: 1) whether the data is positively or negatively skewed, and 2) whether it is moderately, strongly, or extremely skewed. For the assumption of linearity of regression standardized residuals, the dependent variable will be transformed if the residuals do not roughly follow the normality line of the P-P plot.\nVariables will be centered on their mean prior to analyses within the Hayes macro (Hayes, 2012).\n", "q21": "The standard p-value of .05 will be used as a criterion for statistical significance in the moderation analyses. Given our study design, there will be no corrections of multiple comparisons. That is, because we are conducting several independent tests of different domains (endophenotypes of different biological systems), with several explicit hypotheses on different topics, where multiple testing is not required (e.g. Feise, 2002; Streiner &amp; Norman, 2011). \nFor the cluster analysis, the two clusters that will emerge from the two-cluster solution will be examined to determine whether there will be a relatively small cluster of children, comprising between 10-35 % of the present study\u2019s sample, who respond strongly to both the negative and positive (parenting) cues differentiated from another cluster. \n", "q22": "\nData exclusion for data on the film clips task and dynamic face expressions task:\nFor skin conductance (SCR and SCL) and heart rate variability data, outliers will be defined as standardized values of over and below 3 (Persson et al., 2005; Zeegers et al., 2018). We used the method of dealing with outliers as stated in Tabachnick &amp; Fidell (2013, p.112), which states that an option for univariate outliers is to: \u201cto change the score(s) on the variable(s) for the outlying case(s) so that they are deviant, but not as deviant as they were. For instance, assign the outlying case(s) a raw score on the offending variable that is one unit larger (or smaller) than the next most extreme score in the distribution. Because measurement of variables is some-times rather arbitrary anyway, this is often an attractive alternative to reduce the impact of a univariate outlier\u201d (Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2013). Thus, outliers will be assigned with values one unit smaller than the largest non-outlier score on the measured variable of that specific participant (see Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2013, p. 112; Zeegers et al., 2018). If the smallest one-unit (0.01) increase to the next most extreme score still will result in standardized values of or below 3, then the analysis will be run once with the unaltered and once with the altered data. If this outlier imputation will still result in standardized values above, then the unaltered data will be used for analysis (Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2013). \n\nData exclusion for data on the information processing task:\nOutliers will be classified as reaction times of standardized values greater than 3 of a participants individual mean reaction time or reaction times under 200 ms and will be excluded from analysis (e.g. Waters et al., 2008; Koster, 2005). Invalid trials will be trials with either incorrect responses, or trials where no response was made within the valid 3000 ms reaction time window, and will be excluded from analysis (e.g. Waters et al., 2008; Koster, 2005). As a quality check that participants sustained their attention throughout the task and were actively engaged in participation of the paradigm, participants who had over 25 % of trials missing due to outliers and/or invalid responses will be excluded from analysis (Langner &amp; Eickhoff, 2013; Bradley, Mogg, Falla, &amp; Hamilton, 1998).\n\n", "q23": "Mean scores were created from all available data points on a respective variable.", "q24": "n.a.", "q25": "References:\n\n\nAbaied, J.

Then, parent and child were guided to the computer where the child would complete three tasks, organized in two blocks: in block 1 the information processing task , and in block 2 the dynamic face expressions task and the film clips task. The order of the two blocks was counterbalanced, and the order of the two tasks within block 2 was also counterbalanced. Within the film clips task, a negative parenting and a positive parenting film clip was shown. The order of these two films was counterbalanced within this task. This resulted in a total of eight different orders, with participants randomly assigned to one. During both blocks, parents were seated in another room. During block 1, parents completed the same information processing task as their child and during block 2, they completed parent-report questionnaires on a computer. Between block 1 and block 2 parents were brought back into the child\u2019s room to be there for when the heart rate and skin conductance electrodes were attached to the child.

Additionally, flyers of the study were handed out on the street to parents in front of schools and spread throughout the city of Amsterdam in public places. The invitation consisted of a short description of the study and a link to a website, where parents could sign up to participate.

PROCESS estimates the coefficients of a model using OLS regression for continuous outcomes (Hayes, 2012). The negative parenting model will assess the relationship between negative parenting and child externalizing behavior, and the positive parenting model will assess the relationship between positive parenting and child empathy. To answer the primary research question of whether these associations will each be moderated by the examined endophenotypes (SCR, SCL-change, HRV-change, attentional engagement and disengagement), separate moderation analyses will be conducted for each of the five moderators using the Hayes\u2019 PROCESS macro. Specifically, for the moderation of the negative parenting model, the endophenotypes measured in response to the negative, \u201cfor-worse\u201d(parenting) stimuli will be implemented as moderators: SCR to the negative dynamic face expressions, SCL-changes and HRV-changes to the negative parenting film clips, attentional engagement and disengagement to the negative parenting photos. Similarly,, for the positive parenting model, the endophenotypes were measured in response to the positive, \u201dfor-better\u201d (parenting) stimuli and will be implemented as moderators: SCR to the positive dynamic face expressions, SCL-changes and HRV-changes to the positive parenting film clips, attentional engagement and disengagement to the positive parenting photos. Thus, five moderation analyses will be run with the endophenotype measures to negative (parenting) stimuli as moderators in the association between negative parenting and child externalizing behavior (assessing the \u201cfor-worse\u201d end of the differential susceptibility spectrum), and five moderation analyses will be run with the endophenotype measures to positive (parenting) stimuli as moderators in the association between positive parenting and child empathy (\u201cfor-better\u201d end of the differential susceptibility spectrum). All regression and moderation analyses will be run with sex of the child as a covariate.\nWe will generate 95 % bias-corrected confidence intervals using 5,000 bootstrap samples using ordinary least squares estimation (Hayes, 2012). Variables will be centered on their mean prior to analyses within the Hayes macro (Hayes, 2012; 2017). If the analyses will reveal a significant interaction, regions of significance will be generated with the Johnson-Neyman technique (see e.g., Bauer &amp; Curran, 2005; Hayes &amp; Matthes, 2009).\n \nStatistical approach research aim 2: To investigate whether a subset of children reacted strongly to both negative and positive (parenting) stimuli (i.e., a highly reactive group), five hierarchical cluster analyses will be conducted, one for each endophenotype: SCR, SCL-change, HRV-change, attentional engagement, attentional disengagement. To identify whether there might be homogenous groups of cases that indicate a differential susceptibility pattern we will conduct five cluster analyses in total with each following features together: 1) SCR to positive faces and SCR to negative faces, 2) SCL-change to positive parenting film clip and SCL-change to negative parenting film clip, 3) HRV-change to positive parenting film clip and HRV-change to negative parenting film clip, 4) attentional engagement to positive faces and attentional engagement to negative faces, and 5) attentional disengagement to positive faces and attentional disengagement to negative faces. We will use a hierarchical cluster analysis method, specifically Ward\u2019s linkage clustering with the squared Euclidean distances as the distancing metric (measure of similarity) (e.g. Dolnicar, 2002; Doron, Trouillet, Maneveau, Neveu, &amp; Ninot, 2014). We examined the two-cluster solution to see if there was a relatively small cluster of children, comprising between 10-35 % of the present study\u2019s sample, who responded strongly to both the negative and positive (parenting) cues differentiated from another cluster. To visualize the two clusters, scatterplots for measures of SCR, SCL-change, HRV-change, attentional engagement and attentional disengagement to the negative stimuli (y-axis) and positive stimuli (x-axis) were generated in heat-map style, with data points coded in two colors according to cluster-membership. \n\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links":

One compelling candidate is delay discounting: those who prefer smaller sooner rewards over larger but later rewards are hypothesised to have higher BMI. The findings in the literature are mixed however, with meta analyses suggesting only a very small correlation between discounting and BMI. Here we present novel empirical data (N=381) and Bayesian analyses which suggest no such relationship between discounting of either monetary or weight loss rewards and BMI. We also find evidence against our novel proposal that discounting moderates the rate of BMI gain over time. We also present our data in the context of a random effects Bayesian meta-analytical result which does suggest the presence of a small correlation overall. The strength of the correlation is so weak (2.25% shared variance) that its practical significance may be minor to non existent. However because we found decisive evidence for unaccounted for study-level variance, due to study heterogeneity, we argue that we should treat such meta-analytic correlations with extreme caution. While the relationship between discounting and health outcomes such as BMI remain theoretically appealing, our empirical and meta-analytic results suggest we should be cautious in inferring a correlational, let alone a causal, role for discounting processes in driving BMI or moderating BMI gain with age.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created":

Philosophers, evolutionary theorists and anthropologists have described objectivism - i.e., moral externalization - as the default mechanism of meta-ethics (cf. Stanford, 2018). Subjectivist views, therefore, should require an additional effort to be formulated. This hypothesis, however, has not been empirically explored. \n\nIn this study, we will study how meta-ethical judgments engage in differential levels of cognitive processing. Participants will be asked to categorize factual, preference and moral statements as 'objective' or 'subjective' on a computer, while their mouse trajectories will be recorded. Indices of higher engagement in cognitive processing - i.e., more deviant and erratic trajectories - will reveal participants' thought processes during the task.\n\nParticipants will be recruited to participate in a study on \"Foundations of Knowledge\". Upon arrival at the laboratory, participants will be asked to complete a categorization task on a computer. In each trial, participants will be asked to click on a 'start' button and a statement will appear. They need to categorize the statement as by hovering the mouse from the 'start' point to one of two boxes labeled 'objective' or 'subjective'. Unknowingly to the subjects, the statements will be factual statements (\"Berlin is in Germany\"), preference statements (\"Prince William is cuter than Prince Harry\") and moral statements (\"Death penalty is wrong\"). After completing the task, they will complete a brief survey with additional measures and demographics.", "q4": "1.
