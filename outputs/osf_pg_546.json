The Spit for Science project is a university-wide initiative at a large, urban four-year university focused on college students\u2019 substance use and behavioral health outcomes. The Spit for Science project launched in fall 2011 and new cohorts of freshmen were recruited in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2017, resulting in five cohorts as of fall 2018. All incoming freshmen over age 18 were invited to participate in the Spit for Science survey and were given the opportunity to provide saliva samples. DNA was then extracted from the saliva samples to generate genome-wide data. Participants were invited to complete follow-up surveys every subsequent spring semester until graduating.\n\nIn order to be included in the present study, participants must have completed at least one follow-up survey and provided genetic data.\n\nTo examine whether genetic predisposition for externalizing behavior influences selection into relationships with friends and romantic partners to predict alcohol outcomes, I will use structural equation modeling to capitalize on the longitudinal data available in the sample.

It is anticipated that alcohol use and alcohol problems will be natural log-transformed after adding a constant of one to adjust for positive skew while retaining individuals who drank zero grams of ethanol and reported no problems with alcohol. Similar procedures will be employed for other variables that demonstrate skewness or kurtosis. After preliminary analyses, I will run descriptive statistics and zero-order correlations to characterize the associations between all key study variables. \n\nThe goal of the present study is to examine whether 1) genetic predisposition for externalizing behavior influences selection into relationships with friends and romantic partners to predict alcohol outcomes, and 2) whether friends' and romantic partners' substance use moderates the association between genetic predisposition and alcohol outcomes.

Externalizing polygenic scores will be included as my main predictor. Friend substance use and romantic partner substance use at the first follow-up will each be included as mediators, controlling for alcohol outcomes at the first follow-up. Alcohol outcomes at the second follow-up will serve as my outcome variable, controlling for friend and romantic partner substance use at the second follow-up.

The outcomes are based upon the work of Evan Stark (2006, 2007), the Motivations and Effects Questionnaire (MEQ: Follingstad et al., 1991), and the WEB (Smith et al., 1995). \nSocial desirability bias will be assessed using the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding Short Form (BIDR-16: Paulhus, 1991). \nRefer to file labelled Appendix B Questionnaire for the complete survey ", "q17.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e0aafeafbb1ef0043d7e767", "file_name": "Appendix B Questionnaire.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/fty67/files/osfstorage/5e0aafeafbb1ef0043d7e767", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e0aafeafbb1ef0043d7e767"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "1585f6f9d5deeac5d23e8e5114d2767794765706cce1d82efbf75a630384252b"}}], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "We will conduct Bayesian exploratory factor analysis (BEFA) using the R package \u2018BayesFM\u2019 to factor analyse the items.

Log-Bayes factors will be used to determine the relative strength of the evidence for the alternative hypotheses, with a factor less than or greater than one, as suggested by Raftery (1995), indicating substantial evidence for these. \nA perpetrated behaviour model (Figure 1 in Research Plan 20191205) and an experienced behaviour model (Figure 2 in Research Plan 20191205) will be produced, and it will be determined whether these are moderated by gender. If this model fails to converge due to the complexity of the model, a model comparison design using averaged non-latent variables based on the underlying structure identified by the BEFA will be employed. \n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fty67/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}},

The gambling task involves making 64 repeated selections between two virtual buttons labeled \u201cBet\u201d and \u201cSkip\u201d. Upon choosing either button, the payoff for the given trial will be presented above the two buttons. Choosing \u201cBet\u201d implies that the payoff is realized (i.e., added to the participants\u2019 tally which determined their take-home amount), while choosing \u201cSkip\u201d implied that the payoff is  not realized. Following each selection, payoffs are drawn from one of the following two sets: [2, 8, 51, 87, -3, -6, -28, -96], or [-2, -8, -51, -87, 3, 6, 28, 96]. These two sets are identical with the exception that gains in one sets are converted to losses in the other and vice versa. The expected value of the lottery is either slightly negative (set 1) or positive (set 2). Before beginning the task each participant is randomly assigned to one of the two sets, and this assignment remains constant throughout the task. Each item is presented eight times throughout the gambling task in random order (i.e., payoff sets presented above are duplicated eight times for a total of 64 items, and then randomly shuffled for each participant).\nParticipants will receive no prior information about the payoff distributions or the number of trials. They are told that their task is to choose \u201cBet\u201d or \u201cSkip\u201d on each trial, and that \u201cBet\u201d outcomes are added to or subtracted from their final payoff, while \"Skip\" outcomes are not. Participants are also informed of the conversion rate for the outcomes (1000 points = $1), and that either way they would not earn more than $2 nor less than $1. Half of the participants will perform a filler task, in which they have two minutes to solve a set of fifteen anagrams. Subsequently, the experiment automatically continues to a surprise recognition task.\nIn the recognition task participants were presented with 20 numbers, including the 8 outcomes and an additional 12 numbers that were not presented in the gambling task: [17, 26, 4, 18, 9, 38, 92,16,46, 73, 5,7]. They will then be asked to report for each of the  20 numbers if it was (1) presented in the gambling task as a gain, (2) presented in the gambling task as a loss, (3) wasn\u2019t presented at the gambling task at all.

The resulting asymmetries in people\u2019s memory for positives and negatives are illuminating with respect to how people remember ecologically relevant events, but it is not easy to map them to basic asymmetries in perception, attention, and memory. This is the case because external information that is positive or negative is often different in many respects, and these multidimensional differences may confound the basic difference in valence. A case in point is a puzzle in the domain of incidental recognition, initially observed by Ortony, Turner, and Antos (1983). In their study participants read positive and negative affective sentences and were then were asked to recognize them in a surprise test. Even though there was no difference in the number of correctly recognized positive and negative sentences, there were more false alarms for positive than negative sentences. Recently, Alves, Unkelbach,  Burghardt, Koch, Kr\u00fcger, and Becker (2015) replicated this puzzling phenomenon but also showed that it is driven by greater similarity between positive words than between negative words. This highlights the need for examinations of memories using objectively similar positive and negative events. In the present paper, we examine participants\u2019 memory of positive and negative experienced outcomes to address this issue in the context of the Ortony et al. (1983) puzzle.\n\tVarious theories provide qualitative predictions regarding this puzzle. Sedikides and Green (2006; 2009; Sedikides et al., 2016) espoused the view that people prefer to deliberate on and report positive events that are not threatening to one\u2019s self. This account was developed to explain the Pollyanna effect (Boucher &amp; Osgood, 1969), the finding that incidental memory tends to be more accurate for positive than negatives. Yet it does not explain why false alarm rates should be higher positive events. Another relevant  account is the Paradoxical Negative Emotion (PNE) hypothesis of Porter, Taylor, and Brinke (2008) which argues that negative emotions increases susceptibility to misinformation. Direct evidence for this relatively hypothesis was first obtained by Porter, Spencer, and Birt (2003). Participants viewed emotional visual images as stimuli, and were then asked if there was a large animal in the scene. Negative images were associated with an increased susceptibility to misinformation by 40% over positive and neutral images. Similarly, Porter et al. (2008) asked participants whether they could recall 20 \u2018\u2018widely publicized\u2019\u2019 public events that were positively or negatively valanced. Half of the events were actually fictitious. The findings indicated that more than twice as many participants falsely recognized a bogus negative event (90%) compared to a bogus positive event (42%). Note, however, that this account predicts a bias in the opposite direction of the Ortony et al. (1983) puzzle, with more false alarms for negatives than positives.\n\tPorter et al. (2008) explained their findings and the PNE hypothesis as the result of an evolutionary adaptation. They argue that negative events should be recalled better over time than neutral or other emotional events, in order to avoid or deal with them in the future (Porter &amp; Peace, 2007). Given that it is normally adaptive to incorporate relevant information concerning negative events from others deemed trustworthy (the researchers, for example), this leads to an increased positive response bias for negative events. An alternative explanation is based on the findings of a series of studies Paz and colleagues (Schechtman, Laufer, &amp; Paz, 2010; Laufer &amp; Paz, 2012; Resnik, Sobel N, &amp; Paz, 2011). They demonstrated that individuals tend to show more greater generalization for negative cues than for positive cues. For example in Schechtman et al. (2010) participants responded to a tone that was farther away from an aversive conditioned tone, compared to an equivalent rewarding tone. Therefore, participants may have more false alarms for losses due to overgeneralization of cues presented during the recognition task.  \nStill, as mentioned above, it could be that Porter et al.\u2019s (2008) findings might be due to specific properties of the selected events, such as dissimilarities between events. Moreover, the discrepancy between the findings of Porter et al. (2008) and the Ortony et al. (1983) puzzle suggests that additional evidence needs to be collected. To examine the effect of valence on false alarms in a setting with relatively symmetric objective gains and losses, we used a decisions-from-experience task (Rakow &amp; Newell, 2010; Erev &amp; Haruvy, 2015), in which an individual\u2019s gains and losses are the positive and negative events. Gains and losses were counter-balanced creating an objective symmetry in the distribution of events. In three studies, we found evidence for increased false alarm rates in losses (negative valence stimuli), compared to gains.\n"}, "question6a": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "confirmatory-analyses-first": {"value": {"first": {"value": {"question1c": {"extra": [], "value": "The calculation of both IVs was described in the design section as follows:\nFalse-alarms rate: calculated as the number of items participants incorrectly categorized as \u201cold\u201d (i.e., participants report that the item appeared in the gambling task prior to the memory test, although it was not) divided by the number of \u201cnew\u201d items (i.e., in the memory task \u2013 items that were not seen before in the gambling task).

This is the case because external information that is positive or negative is often different in many respects, and these multidimensional differences may confound the basic difference in valence. A case in point is a puzzle in the domain of incidental recognition, initially observed by Ortony, Turner, and Antos (1983). In their study participants read positive and negative affective sentences and were then were asked to recognize them in a surprise test. Even though there was no difference in the number of correctly recognized positive and negative sentences, there were more false alarms for positive than negative sentences. Recently, Alves, Unkelbach,  Burghardt, Koch, Kr\u00fcger, and Becker (2015) replicated this puzzling phenomenon but also showed that it is driven by greater similarity between positive words than between negative words. This highlights the need for examinations of memories using objectively similar positive and negative events. In the present paper, we examine participants\u2019 memory of positive and negative experienced outcomes to address this issue in the context of the Ortony et al. (1983) puzzle.\n\tVarious theories provide qualitative predictions regarding this puzzle. Sedikides and Green (2006; 2009; Sedikides et al., 2016) espoused the view that people prefer to deliberate on and report positive events that are not threatening to one\u2019s self. This account was developed to explain the Pollyanna effect (Boucher &amp; Osgood, 1969), the finding that incidental memory tends to be more accurate for positive than negatives. Yet it does not explain why false alarm rates should be higher positive events. Another relevant  account is the Paradoxical Negative Emotion (PNE) hypothesis of Porter, Taylor, and Brinke (2008) which argues that negative emotions increases susceptibility to misinformation. Direct evidence for this relatively hypothesis was first obtained by Porter, Spencer, and Birt (2003). Participants viewed emotional visual images as stimuli, and were then asked if there was a large animal in the scene. Negative images were associated with an increased susceptibility to misinformation by 40% over positive and neutral images. Similarly, Porter et al. (2008) asked participants whether they could recall 20 \u2018\u2018widely publicized\u2019\u2019 public events that were positively or negatively valanced. Half of the events were actually fictitious. The findings indicated that more than twice as many participants falsely recognized a bogus negative event (90%) compared to a bogus positive event (42%). Note, however, that this account predicts a bias in the opposite direction of the Ortony et al. (1983) puzzle, with more false alarms for negatives than positives.\n\tPorter et al. (2008) explained their findings and the PNE hypothesis as the result of an evolutionary adaptation. They argue that negative events should be recalled better over time than neutral or other emotional events, in order to avoid or deal with them in the future (Porter &amp; Peace, 2007). Given that it is normally adaptive to incorporate relevant information concerning negative events from others deemed trustworthy (the researchers, for example), this leads to an increased positive response bias for negative events. An alternative explanation is based on the findings of a series of studies Paz and colleagues (Schechtman, Laufer, &amp; Paz, 2010; Laufer &amp; Paz, 2012; Resnik, Sobel N, &amp; Paz, 2011). They demonstrated that individuals tend to show more greater generalization for negative cues than for positive cues. For example in Schechtman et al. (2010) participants responded to a tone that was farther away from an aversive conditioned tone, compared to an equivalent rewarding tone. Therefore, participants may have more false alarms for losses due to overgeneralization of cues presented during the recognition task.  \nStill, as mentioned above, it could be that Porter et al.\u2019s (2008) findings might be due to specific properties of the selected events, such as dissimilarities between events. Moreover, the discrepancy between the findings of Porter et al. (2008) and the Ortony et al. (1983) puzzle suggests that additional evidence needs to be collected. To examine the effect of valence on false alarms in a setting with relatively symmetric objective gains and losses, we used a decisions-from-experience task (Rakow &amp; Newell, 2010; Erev &amp; Haruvy, 2015), in which an individual\u2019s gains and losses are the positive and negative events. Gains and losses were counter-balanced creating an objective symmetry in the distribution of events. In three studies, we found evidence for increased false alarm rates in losses (negative valence stimuli), compared to gains.\n", "recommended-hypothesis.question6a": "", "description-methods.design.question2a": "IV: Valence (loss: negative numbers, gain: positive numbers) \u2013 within-subject variable.\n\n", "description-methods.design.question2b": "False-alarms rate: calculated as the number of items participants incorrectly categorized as \u201cold\u201d (i.e., participants report that the item appeared in the gambling task prior to the memory test, although it was not) divided by the number of \u201cnew\u201d items (i.e., in the memory task \u2013 items that were not seen before in the gambling task).

Upon choosing either button, the payoff for the given trial will be presented above the two buttons. Choosing \u201cBet\u201d implies that the payoff is realized (i.e., added to the participants\u2019 tally which determined their take-home amount), while choosing \u201cSkip\u201d implied that the payoff is  not realized. Following each selection, payoffs are drawn from one of the following two sets: [2, 8, 51, 87, -3, -6, -28, -96], or [-2, -8, -51, -87, 3, 6, 28, 96]. These two sets are identical with the exception that gains in one sets are converted to losses in the other and vice versa. The expected value of the lottery is either slightly negative (set 1) or positive (set 2). Before beginning the task each participant is randomly assigned to one of the two sets, and this assignment remains constant throughout the task. Each item is presented eight times throughout the gambling task in random order (i.e., payoff sets presented above are duplicated eight times for a total of 64 items, and then randomly shuffled for each participant).\nParticipants will receive no prior information about the payoff distributions or the number of trials. They are told that their task is to choose \u201cBet\u201d or \u201cSkip\u201d on each trial, and that \u201cBet\u201d outcomes are added to or subtracted from their final payoff, while \"Skip\" outcomes are not.

Two main biases are attention and expectancy biases.  In our previous work (Abado, Sagi, Silber, de Houwer, Aue and Okon-Singer, Under review; Aue, Guex, Chauvign\u00e9 and Okon-Singer, 2013), we have studied the relationship between attention and expectancy biases. We did so by manipulating participants\u2019 expectancies of encountering certain types of stimuli - threatening (spiders) and non-threatening (birds) - among an array of neutral stimuli (butterflies), with an intricate background, thus establishing a causal relationship. First, we found that expectancy cues had an impact on reactions to birds. In contrast, the (same) cues had no impact on reactions to spiders, in both high spider fearful and low spider fearful participants. In addition, reaction times (RTs) to spiders were overall faster than reactions to birds. Thus, robust attention bias toward spiders, but not toward birds, was found among low and high fearful participants. However, when these phylogenetic stimuli (spiders, birds and butterflies) were replaced with ontogenetic stimuli (guns, mobile phones and staplers), this attention bias was not found toward guns (Abado et al. Under review). Hence, one could conclude that spiders receive prioritized processing due their evolutionary importance (Seligman, 1971), while more modern stimuli (i.e. guns) do not (\u00d6hman et al., 1975., 1976). However, this interpretation does not take into account visual factors, which differed between the two experiments. While on Aue et al. (2013) phylogenetic stimuli appeared on complex natural backgrounds, on Abado et al. (under review), ontogenetic objects appeared on clean white background. Thus, this difference in visual factors could be a source of variance in attention bias. \nAs there mixed findings in the literature regarding the difference, or lack thereof, between phylogenetic and ontogenetic stimuli, the present study has two aims: first, to clarify the existence, or lack thereof, of attention bias toward ontogenetic stimuli. This be accomplished by directly comparing responses between ontogenetic and phylogenetic stimuli, under the same conditions. Second, the present study aims at examining the role of visual factors in attention bias. While white backgrounds may seem sterile, articificial and out of context, complex backgrounds (i.e. spiders, birds, and butterflies in nature; guns, phones, and staplers in hands) may provide realistic context and ecological validity. Thus, visual factors (i.e. background) will be controlled while attention bias is measured. To this aim, we will employ a task we have developed and replicated in several studies in the past (e.g., Aue et al., 2013, 2016, 2018), and use phylogenetic stimuli (spiders, birds and butterflies) as well as ontogenetic stimuli (guns, mobile phones and staplers). These stimuli will be presented on a white background or on a complex background. Thus, there will be four between-subjects groups. RTs and accuracy rates will be compared directly between the two different background conditions in order to examine the effects of the visual factors. In addition, participants will be asked to fill out 4 questionnaires: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State Anxiety Inventory (STI), Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ), and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IOU). In addition to the FSQ, participants will answer 3 questions from Origin of Phobia Questionnaire (OPQ) and 8 questions regarding perceived disgust, dangerousness, unpredictability and uncontrollability of spiders. A-priori and a-posteriori expectancy bias of encountering the threatening targets will also be measured. Lastly, in order to better quantify the threat value of each stimulus and in order to understand why attention bias was previously found toward phones, participants will be asked to rate the pleasantness and unpleasantness of each type of stimulus post-experimentally. To conclude, the present study is a control study, meant to clarify the results of previous studies and to examine the role of intervening factors, such as valence, visual features (i.e. background) and indirect comparisons."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "1.\tMain analysis of RT and accuracy:  We expect to find a triple interaction between stimulus type \u00d7 cue \u00d7 target, such that the interaction between cue and target will differ between ontogenetic and phylogenetic groups. In the phylogenetic group, we expect to find a replication of previous results (Aue et al., 2013, 2016, 2018), such that facilitation of cue will only be found toward bird targets, and not toward spider targets (i.e. threatening targets). In other words, RT and accuracy toward spider targets will not differ as a function of the type of cue (valid or invalid). In the ontogenetic group, we similarly expect to find a replication of previous results (Abado et al. Unpublished), such that facilitation of cue will only be found toward phone targets (i.e. neutral targets), and not toward gun targets. In other words, RT and accuracy toward phone targets will not differ as a function of the type of cue (valid or invalid). In addition, based on previous findings, we do not expect to find attention bias toward guns. We also expect a replication of these results in the new conditions (i.e. phones/guns on a complex background and spiders/birds on a white background). As this is a control experiment for previous studies which presented different stimuli on different backgrounds, we predict no effect of the background, thus supporting prioritized processing of spiders in the phylogenetic group. Thus, our main hypothesis is the prioritized processing of spiders and the interaction between cue and target in both phylogenetic backgrounds, and our secondary hypothesis is regarding attention bias toward phones (i.e. interaction between cue and target in both ontogenetic backgrounds).\n2.\tQuestionnaires: BDI, STAI (state), FSQ and IOU will be included. BDI will be used for exclusion only. STAI (state), FSQ and IOU will be used as covariates. As the sample will be random, we expect that most participants will exhibit low to medium levels in all questionnaires. Therefore, we only expect a small-size correlations between IOU/STAI (state) and the interaction (cue x target) effects in all groups. Similarly, in the phylogenetic group, we expect a small-size correlation between FSQ and the cue-target interaction. \n3.\tA-priori expectancy and post experimental questionnaire: as previous studies have found that there is equal a-priori bias toward phylogenetic and ontogenetic stimuli regardless of fear level (Kennedey, Rapee and Mazurski, 1996; M\u00fchlberger et al., 2006), we expect a replication of these findings. Thus, although each target appears equally often, we expect participants to overestimate the appearance of threatening stimuli (i.e.to choose a probability of over 50%). Additionally, in these same studies (Kennedey et al., 1996; M\u00fchlberger et al., 2006), a-posteriori bias found only toward phylogenetic stimuli and among high-fear participants. As we will recruit a random sample of participants, we expect that most of them will be low-fearful, and thus we expect a-posteriori bias to be equal in both phylogenetic and ontogenetic groups, and that it will be lower than the a-priori bias.\nThis question would ask participants if they felt that they have reacted faster to a specific targets. In the case of the phylogenetic group, we expect that participants will explicitly choose \u201cyes, I responded faster to spider targets compared to bird targets\u201d. Thus, as fear is characterized by explicit irrational beliefs, we believe that participants will be able to acknowledge that they react faster toward spiders, compared to birds (Arntz et al., 1993). In the ontogenetic group, we expect one of two findings: as previous studies (Abado et al., unpublished) have found a bias toward phones, participants might similarly acknowledge this bias. However, as attention might be drawn toward phones for different reasons than for spiders, participants might not be able to acknowledge this bias. Regarding the manipulation check question, it is predicted that all participants will correctly indicate on the scale that the verbal cues were mostly valid. In other words, the mean of this measure is expected to be over 50%, with no differences across the four between-subject groups.\nRegarding the questions regarding phobic learning, and perceived disgust, danger, uncontrollability and unpredictability, we expect that the latter 4 dimensions will reduce unexplained variance to the expected attention bias toward spiders found in the phylogenetic groups.

Following the experiment, participants will be asked to fill the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (Szymanski and O'Donohue, 1995). Following the FSQ, participants will be asked to answer 3 questions regarding the origin of their fear of spiders (vicarious learning, conditioning and negative information; \u00d6st and Hugdahl, 1981; each question has 3 possible answers: \"yes\", \"no\", \"I don't know\"), 2 questions regarding perceived disgust of spiders (Armfield and Mattiske, 1996), 2 questions regarding perceived dangerousness of spiders (Armfield and Mattiske, 1996), 2 questions regarding perceived uncontrollability of spiders (Armfield and Mattiske, 1996), and 2 questions regarding perceived unpredictability of spiders (Arntz, Lavy, Van den Berg, and Van Rijsoort, 1993).

For each condition, 30 threatening pictures (i.e. guns or spiders), 30 neutral targets (i.e. phones or birds) and 100 neutral distractors (i.e. staplers or butterflies) were collected.

This measure will reflect participants\u2019 a-priori expectancy of encountering the fearful stimulus. Then, the experiment will begin. During the experimental paradigm, each trial will begin with a fixation point (500 ms), after which the probability of the target stimulus type in the next trial (expectancy cue- either 90% gun/spider or 90% phone/bird) will appear for 1,000 ms. Then, another fixation will appear (500 ms), followed by the search array (2,000 ms or until response), consisting of 8 pictures of staplers/butterflies, and one picture of either a phone/bird or a gun/spider. Several trials will have no target, meaning they will include 9 pictures of staplers or 9 pictures of butterflies. Participants will be instructed to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible and to determine the category of the target stimuli by pressing the P key for gun/spider and Q key for phone/bird targets (counterbalanced) or SPACE bar for no target. The congruency rate between cues and targets is 71%, and 5% of trials are catch trials (i.e. no target). The experimental paradigm takes 25 minutes to complete. \nPost experimental questionnaires: following the experimental paradigm, participants will be asked to answer three questions: (a) they will be asked to indicate if they felt, during the experiment, that they reacted faster to a specific target (three counterbalanced choices); (b) using a VAS that is identical to the one used to measure a-priori expectancies, participants will asked to rate the probability of threatening targets that they have encountered throughout the experiment. This measure will reflect participants\u2019 a-posteriori expectancy. These two questions are counterbalanced and they are meant to reflect explicit awareness of attention bias and a-posteriori expectancy bias. The third question is a manipulation check; participants will be asked to indicate if they felt that the cues truly predicted the target (71% of trials are congruent). Participants will be presented with a VAS and asked to indicate the congruency rate on it, ranging from 0% to 100% (i.e. \u201cnot predictive at all\u201d to \u201cvery predictive\u201d).

Two main biases are attention and expectancy biases.  In our previous work (Abado, Sagi, Silber, de Houwer, Aue and Okon-Singer, Under review; Aue, Guex, Chauvign\u00e9 and Okon-Singer, 2013), we have studied the relationship between attention and expectancy biases. We did so by manipulating participants\u2019 expectancies of encountering certain types of stimuli - threatening (spiders) and non-threatening (birds) - among an array of neutral stimuli (butterflies), with an intricate background, thus establishing a causal relationship. First, we found that expectancy cues had an impact on reactions to birds. In contrast, the (same) cues had no impact on reactions to spiders, in both high spider fearful and low spider fearful participants. In addition, reaction times (RTs) to spiders were overall faster than reactions to birds. Thus, robust attention bias toward spiders, but not toward birds, was found among low and high fearful participants. However, when these phylogenetic stimuli (spiders, birds and butterflies) were replaced with ontogenetic stimuli (guns, mobile phones and staplers), this attention bias was not found toward guns (Abado et al. Under review). Hence, one could conclude that spiders receive prioritized processing due their evolutionary importance (Seligman, 1971), while more modern stimuli (i.e. guns) do not (\u00d6hman et al., 1975., 1976). However, this interpretation does not take into account visual factors, which differed between the two experiments. While on Aue et al. (2013) phylogenetic stimuli appeared on complex natural backgrounds, on Abado et al. (under review), ontogenetic objects appeared on clean white background. Thus, this difference in visual factors could be a source of variance in attention bias. \nAs there mixed findings in the literature regarding the difference, or lack thereof, between phylogenetic and ontogenetic stimuli, the present study has two aims: first, to clarify the existence, or lack thereof, of attention bias toward ontogenetic stimuli. This be accomplished by directly comparing responses between ontogenetic and phylogenetic stimuli, under the same conditions. Second, the present study aims at examining the role of visual factors in attention bias. While white backgrounds may seem sterile, articificial and out of context, complex backgrounds (i.e. spiders, birds, and butterflies in nature; guns, phones, and staplers in hands) may provide realistic context and ecological validity. Thus, visual factors (i.e. background) will be controlled while attention bias is measured. To this aim, we will employ a task we have developed and replicated in several studies in the past (e.g., Aue et al., 2013, 2016, 2018), and use phylogenetic stimuli (spiders, birds and butterflies) as well as ontogenetic stimuli (guns, mobile phones and staplers). These stimuli will be presented on a white background or on a complex background. Thus, there will be four between-subjects groups. RTs and accuracy rates will be compared directly between the two different background conditions in order to examine the effects of the visual factors. In addition, participants will be asked to fill out 4 questionnaires: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State Anxiety Inventory (STI), Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ), and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IOU). In addition to the FSQ, participants will answer 3 questions from Origin of Phobia Questionnaire (OPQ) and 8 questions regarding perceived disgust, dangerousness, unpredictability and uncontrollability of spiders. A-priori and a-posteriori expectancy bias of encountering the threatening targets will also be measured. Lastly, in order to better quantify the threat value of each stimulus and in order to understand why attention bias was previously found toward phones, participants will be asked to rate the pleasantness and unpleasantness of each type of stimulus post-experimentally. To conclude, the present study is a control study, meant to clarify the results of previous studies and to examine the role of intervening factors, such as valence, visual features (i.e. background) and indirect comparisons.", "q4": "1.\tMain analysis of RT and accuracy:  We expect to find a triple interaction between stimulus type \u00d7 cue \u00d7 target, such that the interaction between cue and target will differ between ontogenetic and phylogenetic groups. In the phylogenetic group, we expect to find a replication of previous results (Aue et al., 2013, 2016, 2018), such that facilitation of cue will only be found toward bird targets, and not toward spider targets (i.e. threatening targets).

In the ontogenetic group, we similarly expect to find a replication of previous results (Abado et al.

In other words, RT and accuracy toward phone targets will not differ as a function of the type of cue (valid or invalid). In addition, based on previous findings, we do not expect to find attention bias toward guns. We also expect a replication of these results in the new conditions (i.e. phones/guns on a complex background and spiders/birds on a white background). As this is a control experiment for previous studies which presented different stimuli on different backgrounds, we predict no effect of the background, thus supporting prioritized processing of spiders in the phylogenetic group. Thus, our main hypothesis is the prioritized processing of spiders and the interaction between cue and target in both phylogenetic backgrounds, and our secondary hypothesis is regarding attention bias toward phones (i.e. interaction between cue and target in both ontogenetic backgrounds).\n2.\tQuestionnaires: BDI, STAI (state), FSQ and IOU will be included. BDI will be used for exclusion only. STAI (state), FSQ and IOU will be used as covariates.

These two questions are counterbalanced and they are meant to reflect explicit awareness of attention bias and a-posteriori expectancy bias. The third question is a manipulation check; participants will be asked to indicate if they felt that the cues truly predicted the target (71% of trials are congruent). Participants will be presented with a VAS and asked to indicate the congruency rate on it, ranging from 0% to 100% (i.e. \u201cnot predictive at all\u201d to \u201cvery predictive\u201d). Lastly, in order to rule out valence as an intervening factors, participants will be presented with 30 random pictures from the experiment (10 from each category \u2013 threatening target, neutral target and distractors) and for each picture they will be asked to indicate how pleasant and how unpleasant it is, each on a scale from 0-8  (Kron, Goldstein, Lee, Gardhouse, and Anderson). Each picture will appear for 4 seconds, followed by the two scales (counterbalanced).\nWhen done, participants will be thanked, paid or credited and be given a form of possible psychological treatment centers.", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "As there are four groups, participants will be randomly assigned to each group, with an equal number of participants in each group (i.e. 30). They will be recruited via the SONA system, and the description will state the length of the experiment, the credit/payment given in exchange for participation, and a brief description of the procedure. In addition, similar ads for recruitment will be placed on social networks and university websites. Inclusion criteria: normal or corrected-to normal vision. Exclusion criteria (post-experimental): for each participant, if the average of either dependent measure (i.e. RT or accuracy) is larger than 2.5 SD in absolute terms, as calculated for each participant in comparison with the entire group average. In addition, participants with severe depression (BDI score over 28) will also be excluded.", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "We will manipulate 2 between-subjects variables: type of background (white or complex) and type of stimulus (phylogenetic or ontogenetic). In addition, 2 within-subjects variables will be manipulated: type of cue (threatening or neutral, i.e. spiders and birds in the phylogenetic group of guns and phone in the ontogenetic group) and type of target (similarly to the cue, threatening or neutral).", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "We will measure accuracy rates and reaction time for correct responses. In addition, participants will fill out the State Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale, and Fear of Spiders Questionnaire. A-priori and a-posteriori expectancy will also be measured. These will be quantified using a visual analogue scale (VAS), each time asking participants how often they expect to encounter the threatening stimulus (0%-100%) before the experiment, and similarly asking them how much they have encountered the threatening stimulus (0%-100%) after the experiment. \nPerceived disgust, dangerousness, uncontrollablility and unpredictability of spiders and questions from the Phobic Origin Questionnaire (POQ) questions will be included. The first 4 dimensions will be rated on a 1-7 scale (\"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree\"), while POQ questions have 3 categorical answers (\"yes\", \"no\", \"I don't know\").\nIn addition, participants will be asked to rate the valence of 30 random pictures (i.e. pleasantness and unpleasantness scales), and if they felt that they responded faster to a specific target. Each scale will be rated on a 0-8 scale (\"not pleasant/unpleasant at all\" to \"very pleasant/unpleasant\").", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "Attention bias toward spiders = RT toward bird targets minus RT toward spider targets (regardless of cue). The same index will be applied to phones in the ontogenetic group.\nFacilitation of cue toward spider targets = RT toward trials of bird cue-spider target minus spider cue-spider target. The same index will be applied to phones in the ontogenetic group.", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "1.\tMain analysis of RT and accuracy: A 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be conducted on the RT and accuracy rate data, with stimulus type (phylogenetic, ontogenetic) and background (complex, white) as the between-subject factors and cue (bird, spider in phylogenetic; phone, gun in ontogenetic) and target (bird, spider in phylogenetic; phone, gun in ontogenetic) as the within-subject factors.\nWe expect to find a triple interaction between stimulus type \u00d7 cue \u00d7 target, such that the interaction between cue and target will differ between ontogenetic and phylogenetic groups. In the phylogenetic group, we expect to find a replication of previous results (Aue et al., 2013, 2016, 2018), such that facilitation of cue will only be found toward bird targets, and not toward spider targets. In other words, RT and accuracy toward spider targets will not differ as a function of the type of cue (valid or invalid). In the ontogenetic group, we similarly expect to find a replication of previous results (Abado et al. Unpublished), such that facilitation of cue will only be found toward phone targets, and not toward gun targets. In other words, RT and accuracy toward phone targets will not differ as a function of the type of cue (valid or invalid). In addition, based on previous findings, we do not expect to find attention bias toward guns.\n2.\tQuestionnaires: BDI will be used for exclusion, while FSQ, STAI (state) and IOU will enter two exploratory hierarchical regression models for each calculated index (attention bias and facilitation). The predictors will include stimulus type (phylogenetic /ontogenetic), background type (complex/white), and the three questionnaires, as well as the interaction of each questionnaire with the two between-subject variables.\n3.\tA-priori VAS and post experimental questionnaire: as previous studies have found that there is equal a-priori bias toward phylogenetic and ontogenetic stimuli regardless of fear level (Kennedey, Rapee and Mazurski, 1996; M\u00fchlberger et al., 2006), we expect a replication of these findings. Thus, although each target appears equally often, we expect participants to overestimate the appearance of threatening stimuli (i.e.to choose a probability of over 50%). Additionally, in these same studies (Kennedey et al., 1996; M\u00fchlberger et al., 2006), a-posteriori bias found only toward phylogenetic stimuli and among high-fear participants. As we will recruit a random sample of participants, we expect that most of them will be low-fearful, and thus we expect a-posteriori bias to be equal in both phylogenetic and ontogenetic groups, and that it will be lower than the a-priori bias.\nNon-parametric tests will be conducted on the data from the question regarding RT. This question would ask participants if they felt that they have reacted faster to a specific targets. In the case of the phylogenetic group, we expect that participants will explicitly choose \u201cyes, I responded faster to spider targets compared to bird targets\u201d. Thus, as fear is characterized by explicit irrational beliefs, we believe that participants will be able to acknowledge that they react faster toward spiders, compared to birds (Arntz et al., 1993). In the ontogenetic group, we expect one of two findings: as previous studies (Abado et al., unpublished) have found a bias toward phones, participants might similarly acknowledge this bias. However, as attention might be drawn toward phones for different reasons than for spiders, participants might not be able to acknowledge this bias. Regarding the manipulation check question, it is predicted that all participants will correctly indicate on the scale that the verbal cues were mostly valid. In other words, the mean of this measure is expected to be over 50%, with no differences across the four between-subject groups.\nRegarding the questions regarding phobic learning, and perceived disgust, danger, uncontrollability and unpredictability, we expect that the latter 4 dimensions will reduce unexplained variance to the expected attention bias toward spiders found in the phylogenetic groups. Regarding phobic learning, the questions are exploratory and we have no specific hypotheses for this dimension. \n4.\tPost experimental valence measure: A 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be conducted on valence data, with stimulus type  (phylogenetic, ontogenetic) and background (complex, white) as the between-subject factors and scale type (pleasant, unpleasant) as the within-subject factors. As our previous studies have found an attention bias toward mobile phones in an ontogenetic experiment, we expect that mobile phones will receive mixed responses (i.e. both pleasant and unpleasant), while guns will be wholly unpleasant and not pleasant at all. Staplers are expected to be neutral on both scales. In the phylogenetic group, we expect spiders to be wholly unpleasant and not pleasant at all, while birds and butterflies are mildly pleasant and not unpleasant at all.", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=xh7um", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "xh7um", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "xh7um", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/6eu3z/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "6eu3z", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/abxpv/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "abxpv", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/xh7um/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xh7um/"}}], "links": {"first": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json", "last": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "prev": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=545", "next": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "meta": {"total": 5469, "per_page": 10}}}
