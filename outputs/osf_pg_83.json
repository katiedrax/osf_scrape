Gigerenzer (2018) postulates that researchers\u2019 widespread faith in statistical ritual is a contributing factor, and the possibility that the emphasis on statistical significance (via p-values) could alter research design and analysis. These attitudes, held by researchers, can lead to scientific misconduct (Tijdink, Verbeke and Smulders,2014) or at the very least honest errors (Sacco and Brown, 2019). \nThis study examines a set of actions that sit within a grey area called Questionable Research Practices (QRP\u2019s), which are often open to interpretation and differing tolerance levels within Higher Education establishments. The variation in student attitudes has been demonstrated to be directly influenced by the attitudes and endorsements of dissertation and thesis supervisors (Krishna and Peters, 2018). \nThe aim of the study is to examine the programmatic influences on final year undergraduate students\u2019 perception of QRP\u2019s. The study will conceptually replicate the previous work of Krishna and Peters (2018) with a focus on programmatic influences and not on supervisor attitudes. The questionnaire used is a combination of a replication of Krishna and Peters\u2019 and additional adapted questions to examine programme effects.\nThe study is a collaboration between 13 University psychology departments, each has contributed a set of questions to a main Qualtrics questionnaire. This main questionnaire is answered in full by all participants, however I have only used data from my own contributed questions. Therefore, I have excluded data from other universities that is not relevant to my research question.\nIn addition to the student Qualtrics questionnaire I have compiled an additional questionnaire for the programme leaders. It evaluates their perception as to the level of knowledge of QRP\u2019s that psychology graduates would have upon completion of their statistics, methods and analysis programme (based on the inclusion of Open science teaching within their programme). The questionnaire also explored whether Open Science and reproducibility is included in any other modules within the programme.\nReferences \nGigerenzer, G.

L., Moyer-Gus\u00e9, E., and Byrne, S., 2007; Cline, T. W., &amp; Kellaris, J. J., 2007; Blanc, N., &amp; Brigaud, E., 2014). Thus, humorous appeals to persuade individuals to follow COVID-19 related preventative measures may help engage audiences and increase behavior change. Humorous messages, however, can take various forms, including, but not limited to irony, sarcasm, mockery and satire (Holbert et al., 2011; Polk et al., 2009). In the current study, we focus on mocking forms of humor, which can lead to more unfavorable evaluations of the target of the joke (Becker, 2012). By mocking the behavior of individuals who do not follow physical distancing recommendations when they could, we might encourage audiences to follow these recommendations when possible. Here, recognizing that not everyone has the luxury to avoid all contact with others, we manipulate humor in appeals such that these humorous messages ridicule individuals who are not following social distancing recommendations, despite being in positions that afford them the ability to do so. \nHere, we will focus on participants who will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions, as part of a larger study (https://osf.io/8hn2g/) that has 5 total conditions.\n\nIn this study, participants will either be exposed to 1) messages framed humorously, or 2) control messages. We test the effects of these messages primarily on (1) perceptions of norms about social distancing, (2) favorability of message (i.e., the extent to which the message makes the person want to follow social distance recommendations), and (3) intention to share the message. We compare the effects of humorous messages, and control messages which are not framed humorously.\n\nReferences\nBecker, A. B. (2012).

The proxy server collects the data by tracking which students signed in and every time they switched websites or web apps by tracking HTTP requests.

The following questions were answered based on the rankings of a Likert scale: Rate how interested you were during the class? Rate how motivated you were during the class?
