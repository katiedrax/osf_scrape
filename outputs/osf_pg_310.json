Manipulation"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Roos Doekemeijer, C. Nico Boehler, Frederick Verbruggen"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "In accordance with Logan and Cowan\u2019s (1984) horse race model, it is widely believed that the success of inhibiting an ongoing response depends on (1) the latency of the ongoing go process (measured as \u2018go RT\u2019), (2) the latency of the stop process (\u2018SSRT\u2019), and the delay between the onsets of these two processes (\u2018SSD\u2019). As the SSRT cannot be observed directly, it is typically estimated from the information at hand, e.g., by using the integration approach or Bayesian parameter estimation. Using such methods, researchers have been able to examine within- and between-individual differences in SSRT. As a specific example, research has found that rewarding correctly inhibited responses reduces SSRTs (e.g., Boehler, Hopf, Stoppel, &amp; Krebs, 2012).\t\n \tPeculiarly, the vast majority of said research has operated under the assumption that the stop process occurs without fail, although the concept of \u2018trigger failures\u2019 (i.e., failures to start the stop process) has been around for over 25 years. It has been proposed that some differences attributed to differences in SSRT might actually reflect differences in the rates of trigger failures instead (Logan, 1994). To address this major concern, a recent method (BEESTS-WTF; Matzke, Love, &amp; Heathcote, 2017) was developed that accounts for the possibility of trigger failure (P_TF) when estimating SSRTs. \n \tSo far, we have employed BEESTS-WTF to reanalyze data from four of our previous studies (Boehler et al., 2012 (two separate behavioral studies); Schevernels, Krebs, Bombeke, &amp; Boehler, 2015; Boehler, Schevernels, Hopf, Stoppel, &amp; Krebs, 2014). In all four studies, we had used a stimulus-reward association set-up (in which the stop stimulus in a stop-signal task could be presented in one of two colors, one color was associated with reward, the other wasn\u2019t) and obtained SSRTs via traditional non-parametric SSRT estimation (i.e., integration approach). From the initial analyses, we had concluded that rewarding inhibition led to shorter SSRTs. Yet, from the re-analyses of the data using BEESTS-WTF, we concluded that the effect of reward was driven by a decrease in trigger failure rather than by a decrease in SSRTs. Overall, there appears to be a convergence across these earlier studies that most of the difference in rewarded and non-rewarded behavior is not in the core SSRT \u2014as has been believed previously\u2014 but in a differential rate of trigger failures. \n \tNevertheless, these findings are limited due to the properties of the re-examined studies. Firstly, all four studies had relatively small sample sizes (ranging from 16 to 19 participants). Secondly, the general context between the studies differed considerably (i.e., the data sets originated from two behavioral studies, an EEG study, and an fMRI study), so the data sets could not be considered parts of single data set. Finally, and most importantly, all studies had used a stimulus-reward association set-up, with two different types of stop stimuli randomly intermixed within blocks. This was used to avoid any SSRT estimation problems caused by behavioral differences in the go trials. However, this particularity of the experiment could have triggered some mechanistic implementation of the reward effect (e.g., feature-based attention that enabled the superior processing of one color over that of the other) that is unlikely to play a role in other response inhibition set-ups, which ultimately confines the generalizability of our findings.\n \tIn the present study, we therefore aim to replicate our previous findings on the effect of reward on SSRTs and trigger failure rate in a more typical response inhibition set-up, i.e., we plan to manipulate reward across separate task blocks, use stop stimuli that are identical across reward manipulation, and simply signal reward availability by instruction. Overall, we intend to set up and employ an online, within-subjects experiment in full accordance to a recent consensus paper (Verbruggen et al., 2019), to analyze the acquired data using the integration approach, BEESTS without accounting for trigger failures (\u2018standard BEESTS\u2019; Matzke, Dolan, Logan, Brown, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2013), and BEESTS-WTF."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Based on our findings obtained from the re-analyses of existing data sets, we expect that rewarding successful inhibition (1) decreases SSRTs according to the integration approach and standard BEESTS, (2) does not affect SSRTs, but rather reduces the rate of trigger failures according to BEESTS-WTF, compared to not rewarding successful inhibition."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

We intend to employ five blocks of each type and will alternate them within individuals. Whether participants start with a \u2018no reward\u2019 block or a reward block will be counterbalanced.\n\nBefore the start of the experimental blocks, participants will be asked for their consent, their Prolific ID, their age and their gender. Next, participants will receive a practice block, consisting of three parts. In the first part, participants will be instructed to respond to the go stimuli (a green arrow pointing left or a green arrow pointing right) using the appropriate response keys (pressing the left arrow key to the left-pointing arrow or the right arrow key to the right-pointing arrow); 12 balanced go trials follow in random order, in which the participants will receive immediate feedback. \t\n \tIn the second part, participants will be instructed to stop their response in the presence of an added stop stimulus (a red box surrounding the go stimulus) presented after a variable delay and are warned that they should try to perform appropriately in both tasks without strategically slowing down their responses to the go stimuli; 40 randomized practice trials, of which 10 stop trials (balanced over go stimuli); again receiving immediate feedback.\n \tIn the final part, the participants will be informed that (1) in some of the upcoming blocks they can earn 10 points for successfully inhibiting their response, while not in others; (2) they will be informed about the block type at the start of each block and that symbols (\u2018#\u2019 in the no reward blocks; \u2018\u00a3\u2019 in the reward blocks) will be put in a diamond shape on their screen around the area of the task-relevant stimuli as a reminder of the block type; (3) their final score will amount to a monetary bonus after the experiment, given that they performed adequately on the both the go and stop task; (4) for every 10 points, they will earn \u00a30.05, to a maximum of 600 points (amounting to \u00a33; explained using a table); (5) they cannot pause the experiment (lasting about 35 more minutes) beyond short fixed-duration breaks once they decide to continue.\n\nWithin each of the 10 experimental blocks, each participant is to perform 96 trials of the visual-visual Stop-Signal Task (SST), totaling to 960 trials. Each of these 960 trials starts with a 250 ms fixation point, followed by a go stimulus for 600 ms, then a blank screen for some variable duration (between 750 and 950 ms, steps of 1/60 seconds using a boxcar distribution). Note that these desired delays might differ slightly from the actual delays due to the browser\u2019s refresh rate; to get the closest to our desired delays, we will therefore throttle the refresh rate of each participant to 60 Hz.\n \tIn the 72 go trials (i.e., representing 75% of the trials), the participant is to respond to the go stimulus as fast and accurately as possible, at the very latest before the start of the new trial. So, in our experiment, the participants will be able to respond during stimulus presentation but also still during the blank screen. Nevertheless, we will strongly encourage them to respond fast. \n \tIn the 24 stop trials (25% of trials), a red box will appear around the go stimulus after a delay (i.e., the stop-signal delay, SSD), indicating to the participant that they should inhibit their response. If the participant is successful in inhibiting their response, they will earn 10 points in a \u2018reward\u2019 block and no points in a \u2018no reward\u2019 block, which will be converted to a monetary bonus at the end of the experiment (\u00a30.05 for every 10 points to a maximum of 600 points, \u00a33). Moreover, the SSD will be updated dynamically based on the participant\u2019s success on these stop trials: if the participant is successful in inhibiting their response, the SSD will be decreased by 50 ms (to a minimum of 50 ms); if not, the SSD will be increased by 50 ms (to a maximum of 550 ms). We will employ two independent staircases, one of for each block type, and will employ an additional staircase for the practice block. The starting value of this SSD staircase in the practice block will be set to 200 ms for each participant, then the starting values of experimental staircases will be set to the final SSD of the practice block and will not be reset during the experiment.\n\tAt the end of each block, participants will receive an overview of their performance (average RT, the proportion of correctly inhibited stop trials and total points earned so far) of the past block and of the previous block of the same type. Additionally, participants will receive explicit feedback messages according to their performance: (1) if the participant missed 2% or more of the go stimuli in the past block, they will be reminded to respond to the direction of the arrows and to not omit any responses; (2) if the participant missed between 2% and 7% of the go stimuli in total, they will be told that they risk the possibility that they will not receive their monetary bonus; if the participant missed 15% or more of the go stimuli in total, they will be told that they will not receive their monetary bonus after the experiment; (3) if the participant responded to 70% of the stop trials, they will be reminded to stop their response in presence of the red box; and (4) if the participant has considerably slowed down (more than a 10% increase in their average reaction time), they will be urged to stop waiting to see whether the red box will appear.\n\nFinally, the participants will be asked to fill out a short version of the \u201cUrgency, Premeditation (lack of), Perseverance (lack of), Sensation Seeking, Positive Urgency, Impulsive Behavior Scale\u201d (sUPPS-P; Lynam, 2013; questionnaire retrieved from Cyders, Littlefield, Coffey, &amp; Karyadi, 2014), and asked whether they felt motivated by the reward manipulation to perform better on the task.

Nico Boehler, Frederick Verbruggen", "q3": "In accordance with Logan and Cowan\u2019s (1984) horse race model, it is widely believed that the success of inhibiting an ongoing response depends on (1) the latency of the ongoing go process (measured as \u2018go RT\u2019), (2) the latency of the stop process (\u2018SSRT\u2019), and the delay between the onsets of these two processes (\u2018SSD\u2019). As the SSRT cannot be observed directly, it is typically estimated from the information at hand, e.g., by using the integration approach or Bayesian parameter estimation. Using such methods, researchers have been able to examine within- and between-individual differences in SSRT. As a specific example, research has found that rewarding correctly inhibited responses reduces SSRTs (e.g., Boehler, Hopf, Stoppel, &amp; Krebs, 2012).\t\n \tPeculiarly, the vast majority of said research has operated under the assumption that the stop process occurs without fail, although the concept of \u2018trigger failures\u2019 (i.e., failures to start the stop process) has been around for over 25 years. It has been proposed that some differences attributed to differences in SSRT might actually reflect differences in the rates of trigger failures instead (Logan, 1994). To address this major concern, a recent method (BEESTS-WTF; Matzke, Love, &amp; Heathcote, 2017) was developed that accounts for the possibility of trigger failure (P_TF) when estimating SSRTs. \n \tSo far, we have employed BEESTS-WTF to reanalyze data from four of our previous studies (Boehler et al., 2012 (two separate behavioral studies); Schevernels, Krebs, Bombeke, &amp; Boehler, 2015; Boehler, Schevernels, Hopf, Stoppel, &amp; Krebs, 2014). In all four studies, we had used a stimulus-reward association set-up (in which the stop stimulus in a stop-signal task could be presented in one of two colors, one color was associated with reward, the other wasn\u2019t) and obtained SSRTs via traditional non-parametric SSRT estimation (i.e., integration approach). From the initial analyses, we had concluded that rewarding inhibition led to shorter SSRTs. Yet, from the re-analyses of the data using BEESTS-WTF, we concluded that the effect of reward was driven by a decrease in trigger failure rather than by a decrease in SSRTs. Overall, there appears to be a convergence across these earlier studies that most of the difference in rewarded and non-rewarded behavior is not in the core SSRT \u2014as has been believed previously\u2014 but in a differential rate of trigger failures. \n \tNevertheless, these findings are limited due to the properties of the re-examined studies. Firstly, all four studies had relatively small sample sizes (ranging from 16 to 19 participants). Secondly, the general context between the studies differed considerably (i.e., the data sets originated from two behavioral studies, an EEG study, and an fMRI study), so the data sets could not be considered parts of single data set. Finally, and most importantly, all studies had used a stimulus-reward association set-up, with two different types of stop stimuli randomly intermixed within blocks. This was used to avoid any SSRT estimation problems caused by behavioral differences in the go trials. However, this particularity of the experiment could have triggered some mechanistic implementation of the reward effect (e.g., feature-based attention that enabled the superior processing of one color over that of the other) that is unlikely to play a role in other response inhibition set-ups, which ultimately confines the generalizability of our findings.\n \tIn the present study, we therefore aim to replicate our previous findings on the effect of reward on SSRTs and trigger failure rate in a more typical response inhibition set-up, i.e., we plan to manipulate reward across separate task blocks, use stop stimuli that are identical across reward manipulation, and simply signal reward availability by instruction. Overall, we intend to set up and employ an online, within-subjects experiment in full accordance to a recent consensus paper (Verbruggen et al., 2019), to analyze the acquired data using the integration approach, BEESTS without accounting for trigger failures (\u2018standard BEESTS\u2019; Matzke, Dolan, Logan, Brown, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2013), and BEESTS-WTF.", "q4": "Based on our findings obtained from the re-analyses of existing data sets, we expect that rewarding successful inhibition (1) decreases SSRTs according to the integration approach and standard BEESTS, (2) does not affect SSRTs, but rather reduces the rate of trigger failures according to BEESTS-WTF, compared to not rewarding successful inhibition.", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

We intend to employ five blocks of each type and will alternate them within individuals. Whether participants start with a \u2018no reward\u2019 block or a reward block will be counterbalanced.\n\nBefore the start of the experimental blocks, participants will be asked for their consent, their Prolific ID, their age and their gender. Next, participants will receive a practice block, consisting of three parts. In the first part, participants will be instructed to respond to the go stimuli (a green arrow pointing left or a green arrow pointing right) using the appropriate response keys (pressing the left arrow key to the left-pointing arrow or the right arrow key to the right-pointing arrow); 12 balanced go trials follow in random order, in which the participants will receive immediate feedback. \t\n \tIn the second part, participants will be instructed to stop their response in the presence of an added stop stimulus (a red box surrounding the go stimulus) presented after a variable delay and are warned that they should try to perform appropriately in both tasks without strategically slowing down their responses to the go stimuli; 40 randomized practice trials, of which 10 stop trials (balanced over go stimuli); again receiving immediate feedback.\n \tIn the final part, the participants will be informed that (1) in some of the upcoming blocks they can earn 10 points for successfully inhibiting their response, while not in others; (2) they will be informed about the block type at the start of each block and that symbols (\u2018#\u2019 in the no reward blocks; \u2018\u00a3\u2019 in the reward blocks) will be put in a diamond shape on their screen around the area of the task-relevant stimuli as a reminder of the block type; (3) their final score will amount to a monetary bonus after the experiment, given that they performed adequately on the both the go and stop task; (4) for every 10 points, they will earn \u00a30.05, to a maximum of 600 points (amounting to \u00a33; explained using a table); (5) they cannot pause the experiment (lasting about 35 more minutes) beyond short fixed-duration breaks once they decide to continue.\n\nWithin each of the 10 experimental blocks, each participant is to perform 96 trials of the visual-visual Stop-Signal Task (SST), totaling to 960 trials. Each of these 960 trials starts with a 250 ms fixation point, followed by a go stimulus for 600 ms, then a blank screen for some variable duration (between 750 and 950 ms, steps of 1/60 seconds using a boxcar distribution). Note that these desired delays might differ slightly from the actual delays due to the browser\u2019s refresh rate; to get the closest to our desired delays, we will therefore throttle the refresh rate of each participant to 60 Hz.\n \tIn the 72 go trials (i.e., representing 75% of the trials), the participant is to respond to the go stimulus as fast and accurately as possible, at the very latest before the start of the new trial. So, in our experiment, the participants will be able to respond during stimulus presentation but also still during the blank screen. Nevertheless, we will strongly encourage them to respond fast. \n \tIn the 24 stop trials (25% of trials), a red box will appear around the go stimulus after a delay (i.e., the stop-signal delay, SSD), indicating to the participant that they should inhibit their response. If the participant is successful in inhibiting their response, they will earn 10 points in a \u2018reward\u2019 block and no points in a \u2018no reward\u2019 block, which will be converted to a monetary bonus at the end of the experiment (\u00a30.05 for every 10 points to a maximum of 600 points, \u00a33). Moreover, the SSD will be updated dynamically based on the participant\u2019s success on these stop trials: if the participant is successful in inhibiting their response, the SSD will be decreased by 50 ms (to a minimum of 50 ms); if not, the SSD will be increased by 50 ms (to a maximum of 550 ms).

Additionally, participants will receive explicit feedback messages according to their performance: (1) if the participant missed 2% or more of the go stimuli in the past block, they will be reminded to respond to the direction of the arrows and to not omit any responses; (2) if the participant missed between 2% and 7% of the go stimuli in total, they will be told that they risk the possibility that they will not receive their monetary bonus; if the participant missed 15% or more of the go stimuli in total, they will be told that they will not receive their monetary bonus after the experiment; (3) if the participant responded to 70% of the stop trials, they will be reminded to stop their response in presence of the red box; and (4) if the participant has considerably slowed down (more than a 10% increase in their average reaction time), they will be urged to stop waiting to see whether the red box will appear.\n\nFinally, the participants will be asked to fill out a short version of the \u201cUrgency, Premeditation (lack of), Perseverance (lack of), Sensation Seeking, Positive Urgency, Impulsive Behavior Scale\u201d (sUPPS-P; Lynam, 2013; questionnaire retrieved from Cyders, Littlefield, Coffey, &amp; Karyadi, 2014), and asked whether they felt motivated by the reward manipulation to perform better on the task.

As such, we do not intend to include this in our planned analysis.\n", "item28": "1) observing faster reaction times and reduced errors in the central visual field relative to the mean of the left and right visual fields.\n2) observing faster reaction times and reduced errors in the right visual field relative to the left visual field.\n3) a facilitative effect of orthographic neighbourhood in the left visual field (i.e., right hemisphere) and an inhibitory effect of orthographic neighbourhood in the right visual field (left hemisphere) in reaction times for word targets. \n\nWhile we plan on analysing error rate, it may not be sensitive enough to capture the effects of orthographic N. Thus, it is not part of our criteria for successful replication. \n"}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href":
