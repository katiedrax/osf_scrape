DV4: For robustness purposes, a second 22-point index will be created that takes into account that some firms may be partially compliant, but still in violation of the draft regulation. This index will score compliance for each indicator using a two-point measure (fully compliant=2/partially compliant=1/0=non-compliant). DV5-16: Each component of the index will be run separately as a dichotomous variable (compliant=1, non-compliant=0). This will be analyzed as a linear probability model with probit models used for robustness tests. Fixed effects for randomization blocs. DV17-28: Each component of the index will be run using the two-point measure of partial compliance. The will be analyzed using OLS with ordered probit models using for robustness testing.

These economic crises have also been associated with other serious problems, like the democratic deficit, terrorism, and conflict. Scholars and policy makers believe that stable governments in this region\u2014and certainly democratic ones\u2014will not arise unless there is substantial economic progress. This progress depends on the extent to which these countries can reform and globalize, that is, integrate their national economies into the much larger global economy. But will MENA publics and powerful domestic groups accept such changes? Any serious reform program must be attentive to public preferences. This project focuses on the micro-foundations of the politics of globalization and economic reform in MENA. It examines individual preferences toward globalization and economic reform. This project presents a novel analysis, using original data on public opinion from our own surveys and experiments, of the factors that condition support for and opposition to economic reform and globalization. Further, it develops a causal account of these factors. It examines economic reform in terms of government intervention in the economy through taxes and spending. It focuses on globalization in terms of international trade and direct foreign investment (DFI).\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"These economic models of politics lead to our first three major hypotheses: Hypothesis 1a: The greater an individual\u2019s skill level, the less likely they are to support globalization. Hypothesis 1b: Support for globalization will be highest among those who work in export-oriented sectors of the economy, and it will be lowest among those who work in import-competing sectors. Intermediate levels of support for globalization are likely for those who work in the public sector or are unemployed. Hypothesis 1c: Support for maintaining or increasing the government\u2019s role in the economy will be greatest among those most strongly opposed to globalization. And increases in globalization will further enhance their demands for government intervention. Sociocultural and Political Models and Hypotheses: As previously described, there are several non-economic factors that can also affect preferences for globalization. We group these socio-cultural factors into one set of hypotheses, examining four different aspects of them. Muslim societies are also divided by debate over the role of religion in political and social life. (Ayoubi, 1995; Esposito, 1998). A look at current developments across the Middle East illustrates the extent of this secular/religious divide. One strand of this argument holds that those who espouse a strong commitment to Islam in politics are also those more worried that globalization might introduce anti-Islamic practices into their countries. Hypothesis 2a: The greater an individual\u2019s level support for Islam in politics, the less likely they are to support globalization. Furthermore, some studies show that religion\u2014both overall religiosity and different religions themselves\u2014matters for public policy preferences. Individuals\u2019 attitudes toward various public policies are affected by their religious beliefs. Most studies find that religiosity is linked to less support for a government role in redistribution and social protections (Roemer 1998; Hungerman 2005; Scheve and Stasavage 2006; Huber and Stanig 2011). Further, in terms of globalization, as it relates to religion, Hays et al. (2005) show that religiosity negatively affects support for trade among individuals in a sample of advanced industrial countries. Our focus is MENA and Muslim nations in particular. Hypothesis 2c: The greater an individual\u2019s religiosity, the less likely they are to support globalization. On the other hand, those who are more Islamist or more religious may not view the government as the best place to provide social welfare and they may prefer that non-state organizations, like charitable societies and mosques, provide such compensation and welfare (Benthall and Bellion-Jourdan, 2003; Karshenas and Moghadam, 2006; Jawad, 2009; Jawad and Yakut-Cakar, 2010; Cammett and Issar, 2010). \u201cIn the MENA region, due to poor public administration capacity (OECD, 2010), the governance architecture of the welfare regimes is highly decentralized. Access to social services and distribution of welfare benefits depend, for the most part, on non-state religious actors\u201d (Cerami, 2013: 9). Thus, we test the following hypothesis as well: Hypotheses 2d: Citizens who are more religious or Islamist will be less supportive of globalization and government intervention. Citizens of MENA hold some of the most inegalitarian attitudes toward women in the world. These attitudes may color views toward globalization as well. Citizens may be worried that globalization will lead to the transmission of ideas that may undermine the existing socio-cultural environment that favors a patriarchal order. These attitudes toward gender roles are shaped by intolerance (Fish, 2002; Inglehart and Norris, 2003; Jamal and Langohr, 2009). And these high levels of intolerance do not bode well for globalization (Diamond 1996, Huntington 1993). With rapid change, citizens hold more strongly to status quo beliefs and values, especially on gender roles (Mahmood, 2005; Deeb, 2006; Al-Ali, 2000; Jamal and Nooruddin, 2012). If globalization and trade bring in foreign values and promote rapid changes in society, they may be most feared by those with the most traditional values. Hypothesis 2e: Citizens who held more traditional, inegalitarian attitudes toward gender equality are more likely to oppose globalization. Our survey contains a large number of questions that allow us to examine these hypotheses.\""}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "\"For the last 14 months, we have developed survey experiments that will allow us to examine the effects of economic and sociocultural factors on preferences toward globalization and economic reform. We build on existing household surveys in the region and differentiate individuals into formal vs informal occupations, skill levels, and specific employment sectors. Our instrument offers one of the most detailed and comprehensive measurements of employment patterns in MENA. Survey data are useful to create a full picture of what a nationally representative sample thinks about globalization. Unfortunately, it can rarely tell us anything causal about what induces such preferences. In order to obtain a causal understanding, we need to conduct experiments. In these, we seek to manipulate some feature of the independent variables discussed above and see if this changes preferences toward globalization and economic reform. We thus \u201ctreat\u201d a randomly drawn group with one manipulation of an independent variable and see if their responses to the globalization and government role questions differ from those of the control group who were not \u201ctreated.\u201d We perform two experiments. Each will be administered to half the population in our sample (N=5000). In the first experiment we focus on trade and we manipulate the economic gains and losses from globalization by sector and skill level. Through our questions, we are able to identify each respondent\u2019s (or main income earner in their family\u2019s) sector of occupation. We can then place them within one of four categories (import-competing, export-oriented, non-traded; public sector). We ask a standard question to everyone about trade. But for two groups we provide them with more info. One group, our second control, gives them information on their sector of occupation and whether it is affected by trade and how it is. Our experiments then treat a random set of individuals within each sector with information about the gains or losses they may experience from increasing trade depending on their position within the economy (import-competing, export-oriented, non-traded; public sector; high or low skill). To avoid deception, we rely on economic forecasts to inform our primes. We then ask whether the treated group responds in accordance with our economic models outlined above. If so, then we have more confirmation that individual material economic gains and losses cause support and opposition to globalization and economic reform among the public. Our second experiment frames globalization in different sociocultural and political ways to see if non-economic factors shape attitudes toward globalization and economic reform. In this experiment we tell each respondent that direct foreign investment has created many jobs. While we tell them this, a randomly selected group sees one of 6 pictures about the jobs created. Each picture has the same base setting: it features a call center staffed by young people, implying these are the fortunate ones getting the new jobs. Each picture then has one thing that varies from this baseline. One picture has the flag of the major Islamist party, Ennahda, one has all men in ordinary modern dress; one has all women in modern dress; one has women in traditional dress; and one has men in traditional dress. We test whether priming people with various cultural and political symbols can affect their attitudes toward globalization. In line with hypotheses 2(a-e) above, we expect that those treated with these pictures will respond differently to our globalization and reform questions than those in our control group. In particular we expect the following: H1: Secularists will oppose globalization if it is seen as benefiting Islamist and religious segments of the population; conversely Islamists and religious segments of the population will oppose globalization if it seen as benefiting secularists. H2: We expect that men in general will oppose globalization if it is seen as benefiting women. We expect this finding to be strongest among traditional, Islamist supporting and religious males. Again, this priming allows us to explore the causal aspects of how cultural factors affect support or opposition to globalization. In order to see if the shifts that might have behavioral consequences, we also ask respondents to sign a petition that will be delivered to the appropriate government agency in support for greater trade or direct foreign investment. Examples from the Experiments: Trade Experiment: Control #1 for the Export Group Some people have suggested placing new limits on foreign imports in order to protect Tunisian jobs. Others say that such limits would raise consumer prices and hurt Tunisian exports. Do you favor or oppose placing new limits on imports of foreign goods and services? Trade Experiment: Control #2 for the Export Group You indicated earlier that [you / the main income earner] [work / works / worked] in the [insert industry pipe] industry. This sector is heavily involved in international trade; that is, it exports a lot of its products or services to other countries. Some people have suggested placing new limits on foreign imports in order to protect Tunisian jobs. Others say that such limits would raise consumer prices and hurt Tunisian exports. Do you favor or oppose placing new limits on imports of foreign goods and services? Trade Experiment: Treatment #1Priming the Gains from Globalization You indicated earlier that [you / the main income earner] [work / works / worked] in the [insert industry pipe] industry. This sector is heavily involved in international trade; that is, it exports a lot of its products or services to other countries. In the future, economists predict that Tunisia's trade will grow very substantially. This means that exports in [your / his / her] sector will grow much larger so that wages and jobs in [your / his / her] sector may increase. Some people have suggested placing new limits on foreign imports in order to protect Tunisian jobs. Others say that such limits would raise consumer prices and hurt Tunisian exports. Do you favor or oppose placing new limits on imports of foreign goods and services? We ask this question framed differently to the three other groups, those associated with import-competing sectors, public, and non-traded ones. A list of post-experiment questions will also be asked to assess whether the treatments moved individual preferences according to the hypotheses above. We have included manipulation checks to guarantee reliability and validation of the experiment. DFI Experiment Control: The investment of foreign firms in Tunisia has contributed to the creation of tens of thousands of new jobs in the county. A number of foreign firms are planning to invest in Tunisia. DFI Experiment Treatment 1: Priming Support for Ennahda with the Ennahda flag The investment of foreign firms in Tunisia has contributed to the creation of tens of thousands of new jobs in the county, like the ones in the picture below.

This is by far the most sophisticated and detailed instrument to be deployed in MENA on sector and skill level of employment to date. We have built on existing household surveys in each country and on studies by the World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Bank, and other economic agencies. Moderators. We include many variables that will be used as demographics, moderators or covariates: gender, class, education, urban/rural, political Ideology, and religiosity. Causal Mediators. We include mediating variables that will allow us to discern the causal mechanisms underlying our hypotheses. These mechanisms derive from both economic and non-economic theories of preferences. We focus on six: 1. Labor Market Position and Competition, 2. Tolerance (in-Group vs out-group and social identity theory), 3. Risk Propensity and Status Quo Bias; 4. Job Insecurity (formal vs informal employment, public vs private employment), 5. Inequality aversion and 6.

I hope to study this question in a future survey experiment using Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk, which will provide a large pool of respondents with a range of political beliefs and levels of sophistication. In that study, I plan to use the most common method of inducing disfluency, which is giving participants text in a hard-to-read font. Before I can begin my larger study on politics, however, I will first conduct a shorter study at Dartmouth College to determine whether disfluency is effective online, as other studies have all been lab-based. It is important to verify that disfluency effects can be achieved online given concerns like participants zooming in on disfluent text or having short attention spans on phones and computers. Like Alter et al. (2007), I will test the effects of disfluency by giving participants the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), a three-item measure of the ability to reject intuitive wrong answers and arrive at the correct response (Frederick, 2005). I will randomly assign participants to take the CRT in one of five fonts, one fluent and four disfluent, expanding on Alter et al.\u2019s one font in an effort to find the most effective way of inducing disfluency. This cannot be done on Mechanical Turk because its users are often familiar with the CRT, and knowing the answers would negate any experimental effects. The CRT has often been tested at universities, however, and there is no reason to believe that disfluency operates any differently for university students. While selective universities have been shown to yield higher average CRT scores than national samples, disfluency has a universal impact as it involves the visual and mental processing of information that occurs for everyone.

What characteristics separate them from other residents in their neighborhoods? This study focuses on a pervasive type of broker in urban India\u2014informal slum leaders. We seek to investigate the origins of hierarchy in clientelistic spaces, and study the processes through which informal leaders emerge within proliferating slums. Based on extensive prior fieldwork, we identity five attributes that influence assessments over aspiring slum leaders\u2014(1) education; (2) caste and religion; (3) party affiliation; (4) region of origin; and (5) occupation. Drawing on a conjoint survey experiment design, we seek to illuminate relative preferences for these characteristics in the construction of settlement leadership. Two fictitious candidates for the position of slum president (basti adyaksh) will be presented to survey respondents. Respondents will be asked to choose the leader they prefer for a settlement \u201clike their own.\u201d The specific elements of the five attributes will randomly vary across the two candidates, affording the co-investigators leverage over identifying the effects of each of the attributes. We also seek to capture preferences for who moves into the settlement\u2014what types of people do respondents prefer to be their neighbor? This will allow us to directly compare preferences for informal leaders (vertical considerations) versus everyday residents (horizontal considerations). A conjoint experiment will be administered to respondents in which they are asked which of two hypothetical individuals they would prefer as neighbors. The same attributes presented in the leader experiment will be randomly assigned to the two individuals. The order of the two experiments will be randomly assigned to avoid priming due to question ordering. A related and final experimental question will examine social identity salience as an outcome variable. India\u2019s urban slums are dramatically diverse spaces along the lines of caste, religion, and region of origin. Dense living conditions and pervasive vulnerabilities compel residents to look toward others to help mitigate risk and collectively act to advance their common interests. In the socially novel context of urban slums, why do some identities become politically salient while others lie dormant? Under what conditions do the fault-lines of activated identities change, particularly in response to the vulnerabilities that slum dwellers face on a daily basis? In particular, do the different types of goods slum residents seek from their governments activate identities of varying breadth from the menu available to them? Respondents will either receive one of two treatments (a radio interview on ration cards or public sewers), a placebo (a radio interview on cotton clothing), or no radio address. The ration card radio interview is intended to prime respondents to think about a narrow private good. The sewer radio interview is intended to prime respondents to think about a more encompassing public good in their settlement. Respondents will then be asked to rank the importance of the following four social identities: caste, religion, region of origin, and settlement. The survey will be administered in a stratified random sample of 100 slums, 50 in Jaipur, Rajasthan and 50 in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. 2100 households will be sampled across the 100 slums. Households will be selected as follows. First, high-resolution satellite images will be generated for each sampled settlement from Google Earth. Next, pixels will be randomly selected and marked on the images. Enumerators will then be assigned the sampled households."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Both co-investigators have conducted extensive qualitative fieldwork among the urban poor in India. Based on this fieldwork, we derived several traits we believed to be important in informing leadership selection in slum settlements. These include: H1: Education: More educated leaders are preferred to less educated leaders. H2: Occupation: H2a: Leaders whose occupations endow them with vertical connectivity to the municipal government are preferred to those whose occupations do not. H2b: Leaders whose occupations endow them horizontal connectivity to other slum dwellers are preferred to those whose occupations do not. H3: Partisanship: Co-partisan leaders are preferred to non-co-partisans. H4: Ethnicity: Co-ethnic leaders are preferred to non-co-ethnic leaders. Dimensions of co-ethnicity: jati (caste), religion, and region-of-origin. H1-H4 are assessed through the forced-choice conjoint design described above. The main measure is a general preference for one of the two candidates for a slum leadership position. Some of these traits (notably ethnicity and partisanship) have long been viewed as important in formal leadership selection within India and other developing democracies. Yet there is little work identifying their importance in informal leadership/broker selection. Second, some of these traits (notably education and occupation) have explicitly not been seen as important as selection criteria for leaders in \u2018patronage-democracies\u2019 like India\u2019s. Second, we anticipate variations in the strengths of the attributes tested in H1-H4, depending on the nature of the good the leader is expected to provide. For club goods that are indivisible within the slum, residents primarily care about a leader\u2019s ability to procure the good. We hypothesize that a leader\u2019s capability (i.e. education) and vertical connectivity are more important in such decisions, relative to co-ethnicity, co-partisanship, and horizontally connected occupations. By contrast we hypothesize that co-ethnicity, co-partisanship, and horizontally connected occupations are relatively more desirable leadership traits when respondents consider goods that are divisible within the slum. For such goods respondents must consider not only whether a leader can get the required good, but whether they are likely to distribute that good to their household specifically. The above discussion can be summarized by the following hypothesis: H5: Relative to co-ethnicity, co-partisanship, and horizontally connected occupation effects, education and vertically connected occupation effects will be relatively stronger (weaker) in evaluations of potential leaders as providers of club goods (private goods). We test H5 by measuring responses to leadership preferences on the conjoint experiment in terms of delivering specific club goods (water supply) and private goods (ration cards for purchasing subsidized foods) rather than the general leadership measure. Finally, we hypothesize that education and occupation will prove relatively more important than co-ethnicity in vertical political preferences than horizontal social preferences. In particular we anticipate education and occupation to be more desired attributes of informal slum leaders than potential neighbors, relative to co-ethnicity. We test this expectation by replicating the forced-choice conjoint design, but asking respondents to evaluate hypothetical individuals as potential neighbors rather than slum leaders. H6: Education and occupation effects will be stronger (weaker) relative to co-ethnicity effects in evaluations of potential slum leaders (neighbors) than potential slum neighbors (leaders). Priming Experiment We also hypothesize that the salience of different social identities of slum residents varies with the breadth of a problem/good they are primed to think about. Specifically, we hypothesize: H1: Respondents primed to think of private household goods are more likely to prioritize narrow social identities (specifically caste) than the control group. H2: Respondents primed to think of club goods are more likely to prioritize broader social identities (specifically settlement) than the control group. To test H1 and H2 we present respondents with 1-2 minute fake radio news segments. One radio news segment highlights the problem of accessing a private good (ration card), and one highlights the problem of obtaining a club good (sewer line). The segments are designed to be as similar as possible, and were recorded by professional radio personalities. Half of the control group will be made to listen to a placebo news segment unrelated to the outcome of interest (the benefits of cotton clothes over polyester clothes in the summer), and the other half will receive no news segment. Following the news segments and two simple follow-up questions to ensure respondent comprehension, we ask respondents to rank order four social identities using illustrative cards: caste, settlement, region of origin, and religion. The latter two fall between the former two in terms of breadth within the settlement, although which of these two proves more encompassing varies across different slum settlements."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "The primary statistical tests that will be used to test these hypotheses will be OLS regressions with indicator variables for different treatments.

In the socially novel context of urban slums, why do some identities become politically salient while others lie dormant? Under what conditions do the fault-lines of activated identities change, particularly in response to the vulnerabilities that slum dwellers face on a daily basis? In particular, do the different types of goods slum residents seek from their governments activate identities of varying breadth from the menu available to them? Respondents will either receive one of two treatments (a radio interview on ration cards or public sewers), a placebo (a radio interview on cotton clothing), or no radio address. The ration card radio interview is intended to prime respondents to think about a narrow private good. The sewer radio interview is intended to prime respondents to think about a more encompassing public good in their settlement. Respondents will then be asked to rank the importance of the following four social identities: caste, religion, region of origin, and settlement. The survey will be administered in a stratified random sample of 100 slums, 50 in Jaipur, Rajasthan and 50 in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. 2100 households will be sampled across the 100 slums. Households will be selected as follows. First, high-resolution satellite images will be generated for each sampled settlement from Google Earth. Next, pixels will be randomly selected and marked on the images. Enumerators will then be assigned the sampled households.", "q16": "Both co-investigators have conducted extensive qualitative fieldwork among the urban poor in India. Based on this fieldwork, we derived several traits we believed to be important in informing leadership selection in slum settlements. These include: H1: Education: More educated leaders are preferred to less educated leaders. H2: Occupation: H2a: Leaders whose occupations endow them with vertical connectivity to the municipal government are preferred to those whose occupations do not. H2b: Leaders whose occupations endow them horizontal connectivity to other slum dwellers are preferred to those whose occupations do not. H3: Partisanship: Co-partisan leaders are preferred to non-co-partisans. H4: Ethnicity: Co-ethnic leaders are preferred to non-co-ethnic leaders. Dimensions of co-ethnicity: jati (caste), religion, and region-of-origin. H1-H4 are assessed through the forced-choice conjoint design described above. The main measure is a general preference for one of the two candidates for a slum leadership position. Some of these traits (notably ethnicity and partisanship) have long been viewed as important in formal leadership selection within India and other developing democracies. Yet there is little work identifying their importance in informal leadership/broker selection. Second, some of these traits (notably education and occupation) have explicitly not been seen as important as selection criteria for leaders in \u2018patronage-democracies\u2019 like India\u2019s. Second, we anticipate variations in the strengths of the attributes tested in H1-H4, depending on the nature of the good the leader is expected to provide. For club goods that are indivisible within the slum, residents primarily care about a leader\u2019s ability to procure the good. We hypothesize that a leader\u2019s capability (i.e. education) and vertical connectivity are more important in such decisions, relative to co-ethnicity, co-partisanship, and horizontally connected occupations. By contrast we hypothesize that co-ethnicity, co-partisanship, and horizontally connected occupations are relatively more desirable leadership traits when respondents consider goods that are divisible within the slum. For such goods respondents must consider not only whether a leader can get the required good, but whether they are likely to distribute that good to their household specifically. The above discussion can be summarized by the following hypothesis: H5: Relative to co-ethnicity, co-partisanship, and horizontally connected occupation effects, education and vertically connected occupation effects will be relatively stronger (weaker) in evaluations of potential leaders as providers of club goods (private goods). We test H5 by measuring responses to leadership preferences on the conjoint experiment in terms of delivering specific club goods (water supply) and private goods (ration cards for purchasing subsidized foods) rather than the general leadership measure. Finally, we hypothesize that education and occupation will prove relatively more important than co-ethnicity in vertical political preferences than horizontal social preferences. In particular we anticipate education and occupation to be more desired attributes of informal slum leaders than potential neighbors, relative to co-ethnicity. We test this expectation by replicating the forced-choice conjoint design, but asking respondents to evaluate hypothetical individuals as potential neighbors rather than slum leaders. H6: Education and occupation effects will be stronger (weaker) relative to co-ethnicity effects in evaluations of potential slum leaders (neighbors) than potential slum neighbors (leaders). Priming Experiment We also hypothesize that the salience of different social identities of slum residents varies with the breadth of a problem/good they are primed to think about. Specifically, we hypothesize: H1: Respondents primed to think of private household goods are more likely to prioritize narrow social identities (specifically caste) than the control group. H2: Respondents primed to think of club goods are more likely to prioritize broader social identities (specifically settlement) than the control group. To test H1 and H2 we present respondents with 1-2 minute fake radio news segments. One radio news segment highlights the problem of accessing a private good (ration card), and one highlights the problem of obtaining a club good (sewer line). The segments are designed to be as similar as possible, and were recorded by professional radio personalities. Half of the control group will be made to listen to a placebo news segment unrelated to the outcome of interest (the benefits of cotton clothes over polyester clothes in the summer), and the other half will receive no news segment. Following the news segments and two simple follow-up questions to ensure respondent comprehension, we ask respondents to rank order four social identities using illustrative cards: caste, settlement, region of origin, and religion. The latter two fall between the former two in terms of breadth within the settlement, although which of these two proves more encompassing varies across different slum settlements.", "q17": "The primary statistical tests that will be used to test these hypotheses will be OLS regressions with indicator variables for different treatments. We will initially only include slum-level fixed effects, but additional models will include relevant control variables. We will also test interaction effects between the different treatment attributes. Finally, we will examine heterogeneous treatment effects based on slum age and ethnic diversity.", "q18": "India", "q19": "", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "", "q25": "",
