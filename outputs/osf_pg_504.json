"Method\n\nParticipants\nData from XX participants were used (M = XX, SD = XX), XX were women. All participants were L2 psychology students from the University of Poitiers recruited by the \"cr\u00e9dit cours\" system. The participants were randomly assigned to one of the 2 conditions of an between-subject plan 2 (Role: Surgeon, Internal).\n\nMaterial, procedure and variables\nThe material was translated from Lammers and Stapel, (2011). After filling out a consent form, the participants started a slideshow first presenting the subject of the experiment. A photo of a hospital patient also appeared on this first slide. Then a power induction per scenario was first performed. Half of the participants read a slide which placed them in the role of a senior surgeon (High power condition: N = XX). More specifically, each participant in this group read that he was a senior surgeon, head of department of visceral surgery. In his activity, he was the one who made the decisions regarding the treatment of patients in their department. He was therefore alone in deciding what will be applied, without outside supervision. The rest of the participants read a text placing them in a junior surgeon role (Low power condition: N = XX). The text stated that as a junior surgeon in the service, the participant had not completed his studies. Within his activity, he examined patients and could offer treatments. However, his proposals were supervised by the surgeons and / or the department head. In the end, it was not he who made the decision. For participants trained in senior as well as junior surgeon, they were asked to think about the activities of their role for 1 minute.\nThe participants then learned about the case of a patient suffering from a deviation of the intestinal wall. This patient, 56 years old and teacher, is admitted to the visceral surgery department with a rare anomaly of the abdominal wall. This defect, a deviation from the wall, can cause long-term problems, but this deviation can be treated and there are two treatment options. Additional information concerning the patient was added, notably concerning his activities during his pre-operative stay: \u201cHe reads, watches television, and also spends time on his mobile phone. [He] is walking in the corridors or watching people pass by the window of his room. \u201d This pseudo-relevant information is intended to add information concerning the target (the patient) without being relevant.\n\nMeasures\nParticipants had to choose between two treatments. The first (treatment A) can be performed under general anesthesia and is therefore painless for the patient who can return home after a few days. The downside of Treatment A is that there is an approximately 20 to 25% chance of complications occurring. If this happens, the operation must be performed again, with an unknown probability of success. As for the second treatment (treatment B), no anesthesia is possible, which makes it painful and unpleasant for the patient who remains conscious during the operation. But treatment B has the great advantage of having guaranteed efficacy and 0% risk of complications. The choice was made on a 9-point scale opposing the two treatments.\nParticipants were then asked to assign 10 traits to patients, expressing on a 9-point scale whether these traits corresponded from not at all (1) to completely (9) to the patient. Six of these traits (cold, lacks responsiveness, passive, superficial, lacks depth and sensitive) referred to characteristics linked to mechanistic dehumanization (\u03b1 = .XX). An average dehumanization score was calculated. Four of these traits (funny, smart, sober and generous) referred to a dimension of judgment unrelated to dehumanization (\u03b1 = .XX)\nFinally, the participants answered 4 items (Your opinion has influence, You carry little weight, You have power, You have little control over events) aiming to measure the degree of power that was conferred on them according to their role (\u03b1 = XX). They gave their level of agreement on a 9-point scale ranging from (1) strongly disagree to (9) completely agree. An average Feeling of Power score was calculated.

We will assess the results of our search based on repeated methodologies, research questions, and procedures between the studies that are of interest to our posed research questions. Specifically, we are seeking studies that incorporate the following: 1. Utilize aspen stand exclosures and control plots to manipulate ungulate browsing; 2. Analyze young aspen fitness traits (measured as size, growth rate, density, survival) in fenced areas designed to exclude ungulates and in reference areas from which ungulates are not excluded. We will not exclude that are missing data for modifier variables. Initial screenings will consist of reading titles and abstracts. Based on this initial screening, any articles that are clearly outside the scope of these criteria will be disregarded. Subsequent full-text screenings will further assess each article for the criteria outlined (1-2) from the abstract screening stage. We will complete a thorough examination of the methods and results sections to extract data. The screening will be completed by two researchers.

If any moderator data are missing for any effect sizes, we will conduct this analysis twice, once including only effect sizes with data for all moderators (though excluding any moderators that would require reducing sample size below 60 effect sizes), and another time excluding any moderators lacking data for any effect sizes (i.e., including only moderators with no missing data). \n3.

They were asked to give a rating every time they were prompted to. The experimentor asked them every 10 seconds for a minute.\n\nBefore starting the clock (hidden to the participants), the experimentor then showed them a picture (either of their romantic partner or a stranger, thus forming the two conditions) and asked to concentrate on them 'as if they were physically present with us here'.\n\nAfter which they were thanked, given a towel and a chocolate (if desired) and told the rationale for the experiment.\n\nH2:\nThe same procedure was used for the second hypothesis. However, participants repeated the procedure twice (at different times as to forget about the ratings they reported and avoid repetition effects or habituation), once with a photo of their romantic partner, and once with a picture of a stranger.\nFor the second group, however, the experiment differed only in that participants were asked to come with a romantic partner or were presented with a stranger (same as in the photo conditions) to be present (holding their other hand) during the cold pressure task.", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question1c": "Two groups depending on if the romantic partner is physically present or not.", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question2c": "1: A independent sample t-test between two groups.\nA Bayesian t-test (independent samples) with Dienes calculator (R script) using the 'room to move' heuristic (Dienes, preprint).", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question3c": "1: IVs presence or image of romantic partner.\n   DV : pain rating scores (pooled over the 6 ratings given over a minute (cf. procedure).\n\n", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question4c": "none", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question5c": "BF (\u00e0 la Dienes) of &lt; 1/3 = evidence towards no differences.\nBF (\u00e0 la Dienes) of &gt; 3 = evidence for a difference between conditions", "confirmatory-analyses-third.third.question1c": "", "confirmatory-analyses-third.third.question2c": "", "confirmatory-analyses-third.third.question3c": "", "confirmatory-analyses-third.third.question4c": "", "confirmatory-analyses-third.third.question5c": "", "description-methods.planned-sample.question4b": "Equal number of both genders (see McClelland, L.E., McCubbin, J.A., 2008 for rationale).\nAll participants must be adults with a romantic partner.", "description-methods.planned-sample.question5b": "Participants will be recruited on university campus.
