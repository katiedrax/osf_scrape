For example, although Roma populations in Greece have been legally integrated through the extension of citizenship, they continue to live on the margins of society, economically and socially segregated from the majority ethnic Greek population because of sustained discrimination. The example of Greece highlights an interesting paradox. The humanitarian, public policy, and academic communities have long held that the extension of legal rights to vulnerable migrants will ease their economic, social, and political integration, bolstering living standards and quality of life. According to this logic, we would expect that providing access to legal rights, in turn, changes the broader community's perceptions of this marginalized out-group. However, in Greece, we see the power of sustained out-group prejudice outweighing the expected effect of extension of legal rights. This begs the question of whether out-group prejudice decrease when paired with a normative assertion about the international legal rights of the marginalized out-group. As such, this research project examines Greeks\u2019 generosity as a function of the ethnic identity of aid recipients. As a secondary experiment, we also examine whether a reference to fundamental rights can reduce out-group prejudice (in terms of generosity). To do so, we are working with Prolepsis, a Greek NGO, and major mobile carriers in Greece to conduct a nationwide SMS text message experiment from March 25th to 29th, 2016. This study offers the first rigorous experimental approach to examining ethnic Greeks\u2019 generosity towards out-groups--particularly, toward their highly stigmatized and often segregated Roma populations. Although this SMS experiment is part of a larger project focusing on migrants as the out-group category, we have selected our focus as the Roma out-group in particular because our findings can serve to represent the baseline level of antipathy toward a well-known out-group, given that the Roma stigmatization is so strongly recognized in the literature. Even more importantly, this study contributes to the understanding of when pleas to aid a vulnerable out-group are effective. We thereby actually measure behavioral change, examining whether a reminder employing the language of fundamental rights (i. e., \u201cEvery child has a right to food\u201d) can reduce out-group prejudice. In sum, the most innovative element of this research is project is that we can actually operationalize out-group prejudice (via discrepancies in respondents\u2019 willingness to donate one Euro) and then measure behavioral changes (examining whether this discrepancy is reduced when we invoke a normative frame of legal rights).

As such, the three mobile carriers have reached out to their customers and asked if they would be willing to receive text messages. These mobile carriers created a pool of 590,000 individuals who they send text messages to on a regular basis requesting small, financial donations for NGOs.

leaders, reducing leakage and improving outcomes. However, in many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, development resources are often controlled at the local level by unelected local leaders, including both appointed commissioners and traditional chiefs. These leaders cannot be directly sanctioned by voters, raising the question of whether and how transparency might translate to better outcomes . The effects of transparency on the behavior of hereditary leaders in particular are difficult to predict, as we have little recent literature on the mechanism by which these leaders are accountable, and to whom. This pre-analysis plan presents the intended analysis of pilot study for a larger project on transparency, accountability and leakage among various types of local leaders in African countries. The pilot is intended to determine the feasibility of our intended test; generate evidence on how and to whom traditional leaders in Malawi are accountable; and provide initial evidence as to whether dissemination of information to the appropriate principals will reduce diversion."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: Traditional leaders are more likely to face sanctions from senior officials than from citizens. 1a.

Leaders were randomly chosen from a roster of leaders in the district. In the interviews, we asked the leaders to explain what they would expect their citizens, senior chiefs, and other government officials, to do if they were to make \u201ca bad decision\u201d. We then asked them what a \u201cbad decision\u201d would entail from the perspective of each of these actors. We also conducted two citizen focus groups of five people in each of the five districts (50 subjects total). Participants for the focus groups were recruited from those passing through a busy intersection; enumerators were instructed to maximize diversity in terms of age, gender, and apparent wealth. Focus group participants were asked to report on their ability and willingness to take action against their traditional leaders; whether those actions were effective; and the type of malfeasance that spurred the action. (See attached appendix for full battery of questions.) To analyse the results, we will determine whether the frequencies in the data accord with predictions; the sample is far too small for statistical power. We will use qualitative analysis produce a listing of the types of malfeasance that superiors and citizens care about, and the mechanisms of sanction, if any, that each of these actors have recourse to. Part Two In the experimental portion of the design, we provided a valuable development good \u2013 iron sheets \u2013 to local traditional leaders. We randomized whether leaders were told they would be audited, the intensity of the audit they were told to expect, and who would receive information about their decision. The study was conducted among a random sample of 200 traditional leaders, five from each of forty villages across eight districts. Chiefs and communities who participated in the qualitative portion of the study were excluded from the experimental sample. A trained enumerator arranged a visit with each chief, and informed him that he would be receiving two iron sheets to give to a needy household in the community. In a face-to-face interaction with the enumerator, the leader identified and described the characteristics of the two neediest households in the community, as well as the two households most in need of permanent roofing materials in particular. The enumerator then read one of four randomly assigned scripts that informed the leader whether he could expect an audit, and of what type. The control group was not informed about any auditing and told simply to distribute the sheets as they saw fit. Those in three treatments conditions were audited. Those in treatment two (basic audit) were told we would call in a few weeks to learn name of the household to whom they provided the sheets. Those in treatment two were told we would call and return to the site to photograph the household that received the sheets. Those in treatment four were told they would be called, photographed, and that we would send letters to their district-level officials acknowledging receipt of the sheets and indicating the name of the household they had selected to receive them. After the script was read, the leaders were then asked to identify the one household to which they intended to provide the iron sheets; this could be one the households already identified as poor, or it could be another household entirely. This is the household that was named in the letter to the district officials. The source of variation in the data is twofold. There are cross-subject treatments that assign leaders assigned to one treatment as opposed to another. There are also within-subject treatments: all leaders identified households in need of iron sheeting both before and after learning they would (or would not) be subject to an audit. Regardless of the assigned treatment, we returned to every site and conducted a post-treatment focus group.

However, in many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, development resources are often controlled at the local level by unelected local leaders, including both appointed commissioners and traditional chiefs. These leaders cannot be directly sanctioned by voters, raising the question of whether and how transparency might translate to better outcomes . The effects of transparency on the behavior of hereditary leaders in particular are difficult to predict, as we have little recent literature on the mechanism by which these leaders are accountable, and to whom. This pre-analysis plan presents the intended analysis of pilot study for a larger project on transparency, accountability and leakage among various types of local leaders in African countries. The pilot is intended to determine the feasibility of our intended test; generate evidence on how and to whom traditional leaders in Malawi are accountable; and provide initial evidence as to whether dissemination of information to the appropriate principals will reduce diversion.", "q16": "H1: Traditional leaders are more likely to face sanctions from senior officials than from citizens. 1a. Traditional leaders will be more likely to say they expect negative consequences for a bad decision from senior officials than from citizens. 1b. Citizens in a minority of communities will report successful citizen action against a badly performing leader. 1c. Diversion of resources will be identified as a decision leading to sanctions by more than half of leaders. H2. Provision of information to a chief\u2019s superiors will reduce diversion more than provision of information to the leaders\u2019 citizens. 2a. There will be less diversion under top-down transparency (D) than bottom-up transparency (C) 2b. The increase in the poverty of ``needy\u2019\u2019 households reported after leaders learn about the audit, relative to that of the households reported before, will be greater under top-down transparency (D) than under bottom-up transparency (C). H3. Low-cost audits that do not allow for independent verification of distribution will neither reduce diversion, nor allow us to measure it accurately. 3a. There will be an equal amount of diversion under basic audit (B) and control. 3b. There will be no increase in the poverty of ``needy\u2019\u2019 households reported after leaders learn about the basic audit (B), relative to that of the households reported before. 3c.

The difference between the effects of top-down and bottom-up monitoring should be smaller in areas where the chief has lived in the village a long time and shares the ethnicity of most people in the village.", "q17": "Part One We conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 traditional leaders, at the village and village-group level, from a total of five districts. Leaders were randomly chosen from a roster of leaders in the district. In the interviews, we asked the leaders to explain what they would expect their citizens, senior chiefs, and other government officials, to do if they were to make \u201ca bad decision\u201d. We then asked them what a \u201cbad decision\u201d would entail from the perspective of each of these actors. We also conducted two citizen focus groups of five people in each of the five districts (50 subjects total). Participants for the focus groups were recruited from those passing through a busy intersection; enumerators were instructed to maximize diversity in terms of age, gender, and apparent wealth. Focus group participants were asked to report on their ability and willingness to take action against their traditional leaders; whether those actions were effective; and the type of malfeasance that spurred the action. (See attached appendix for full battery of questions.) To analyse the results, we will determine whether the frequencies in the data accord with predictions; the sample is far too small for statistical power. We will use qualitative analysis produce a listing of the types of malfeasance that superiors and citizens care about, and the mechanisms of sanction, if any, that each of these actors have recourse to. Part Two In the experimental portion of the design, we provided a valuable development good \u2013 iron sheets \u2013 to local traditional leaders. We randomized whether leaders were told they would be audited, the intensity of the audit they were told to expect, and who would receive information about their decision. The study was conducted among a random sample of 200 traditional leaders, five from each of forty villages across eight districts. Chiefs and communities who participated in the qualitative portion of the study were excluded from the experimental sample. A trained enumerator arranged a visit with each chief, and informed him that he would be receiving two iron sheets to give to a needy household in the community. In a face-to-face interaction with the enumerator, the leader identified and described the characteristics of the two neediest households in the community, as well as the two households most in need of permanent roofing materials in particular. The enumerator then read one of four randomly assigned scripts that informed the leader whether he could expect an audit, and of what type. The control group was not informed about any auditing and told simply to distribute the sheets as they saw fit. Those in three treatments conditions were audited. Those in treatment two (basic audit) were told we would call in a few weeks to learn name of the household to whom they provided the sheets. Those in treatment two were told we would call and return to the site to photograph the household that received the sheets. Those in treatment four were told they would be called, photographed, and that we would send letters to their district-level officials acknowledging receipt of the sheets and indicating the name of the household they had selected to receive them. After the script was read, the leaders were then asked to identify the one household to which they intended to provide the iron sheets; this could be one the households already identified as poor, or it could be another household entirely. This is the household that was named in the letter to the district officials. The source of variation in the data is twofold. There are cross-subject treatments that assign leaders assigned to one treatment as opposed to another. There are also within-subject treatments: all leaders identified households in need of iron sheeting both before and after learning they would (or would not) be subject to an audit. Regardless of the assigned treatment, we returned to every site and conducted a post-treatment focus group. The focus groups, composed of people who were unconnected to the chief but well-informed about community business, independently reported the characteristics of the four households the leaders told us were needy before treatment; the characteristics of the household the leader said would receive the sheet after treatment; and the characteristics of the household (if any) that actually received the sheets. We will compare means with an appropriate hypothesis test (e.g. t-test). We will set the threshold for a significant effect at p=0.05. We will also generate two more sets of estimates: logit coefficients with district-level fixed effects, and logit coefficients with a full set of controls: \u2022 The straight-line distance between

The study should contribute to our understanding of the relationship between policy design, social construction of target populations, and partisan cues. It will also contribute to the literatures on the submerged state and the politics of welfare retrenchment and durability, as the study is based on a politically durable social welfare program (the Earned Income Tax Credit)."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypothesis 1a - Racially resentful Americans assume that policies that construct beneficiaries as deserving of benefits are less likely than policies without such features to benefit African-Americans without benefiting whites.

Hypothesis 2a - Americans are more likely to assume that social welfare policies constructed as unconditional cash payments are supported solely by the Democratic Party relative to those constructed as tax breaks or with conditions. Hypothesis 2b - Americans are more likely to assume that social welfare policies constructed as tax breaks or with conditions are supported solely by the Republican Party relative to those constructed as tax breaks.

The experimental question will be based on a description of the real Earned Income Tax Credit but will vary in terms of two key policy dimensions: delivery as a tax credit vs. a cash payment and the presence or absence of a work requirement. (See the attached questionnaire for the text of the experimental question.) Respondents will then be asked to rate their approval of the policy on a seven-point scale, and to identify which social groups (including racial groups) they think would benefit from the policy as well as which major party they think is likely to support it. Hypotheses on beneficiary group assumptions will be tested using logit models where the key independent variables will be interaction terms of the experimental treatment indicators with the predispositions of interest (racial resentment, anti-immigrant views). Hypotheses on partisan assumptions will be tested with simple logit models with no interactions (equivalent to difference-of-proportions tests between the treatment categories).

The study should contribute to our understanding of the relationship between policy design, social construction of target populations, and partisan cues. It will also contribute to the literatures on the submerged state and the politics of welfare retrenchment and durability, as the study is based on a politically durable social welfare program (the Earned Income Tax Credit).", "q16": "Hypothesis 1a - Racially resentful Americans assume that policies that construct beneficiaries as deserving of benefits are less likely than policies without such features to benefit African-Americans without benefiting whites. Hypothesis 1b - Americans with anti-immigration views assume that policies that construct beneficiaries as deserving of benefits are less likely than policies without such features to benefit immigrants without benefiting native-born Americans. Hypothesis 2a - Americans are more likely to assume that social welfare policies constructed as unconditional cash payments are supported solely by the Democratic Party relative to those constructed as tax breaks or with conditions. Hypothesis 2b - Americans are more likely to assume that social welfare policies constructed as tax breaks or with conditions are supported solely by the Republican Party relative to those constructed as tax breaks. Hypothesis 3a - When an element of policy design cues an individual to associate the policy with African Americans, attitudes about African Americans will become more important to the individual's assessment of the policy. Hypothesis 3b - When an element of policy design cues an individual to associate the policy with immigrants, attitudes about immigrants will become more important to the individual's assessment of the policy.

The experimental question will be based on a description of the real Earned Income Tax Credit but will vary in terms of two key policy dimensions: delivery as a tax credit vs. a cash payment and the presence or absence of a work requirement. (See the attached questionnaire for the text of the experimental question.) Respondents will then be asked to rate their approval of the policy on a seven-point scale, and to identify which social groups (including racial groups) they think would benefit from the policy as well as which major party they think is likely to support it. Hypotheses on beneficiary group assumptions will be tested using logit models where the key independent variables will be interaction terms of the experimental treatment indicators with the predispositions of interest (racial resentment, anti-immigrant views). Hypotheses on partisan assumptions will be tested with simple logit models with no interactions (equivalent to difference-of-proportions tests between the treatment categories).
