correlated with feelings and attitudes against breastfeeding in public. Negative attitudes of both men and women toward public breastfeeding can be related to a dichotomous view of women. Negative attitudes toward public breastfeeding might stem from the difficulty to view breasts, which are considered as sexual, in the maternal context of breastfeeding.
