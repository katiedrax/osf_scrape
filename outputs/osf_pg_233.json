Families will be excluded if the child has been diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy. Each family will have one parent (or primary caregiver) and one child participating in the program. Participating primary caregivers will be those who 1) undertake the responsibility for the daily care of the child for at least five days a week and 2) provide informed consent to participate in the research. There will be no additional exclusion criteria. Despite the fact that the service will be provided in Beijing, recruitment will not be restricted to families in Beijing, but open to families from every administrative division in China.\n\n1.2 Facilitators\nProgram facilitators will be employees of the NGO in Beijing. Only facilitators who have provided informed consent will participate in the assessment of the program implementation.\n\n1.3 NGO managers\nThe NGO managers consist of the founder, CEO, and program development officers of the NGO. Five NGO managers will be invited to take part in an interview, but only those who agree and provide informed consent, will take part. \n\n2 Study setting\nThe program will be delivered in the SREIA venues in the Chaoyang District of Beijing. Both sites are physically close to each other and located at the east border of the inner city of Beijing and away from the city center, but with easy access to public transportation.\n\n3. Recruitment of families\nEnrolment will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Potential participants will first be recruited from an existing waiting list for the SREIA program. When necessary, more participants will be recruited online, by word of mouth, or by referrals from other service agencies and hospitals. It will be made explicit to potential participants that these two rounds of parent training are delivered for the purpose of evaluation. Families will decide which round of delivery and which version to attend according to their own preference and availability. Staff will provide information sheets and introduce the study to families who intend to attend the parent training before they are officially enrolled. Families will be able to contact the research team regarding project details or any concerns, before they give written consent. Participation in the study will be voluntary. Parents who are not willing to participate in the study will be advised to attend the training after the evaluation. On rare occasions, there may be parents who insist in attending the training during the evaluation but prefer not to provide data; those parents will be enrolled in the program but will not be required to participate in the research. \n\n4. Incentives\nFamily participants will be offered discounts on program fees. Facilitators and NGO manager will not be given any reimbursement but will receive a formal Thank You letter for participation in the research."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "The study will be conducted in routine service settings and involve two waves of routine delivery of the SREIA program.

The review conducted by Fang et al. (2020, forthcoming) showed that parent training programs for families of children with ASD aged one to eleven in China had an effect size of g = -1.37 (95% CI [-2.03, -0.71]) on child emotional and behavioral problems, whereas Postorino et al. (2017) found a smaller effect size SMD=-0.59 (95% CI, [-0.88, -0.30]) in reducing disruptive behaviors in children with ASD aged between two to fourteen years. The power calculation was based on Postorino et al. (2017) in order to increase the statistical power. The sample size calculation shows that with a significance level of 0.05 and statistical power of 0.8 in a two-sample, two-tailed t-test, the sample size necessary to detect any significant effect is 94 (47 in each arm). \n\nSince the study will be conducted in a routine setting by an NGO with limited capacity, it will involve two rounds of delivery with a maximum sample size of 100 (50 in the first round serving as the treatment group and 50 in the second round as the waitlist control). This will enable a minimal detectable effect size of g = -0.56 on the primary outcome measure. Based previous delivery of the program to date, parents are typically highly committed, contributing to a low program attrition rate of 2% in the past three years. Allowing for this level of attrition, the proposed sample size can still give a detectable change in the region of approximately g = 0.57. If the attrition is increased to 5%, the sample will only be able to detect a slightly larger effect size of g = 0.58. The two rounds of delivery will also in total comprise of 60 families in Version A and 40 in Version B, which can potentially detect a difference of g = 0.57 in the two versions. \n"}, "q15": {"extra": [], "value": "Not applicable"}, "q16": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Intervention: The SREIA Parent Training Program\n\nThe SREIA parent training program was developed by SREIA during the 1990s and has been evolving over the past two decades. The program is grounded in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) [28,29]. It aims to promote positive behaviors and child development by improving parental attitudes and parenting styles. The program targets parent-child dyads from families of children with ASD aged between three and six years. It is delivered five days a week, with three hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon, for 11 weeks. Fourteen two-hour lectures on weekly themes (such as knowledge of ASD, parent-child interaction, and behavior management techniques) are offered throughout the 11 weeks and attended by all participating parents. Weekly topics include 1) knowledge of ASD, 2) Applied Behavioral Analysis, 3) child behavior problems, 4) reinforcement, 5) parent-child communication, 6) differential reinforcement and prompts, 7) fading and shaping, 8) chaining, and 9) generation and maintenance. For the remaining time, additional training in ABA principles and practice are tailored for the different functioning groups. Although a program framework specifies the themes covered each week, there is an inbuilt flexibility in terms of program content and the delivery mode for each session within the week. For example, depending on child ability and parental acquisition of skills, facilitators may decide whether and when to strengthen the basic skills, or to move on to more advanced skills. The program is delivered in person through a combination of individual counselling and group sessions, as well as a mixture of didactic and interactive delivery modes. Some sessions are only for parents, while others are participated in by both parent and child. Childcare is provided during by NGO staff parent group sessions. A wide range of session types and delivery methods are used in the training, such facilitator modeling, parent practicing, and in-vivo feedback.\n\n\nTreatment group will receive the intervention during the 1st wave of delivery.

Outcome measurements:\n\nData will be collected  at baseline (T0), immediately post-intervention (T1), and 6-month post-interventio (T2, conditional to funding). For questionnaires that do not have a Chinese version, the translation followed the WHO guideline of Process of Translation and Adaptation of Instruments (World Health Organization, 2020).\n\n1.1. Primary outcome\nChild behavioral problems will be assessed using the Externalizing scale of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) for Ages 1.5-5 (Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2001). The Externalizing scale measures child attention problems and aggressive behaviors using 24 items rated by parents with a 3-point -type scale. The study will use the CBCL 1.5-5 for all families whose children will be between three to six years old, because 1) it is anticipated that the majority of children will be under six, 2) CBCL 1.5-5 has been shown good internal consistency among children with ASD aged six to seven (Basten et al., 2014), and 3) many items in the Externalizing scale of CBCL 6-18 (such as drink alcohol, lie/cheat, use tobacco or drugs, and truant) are not applicable for children with ASD aged six. Lower scores suggest fewer behavioral problems. Research has shown sufficient test-retest reliability, internal consistency, convergent validity, and cross-cultural validity of CBCL 2-3 and CBCL 4-18 in China (Leung et al., 2006; Liu, Wu, &amp; Yao, 2003; Su, Li, Wan, Yang, &amp; Luo, 1996), but the evidence regarding the validity and reliability of this new version of CBCL 1.5-5 is currently limited. However, the CBCL 1.5-5 has shown good factorial validity among Chinese girls adopted into North American families (Tan, Dedrick, &amp; Marfo, 2007); it has also demonstrated good internal validity with children with ASD (Pandolfi, Magyar, &amp; Dill, 2009).\n\n1.2 Secondary outcomes\nASD symptoms will be assessed using the Chinese version of the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) (Rimland &amp; Edelson, 1999), which comprise four subscales to measure child speech/language/communication, sociability, sensory/cognitive awareness, and health/physical/behavior. The scale has 77 items that are scored by parents. The health/physical/behavior subscale is rated using a 0 (not a problem)-to-3 (serious problem) point scale, whereas the other three subscales are rated using a 0 (not true)-to-2 (very true) point scale. Higher scores represent more ASD symptoms. The ATEC has shown sufficient internal consistency and test-retest reliability internationally and in China (Geier, Kern, &amp; Geier, 2013; Lu, Yang, Shu, &amp; Su, 2004; Magiati, Moss, Yates, Charman, &amp; Howlin, 2011), as well as cross-contextual validity (Jarusiewicz, 2002). \n\nParenting style will be measured using the Over-Reactivity subscale (5 items) of the Arnold-O\u2019Leary Parenting Scale (PS) (Arnold, O\u2019Leary, Wolff, &amp; Acker, 1993), and the Supporting Positive Behavior subscale (7 items) of the Parenting Young Children Scale (PARYC) (McEachern et al., 2012). The PS assesses dysfunctional discipline practices reported by parents using a 7-point Likert-type scale. Higher scores indicate more dysfunctional parenting practices. Sufficient internal consistency and convergent and divergent validity has been demonstrated for the use of PS in Hong Kong (C. Leung, Sanders, Leung, Mak, &amp; Lau, 2003; Zhu, 2018). The PARYC Supporting Positive Behavior subscale is rated by parents from 1 to 7 regarding the frequency with which they engaged in such parenting strategies during the last month. Higher scores represent more positive and proactive parenting practices. The PARYC has exhibited sufficient construct and convergent validity and internal consistency in other studies (McEachern et al., 2012), but there is currently limited evidence regarding validity and reliability in the Chinese population.\n\nParental mental health will be assessed using the Chinese version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 items (DASS-21) (Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995), which consists of three self-report subscales (depression, anxiety, and stress) with each having 7 items that are rated from 0 (not apply to me) to 3 (apply to me very much or most of the time). Higher scores indicate a worse emotional state. The scale has been shown to have good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and cross-cultural validity in China (Chan et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2016). \n\nFamily function will be assessed using the Chinese version of the Family APGAR scale (Smilkstein, Ashworth, &amp; Montano, 1982), which consists of 5 items that are rated from 0 (never) to 2 (often) to examine the five functional components of adaptability, partnership, growth, affection, and resolve. Higher scores indicate that parents are more satisfied with their relationships with other family members. The Chinese version of this scale has demonstrated good internal consistency and test-retest reliability in Chinese population (Lin et al., 2008; Nan et al., 2014; Zheng, Shi, &amp; Mao, 1996).\n\nParental knowledge will be measured using of the scores of several quizzes designed for use with the SREIA program to assess parental understanding and utilization of ABA techniques taught during the sessions. The quizzes on ABA principles and techniques will be administered at all time points in order to compare the change over time. \n\n2 Process evaluation outcomes\nThe implementation of the program will be explored regarding four criteria: program acceptability, participant involvement, program delivery, and sustainability.\n\nProgram Acceptability will be assessed at post-intervention only using a questionnaire based on the Incredible Years\u00ae Autism Program End-of-Course Satisfaction Questionnaire (Incredible Years, n.d.) tailored to the SREIA program and Chinese context. The questionnaire covers a range of topics including overall impression; teaching format; information and techniques; facilitators; and parent groups. It consists of 30 items rated with a 3-point Likert-type scale. High scores represent higher levels of satisfaction.\n\nThe level of participant involvement will be captured by calculating rates of attendance, engagement, and program dropout. The attendance rate will be assessed with an attendance sheet, which will be reported by facilitators and collected twice a day (morning and afternoon); engagement rate will be based on the percentage of families who complete assigned homework and tasks during the practice sessions, using an attendance and engagement registry; program dropout rate will be calculated based on families who miss at least ten days. Participant involvement, as well as program acceptability, will also be assessed using qualitative interviews with parents, focus groups with facilitators and NGO managers, and facilitator supervision sessions. \n\nProgram Delivery will be measured through two dimensions\u2014fidelity and quality of delivery. Implementation fidelity will be measured using facilitator checklists. Facilitators will report whether they deliver the core components prescribed in the manual after each session. The fidelity score will comprise the ratio of delivered components to prescribed components. Dosage will be calculated using hours of delivery. Quality of delivery will be assessed by research staff observing parent group sessions and filling out a quality of delivery survey. The in-depth interviews with NGO managers, focus group discussion with facilitators and supervision notes will also investigate the delivery of the program.\n\nProgram Sustainability will be explored during the qualitative interviews with NGO managers, which will be guided by the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adopt, implementation, and maintenance) framework (Glasgow, Vogt, &amp; Boles, 1999). The interviews will focus on community- and policy-level factors that may affect program sustainability and scale-up.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Not applicable"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q19": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Quantitative data analyses will be conducted using R Studio (R Core Team, 2013). Data analysis will follow the principles of intent-to-treat, which involves assessing all participants as originally allocated, regardless of program dropouts or the dose of treatment they received. Missing data and its association with other variables will be assessed using logistic regression. Where appropriate, full-information maximum likelihood (FIML) will be used to compensate for missing data (Schafer &amp; Graham, 2002).\n\nA table showing the demographic characteristics of participants will be compiled (M\u00b1SD for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables). The analysis will comprise a between-group comparison for the treatment and the waitlist control groups after the first wave of delivery (T1) to investigate the treatment effects.\n\nTo reduce selection bias and improve baseline balance for the between-group comparison, the treatment effects of the intervention will be estimated using a difference-in-differences (DiD) design with inverse propensity score weights (Stuart et al., 2014). The weighting of propensity scores will help to keep all available data in the analysis, in order to improve the statistical power. Propensity scores will be calculated using logistic regression based on key variables that may affect intervention effects, including baseline outcome scores (i.e., child behavior problems, ASD severity, parenting styles, parental mental health, parental knowledge, and family function) and demographic characteristics (i.e., parental education levels and economic status), as well as other variables that demonstrate baseline imbalance. With the propensity scores, the treatment and control groups will be weighted to be balanced on the key variables; weighted regression models will then be fitted for the DiD analyses, which further adjust for unobserved variables and secular time trends. Clustering effects within each treatment condition and child levels of functioning group will also be accounted for. Exploratory statistical analyses will be conducted to understand the differences in treatment effects between the two different versions of delivery. Attrition weights for program dropouts (if any) will be combined. Propensity score weights will be estimated using the TWANG (Toolkit for Weighting and Analysis of Nonequivalent Groups) package in R (Ridgeway, McCaffrey, Morral, Burgette, &amp; Griffin, 2014). \n\nMeans and standard deviations will be calculated for participant satisfaction, attendance rate, engagement rate, program dropout rate, and quality of delivery. Implementation fidelity will be reported using a ratio of delivered components to prescribed components. Regression models will be created to explore potential predictors of participant involvement, as well as investigate possible associations between implementation aspect (i.e., particularly participant involvement and program satisfaction but may also include any salient features identified from the qualitative data analysis) and treatment effects.

(2020, forthcoming) showed that parent training programs for families of children with ASD aged one to eleven in China had an effect size of g = -1.37 (95% CI [-2.03, -0.71]) on child emotional and behavioral problems, whereas Postorino et al. (2017) found a smaller effect size SMD=-0.59 (95% CI, [-0.88, -0.30]) in reducing disruptive behaviors in children with ASD aged between two to fourteen years. The power calculation was based on Postorino et al. (2017) in order to increase the statistical power. The sample size calculation shows that with a significance level of 0.05 and statistical power of 0.8 in a two-sample, two-tailed t-test, the sample size necessary to detect any significant effect is 94 (47 in each arm). \n\nSince the study will be conducted in a routine setting by an NGO with limited capacity, it will involve two rounds of delivery with a maximum sample size of 100 (50 in the first round serving as the treatment group and 50 in the second round as the waitlist control). This will enable a minimal detectable effect size of g = -0.56 on the primary outcome measure. Based previous delivery of the program to date, parents are typically highly committed, contributing to a low program attrition rate of 2% in the past three years. Allowing for this level of attrition, the proposed sample size can still give a detectable change in the region of approximately g = 0.57. If the attrition is increased to 5%, the sample will only be able to detect a slightly larger effect size of g = 0.58. The two rounds of delivery will also in total comprise of 60 families in Version A and 40 in Version B, which can potentially detect a difference of g = 0.57 in the two versions. \n", "q15": "Not applicable", "q20": "There will be no transformation of the data.", "q21": "The means, standard deviations, p-value, and confidence intervals (95%) will be reported.

Mixed methods will be used with a nested design, in which the qualitative approach will be embedded within the quantitative method to better understand the quantitative data obtained (Creswell, 2011). The study will be conducted within the context of routine services and will involve two consecutive deliveries of the SREIA program. One hundred families of children with ASD age three to six will be recruited and allocated to the two waves of delivery with a 1:1 ratio. Participants will be self-selected into either version. The 50 families who choose to participate in the first wave will be the treatment group, and the 50 families in the second wave will service as the waitlist control group. ", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria\n\n1.1 Families\nThe recruitment criteria will follow the existing strategies used by the NGO that provides the SREIA program. The age range of children will be three to six years old, and all participating children will need to meet the diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder according to DSM-V; otherwise, an official letter of ASD diagnosis will need to be provided. Families will be excluded if the child has been diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy. Each family will have one parent (or primary caregiver) and one child participating in the program. Participating primary caregivers will be those who 1) undertake the responsibility for the daily care of the child for at least five days a week and 2) provide informed consent to participate in the research. There will be no additional exclusion criteria. Despite the fact that the service will be provided in Beijing, recruitment will not be restricted to families in Beijing, but open to families from every administrative division in China.\n\n1.2 Facilitators\nProgram facilitators will be employees of the NGO in Beijing. Only facilitators who have provided informed consent will participate in the assessment of the program implementation.\n\n1.3 NGO managers\nThe NGO managers consist of the founder, CEO, and program development officers of the NGO. Five NGO managers will be invited to take part in an interview, but only those who agree and provide informed consent, will take part. \n\n2 Study setting\nThe program will be delivered in the SREIA venues in the Chaoyang District of Beijing. Both sites are physically close to each other and located at the east border of the inner city of Beijing and away from the city center, but with easy access to public transportation.\n\n3. Recruitment of families\nEnrolment will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Potential participants will first be recruited from an existing waiting list for the SREIA program. When necessary, more participants will be recruited online, by word of mouth, or by referrals from other service agencies and hospitals. It will be made explicit to potential participants that these two rounds of parent training are delivered for the purpose of evaluation. Families will decide which round of delivery and which version to attend according to their own preference and availability. Staff will provide information sheets and introduce the study to families who intend to attend the parent training before they are officially enrolled. Families will be able to contact the research team regarding project details or any concerns, before they give written consent. Participation in the study will be voluntary. Parents who are not willing to participate in the study will be advised to attend the training after the evaluation. On rare occasions, there may be parents who insist in attending the training during the evaluation but prefer not to provide data; those parents will be enrolled in the program but will not be required to participate in the research. \n\n4. Incentives\nFamily participants will be offered discounts on program fees. Facilitators and NGO manager will not be given any reimbursement but will receive a formal Thank You letter for participation in the research.", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "Intervention: The SREIA Parent Training Program\n\nThe SREIA parent training program was developed by SREIA during the 1990s and has been evolving over the past two decades. The program is grounded in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) [28,29]. It aims to promote positive behaviors and child development by improving parental attitudes and parenting styles. The program targets parent-child dyads from families of children with ASD aged between three and six years. It is delivered five days a week, with three hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon, for 11 weeks. Fourteen two-hour lectures on weekly themes (such as knowledge of ASD, parent-child interaction, and behavior management techniques) are offered throughout the 11 weeks and attended by all participating parents. Weekly topics include 1) knowledge of ASD, 2) Applied Behavioral Analysis, 3) child behavior problems, 4) reinforcement, 5) parent-child communication, 6) differential reinforcement and prompts, 7) fading and shaping, 8) chaining, and 9) generation and maintenance. For the remaining time, additional training in ABA principles and practice are tailored for the different functioning groups. Although a program framework specifies the themes covered each week, there is an inbuilt flexibility in terms of program content and the delivery mode for each session within the week. For example, depending on child ability and parental acquisition of skills, facilitators may decide whether and when to strengthen the basic skills, or to move on to more advanced skills. The program is delivered in person through a combination of individual counselling and group sessions, as well as a mixture of didactic and interactive delivery modes. Some sessions are only for parents, while others are participated in by both parent and child. Childcare is provided during by NGO staff parent group sessions. A wide range of session types and delivery methods are used in the training, such facilitator modeling, parent practicing, and in-vivo feedback.\n\n\nTreatment group will receive the intervention during the 1st wave of delivery. ", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "1. Outcome measurements:\n\nData will be collected  at baseline (T0), immediately post-intervention (T1), and 6-month post-interventio (T2, conditional to funding). For questionnaires that do not have a Chinese version, the translation followed the WHO guideline of Process of Translation and Adaptation of Instruments (World Health Organization, 2020).\n\n1.1. Primary outcome\nChild behavioral problems will be assessed using the Externalizing scale of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) for Ages 1.5-5 (Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2001). The Externalizing scale measures child attention problems and aggressive behaviors using 24 items rated by parents with a 3-point -type scale. The study will use the CBCL 1.5-5 for all families whose children will be between three to six years old, because 1) it is anticipated that the majority of children will be under six, 2) CBCL 1.5-5 has been shown good internal consistency among children with ASD aged six to seven (Basten et al., 2014), and 3) many items in the Externalizing scale of CBCL 6-18 (such as drink alcohol, lie/cheat, use tobacco or drugs, and truant) are not applicable for children with ASD aged six. Lower scores suggest fewer behavioral problems. Research has shown sufficient test-retest reliability, internal consistency, convergent validity, and cross-cultural validity of CBCL 2-3 and CBCL 4-18 in China (Leung et al., 2006; Liu, Wu, &amp; Yao, 2003; Su, Li, Wan, Yang, &amp; Luo, 1996), but the evidence regarding the validity and reliability of this new version of CBCL 1.5-5 is currently limited. However, the CBCL 1.5-5 has shown good factorial validity among Chinese girls adopted into North American families (Tan, Dedrick, &amp; Marfo, 2007); it has also demonstrated good internal validity with children with ASD (Pandolfi, Magyar, &amp; Dill, 2009).\n\n1.2 Secondary outcomes\nASD symptoms will be assessed using the Chinese version of the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) (Rimland &amp; Edelson, 1999), which comprise four subscales to measure child speech/language/communication, sociability, sensory/cognitive awareness, and health/physical/behavior. The scale has 77 items that are scored by parents. The health/physical/behavior subscale is rated using a 0 (not a problem)-to-3 (serious problem) point scale, whereas the other three subscales are rated using a 0 (not true)-to-2 (very true) point scale. Higher scores represent more ASD symptoms. The ATEC has shown sufficient internal consistency and test-retest reliability internationally and in China (Geier, Kern, &amp; Geier, 2013; Lu, Yang, Shu, &amp; Su, 2004; Magiati, Moss, Yates, Charman, &amp; Howlin, 2011), as well as cross-contextual validity (Jarusiewicz, 2002). \n\nParenting style will be measured using the Over-Reactivity subscale (5 items) of the Arnold-O\u2019Leary Parenting Scale (PS) (Arnold, O\u2019Leary, Wolff, &amp; Acker, 1993), and the Supporting Positive Behavior subscale (7 items) of the Parenting Young Children Scale (PARYC) (McEachern et al., 2012). The PS assesses dysfunctional discipline practices reported by parents using a 7-point Likert-type scale. Higher scores indicate more dysfunctional parenting practices. Sufficient internal consistency and convergent and divergent validity has been demonstrated for the use of PS in Hong Kong (C. Leung, Sanders, Leung, Mak, &amp; Lau, 2003; Zhu, 2018). The PARYC Supporting Positive Behavior subscale is rated by parents from 1 to 7 regarding the frequency with which they engaged in such parenting strategies during the last month. Higher scores represent more positive and proactive parenting practices. The PARYC has exhibited sufficient construct and convergent validity and internal consistency in other studies (McEachern et al., 2012), but there is currently limited evidence regarding validity and reliability in the Chinese population.\n\nParental mental health will be assessed using the Chinese version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 items (DASS-21) (Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995), which consists of three self-report subscales (depression, anxiety, and stress) with each having 7 items that are rated from 0 (not apply to me) to 3 (apply to me very much or most of the time). Higher scores indicate a worse emotional state. The scale has been shown to have good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and cross-cultural validity in China (Chan et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2016). \n\nFamily function will be assessed using the Chinese version of the Family APGAR scale (Smilkstein, Ashworth, &amp; Montano, 1982), which consists of 5 items that are rated from 0 (never) to 2 (often) to examine the five functional components of adaptability, partnership, growth, affection, and resolve. Higher scores indicate that parents are more satisfied with their relationships with other family members. The Chinese version of this scale has demonstrated good internal consistency and test-retest reliability in Chinese population (Lin et al., 2008; Nan et al., 2014; Zheng, Shi, &amp; Mao, 1996).\n\nParental knowledge will be measured using of the scores of several quizzes designed for use with the SREIA program to assess parental understanding and utilization of ABA techniques taught during the sessions. The quizzes on ABA principles and techniques will be administered at all time points in order to compare the change over time. \n\n2 Process evaluation outcomes\nThe implementation of the program will be explored regarding four criteria: program acceptability, participant involvement, program delivery, and sustainability.\n\nProgram Acceptability will be assessed at post-intervention only using a questionnaire based on the Incredible Years\u00ae Autism Program End-of-Course Satisfaction Questionnaire (Incredible Years, n.d.) tailored to the SREIA program and Chinese context. The questionnaire covers a range of topics including overall impression; teaching format; information and techniques; facilitators; and parent groups. It consists of 30 items rated with a 3-point Likert-type scale. High scores represent higher levels of satisfaction.\n\nThe level of participant involvement will be captured by calculating rates of attendance, engagement, and program dropout. The attendance rate will be assessed with an attendance sheet, which will be reported by facilitators and collected twice a day (morning and afternoon); engagement rate will be based on the percentage of families who complete assigned homework and tasks during the practice sessions, using an attendance and engagement registry; program dropout rate will be calculated based on families who miss at least ten days. Participant involvement, as well as program acceptability, will also be assessed using qualitative interviews with parents, focus groups with facilitators and NGO managers, and facilitator supervision sessions. \n\nProgram Delivery will be measured through two dimensions\u2014fidelity and quality of delivery. Implementation fidelity will be measured using facilitator checklists. Facilitators will report whether they deliver the core components prescribed in the manual after each session. The fidelity score will comprise the ratio of delivered components to prescribed components. Dosage will be calculated using hours of delivery. Quality of delivery will be assessed by research staff observing parent group sessions and filling out a quality of delivery survey. The in-depth interviews with NGO managers, focus group discussion with facilitators and supervision notes will also investigate the delivery of the program.\n\nProgram Sustainability will be explored during the qualitative interviews with NGO managers, which will be guided by the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adopt, implementation, and maintenance) framework (Glasgow, Vogt, &amp; Boles, 1999). The interviews will focus on community- and policy-level factors that may affect program sustainability and scale-up.\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "Not applicable", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Quantitative data analyses will be conducted using R Studio (R Core Team, 2013). Data analysis will follow the principles of intent-to-treat, which involves assessing all participants as originally allocated, regardless of program dropouts or the dose of treatment they received. Missing data and its association with other variables will be assessed using logistic regression. Where appropriate, full-information maximum likelihood (FIML) will be used to compensate for missing data (Schafer &amp; Graham, 2002).\n\nA table showing the demographic characteristics of participants will be compiled (M\u00b1SD for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables). The analysis will comprise a between-group comparison for the treatment and the waitlist control groups after the first wave of delivery (T1) to investigate the treatment effects.\n\nTo reduce selection bias and improve baseline balance for the between-group comparison, the treatment effects of the intervention will be estimated using a difference-in-differences (DiD) design with inverse propensity score weights (Stuart et al., 2014). The weighting of propensity scores will help to keep all available data in the analysis, in order to improve the statistical power. Propensity scores will be calculated using logistic regression based on key variables that may affect intervention effects, including baseline outcome scores (i.e., child behavior problems, ASD severity, parenting styles, parental mental health, parental knowledge, and family function) and demographic characteristics (i.e., parental education levels and economic status), as well as other variables that demonstrate baseline imbalance. With the propensity scores, the treatment and control groups will be weighted to be balanced on the key variables; weighted regression models will then be fitted for the DiD analyses, which further adjust for unobserved variables and secular time trends. Clustering effects within each treatment condition and child levels of functioning group will also be accounted for. Exploratory statistical analyses will be conducted to understand the differences in treatment effects between the two different versions of delivery. Attrition weights for program dropouts (if any) will be combined. Propensity score weights will be estimated using the TWANG (Toolkit for Weighting and Analysis of Nonequivalent Groups) package in R (Ridgeway, McCaffrey, Morral, Burgette, &amp; Griffin, 2014). \n\nMeans and standard deviations will be calculated for participant satisfaction, attendance rate, engagement rate, program dropout rate, and quality of delivery. Implementation fidelity will be reported using a ratio of delivered components to prescribed components. Regression models will be created to explore potential predictors of participant involvement, as well as investigate possible associations between implementation aspect (i.e., particularly participant involvement and program satisfaction but may also include any salient features identified from the qualitative data analysis) and treatment effects. Participant characteristics will be controlled for in the regression analyses.", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href":

First, all of the items of the HSQ (as well, as the items from the No-Humor HSQ and the Humor HSQ; see Main Data Collection section below) will be independently translated to European Portuguese by two bilingual native speakers, expert in the field of Psychology. The resulting translations will then be combined by the first author and translated back to Portuguese by two bilingual individuals (English-Portuguese and vice-versa). The resulting translated items will be checked and adjusted for by the first author, if necessary, and a pilot-evaluation study with 10 individuals will be conducted, to assure the clarity of all of the items and corresponding instructions. These individuals will be asked to rate the questionnaires in terms of its clarity and understandability. If necessary, changes resulting from the feedback of these individuals will be implemented. The result of this process will then be considered the final version of the scale.\n\n2.\tMain Data Collection:\nThe main data collection will be run in two stages. In the first stage, participants will be requested to fill out an online questionnaire, which will be composed of the following instruments: (a) the translated version of HSQ (Martin, Phulik-Doris, Larsen, Gray &amp; Weir, 2003); (b) the translated version of the No-Humor HSQ (Ruch &amp; Heintz, 2017, adapted from Martin, Phulik-Doris, Larsen, Gray &amp; Weir, 2003); (c) the translated version of the Humor-HSQ (Ruch &amp; Heintz, 2017, adapted from Martin, Phulik-Doris, Larsen, Gray &amp; Weir, 2003); (d) PANAS (Watson, Clark &amp; Tellegen, 1988; Portuguese adaptation by Galinha &amp; Pais-Ribeiro, 2005); (e) TIPI scale (Gosling, Rentfrow &amp; Swann, 2003; adapted to Portuguese by Nunes, Limpo, Lima &amp; Castro, 2018); (f) Personal Well-Being Scale (Cummins, McCabe, Romeo &amp; Gullone, 1994; adapted to Portuguese by Ribeiro &amp; Cummins, 2008) and (g) a brief socio-demographic questionnaire. Both the No-Humor HSQ and the Humor HSQ are scales derived from the original HSQ, adapted from the work of Ruch and Heintz (2017), and are intended to provide a way to measure the effect of the context-relevant and construct-relevant (respectively) elements of the original scale\u2019s items in explaining its variance. The PANAS, TIPI and Personal Well-Being scales will be used to evaluate the scale\u2019s criterion validity. In addition, two attention-check items will be included at random throughout the questionnaire, to guarantee that participants are paying attention.\nThe socio-demographic questionnaire will include questions regarding the participant\u2019s (a) sex; (b) age; (c) native tongue; (d) nationality; (e) education and (f) level of attention while responding to the study.\nParticipation in this stage of the study is expected to last between 40 and 60 minutes.\n\n3.\tRepeated Measures:\nIn order to evaluate the HSQ temporal validity, subjects who participated in the main data collection stage, will be asked to respond to the items of the HSQ again, two weeks after they responded for the first time.\nParticipation in this stage of the study is expected to last, maximum, 15 minutes.\n\n4.\tExploratory Analysis and Measures:\nThis study is included in a larger project, that aims at characterizing the role of positive humor in the acceptance and attitudes towards social robots. In this context, we will also ask participants to fill the NARS (Pi\u00e7arra, Giger, Pochwatko &amp; Gon\u00e7alves, 2015).

First, all of the items of the HSQ (as well, as the items from the No-Humor HSQ and the Humor HSQ; see Main Data Collection section below) will be independently translated to European Portuguese by two bilingual native speakers, expert in the field of Psychology. The resulting translations will then be combined by the first author and translated back to Portuguese by two bilingual individuals (English-Portuguese and vice-versa). The resulting translated items will be checked and adjusted for by the first author, if necessary, and a pilot-evaluation study with 10 individuals will be conducted, to assure the clarity of all of the items and corresponding instructions. These individuals will be asked to rate the questionnaires in terms of its clarity and understandability. If necessary, changes resulting from the feedback of these individuals will be implemented. The result of this process will then be considered the final version of the scale.\n\n2.\tMain Data Collection:\nThe main data collection will be run in two stages. In the first stage, participants will be requested to fill out an online questionnaire, which will be composed of the following instruments: (a) the translated version of HSQ (Martin, Phulik-Doris, Larsen, Gray &amp; Weir, 2003); (b) the translated version of the No-Humor HSQ (Ruch &amp; Heintz, 2017, adapted from Martin, Phulik-Doris, Larsen, Gray &amp; Weir, 2003); (c) the translated version of the Humor-HSQ (Ruch &amp; Heintz, 2017, adapted from Martin, Phulik-Doris, Larsen, Gray &amp; Weir, 2003); (d) PANAS (Watson, Clark &amp; Tellegen, 1988; Portuguese adaptation by Galinha &amp; Pais-Ribeiro, 2005); (e) TIPI scale (Gosling, Rentfrow &amp; Swann, 2003; adapted to Portuguese by Nunes, Limpo, Lima &amp; Castro, 2018); (f) Personal Well-Being Scale (Cummins, McCabe, Romeo &amp; Gullone, 1994; adapted to Portuguese by Ribeiro &amp; Cummins, 2008) and (g) a brief socio-demographic questionnaire. Both the No-Humor HSQ and the Humor HSQ are scales derived from the original HSQ, adapted from the work of Ruch and Heintz (2017), and are intended to provide a way to measure the effect of the context-relevant and construct-relevant (respectively) elements of the original scale\u2019s items in explaining its variance. The PANAS, TIPI and Personal Well-Being scales will be used to evaluate the scale\u2019s criterion validity. In addition, two attention-check items will be included at random throughout the questionnaire, to guarantee that participants are paying attention.\nThe socio-demographic questionnaire will include questions regarding the participant\u2019s (a) sex; (b) age; (c) native tongue; (d) nationality; (e) education and (f) level of attention while responding to the study.\nParticipation in this stage of the study is expected to last between 40 and 60 minutes.\n\n3.\tRepeated Measures:\nIn order to evaluate the HSQ temporal validity, subjects who participated in the main data collection stage, will be asked to respond to the items of the HSQ again, two weeks after they responded for the first time.\nParticipation in this stage of the study is expected to last, maximum, 15 minutes.\n\n4.\tExploratory Analysis and Measures:\nThis study is included in a larger project, that aims at characterizing the role of positive humor in the acceptance and attitudes towards social robots. In this context, we will also ask participants to fill the NARS (Pi\u00e7arra, Giger, Pochwatko &amp; Gon\u00e7alves, 2015).

First, all of the items of the HSQ (as well, as the items from the No-Humor HSQ and the Humor HSQ; see Main Data Collection section below) will be independently translated to European Portuguese by two bilingual native speakers, expert in the field of Psychology. The resulting translations will then be combined by the first author and translated back to Portuguese by two bilingual individuals (English-Portuguese and vice-versa). The resulting translated items will be checked and adjusted for by the first author, if necessary, and a pilot-evaluation study with 10 individuals will be conducted, to assure the clarity of all of the items and corresponding instructions. These individuals will be asked to rate the questionnaires in terms of its clarity and understandability. If necessary, changes resulting from the feedback of these individuals will be implemented. The result of this process will then be considered the final version of the scale.\n\n2.\tMain Data Collection:\nThe main data collection will be run in two stages. In the first stage, participants will be requested to fill out an online questionnaire, which will be composed of the following instruments: (a) the translated version of HSQ (Martin, Phulik-Doris, Larsen, Gray &amp; Weir, 2003); (b) the translated version of the No-Humor HSQ (Ruch &amp; Heintz, 2017, adapted from Martin, Phulik-Doris, Larsen, Gray &amp; Weir, 2003); (c) the translated version of the Humor-HSQ (Ruch &amp; Heintz, 2017, adapted from Martin, Phulik-Doris, Larsen, Gray &amp; Weir, 2003); (d) PANAS (Watson, Clark &amp; Tellegen, 1988; Portuguese adaptation by Galinha &amp; Pais-Ribeiro, 2005); (e) TIPI scale (Gosling, Rentfrow &amp; Swann, 2003; adapted to Portuguese by Nunes, Limpo, Lima &amp; Castro, 2018); (f) Personal Well-Being Scale (Cummins, McCabe, Romeo &amp; Gullone, 1994; adapted to Portuguese by Ribeiro &amp; Cummins, 2008) and (g) a brief socio-demographic questionnaire. Both the No-Humor HSQ and the Humor HSQ are scales derived from the original HSQ, adapted from the work of Ruch and Heintz (2017), and are intended to provide a way to measure the effect of the context-relevant and construct-relevant (respectively) elements of the original scale\u2019s items in explaining its variance. The PANAS, TIPI and Personal Well-Being scales will be used to evaluate the scale\u2019s criterion validity. In addition, two attention-check items will be included at random throughout the questionnaire, to guarantee that participants are paying attention.\nThe socio-demographic questionnaire will include questions regarding the participant\u2019s (a) sex; (b) age; (c) native tongue; (d) nationality; (e) education and (f) level of attention while responding to the study.\nParticipation in this stage of the study is expected to last between 40 and 60 minutes.\n\n3.\tRepeated Measures:\nIn order to evaluate the HSQ temporal validity, subjects who participated in the main data collection stage, will be asked to respond to the items of the HSQ again, two weeks after they responded for the first time.\nParticipation in this stage of the study is expected to last, maximum, 15 minutes.\n\n4.\tExploratory Analysis and Measures:\nThis study is included in a larger project, that aims at characterizing the role of positive humor in the acceptance and attitudes towards social robots. In this context, we will also ask participants to fill the NARS (Pi\u00e7arra, Giger, Pochwatko &amp; Gon\u00e7alves, 2015).

The data collection process is expected to last between two and three months. Data collection will occur online, using the Qualtrics platform. Participants will receive a monetary compensation for the time invested in participating in this study.\n\nParticipants will be given an inform consent prior to the start of data collection and will be provided with a very general explanation about the study\u2019s purpose (as not to influence their responses). To avoid order effects, both the items within each scale and the different scales used, will be presented randomly to participants, with the exception of the socio-demographic questionnaire, which will be presented last of all.\n\nParticipants will be provided a debriefing statement at the end of their participation and their participation on the second stage will be asked. \n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "NA", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "See Statistic Models section.", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "NA", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Data will be analyzed using IBM AMOS, v. 26 and IBM SPSS, V.26.
