"Although various studies have documented the effects of insecurity on the policy preferences of citizens, we do not have a solid understanding of how politicians react to insecurity and its effects on citizens and of the political opportunities that security policies may offer politicians. Many analysts consider appeals to heavy-handed security policies an effective way of garnering support among voters as they respond to citizen concerns over violence and to shifts in public opinion towards punitive policies as a result of insecurity. In addition to allowing politicians to respond to public opinion, resorting to heavy-handed security policies may also be an effective way of communicating politician traits to voters, despite the undesired consequences these policies may have on levels of violence and human rights. Voters may perceive politicians appealing to tough security policies as more effective or committed relative to politicians who propose policies often thought to be softer on crime and these perceptions of effectiveness may affect how voters evaluate the politician on other policy dimensions. Moreover, security concerns may override other concerns voters may have and thus allow politicians to resort to security issues to facilitate their implementation of other policies. The goal of these survey experiments is to answer two main questions. First, do appeals to repressive security policies signal politician effectiveness in other (non-security) policy areas? And second, are appeals to security issues an effective way for politicians to garner support to implement other, perhaps unpalatable, policies? In answering these questions, I hope to contribute to our understanding of how politicians can use an issue like crime and security to shape public opinion towards themselves and towards other policy issues. To do so, I am including two survey experiments in an online survey of Mexican citizens. The first experiment asks respondents about their local mayor's effectiveness at administering a housing improvement plan, but some respondents are also told that the mayor is implementing a repressive security policy and others that the mayor is taking a preventative approach to crime.

On the other hand, social exclusion is a source of group formation and thus group identity. This project focuses on the history of leprosy in Colombia to assess the legacy of the historical social -and geographical- exclusion on current solidarity and social capital. Leprosy has a strong genetic component and is correlated with poverty, a condition amply met by the totality of Colombia throughout the 19th and the early 20th centuries, so that the \u2018historical assignment\u2019 of the disease in Colombia -which inevitably came with social exclusion- can be understood as if random. Leveraging on the fact that all lepers were geographically isolated as a part of the social exclusion to which they were subject, and that leprosy has nearly vanished since the 1960s, this project seeks to investigate the differential effects of social exclusion on in- and out-group pro-sociality and social capital. Further, considering that such exclusion was strongly related to a medical stigma, the project also seeks to investigate the legacy of this medically-managed exclusion on contemporary trust in modern medicine."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "This project seeks to test several main hypotheses: 1.

Intergenerational transmission of social preferences 2. Knowledge of history"}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "The project will employ a lab-in-the-field approach to answer the hypothesis. Dictator Games will be conducted in the former leper colony (called Agua de Dios) and in the two municipalities contiguous to it (called Ricaurte and Tocaima, for a total of 3 municipalities), which provide a reasonable control group to examine the effects of social discrimination on solidarity. Subjects will be asked to divide COP $16000 (more than half a day of a minimum wage) between themselves and someone chosen at random in the same municipality (which measures ingroup solidarity). They will be also asked to divide COP $16000 between themselves and someone chosen at random in Apulo, a third Colombian municipality that has a comparable level of development and of climatic conditions (which measures outgroup solidarity). The comparison of these two measures across the three municipalities will enable to test hypotheses 1 and 2 above. Further, question 3 above can be assessed by comparing the aggregation of the within-town allocation and the allocation given to subjects in Apulo in the Dictator games.

On the other hand, social exclusion is a source of group formation and thus group identity. This project focuses on the history of leprosy in Colombia to assess the legacy of the historical social -and geographical- exclusion on current solidarity and social capital. Leprosy has a strong genetic component and is correlated with poverty, a condition amply met by the totality of Colombia throughout the 19th and the early 20th centuries, so that the \u2018historical assignment\u2019 of the disease in Colombia -which inevitably came with social exclusion- can be understood as if random. Leveraging on the fact that all lepers were geographically isolated as a part of the social exclusion to which they were subject, and that leprosy has nearly vanished since the 1960s, this project seeks to investigate the differential effects of social exclusion on in- and out-group pro-sociality and social capital. Further, considering that such exclusion was strongly related to a medical stigma, the project also seeks to investigate the legacy of this medically-managed exclusion on contemporary trust in modern medicine.", "q16": "This project seeks to test several main hypotheses: 1. Historical experiences of social exclusion have a positive effect on in-group solidarity 2. Historical experiences of social exclusion have a negative effect on out-group solidarity 3. Is the positive effect on ingroup solidarity outweighed by the negative effect on outgroup solidarity when considering measures of solidarity that disregard group-considerations? (No prior as to which is the preeminent effect) 4. There is a negative legacy on trust in modern medicine in those sites of leper isolation Further, two mechanisms will be assessed: 1. Intergenerational transmission of social preferences 2. Knowledge of history", "q17": "The project will employ a lab-in-the-field approach to answer the hypothesis. Dictator Games will be conducted in the former leper colony (called Agua de Dios) and in the two municipalities contiguous to it (called Ricaurte and Tocaima, for a total of 3 municipalities), which provide a reasonable control group to examine the effects of social discrimination on solidarity. Subjects will be asked to divide COP $16000 (more than half a day of a minimum wage) between themselves and someone chosen at random in the same municipality (which measures ingroup solidarity). They will be also asked to divide COP $16000 between themselves and someone chosen at random in Apulo, a third Colombian municipality that has a comparable level of development and of climatic conditions (which measures outgroup solidarity). The comparison of these two measures across the three municipalities will enable to test hypotheses 1 and 2 above. Further, question 3 above can be assessed by comparing the aggregation of the within-town allocation and the allocation given to subjects in Apulo in the Dictator games. Such question will also be assessed by comparing across municipalities the answers to a survey measure asking for a degree of similarity (between 1 and 10) to someone who finds it important to selflessly help others.

Hypothesis 2a: When a weapon originates in an adversary country, support for arms control should increase when expectations that it will diffuse are low, and decrease when expectations are high. Hypothesis 2b: When a weapon originates in a respondent\u2019s home country, support for arms control should increase when expectations that it will diffuse are high, and decrease when expectations are low.

[], "value": "In a previous study, \u201cWho Likes Rebels? Representation and the Electoral Success of Parliamentary Mavericks (Registered with EGAP)\u201d we find that voters express a preference for rebellious MPs that is not driven by considerations of norms to vote with the party or whether the rebel activity runs counter to the preferences of the public/constituency. We hypothesised that the observed behavior is rather driven by voters' expressive preferences and voting for a rebel should be seen as symbolic act. In this second study, we focus on identifying rebellion as expressive symbolic act. We implement a survey experiment to separate expressive from instrumental motivations behind vote choice. Respondents are presented with a series of five hypothetical MP. The experiment vignettes contains two parts: Part 1 describes a parliamentary vote in which an MP may or may not rebel against his/her party and which further varies in the subject of the bill (i.e., immigration, taxation/spending, environmental protection), whether the bill passed, whether the public supported or opposed the bill, the gender of the MP, and whether the MP was pivotal.

We hypothesised that the observed behavior is rather driven by voters' expressive preferences and voting for a rebel should be seen as symbolic act. In this second study, we focus on identifying rebellion as expressive symbolic act. We implement a survey experiment to separate expressive from instrumental motivations behind vote choice.
