theoretically sound media psychology research practices. In the original article (Pryzbylski &amp; Weinstein, 2019), there were numerous methodological and statistical decisions made that obscured the results presented (Bushman &amp; Anderson, In Review). These kinds of mistakes can be harmful when we talk about science acceptance (Prot &amp; Anderson, 2020), and by presenting this information in this way, we know that it can ruin trust in scientific discourse. \n We believe that by using this fairly robust dataset and incorporating more appropriate methodological and statistical approaches, we can establish the best practices one should take when researching media violence effects. We will address our concerns about the original analyses (poor measures of aggression and of violent gameplay, as well as inappropriately controlling for trait aggression while assessing media violence effects on aggressive behavior) in a separate manuscript to be submitting to the original journal, but the manuscript to be prepared based on this preregistration will use the dataset to establish a course of best practices when looking at media effects. We intend to address the following:\n\n-\tCreating more valid measures of aggression, both by using the Buss Perry scales provided, as well as exploring how the measure used in the original article (the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) can potentially be used as a way to measure aggressive behavior. We intend to conduct exploratory factor analyses to see how the SDQ maps onto more valid constructs of aggression. We will also use certain items from the SDQ (determined both by the standard definitions of aggressive behavior, cognition, and affect, as well as results from factor analyses) combined with items from Buss Perry subscales, to see if more valid and theoretically consistent measures of aggression can be created. \n-\tCreate new measures of violent content in the video games listed by participants, and thereby of violent video game exposure. The original authors used game ratings (the ESRB and PEGI ratings boards respectively) to determine the amount of violent content participants recorded playing. However, we know that simply using such ratings as a measure of violent content does not adequately capture the amount of violent content players are exposed to (Anderson et. al, 2017; Busching et al., 2015). We have trained research assistants to go through the database of recorded games, watch gameplay clips, and rate the violent content based on methods previously established to be more sensitive than simply using the game\u2019s parental ratings (Anderson et. al, 2017). They currently (February 2020) are doing the ratings. We will run multiple analyses comparing the original use of ratings to evaluate violent content, with this more sensitive method, to test whether using more direct questions and evaluations of violent content are more valid than using game ratings, as has been found in previous work. \n-\tWe also intend to use structural equational modeling (SEM) to test the relationships between violent gameplay, aggressive behavior, and other mediating (e.g., trait hostility, trait anger) and moderating variables (e.g., gender and age). \n-\tWe also will include a list of best practices to engage in whenever analyzing media effects data. We will walk through a list of steps (outlined below) that will show how and why some of these basic steps are necessary to begin any statistical analyses and should be reported in all future published manuscripts (perhaps as Supplemental Materials:\n1.\tCheck for errors and mindless responding for example:\na.\tLook for impossible scores on each variable (e.g., a \u201c7\u201d on a 1 to 5 scale)\nb.\tCompute standard deviations within each participant for multi-item scales\n2.\tCheck distributions and alphas of key variables:\na.\tUse box plots to reveal asymmetric distributions and outliers (as defined by Tukey)\nb.\tUse means &amp; standard deviations to find data points more than 3 standard deviations from mean\nc.\tUse Ladder of Powers to transform badly skewed data\nd.\tCheck standard deviations of each item in multi-item scales. If very different, consider standardizing items before combining into a summed (or averaged) scale\n\nReferences\n\nAnderson, C. A., Suzuki, K., Swing, E. L., Groves, C. L., Gentile, D.

In the original article (Pryzbylski &amp; Weinstein, 2019), there were numerous methodological and statistical decisions made that obscured the results presented (Bushman &amp; Anderson, In Review). These kinds of mistakes can be harmful when we talk about science acceptance (Prot &amp; Anderson, 2020), and by presenting this information in this way, we know that it can ruin trust in scientific discourse. \n We believe that by using this fairly robust dataset and incorporating more appropriate methodological and statistical approaches, we can establish the best practices one should take when researching media violence effects. We will address our concerns about the original analyses (poor measures of aggression and of violent gameplay, as well as inappropriately controlling for trait aggression while assessing media violence effects on aggressive behavior) in a separate manuscript to be submitting to the original journal, but the manuscript to be prepared based on this preregistration will use the dataset to establish a course of best practices when looking at media effects. We intend to address the following:\n\n-\tCreating more valid measures of aggression, both by using the Buss Perry scales provided, as well as exploring how the measure used in the original article (the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) can potentially be used as a way to measure aggressive behavior. We intend to conduct exploratory factor analyses to see how the SDQ maps onto more valid constructs of aggression. We will also use certain items from the SDQ (determined both by the standard definitions of aggressive behavior, cognition, and affect, as well as results from factor analyses) combined with items from Buss Perry subscales, to see if more valid and theoretically consistent measures of aggression can be created. \n-\tCreate new measures of violent content in the video games listed by participants, and thereby of violent video game exposure. The original authors used game ratings (the ESRB and PEGI ratings boards respectively) to determine the amount of violent content participants recorded playing. However, we know that simply using such ratings as a measure of violent content does not adequately capture the amount of violent content players are exposed to (Anderson et. al, 2017; Busching et al., 2015). We have trained research assistants to go through the database of recorded games, watch gameplay clips, and rate the violent content based on methods previously established to be more sensitive than simply using the game\u2019s parental ratings (Anderson et. al, 2017). They currently (February 2020) are doing the ratings. We will run multiple analyses comparing the original use of ratings to evaluate violent content, with this more sensitive method, to test whether using more direct questions and evaluations of violent content are more valid than using game ratings, as has been found in previous work. \n-\tWe also intend to use structural equational modeling (SEM) to test the relationships between violent gameplay, aggressive behavior, and other mediating (e.g., trait hostility, trait anger) and moderating variables (e.g., gender and age). \n-\tWe also will include a list of best practices to engage in whenever analyzing media effects data. We will walk through a list of steps (outlined below) that will show how and why some of these basic steps are necessary to begin any statistical analyses and should be reported in all future published manuscripts (perhaps as Supplemental Materials:\n1.\tCheck for errors and mindless responding for example:\na.\tLook for impossible scores on each variable (e.g., a \u201c7\u201d on a 1 to 5 scale)\nb.\tCompute standard deviations within each participant for multi-item scales\n2.\tCheck distributions and alphas of key variables:\na.\tUse box plots to reveal asymmetric distributions and outliers (as defined by Tukey)\nb.\tUse means &amp; standard deviations to find data points more than 3 standard deviations from mean\nc.\tUse Ladder of Powers to transform badly skewed data\nd.\tCheck standard deviations of each item in multi-item scales. If very different, consider standardizing items before combining into a summed (or averaged) scale\n\nReferences\n\nAnderson, C. A., Suzuki, K., Swing, E. L., Groves, C. L., Gentile, D.

"}, "hypothesis": {"extra": [], "value": "This survey measures beliefs held by lawyers and members of the general public (i.e. potential jurors) regarding what people would notice in real-world scenarios, and what factors individuals believe affect what people would notice. \n\nPrevious studies have explored beliefs about visual detection (Levin &amp; Angelone, 2008) and beliefs about whether individuals will notice unexpected events (Simons &amp; Chabris, 2011, 2012). However, it is important to extend this research to look at beliefs regarding visual detection within legal populations. This is important because there are many real-world situations of inattentional blindness that are legally relevant. An individual failing to notice something may be sued, or face negligence charges. Therefore these individuals may be deemed to be legally responsible when they have failed to see something (Jaeger et al., 2017). Beliefs about inattentional blindness and what individuals will notice may also extend to how individuals are treated within the legal system. For example, beliefs that lawyers have about what individuals will notice may affect how they approach legal cases, and how they prepare and defend clients. Beliefs that members of the general population have about what individuals will notice may affect their legal decision-making as jurors. Therefore, we will explore beliefs and compare beliefs among lawyers and members of the general population about what individuals will notice (and the factors that influence what individuals will notice), using legally relevant scenarios derived from the inattentional blindness literature (e.g. driving, medicine, witnesses). We will also assess participants' knowledge and anecdotal experiences of inattentional blindness, as it has been previously suggested that one solution to reducing misconceptions regarding inattentional blindness is allowing individuals to experience it for themselves (Hyman, 2016). Therefore, determining whether individuals can reflect on their own personal experiences of inattentional blindness may be useful in rectifying misconceptions within the legal field. \n\nWe hypothesise that the two current groups (lawyers and general population) will differ in age and gender. We expect lawyers will be significantly older than our general public group (because the general public group will comprise of introductory psychology students who have not yet learnt about inattentional blindness during classes). We also expect that lawyers will have a more even split of males and females compared to the general public group.\n\nThe survey is exploratory. We do not have any clear or directional hypotheses regarding differences within the populations in their beliefs about what individuals will notice, or the factors that they believe make individuals more, just as, or less likely to notice something. Previous studies of beliefs regarding eyewitness memory have demonstrated that different legal populations differ in their beliefs regarding some eyewitness factors, but not all (Granhag et al., 2005; Jiang &amp; Luo, 2016; Kask, 2011). Therefore, we expect some differences may emerge across the groups regarding beliefs about noticing, but we do not know for what items and scenarios these groups may differ.  \n\nAdditionally, given that neither of the two populations are given training into inattentional blindness, we do not believe there will be differences in their knowledge of inattentional blindness.
