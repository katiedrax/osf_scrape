Given the opportunity to flee to government-controlled areas, IDP camps, or neighboring countries, why do some people stay? This paper uses the case of the Islamic State\u2019s three-year rule over the Iraqi city of Mosul to explore the individual-level motivations--social, political, economic, and ideological--that influence the decisions of potential migrants to stay or leave territory captured by a state-building insurgent group. Through a survey of 1,400 residents of Mosul, I compare and contrast the motivations of \"stayers\" (those who remained in Mosul after IS's arrival in June 2014) and \"leavers\" (those who fled Mosul in the early days of IS rule and have since returned to the city). While recognizing that decisions to stay or leave are multi-factorial, I develop and test a discrete-choice theory of migration hypothesizing that civilians who had previously experienced high levels of injustice in their interactions with Iraqi state authorities--for example, bribery, sectarian discrimination, and police harassment--were more likely to be \"stayers\" than those with fewer or no such grievances. If this hypothesis is supported by the data, it would suggest that weak rule of law in Iraq contributed to civilian cooperation with and support for IS. The survey will also assess several alternative explanations that could explain migration decisions: economic resources, social networks, information, threat perceptions, and ideology."}, "q16":

REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) programmes aim to reduce tropical deforestation, thereby increasing carbon sequestration and mitigating climate change. In addition, the National Park has been classified as one of the 34 most important biodiversity hotspots in the world.

The Gola REDD+ project\u2019s overarching objectives are to increase food security and income and generate support for conservation of the GRNP. Activities include agricultural trainings, the establishment of savings and loans association, and specific programs for the major cash crop cocoa. With data collected in multiple waves, we can estimate the treatment effect of these activities through difference-in-difference analysis.

Indeed, within conservation science there are calls for increasing the number of impact evaluations of conservation projects. In this study we assess the five year impact of the REDD+ programme implemented in Eastern Sierra Leone in communities around the Gola Rainforest National Park. REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) programmes aim to reduce tropical deforestation, thereby increasing carbon sequestration and mitigating climate change. In addition, the National Park has been classified as one of the 34 most important biodiversity hotspots in the world. The REDD+ programme in Sierra Leone has been implemented from 2014 by Gola Rainforest Conservation (GRC) and provides direct social benefits to Forest Edge Communities (FECs). The Gola REDD+ project\u2019s overarching objectives are to increase food security and income and generate support for conservation of the GRNP. Activities include agricultural trainings, the establishment of savings and loans association, and specific programs for the major cash crop cocoa. With data collected in multiple waves, we can estimate the treatment effect of these activities through difference-in-difference analysis. By assessing how these programs affected economic outcomes as well as conservation outcomes, this research will contribute to the ongoing debate on whether conservation and poverty reduction can go hand in hand.", "q16": "The impact of the REDD+ programme on three families: Economic outcomes, Conservation Attitudes and Conservation Behaviour.

We will look for systematic bias between responders and non-responders by comparing data on sex, current employer, sub-field, rank, and personal connection to the PIs.

organizations that are foreign in a variety of ways. Civil society has been theorized as being a crucial component of democracy and a crucial actor in democratic and economic development. However, we do not know how citizen attitudes toward civil society may have been altered by foreign aid. The democracy assistance literature has looked at the impact of donor preferences and funding patterns on nongovernmental organizations in recipient countries --- the supply side of foreign aid. A significant interest of the foreign aid literature has been to investigate the relationship between citizens\u2019 views of their government\u2019s legitimacy and the receipt of foreign aid, pulling into focus the impact of foreign aid on the demand side in terms of governance. This project seeks to unite these two strands of the literature by turning to the demand side of civil society, and how it is impacted by foreign aid.

Civil society has been theorized as being a crucial component of democracy and a crucial actor in democratic and economic development. However, we do not know how citizen attitudes toward civil society may have been altered by foreign aid. The democracy assistance literature has looked at the impact of donor preferences and funding patterns on nongovernmental organizations in recipient countries --- the supply side of foreign aid. A significant interest of the foreign aid literature has been to investigate the relationship between citizens\u2019 views of their government\u2019s legitimacy and the receipt of foreign aid, pulling into focus the impact of foreign aid on the demand side in terms of governance. This project seeks to unite these two strands of the literature by turning to the demand side of civil society, and how it is impacted by foreign aid.

This goes against established theories of retrospective voting and electoral accountability. Our findings stem from two research designs and two datasets from Brazil. First, in a regression discontinuity design (RDD) exploiting data for the municipal elections of 2008, 2012 and 2016 across Brazil, we study the effect of municipalities meeting a highly visible school quality target (IDEB) on electoral outcomes. Second, in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a sample of municipalities in Pernambuco, we study the effect of informing voters before the election about their municipality\u2019s rank in the performance in an early student assessment (ANA) on individual vote choice. Contrary to expectations, we find in both the RDD and the RCT that signals about school quality decrease, rather than increase, electoral support for the incumbent.

The core of the survey is a vignette experiment. Before the vignette we will expose respondents to a battery of questions about how important they think different policy areas are for their personal interests. In particular, respondents will be asked about education, healthcare, employment in the municipal sector, economic development, security, and fight against poverty. This will allow us to (i) collect data about saliency of different policy areas for voters; and (ii) prime respondents to think about the importance of different policy areas, and thus simulate the conditions in which voters decide their vote during electoral campaigns. Immediately before the vignette, we will inform voters about IDEB (what it is and what it means for a municipality to meet its IDEB target), and ask them whether they had already heard about it. The vignette will be very similar to the one used in the RCT (Boas et al 2017) and in previous studies (Weitz-Shapiro and Winters 2017), focused on a hypothetical mayor. Respondents will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: positive treatment (where they are informed that the municipality met its school quality target), negative treatment (where they are informed that the municipality did not meet its school quality target), and control (where they are not given information about whether the municipality met its target). This design will allow us to identify the effect of positive vs negative information about the quality of schools, by comparing the mean of a given outcome in the positive treatment group to the mean of that same outcome in the negative treatment group. It will also allow us to identify the effect of school quality information versus absence thereof, by comparing the mean of a given outcome in the positive and negative treatment groups to the mean of that outcome in the placebo group. After the vignette, we will ask respondents about their likelihood of voting for that hypothetical mayor, on a 4-point Likert scale. This will provide additional tests for H1. Next, we will ask them about their perception of how likely they think the hypothetical mayor is to 1) have invested a lot of money in education, 2) have hired many municipal workers, 3) have improved municipal schools, 4) have improved municipal clinics, 5) have helped people like them solve their problems, and 6) have reduced poverty in the municipality."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Brazil"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "3000"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "1712167362 (MIT)"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "12/21/17"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q32": {"extra": [], "value": "D72"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design", "Survey Methodology"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Development", "Elections"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e3858dffa39b701761db995", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/f3ubj/providers/osfstorage/5e3858dffa39b701761db995", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/f3ubj/providers/osfstorage/5e3858dffa39b701761db995", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/f3ubj/providers/osfstorage/5e3858dffa39b701761db995?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/f3ubj/providers/osfstorage/5e3858dffa39b701761db995"}, "attributes": {"etag": "42a39a95a73f969a9f4567124a6c71fe021cf009dfcf0b6bdc2c7edf482bd27a", "kind": "file", "name": "20180222AA_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e3858dffa39b701761db995", "size": 108672, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "1d211086117409405784eb521d27b28f", "sha256": "cccb6f1820bd7d30fa90f01a5a53d2d62b78dcbc19e521a366f0a87039b01707"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 108672, "modified": "2020-02-03T17:31:11.278324+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "f3ubj", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20180222AA_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T17:31:11+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "f3ubj", "sha256": "cccb6f1820bd7d30fa90f01a5a53d2d62b78dcbc19e521a366f0a87039b01707", "viewUrl": "/project/tv8mc/files/osfstorage/5e3858e757427b01830c27ca/", "selectedFileName": "20180222AA_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20180222AA_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "How do Brazilian voters trade school quality and other government outputs when evaluating municipal politicians?", "q2": "Taylor Boas | Guillermo Toral", "q3": "20180222AA", "q4": "02/22/2018 - 15:54", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to any research activities", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "2/22/18", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "In a working paper (\u201cEvaluating students and politicians: Test scores and electoral accountability in Brazil\u201d), we find that voters who receive information about the performance of municipal schools are less likely to vote for the incumbent when such signals are positive than when they are negative.

Before the vignette we will expose respondents to a battery of questions about how important they think different policy areas are for their personal interests. In particular, respondents will be asked about education, healthcare, employment in the municipal sector, economic development, security, and fight against poverty. This will allow us to (i) collect data about saliency of different policy areas for voters; and (ii) prime respondents to think about the importance of different policy areas, and thus simulate the conditions in which voters decide their vote during electoral campaigns. Immediately before the vignette, we will inform voters about IDEB (what it is and what it means for a municipality to meet its IDEB target), and ask them whether they had already heard about it. The vignette will be very similar to the one used in the RCT (Boas et al 2017) and in previous studies (Weitz-Shapiro and Winters 2017), focused on a hypothetical mayor. Respondents will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: positive treatment (where they are informed that the municipality met its school quality target), negative treatment (where they are informed that the municipality did not meet its school quality target), and control (where they are not given information about whether the municipality met its target). This design will allow us to identify the effect of positive vs negative information about the quality of schools, by comparing the mean of a given outcome in the positive treatment group to the mean of that same outcome in the negative treatment group. It will also allow us to identify the effect of school quality information versus absence thereof, by comparing the mean of a given outcome in the positive and negative treatment groups to the mean of that outcome in the placebo group. After the vignette, we will ask respondents about their likelihood of voting for that hypothetical mayor, on a 4-point Likert scale. This will provide additional tests for H1. Next, we will ask them about their perception of how likely they think the hypothetical mayor is to 1) have invested a lot of money in education, 2) have hired many municipal workers, 3) have improved municipal schools, 4) have improved municipal clinics, 5) have helped people like them solve their problems, and 6) have reduced poverty in the municipality.", "q18": "Brazil", "q19": "3000", "q20":
