In order to manipulate the accusation of ingroup wrongdoing we varied the extent to which a (fabricated) tweet implicated men as the perpetrators of sexual harassment against women within the workplace. However, the findings of Study 1 suggested that both experimental conditions threatened men\u2019s need for morality. Results indicated that men\u2019s need for moral acceptance was high (above the midpoint) in both conditions. While the low threat condition did not contain an explicit accusation of ingroup wrongdoing, male participants may have felt that a tweet regarding sexual harassment (from women) was implicitly holding their group accountable, leading them to feel similarly threatened to the \u201caccusation\u201d condition. \t\n\nAccordingly, Study 2 aims to use a \u201cmitigated threat\u201d condition to more accurately manipulate a threat to the advantaged groups\u2019 morality. The \u201cmitigated threat\u201d condition will present men with an accusation of ingroup wrongdoing alongside an article that describes men protesting against the sexual harassment of women (information designed to affirm their groups\u2019 morality). Moral affirmations have been successful in reducing threat to participants\u2019 collective identity in contexts of historical wrongdoing (Peetz, Gunn &amp; Wilson, 2010). In a similar vein, the use of \u201cmoral exemplars\u201d (being presented with an example of a group\u2019s moral behaviour) has been found to foster intergroup reconciliation processes in post genocide and post conflict settings (\u010cehaji\u0107-Clancy &amp; Bilewicz, 2020). However, to our knowledge, the use of moral exemplars as a strategy to reduce advantaged groups\u2019 threat within online contexts has not received empirical investigation. We expect that when men are presented with information that affirms their groups morality (alongside an accusation of ingroup wrongdoing), this should mitigate the threat to their need for acceptance. Reduced need for acceptance should be associated with a reduction in defensive responses.\n\nHowever, providing men with an article about their group mobilising on behalf of women does not just provide an example of ingroup moral behaviour, but also presents them with a norm that may influence other variables of interest (e.g. men\u2019s future intention to take action on behalf of women). To control for these potential effects, we plan to use two moral affirmation conditions. Both utilise a fabricated news article; one describes men taking online action to address sexual harassment against women, the other describes men as good parents and role models. \n\nHypotheses: \n(1)\tWe expect that participants in the accusation condition will have a greater need for morality than participants in the mitigated threat condition(s). The relationship between an accusation of ingroup wrongdoing and need for morality will be moderated by social identification with men. \n\n(2)\tNeed for morality will be positively related to, and mediate the effect of, an accusation of in-group wrongdoing on defensive strategies (1) competitive victimhood (claiming that their own group has also suffered), (2) attributing less responsibility to the in-group for the wrongdoing, and (3) perceiving the wrongdoing as having less severe consequences for the out group (indirect effect). \n"}, "study_type": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment"}, "study_type_other": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"data": "No, no data have been collected for this study yet.", "name": "Study 2", "other": "In Study 2, we will include a measure of masculine norms to explore whether participant\u2019s beliefs about group norms influences their responses to the dependent variables of interest. \n\nGroup Norms (6 items rated on a scale from 1 \u2013 weakly describes men to 7 \u2013 strongly describes men):\n\n\u201cWhat it means\u201d to be a man can mean different things to different people.

The study consisted of two tasks which were counterbalanced. One task tested children\u2019s preference to learn about novel people categories. The other task tested the children\u2019s tendency to generalize individual information to larger groups.\nPreference to Learn. At the beginning of each session, the experimenter familiarized the child with the current setting of Canada, and then introduced to the novel people groups living in different countries in the world, consisting of various skin colors (e.g., People in Zoovia have purple skin). Following this, the experimenter will continue:\nNow, I have some facts that I can tell you, but I can only tell you some of them because we don\u2019t have much time. So, I am going to pick up two facts at a time and you will choose the one that you would like to learn the most. Then, I will tell you the facts you chose at the end. Does that make sense? [wait for confirmation] Okay, and remember, we\u2019re imagining that these people are from different countries and the people in each country have a different skin color!\nWe used 16 cards, each with a drawing of a door on one side and a drawing of a person on the other. The two cards were placed in front of the child on a stand with the door-side facing the child and the person-side facing the experimenter. Therefore, there were eight trials where children were asked which fact they would like to learn and were encouraged to point to the card.  Each child was first be prompted with \u201cNow let\u2019s imagine that we are going on vacation to the country Zoovia. Which fact would you like to learn the most?\u201d One fact is always about the individual person (e.g., \u201cWhat this person in the picture likes to eat? This Zoovian?) and the other fact is always about the category of person (e.g., \u201cWhat this category of people like to eat? The Zoovians?; see Table 1 for a complete list of novel names). The order of the singular noun versus plural noun is counterbalanced. \nTendency to Generalize. In this task, children were shown a dot scale denoting \u201cAll\u201d, \u201cLots\u201d, \u201cSome\u201d, and \u201cFew\u201d. The children were taught what the scale represented and how to use it. The next part of the task introduced children to real pictures of people who were the same gender as a child but were either African-American or Asian depending on the child\u2019s race. If the child was non-Black then we would first present them with an African-American face and ask the child \u201cdoes this person belong to the same group as you?\u201d. If they answered \u201cyes\u201d, then the experiment continues with the African-American faces. If they answered \u201cno\u201d, then the child is shown an Asian face and asked again, \u201cdoes this person belong to the same group as you?\u201d. If the child was Black then they were shown a picture of an Asian face and asked \u201cdoes this person belong to the same group as you?\u201d. The purpose of not including Caucasian faces was to ensure that children were always asked to generalize about an outgroup. This is important because outgroups are seen as more homogenous while outgroups are seen as more heterogenous (Park &amp; Judd, 1990; Quattrone &amp; Jones, 1980). Therefore, we would suspect systemically lower generalization scores for ingroups than outgroups. There were eight different faces for each race. While asking them a question, the picture of the face was held up to them. The questions asked were about novel games, dances, puzzles, and sports (e.g., \u201cThis person is really good at a game called gorp. Now thinking about the people from the same country as this person, how many of those people are good at the game called gorp? All, Lots, Some, or Few?\u201d). There were two novel questions for each category (e.g., games, dance, puzzles, and sports) for a total of eight questions. The order of the questions was counterbalanced. At the end of the experiment, the experimenter would read the facts to the child from the preference to learn section, and then the child would be given a prize.\n"}}}, "planned-sample": {"value": {"question4b": {"extra": [], "value": "Children ages 9-10 as this is the age children begin to show a preference to learn about categories over individuals.\n"}, "question5b": {"extra": [], "value": "The data will be collected by several research assistants in various places including the laboratory, school camps, parks, and science centres."}, "question6b": {"extra": [], "value": "40 Participants - This is a similar number of participants used in similar studies (see Cimpian &amp; Park, 2013), as well as the predict G*power of an effect size of 0.42, alpha of 0.05 and Power of 0.8."}, "question7b": {"extra": [], "value": "Data collection ends when the desired number of participants (40), is reached, not including excluded data.

The study consisted of two tasks which were counterbalanced. One task tested children\u2019s preference to learn about novel people categories. The other task tested the children\u2019s tendency to generalize individual information to larger groups.\nPreference to Learn. At the beginning of each session, the experimenter familiarized the child with the current setting of Canada, and then introduced to the novel people groups living in different countries in the world, consisting of various skin colors (e.g., People in Zoovia have purple skin). Following this, the experimenter will continue:\nNow, I have some facts that I can tell you, but I can only tell you some of them because we don\u2019t have much time. So, I am going to pick up two facts at a time and you will choose the one that you would like to learn the most. Then, I will tell you the facts you chose at the end. Does that make sense? [wait for confirmation] Okay, and remember, we\u2019re imagining that these people are from different countries and the people in each country have a different skin color!\nWe used 16 cards, each with a drawing of a door on one side and a drawing of a person on the other. The two cards were placed in front of the child on a stand with the door-side facing the child and the person-side facing the experimenter. Therefore, there were eight trials where children were asked which fact they would like to learn and were encouraged to point to the card.  Each child was first be prompted with \u201cNow let\u2019s imagine that we are going on vacation to the country Zoovia. Which fact would you like to learn the most?\u201d One fact is always about the individual person (e.g., \u201cWhat this person in the picture likes to eat? This Zoovian?) and the other fact is always about the category of person (e.g., \u201cWhat this category of people like to eat? The Zoovians?; see Table 1 for a complete list of novel names). The order of the singular noun versus plural noun is counterbalanced. \nTendency to Generalize. In this task, children were shown a dot scale denoting \u201cAll\u201d, \u201cLots\u201d, \u201cSome\u201d, and \u201cFew\u201d. The children were taught what the scale represented and how to use it. The next part of the task introduced children to real pictures of people who were the same gender as a child but were either African-American or Asian depending on the child\u2019s race. If the child was non-Black then we would first present them with an African-American face and ask the child \u201cdoes this person belong to the same group as you?\u201d. If they answered \u201cyes\u201d, then the experiment continues with the African-American faces. If they answered \u201cno\u201d, then the child is shown an Asian face and asked again, \u201cdoes this person belong to the same group as you?\u201d. If the child was Black then they were shown a picture of an Asian face and asked \u201cdoes this person belong to the same group as you?\u201d. The purpose of not including Caucasian faces was to ensure that children were always asked to generalize about an outgroup. This is important because outgroups are seen as more homogenous while outgroups are seen as more heterogenous (Park &amp; Judd, 1990; Quattrone &amp; Jones, 1980). Therefore, we would suspect systemically lower generalization scores for ingroups than outgroups. There were eight different faces for each race. While asking them a question, the picture of the face was held up to them. The questions asked were about novel games, dances, puzzles, and sports (e.g., \u201cThis person is really good at a game called gorp. Now thinking about the people from the same country as this person, how many of those people are good at the game called gorp? All, Lots, Some, or Few?\u201d). There were two novel questions for each category (e.g., games, dance, puzzles, and sports) for a total of eight questions. The order of the questions was counterbalanced. At the end of the experiment, the experimenter would read the facts to the child from the preference to learn section, and then the child would be given a prize.\n", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question1c": "Preference to Learn Score: Ask the child if they would rather learn information about and individual (1) or a Group/Kind (0) and taking the average\nTendency to Generalize Score: Ask the child how many of the people from the same country as the person shown (in a picture), are good a the particular sport/game/dance/puzzle, All (3), Lots (2), Some (1), or Few (0) and taking the average", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question2c": "Pearson Correlational Analysis", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question3c": "Preference to Learn - DV\nTendency to Generalize - DV\nGender - Covariate\nChild's Race - Covariate\nExperimenter's Race - Covariate\nData Sheet - Covariate\n", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question4c": "Gender - There may be difference in gender when it comes to generalizing as there has not been gender effects for preference to learn (Sutherland &amp; Rule, under review)\nChild's Race - Race effects for stereotyping has been observed in other research (see Pauker, Xu, Williams &amp; Biddle, 2016)\nExperimenter's Race - There may be experimenter race effects in which children change their answers depending on the experimenter's race\nData Sheet - There may be order effects of the 4 datasheets in which there are differences in the order of the tasks and the order of the questions.", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question5c": "N/A", "description-methods.planned-sample.question4b": "Children ages 9-10 as this is the age children begin to show a preference to learn about categories over individuals.\n", "description-methods.planned-sample.question5b": "The data will be collected by several research assistants in various places including the laboratory, school camps, parks, and science centres.", "description-methods.planned-sample.question6b": "40 Participants - This is a similar number of participants used in similar studies (see Cimpian &amp; Park, 2013), as well as the predict G*power of an effect size of 0.42, alpha of 0.05 and Power of 0.8.", "description-methods.planned-sample.question7b": "Data collection ends when the desired number of participants (40), is reached, not including excluded data.
