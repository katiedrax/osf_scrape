Coordination in many situations requires individuals to risk some of their personal resources in hopes of obtaining a higher payoff if others also contribute. We study whether emotions, in particular fear, affect people's ability to coordinate in taking risky actions. Emotions are patterns of chemical and neural responses to environmental stimuli (Damasio, 1994). Fear, for instance, is controlled by a region of the brain called the amygdala, which triggers the release of the stress hormone cortisol, which causes changes in bodily processes such as heart rate, breathing, and metabolism that prepare an organism for action. The amygdala also triggers changes in higher-level processing in the brain, redirecting working memory to the potential threat and shifting decision-making through risk perceptions, risk preferences, and trust, among other parameters. While this basic dynamic describes many scenarios, we apply this view of decision-making from psychology and neuroscience to study decisions to participate in acts of collective dissent in authoritarian regimes. We build a model based on a global game (Carlsson and Van Damme, 1993; Morris and Shin, 2003, 2004) in which people decide whether or not to take a costly action to overthrow a regime. We argue that fear may reduce participation in collective dissent. In particular, fear may increase pessimism about a signal of the strength of the regime, and it may increase risk aversion. When people are aware that the other players are also in a state of fear, the effects may compound as not only will they themselves be more pessimistic and risk averse, but they will expect that their partner will be as well. We propose to conduct a lab experiment to test the implications of this model. In the lab, we will induce fear in a random subset of participants using an Autobiographical Emotional Memory Task (AEMT) (Lerner and Small, 2008; Myers and Tingley, Forthcoming). This treatment induces emotions by asking participants to write a description of a past experience in which they felt fear, while control participants describe a typical day. After the emotion induction, participants will play 15 rounds of a two-player coordination game. In this game, players will receive a signal of the cost of dissenting with the regime and decide whether to mobilize or not."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1.

To induce fear, we will use an Autobiographical Emotional Memory Task (AEMT) in which participants in the treatment condition write about something that makes them afraid, while control participants describe a typical day.

Most of the literature on scope insensitivity focuses on contingent valuation and willingness to pay (WTP), manipulating the scale of a policy and using a hypothetical contribution as the dependent variable. In this study, we manipulate scope by varying the expected effectiveness of a policy, holding the financial costs of the policy constant. We implement the design for policies regarding voter fraud and domestic violence. We add two further manipulations to examine the effect of problem prevalence priming and group identification on scope insensitivity."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: scope manipulation. Overall, we expect to find either strict or limited scope insensitivity in support for policies of varying effectiveness. Strict insensitivity amounts to a hypothesis of no differences across the three groups (1/3, 1/2, and 2/3 reductions in fraudulent voters on registration lists/repeat domestic violence offenses). Although strict insensitivity may materialize, we could also find modest differences in support according to the effectiveness of the policy.1 We hypothesize that any differences in support should be larger for initial gains, i.e., larger across the first two conditions (reducing fraud/violence by 1/3 vs. 1/2) than across the second two conditions (reducing fraud/violence by 1/2 vs. 2/3). H2-H5: prevalence prime. The prevalence prime serves two purposes: (1) to prime the respondent to think about the size of the problem that the proposed policy addresses and (2) to measure the respondent\u2019s prior on the size of the problem. We expect respondents treated with the prime to support the policy at higher rates than respondents in the control group (H2). Furthermore, we expect respondents with high priors on the prevalence of the issue to support the policy at higher rates than those with lower priors (H3). In addition, we expect individuals treated with the prime to become more scope insensitive; i.e., that differences in support across the scope conditions will decrease relative to those found for the unprimed respondents (H4). We also predict that respondents with high priors will be more scope insensitive than those with lower priors (H5). H6-H8: group cue. Drawing attention to harm to the respondent\u2019s ingroup should decrease support for the policy, irrespective of the prevalence prime or scope manipulation (H6). Specifically, we expect that Democrats who receive the group cue will support the voter fraud policy at a lower rate than Democrats in the control group, and that men who receive the group cue will support the domestic violence policy at a lower level than men in the control group. We will also evaluate whether the group cue moderates the degree of scope sensitivity that is manifest among group identifiers. On the one hand, the group cue treatment could increase scrutiny and, thus, scope sensitivity among group identifiers\u2014Democrats and men, respectively, for the vote fraud and domestic violence questions\u2014such that any differences in support across the three proposed policies will be higher for Democrats/men in the treatment group than for Democrats/men in the control group (H7a). On the other hand, by drawing attention to harm to the ingroup, the group cue could spur opposition to the policy regardless of the policy\u2019s effectiveness, resulting in diminished scope sensitivity (H7b). We do not have a clear prediction for outgroup behavior. We see three possibilities: (1) Outgroup respondents receiving the group cue support the policy at a lower rate than the outgroup control respondents. Respondents\u2019 support for the policy decreases when they are made aware of the costs. If this occurs, we expect the decrease to be smaller than the corresponding decrease for the ingroup.

Most of the literature on scope insensitivity focuses on contingent valuation and willingness to pay (WTP), manipulating the scale of a policy and using a hypothetical contribution as the dependent variable. In this study, we manipulate scope by varying the expected effectiveness of a policy, holding the financial costs of the policy constant. We implement the design for policies regarding voter fraud and domestic violence. We add two further manipulations to examine the effect of problem prevalence priming and group identification on scope insensitivity.", "q16": "H1: scope manipulation. Overall, we expect to find either strict or limited scope insensitivity in support for policies of varying effectiveness. Strict insensitivity amounts to a hypothesis of no differences across the three groups (1/3, 1/2, and 2/3 reductions in fraudulent voters on registration lists/repeat domestic violence offenses). Although strict insensitivity may materialize, we could also find modest differences in support according to the effectiveness of the policy.1 We hypothesize that any differences in support should be larger for initial gains, i.e., larger across the first two conditions (reducing fraud/violence by 1/3 vs. 1/2) than across the second two conditions (reducing fraud/violence by 1/2 vs. 2/3). H2-H5: prevalence prime. The prevalence prime serves two purposes: (1) to prime the respondent to think about the size of the problem that the proposed policy addresses and (2) to measure the respondent\u2019s prior on the size of the problem. We expect respondents treated with the prime to support the policy at higher rates than respondents in the control group (H2). Furthermore, we expect respondents with high priors on the prevalence of the issue to support the policy at higher rates than those with lower priors (H3). In addition, we expect individuals treated with the prime to become more scope insensitive; i.e., that differences in support across the scope conditions will decrease relative to those found for the unprimed respondents (H4). We also predict that respondents with high priors will be more scope insensitive than those with lower priors (H5). H6-H8: group cue. Drawing attention to harm to the respondent\u2019s ingroup should decrease support for the policy, irrespective of the prevalence prime or scope manipulation (H6). Specifically, we expect that Democrats who receive the group cue will support the voter fraud policy at a lower rate than Democrats in the control group, and that men who receive the group cue will support the domestic violence policy at a lower level than men in the control group. We will also evaluate whether the group cue moderates the degree of scope sensitivity that is manifest among group identifiers. On the one hand, the group cue treatment could increase scrutiny and, thus, scope sensitivity among group identifiers\u2014Democrats and men, respectively, for the vote fraud and domestic violence questions\u2014such that any differences in support across the three proposed policies will be higher for Democrats/men in the treatment group than for Democrats/men in the control group (H7a). On the other hand, by drawing attention to harm to the ingroup, the group cue could spur opposition to the policy regardless of the policy\u2019s effectiveness, resulting in diminished scope sensitivity (H7b). We do not have a clear prediction for outgroup behavior. We see three possibilities: (1) Outgroup respondents receiving the group cue support the policy at a lower rate than the outgroup control respondents. Respondents\u2019 support for the policy decreases when they are made aware of the costs. If this occurs, we expect the decrease to be smaller than the corresponding decrease for the ingroup. (2) Outgroup respondents receiving the group cue support the policy at a higher rate than the outgroup control respondents. With intergroup competition made salient, they have a higher propensity to support the policy since it disadvantages the outgroup. (3) Outgroup respondents receiving the group cue support the policy at the same rate as the outgroup control respondents. The group cue does not affect their perception of the policy, or the effects described in (1) and (2) cancel each other out. Given H6, then if either (2) or (3) are operating we should also see a larger opinion gap between Democrats and Republicans in the treatment (group cue) group than in the control group in the voter fraud experiment (H8 fraud) and a larger opinion gap between men and women in the treatment (group cue) group than in the control group in the domestic violence experiment (H8 domestic violence).", "q17": "For each policy issue, the design follows a 2x3x2 factorial that yields 12 experimental conditions\u2014each consisting of a unique question wording.

Vignette experiment on ethnic appeals: The goal of this experiment is to examine how individuals respond to targeted ethnic appeals by co-ethnic political leaders (H1). Respondents will be asked to listen to a campaign speech by a hypothetical leader considering running for parliament. The script for the speech is shown below. There are four version: a control, an inclusive appeal, a targeted ethnic appeal using explicit language, and a more subtle ethnic appeal. For all respondents, the candidate will be identified as a co-ethnic using common surnames to signal co-ethnicity (the audio recordings will also be made by native speakers from each of the seven largest ethnic groups in Nairobi, and respondents will be matched to co-ethnic actors). After listening to one version of the speech, respondents will be asked whether they would vote for the candidate (recorded on a \u201csecret ballot\u201d to be placed in an envelope in order to minimize social desirability bias). We expect that on average long-time residents of Nairobi will punish the aspirant for making targeted ethnic appeals (both explicit and subtle) and reward the candidate for making inclusive promises, relative to the control condition. The size of these rewards and punishments will be smaller or non-existent for more recent migrants and rural residents. b. Vignette experiment on ethnic favoritism: The goal of this experiment is to examine how individuals respond to political aspirants who engage in ethnic favoritism (H2). Respondents will be told about two hypothetical candidates who are considering running for office as Councilors, and asked to indicate who they would vote for (again using a secret ballot placed in an envelope). For one of the candidates (order randomized), favoritism history will be provided (script below). There are four versions: 1) a control condition with no favoritism history; 2) an ethnic favoritism condition in which critics allege that the selected candidate has favored co-ethnics over non-co-ethnics; 3) an inclusive condition in which the selected candidate has helped people from all ethnic groups; and 4) a condition in which the selected candidate has helped co-ethnic students but without the allegation of favoring co-ethnics over non-co-ethnics. Other attributes of the candidates (first name, age, profession) will be randomized to make them appear realistic. Surnames for both candidates will chosen to signal co-ethnicity with the respondent. We expect that on average long-time residents of Nairobi will punish the aspirant for favoring co-ethnics over non-co-ethnics and reward the candidate for providing assistance to all groups, relative to the control condition. We expect no penalty for helping co-ethnics when there is no allegation of ethnic favoritism. The size of these rewards and punishments will be smaller or non-existent for more recent migrants and rural residents. c.

Respondents will be told about two hypothetical candidates who are considering running for office as Councilors, and asked to indicate who they would vote for (again using a secret ballot placed in an envelope). For one of the candidates (order randomized), favoritism history will be provided (script below). There are four versions: 1) a control condition with no favoritism history; 2) an ethnic favoritism condition in which critics allege that the selected candidate has favored co-ethnics over non-co-ethnics; 3) an inclusive condition in which the selected candidate has helped people from all ethnic groups; and 4) a condition in which the selected candidate has helped co-ethnic students but without the allegation of favoring co-ethnics over non-co-ethnics. Other attributes of the candidates (first name, age, profession) will be randomized to make them appear realistic. Surnames for both candidates will chosen to signal co-ethnicity with the respondent. We expect that on average long-time residents of Nairobi will punish the aspirant for favoring co-ethnics over non-co-ethnics and reward the candidate for providing assistance to all groups, relative to the control condition. We expect no penalty for helping co-ethnics when there is no allegation of ethnic favoritism. The size of these rewards and punishments will be smaller or non-existent for more recent migrants and rural residents. c. Dictator game: Respondents will play two rounds of the dictator game with one recipient being from their own ethnic group and the other from an out-group (order randomized). The goal of this component is to employ a behavioral measure of ethnic preferences regarding discrimination/fairness (H3). Recipient profiles are based on respondents from a prior national survey conducted in Kenya in 2012-13. In each round participants will be given information about the recipient\u2019s age, education, and where born (county and province \u2013 a signal of ethnic origin). In each round respondents will choose how to divide 50 shillings, placing their responses in an envelope. We expect that for long-time residents of Nairobi the \u201cethnic premium\u201d (the amount given to co-ethnic recipients relative to non-co-ethnics) will be lower than for more recent migrants or rural residents.", "q18": "Kenya", "q19": "1,600", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "STUDY00029495", "q25": "5-May-16", "q26": "Researchers", "q27": "", "q28": "No", "q29": "",

Respondents will be presented sets of MP-profile pairs and be asked to choose the MP profile that they prefer. Each MP-profile varies on seven attributes. The attributes are divided into two clusters. The first cluster (1, 2, 3, 4) randomizes four important individual characteristics that are usually considered in choice tasks on MPs: gender, party affiliation, motivation for the candidacy, and experience as MP.

The P2P intervention aimed to improve local health care provision in rural Uganda by empowering community members to better monitor and sanction underperforming health care providers.

This project examines the relationship between contentious and electoral politics in times of crisis by investigating the effect of a candidate's social movements background on support for their candidacy for public office, perceptions of their qualifications, character, and ideological position. Using a candidate choice experiment in Spain, I propose to test whether voters reward prior involvement in contentious politics and if so, whether they do so for some social movements but not others. Finally, I aim to unpack the signal that activist experience sends to the voters, providing insight into what drives voters' (dis)approval of activists-turned-politicians. I argue that there are two ways in which candidate's social movement background influences vote choice. First, activism reduces uncertainty around the candidate's ideal point. More specifically, voters receives better information about where the candidate falls on the ideological spectrum than if relying on party cues alone. This is because activism is a costly (time sacrifice, risk of arrest etc.) and thus credible signal of ideological beliefs. Given that most new social movements, particularly in the Spanish context, such as feminist, anti-austerity, or ecological movements, are left-leaning movements, voters will infer a left-wing position from an activist background. Second, in addition to an informational channel, there is a character or integrity component, which, unlike the information channel which has differential effects, should increase support for social movements candidates across the political spectrum. I argue that activists are considered more honest because of their lack of association with and opposition to the corrupt establishment, as well as presumed values-based (as opposed to opportunistic or career-oriented) involvement. This distinguishes them from labor union activists who - despite advocacy for social issues and workers' rights - belong to highly institutionalized organizations with close ties to politics and therefore are often grouped together with the establishment as culprits, not victims, of the crisis."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypothesis 1A: Respondents will place candidates with contentious experience further on the left than candidates from the same party without the social movement experience, including candidates with labor union experience. Hypothesis 1B: Respondents will be more certain about the ideological placement of activist candidates than other candidates. This, in turn will influence vote choice: Hypothesis 1C: Respondents on the left side of the political spectrum will be more likely to support candidates involved in social movements (believed to be proximate to their own ideal point). In contrast, respondents on the right side of the political spectrum will be less likely to vote for a candidate with a social movements experience (believed to be further away from their own ideal point). Hypothesis 2: All respondents, regardless of their ideology, will consider activist candidates to be more honest and more likable. Hypothesis 3: Activist credentials: Sacrifice will strengthen these effects. Activists who were arrested for their involvement in a social movement (relative to those described as having committed time) will be even more likely to receive support of left-wing voters and even less likely to receive support of right-wing voters. In the atmosphere of declining trust in institutions, parties, and professional politicians, however, voters might simply favor outsiders, regardless of their experience. This would suggest that social movements background provides no additional advantage or carries no additional penalty than simply not being part of the establishment. In this case, we would observe no difference in support for candidates with trade union involvement, business experience, or social movement activism, only between political insiders and outsiders. Hypothesis 4: Candidates will be rewarded for being a political outsider more than experience, be it political, trade union, business, or even activist. Hypothesis 5: Crisis effect: Among those respondents who rate the economic situation in Spain as bad or very bad, those who were asked the question at the beginning of the survey (and thus primed to think of the economic crisis) will be more likely to declare intention to vote for political outsiders and social movement activists. I will also test whether skills gained in social movements organizing are considered transferrable into the political realm. If they are, leaders of social movements should be considered more qualified for political office than rank-and-file members and just as qualified as leaders in business or labor unions. Hypothesis 6: Leadership effect: Candidates described as having held leadership positions either in the party or in the movement will be rated as more competent/qualified by the respondents.

This project examines the relationship between contentious and electoral politics in times of crisis by investigating the effect of a candidate's social movements background on support for their candidacy for public office, perceptions of their qualifications, character, and ideological position. Using a candidate choice experiment in Spain, I propose to test whether voters reward prior involvement in contentious politics and if so, whether they do so for some social movements but not others. Finally, I aim to unpack the signal that activist experience sends to the voters, providing insight into what drives voters' (dis)approval of activists-turned-politicians. I argue that there are two ways in which candidate's social movement background influences vote choice. First, activism reduces uncertainty around the candidate's ideal point. More specifically, voters receives better information about where the candidate falls on the ideological spectrum than if relying on party cues alone. This is because activism is a costly (time sacrifice, risk of arrest etc.) and thus credible signal of ideological beliefs. Given that most new social movements, particularly in the Spanish context, such as feminist, anti-austerity, or ecological movements, are left-leaning movements, voters will infer a left-wing position from an activist background.
