Using RMSSD is less susceptible to respiratory effects (Hill &amp; Siebenbrock, 2009; Verkuil, Brosschot, &amp; Thayer, 2014). This is an index of cardiac parasympathetic influence. Variable will be change in RMSSD from baseline physiological measurement to condition stimuli presentation physiological measurement (between-participant after this data reduction).\n\n2) Stroke index (SI), which is stroke volume adjusted for body size (following Cooper et al., 2014). Stroke volume is the volume of blood pumped with each heartbeat. Variable will be change in SI from baseline physiological measurement to condition stimuli presentation physiological measurement (between-participant after this data reduction).\n\n3) Cardiac index (CI; cardiac output adjusted for body size; Cooper et al., 2014). This is the volume of blood pumped per minute. Both #2 and #3 are proxies for the volume of blood pumped from the left ventricle and an indicator of cardiac function. Elevated cardiac output corresponds to early phases of hypertension (Palatini &amp; Julius, 2009). Variable will be change in CI from baseline physiological measurement to condition stimuli presentation physiological measurement (between-participant after this data reduction).\n\n4) Cardiac pre-ejection period (PEP). PEP is indexed as the time (in milliseconds) between left\u2010ventricular depolarization, indicated by onset of the ECG Q\u2010wave and the initiation of ejection of blood into the aorta, indicated by the ICG B-wave. Following Neblett &amp; Roberts (2013), PEP is a general index of vascular contractility and a commonly accepted indicator of challenge or threat appraisals.

"}}}, "procedure": {"value": {"question10b": {"extra": [], "value": "The study will consist of two parts that function as separate sub-studies with separate samples of participants - a focus group (Part 1) and an online survey and laboratory visit (Part 2). Part 1 consists of participants completing a focus group eligibility screener, which is an online Qualtrics survey. This survey first provides an electronic consent form for participants to review. Participants who consent then provide their contact information and intended compensation (gift card vs. participant pool credit), answers to eligibility questions previously described in inclusion/exclusion criteria (faculty status/undergraduate student status, race/ethnicity, age, and social media use), and preliminary availability (i.e., days of the week and morning/afternoon/evening) for focus group participation. If they meet eligibility criteria, participants will be emailed to schedule a time to come into the lab to participate in a focus group. Focus groups will be composed of a maximum of 6 students per focus group, with 2 focus groups per condition (race-related-negative, race-related-positive, non-race-related-negative, non-race-related-positive) and will be 60 minutes maximum. The condition that each focus group will assess will be randomly assigned (single-blind). Once they arrive to the lab for the focus group, participants will first re-engage in a written consent process. If electing to consent to participate, first participants will be asked to fill out a paper-and-pencil packet. This packet asks participants demographic questions (sex, gender identity, year in school, time spent on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat). It then asks participants to rate a set of 10 online social media stimuli (the set of stimuli for one of the four conditions) on a variety of dimensions, including perceived positivity, negativity, racial motivation, attractiveness of avatar, changes felt in their body when viewing the stimulus, and changes felt in their mood or thoughts when viewing the stimulus. Next, participants will be asked to discuss the group of stimuli together in a discussion format. Specifically, participants will view the group of stimuli on a TV screen and discuss which stimuli stuck out the most, are most stressful, are most negative, most positive, if they were racially motivated, their first impressions of the stimuli, and the realness of the stimuli. Participants will be compensated with a gift card of US $15 or psychology participant pool credit, debriefed, and provided with resources regarding stress and mental health. \n\nPart 2 will recruit a separate set of participants than Part 1 and consists of two components. First, interested participants will access an online survey on the Qualtrics platform. This survey provides information about the study and an opportunity to electronically consent to participate. Those participants who consent to participate in the study will provide their contact information and intended compensation (gift card vs. participant pool credit), answers to eligibility questions previously described in inclusion/exclusion criteria (participation in previous Part 1 of the study, faculty status/undergraduate student status, diagnosis of irregular heartbeat and/or heart rhythm, race/ethnicity, age, and social media use), and preliminary availability (i.e., days of the week and morning/afternoon/evening) for focus group participation. If they meet eligibility criteria, participants will next respond to a series of additional demographic questions (gender identity, sex, year in school, household income of the person who financially supports the participant). Then participants will respond to a series of standardized measures, which will be presented in a random order to participants, including: physical activity (following Jackson, Blaire, Mahar, Wier, Ross, &amp; Stuteville, 1990), gender role conflict (GRC-SF; Wester, Vogel, O\u2019Neil, &amp; Danforth, 2012), exposure to traumatic events online (following Tynes, Willis, Stewart, &amp; Hamilton, 2019), exposure to different forms of racism (IRRS-B; Utsey, Ponterotto, Reynolds, &amp; Cancelli, 2000), exposure to individually experienced online racial discrimination (I-ORD following Tynes, Rose, &amp; Williams, 2010), exposure to vicariously experienced online racial discrimination (V-ORD following Tynes, Rose, &amp; Williams, 2010), critical consciousness (CCS; Diemer, Rapa, Park, &amp; Perry, 2016), collective efficacy (following Cohen, Finch, Bower, &amp; Sastry, 2006), social media use (Ohannessian, 2009; Vannucci, Flannery, &amp; Ohannessian, 2017), racial identity (MIBI-S; Martin, Wout, Nguyen, Gonzalez, &amp; Sellers, 2010), exposure to gendered racial microaggressions which will be completed only by cisgender women participants (GRMS; Lewis &amp; Neville, 2015), exposure to and resilience against gender minority stress which will be completed only by transgender, gender non-binary, and/or agender participants (GMSRM; Testa, Habarth, Peta, Balsam, &amp; Bockting, 2015). After completing questionnaires, participants will be provided with resources regarding stress and mental health, asked their preference for the sex of the research team member conducting their lab visit, and told they will be contacted about scheduling the lab visit via email soon. Participants will be compensated US $5 electronic gift card for completing the online survey. Participants will next attend the laboratory visit in a secure lab location on campus. Once they arrive to the lab, participants will first re-engage in a written consent process. If electing to consent to participate, the research assistant running the laboratory visit will first take measurements of participants\u2019 body composition (height via stadiometer, weight via scale, waist circumference via a circumference measuring tape). Next, participants will be asked to complete a paper-and-pencil checklist which asks about caffeine consumption, nicotine consumption, cardiac medication, anxiety medication, medications that cause drowsiness, antidepressant medication, and ADHD/ADD medication. Then participants will complete a single-item measure of pleasure and arousal which asks participants to indicate how they are feeling \u201cat this moment\u201d by placing an X in one of the boxes on the grid (Affect Grid; Russell, Weiss, &amp; Mendelsohn, 1989). Next, the research assistant will secure physiological equipment to the participant. Skin will first be prepared for single-use disposable ECG electrode placement by wiping the skin with preparation gel, which is slightly abrasive, and then electrodes are gel-ed with non-irritating, hypo-allergenic gel, and applied to the skin. Three electrodes will be placed on the skin \u2013 two on the left and right collarbone, respectively, and one on the lowest rib on the participant\u2019s left side. A respiration belt will then be placed over the participant\u2019s clothing around the abdomen/chest. Finally,  continuous non-invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) monitor equipment will be attached to the participant via the use of a finger and arm cuff. The participant will be asked to wear the ECG, respiration, and CNAP equipment for no more than 20 minutes in total. First, participants will engage in a baseline period wherein they will be instructed to sit still and relax without talking for 5 minutes. Next, participants will be shown a series of up to 10 online stimuli in the form of fabricated twitter posts on a computer screen. Participants will be randomized to see one set of 10 stimuli from one of the four stimuli conditions. Randomization to condition will be conducted by Inquisit programming such that condition will be double-blind. Before stimuli are presented, an attention-directing image will first appear on the screen. Each stimulus will be on the screen for 30 seconds (stimuli will be pre-programmed to display automatically for 30 seconds, one after the other), and the presentation of stimuli within condition will also be randomized via Inquisit programming. Finally, after participants have seen all stimuli in the set, they will engage in another period of 5 minutes (the \u201crecovery\u201d period) wherein they will be instructed to sit still and relax without talking for 5 minutes. After this period, physiological equipment will be removed. Next, participants will then be asked to fill out another paper-and-pencil packet, which includes another Affect Grid, question about emotions felt, a measure of racial centrality (sub-scale from MIBI-S), and questions about each stimuli avatar in the set (perceived race, perceived gender, perceived education, perceived attractiveness, perceived likeability) and manipulation check items (how racially motivated, positive, and negative were the stimuli as a group).

Although no previous research has examined physiological responses to online racism, theoretical work proposes that online racism may engender psychosocial and corresponding psychophysiological stress responses, which has consequences for the health of Black individuals (Volpe, Hoggard, Willis, &amp; Tynes, under review). However, we operate from the assumption that exposure to online racism engenders a physiological stress response similar to exposure to in-person racism (or its proxies, as measured experimentally).

The demographic variables are age, sex assigned at birth on one\u2019s original birth certificate, current gender identity, race/ethnicity, and year in school. Social media use will be evaluated using four questions that ask how much time a participant spends on Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook, respectively, which will be measured on a 6-point scale that ranged from 1 (None) to 6 (About four hours). \n\nAnalytic evaluation of the original stimuli set will then occur in several steps. First, interrater reliability will be determined using two intraclass correlation (ICC) analyses. We will use a two-way random effects model assessing single measure consistency in quantitative ratings of three qualities of interest, positivity, negativity, and racial motivation, for each of the four stimuli conditions.  The threshold for acceptable consistency will be an ICC of at least 0.70 (Landis &amp; Koch, 1977). Our goal is to have an average ICC of at least 0.70 for each condition.\n\nIf a stimuli set has adequate ICC\u2019s for all three main qualities of  interest, meaning that the whole stimuli set was consistently rated on positivity, negativity, and racial motivation, each Tweet stimulus\u2019 will be further examined in order to determine exclusion or inclusion within the final stimuli set. Mean scores for the qualities of interest will be used as a primary step to indicate whether or not participants\u2019 perceptions of individual stimuli match the intended condition. For the race-related positive condition, the desired mean score for positivity will be at least 4 (Very Positive), at most 2 (Slightly Negative) for negativity, and at least 4 (Very Racially Motivated) for racial motivation. For the non-race-related-negative condition, the desired mean score for positivity will be at most 2 (Slightly Positive), at least 4 (Very Negative) for negativity, and at least 4 (Very Racially Motivated) for racial motivation. For the non-race-related-positive condition, the desired mean score for positivity will be at least 4 (Very Positive), at most 2 (Slightly Negative) for negativity, and at most 2 (Slightly Racially Motivated) for racial motivation. For the non-race-related-negative condition, the desired mean score for positivity will be at most 2 (Slightly Positive), at least 4 (Very Negative) for negativity, and at most 2 (Very Racially Motivated) for racial motivation. The scale cutoffs for the quality of interest mean scores were determined using Larsen et al.\u2019s (2009) description of positive and negative unipolar scale scores in their validated evaluative space grid. \n\nFor the stimuli within each condition that meet these mean requirements, there will be a final step to determine inclusion dependent upon the three qualities of interest. The qualitative responses to the questions, \u201cOf all of these tweets, which are the most negative?,\u201d \u201cWhat was most negative about it / why was it most negative?,\u201d \u201cWhich are the most positive?,\u201d \u201dWhat was most positive about it / why was it most positive?,\u201d \u201cHow racially motivated did you think these tweets were?,\u201d and \u201cHow could you tell?\u201d will be used in this step. The focus group discussion will be recorded. Participants will be instructed to speak one at a time and to state their participant ID number before responding to any question or statement posed during the discussion. During transcription of the discussions, these ID numbers will be used to differentiate participant responses. If there is at least 30% disagreement from focus group participants about an intended quality of interest, the stimulus in question will be removed from the final stimuli set. So, for example, if at least four participants across a condition\u2019s two focus groups, or approximately 30% of these focus group participants, do not believe or question whether a stimulus from the race-related-positive condition is positive, it will be removed for not adequately fitting with its condition. These steps will be taken so that we can make sure that the stimuli that are included do in fact represent the conditions for which they were designed. \n\nIf a stimuli set does not have adequate ICCs (i.e., defined as being below 0.70, for all three qualities of interest), meaning that there was not consistency in quantitative ratings of the stimuli set, the qualitative responses about these qualities will be used to determine which stimuli to remove from the set. Therefore, as stated above, if there is at least 30% disagreement or more than four participants who disagree about an intended quality of interest regarding a stimulus within one of the conditions, that stimulus will be removed from the final stimuli set. After all stimuli that do not pass through the qualitative step are removed, ICC analyses on the qualities of interest for the updated stimuli set will be run again. The stimuli sets will then go through the previously stated steps dependent upon whether their quality of interest ICCs are below or above the set threshold, 0.70.\n\nOnce consistently rated and evaluated stimuli sets are established dependent upon qualities of interest, further examination of the stimuli within each condition will occur. The following steps will be carried out concurrently. The 30% or four participant threshold for disagreement within the intended conditions written about previously will also be used in this set of steps to determine if a stimulus should be removed from its condition. In one step, responses to the following questions from the questionnaire will be examined, \u201cWhen looking at this post, do you feel any changes happening to your body? (Select one option, Yes or No)  If so, please briefly explain:\u201d and \u201cWhen looking at this post, do you feel any changes in your mood or thoughts? (Select one option, Yes or No)  If so, please briefly explain:\u201d. For the participants that select yes, their open-ended responses will be examined by the research team to determine whether the changes that they write about are incongruent with the intended condition or speak to a quality of the stimulus that would not be desirable for the final stimuli set. For example, in an examining a race-related-negative stimulus, if four participants indicate that the stimulus is funny or that it makes them want to laugh, that stimulus will be removed from the stimuli set. In another step, responses to the following questions from the discussion will be examined dependent upon whether the condition is positive or negative, \u201cOf all of these tweets, which are the most stressful?\u201d and \u201cWhat was most stressful about it / why was it stressful?.\u201d For the race-related-positive and non-race-related-positive conditions, it is preferred that they are overall not stressful for the participants. For the race-related-negative and non-race-related-negative conditions, it is preferred that they are overall stressful for the participants. In another step, responses to the following questions from the discussion will be examined to determine believability of the stimuli, \u201cDid you think these were real Twitter statuses?,\u201d \u201cWhy or why not?,\u201d \u201cIs there anything we could do to make them more believable?,\u201d and \u201cWhat things did you notice while looking at them?\u201d In this step, stimuli that are not considered to be believable will not necessarily abide by the previously stated exclusion threshold. The final decision for the stimulus in question will be determined by the research team. If there is a stimulus that does not meet the threshold for believability, but maps well onto its intended condition, the research team may decide to include it within the final stimuli set if the other quantitative and qualitative responses about stimulus quality are thought to outweigh its lack of believability. \n\nAs a final step for evaluating the stimuli for inclusion within the final stimuli set, the responses to the discussion questions, \u201cWhich one of these tweets stuck out to you the most?,\u201d and \u201cWhy did it stick out to you?\u201d will be examined. Ideally, the stimuli within the final set will not be uniquely different from others within the same condition. If they were, any responses to the condition within experimental studies may be due to the unique stimulus and not the intended qualities of the condition. The exclusion threshold will not be the basis for exclusion in this step. The research team will closely examine responses to the second question. If the responses about certain stimuli indicate a unique quality of the stimulus in question that is determined to be potentially detrimental to the quality of final stimuli set, it will be removed. \n\nOther than being used for determining whether a stimulus will be included or excluded, the qualitative responses from the questionnaire and discussion will be used to later describe the stimuli within any future publications or presentations."}, "question3c": {"extra": [], "value": "RQ1 \u2013 Focus Group (No a priori hypotheses, exploratory): See above (statistical technique) for full details."}, "question4c": {"extra": [], "value": "RQ1 \u2013 Focus Group (No a priori hypotheses, exploratory): No covariates will be utilized in this type of analysis."}, "question5c": {"extra": [], "value": "RQ1 \u2013 Focus Group (No a priori hypotheses, exploratory): Criteria are described in detail in the statistical technique section."}}}}}, "confirmatory-analyses-third": {"value": {"third": {"value": {"question1c": {"extra": [], "value": "RQ3 \u2013 Online Survey &amp; Laboratory Visit (Hypotheses 3; No a priori hypotheses; Exploratory): For RQ3a, relevant variables include period (within-person; 2 levels: baseline, stimuli-presentation) 5 outcome variables (change in HRV, SI, CI, MAP, PEP), and theoretically-based control variables of  biological sex, BMI, caffeine and/or nicotine use, medication use, physical activity, and experimenter (listed with supporting citations below).

Using RMSSD is less susceptible to respiratory effects (Hill &amp; Siebenbrock, 2009; Verkuil, Brosschot, &amp; Thayer, 2014). This is an index of cardiac parasympathetic influence. Variable will be change in RMSSD from baseline physiological measurement to condition stimuli presentation physiological measurement (between-participant after this data reduction).\n\n2) Stroke index (SI), which is stroke volume adjusted for body size (following Cooper et al., 2014). Stroke volume is the volume of blood pumped with each heartbeat. Variable will be change in SI from baseline physiological measurement to condition stimuli presentation physiological measurement (between-participant after this data reduction).\n\n3) Cardiac index (CI; cardiac output adjusted for body size; Cooper et al., 2014). This is the volume of blood pumped per minute. Both #2 and #3 are proxies for the volume of blood pumped from the left ventricle and an indicator of cardiac function. Elevated cardiac output corresponds to early phases of hypertension (Palatini &amp; Julius, 2009). Variable will be change in CI from baseline physiological measurement to condition stimuli presentation physiological measurement (between-participant after this data reduction).\n\n4) Cardiac pre-ejection period (PEP). PEP is indexed as the time (in milliseconds) between left\u2010ventricular depolarization, indicated by onset of the ECG Q\u2010wave and the initiation of ejection of blood into the aorta, indicated by the ICG B-wave.

Variable will be change in PEP from baseline physiological measurement to condition stimuli presentation physiological measurement (between-participant after this data reduction). \n\n5) Mean arterial pressure (MAP), which is a function of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance (following Hill &amp; Thayer, 2019). MAP is, generally, the average pressure in the arteries during one cardiac cycle and a good index of perfusion to vital organs (DeMers &amp; Wachs, 2020).

Participants who consent then provide their contact information and intended compensation (gift card vs. participant pool credit), answers to eligibility questions previously described in inclusion/exclusion criteria (faculty status/undergraduate student status, race/ethnicity, age, and social media use), and preliminary availability (i.e., days of the week and morning/afternoon/evening) for focus group participation. If they meet eligibility criteria, participants will be emailed to schedule a time to come into the lab to participate in a focus group. Focus groups will be composed of a maximum of 6 students per focus group, with 2 focus groups per condition (race-related-negative, race-related-positive, non-race-related-negative, non-race-related-positive) and will be 60 minutes maximum. The condition that each focus group will assess will be randomly assigned (single-blind). Once they arrive to the lab for the focus group, participants will first re-engage in a written consent process. If electing to consent to participate, first participants will be asked to fill out a paper-and-pencil packet. This packet asks participants demographic questions (sex, gender identity, year in school, time spent on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat). It then asks participants to rate a set of 10 online social media stimuli (the set of stimuli for one of the four conditions) on a variety of dimensions, including perceived positivity, negativity, racial motivation, attractiveness of avatar, changes felt in their body when viewing the stimulus, and changes felt in their mood or thoughts when viewing the stimulus. Next, participants will be asked to discuss the group of stimuli together in a discussion format. Specifically, participants will view the group of stimuli on a TV screen and discuss which stimuli stuck out the most, are most stressful, are most negative, most positive, if they were racially motivated, their first impressions of the stimuli, and the realness of the stimuli. Participants will be compensated with a gift card of US $15 or psychology participant pool credit, debriefed, and provided with resources regarding stress and mental health. \n\nPart 2 will recruit a separate set of participants than Part 1 and consists of two components. First, interested participants will access an online survey on the Qualtrics platform. This survey provides information about the study and an opportunity to electronically consent to participate. Those participants who consent to participate in the study will provide their contact information and intended compensation (gift card vs. participant pool credit), answers to eligibility questions previously described in inclusion/exclusion criteria (participation in previous Part 1 of the study, faculty status/undergraduate student status, diagnosis of irregular heartbeat and/or heart rhythm, race/ethnicity, age, and social media use), and preliminary availability (i.e., days of the week and morning/afternoon/evening) for focus group participation. If they meet eligibility criteria, participants will next respond to a series of additional demographic questions (gender identity, sex, year in school, household income of the person who financially supports the participant). Then participants will respond to a series of standardized measures, which will be presented in a random order to participants, including: physical activity (following Jackson, Blaire, Mahar, Wier, Ross, &amp; Stuteville, 1990), gender role conflict (GRC-SF; Wester, Vogel, O\u2019Neil, &amp; Danforth, 2012), exposure to traumatic events online (following Tynes, Willis, Stewart, &amp; Hamilton, 2019), exposure to different forms of racism (IRRS-B; Utsey, Ponterotto, Reynolds, &amp; Cancelli, 2000), exposure to individually experienced online racial discrimination (I-ORD following Tynes, Rose, &amp; Williams, 2010), exposure to vicariously experienced online racial discrimination (V-ORD following Tynes, Rose, &amp; Williams, 2010), critical consciousness (CCS; Diemer, Rapa, Park, &amp; Perry, 2016), collective efficacy (following Cohen, Finch, Bower, &amp; Sastry, 2006), social media use (Ohannessian, 2009; Vannucci, Flannery, &amp; Ohannessian, 2017), racial identity (MIBI-S; Martin, Wout, Nguyen, Gonzalez, &amp; Sellers, 2010), exposure to gendered racial microaggressions which will be completed only by cisgender women participants (GRMS; Lewis &amp; Neville, 2015), exposure to and resilience against gender minority stress which will be completed only by transgender, gender non-binary, and/or agender participants (GMSRM; Testa, Habarth, Peta, Balsam, &amp; Bockting, 2015). After completing questionnaires, participants will be provided with resources regarding stress and mental health, asked their preference for the sex of the research team member conducting their lab visit, and told they will be contacted about scheduling the lab visit via email soon. Participants will be compensated US $5 electronic gift card for completing the online survey. Participants will next attend the laboratory visit in a secure lab location on campus. Once they arrive to the lab, participants will first re-engage in a written consent process. If electing to consent to participate, the research assistant running the laboratory visit will first take measurements of participants\u2019 body composition (height via stadiometer, weight via scale, waist circumference via a circumference measuring tape). Next, participants will be asked to complete a paper-and-pencil checklist which asks about caffeine consumption, nicotine consumption, cardiac medication, anxiety medication, medications that cause drowsiness, antidepressant medication, and ADHD/ADD medication. Then participants will complete a single-item measure of pleasure and arousal which asks participants to indicate how they are feeling \u201cat this moment\u201d by placing an X in one of the boxes on the grid (Affect Grid; Russell, Weiss, &amp; Mendelsohn, 1989). Next, the research assistant will secure physiological equipment to the participant. Skin will first be prepared for single-use disposable ECG electrode placement by wiping the skin with preparation gel, which is slightly abrasive, and then electrodes are gel-ed with non-irritating, hypo-allergenic gel, and applied to the skin. Three electrodes will be placed on the skin \u2013 two on the left and right collarbone, respectively, and one on the lowest rib on the participant\u2019s left side. A respiration belt will then be placed over the participant\u2019s clothing around the abdomen/chest. Finally,  continuous non-invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) monitor equipment will be attached to the participant via the use of a finger and arm cuff. The participant will be asked to wear the ECG, respiration, and CNAP equipment for no more than 20 minutes in total. First, participants will engage in a baseline period wherein they will be instructed to sit still and relax without talking for 5 minutes. Next, participants will be shown a series of up to 10 online stimuli in the form of fabricated twitter posts on a computer screen. Participants will be randomized to see one set of 10 stimuli from one of the four stimuli conditions. Randomization to condition will be conducted by Inquisit programming such that condition will be double-blind. Before stimuli are presented, an attention-directing image will first appear on the screen. Each stimulus will be on the screen for 30 seconds (stimuli will be pre-programmed to display automatically for 30 seconds, one after the other), and the presentation of stimuli within condition will also be randomized via Inquisit programming. Finally, after participants have seen all stimuli in the set, they will engage in another period of 5 minutes (the \u201crecovery\u201d period) wherein they will be instructed to sit still and relax without talking for 5 minutes. After this period, physiological equipment will be removed. Next, participants will then be asked to fill out another paper-and-pencil packet, which includes another Affect Grid, question about emotions felt, a measure of racial centrality (sub-scale from MIBI-S), and questions about each stimuli avatar in the set (perceived race, perceived gender, perceived education, perceived attractiveness, perceived likeability) and manipulation check items (how racially motivated, positive, and negative were the stimuli as a group).

The demographic variables are age, sex assigned at birth on one\u2019s original birth certificate, current gender identity, race/ethnicity, and year in school. Social media use will be evaluated using four questions that ask how much time a participant spends on Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook, respectively, which will be measured on a 6-point scale that ranged from 1 (None) to 6 (About four hours). \n\nAnalytic evaluation of the original stimuli set will then occur in several steps. First, interrater reliability will be determined using two intraclass correlation (ICC) analyses. We will use a two-way random effects model assessing single measure consistency in quantitative ratings of three qualities of interest, positivity, negativity, and racial motivation, for each of the four stimuli conditions.  The threshold for acceptable consistency will be an ICC of at least 0.70 (Landis &amp; Koch, 1977). Our goal is to have an average ICC of at least 0.70 for each condition.\n\nIf a stimuli set has adequate ICC\u2019s for all three main qualities of  interest, meaning that the whole stimuli set was consistently rated on positivity, negativity, and racial motivation, each Tweet stimulus\u2019 will be further examined in order to determine exclusion or inclusion within the final stimuli set. Mean scores for the qualities of interest will be used as a primary step to indicate whether or not participants\u2019 perceptions of individual stimuli match the intended condition. For the race-related positive condition, the desired mean score for positivity will be at least 4 (Very Positive), at most 2 (Slightly Negative) for negativity, and at least 4 (Very Racially Motivated) for racial motivation. For the non-race-related-negative condition, the desired mean score for positivity will be at most 2 (Slightly Positive), at least 4 (Very Negative) for negativity, and at least 4 (Very Racially Motivated) for racial motivation. For the non-race-related-positive condition, the desired mean score for positivity will be at least 4 (Very Positive), at most 2 (Slightly Negative) for negativity, and at most 2 (Slightly Racially Motivated) for racial motivation. For the non-race-related-negative condition, the desired mean score for positivity will be at most 2 (Slightly Positive), at least 4 (Very Negative) for negativity, and at most 2 (Very Racially Motivated) for racial motivation. The scale cutoffs for the quality of interest mean scores were determined using Larsen et al.\u2019s (2009) description of positive and negative unipolar scale scores in their validated evaluative space grid. \n\nFor the stimuli within each condition that meet these mean requirements, there will be a final step to determine inclusion dependent upon the three qualities of interest. The qualitative responses to the questions, \u201cOf all of these tweets, which are the most negative?,\u201d \u201cWhat was most negative about it / why was it most negative?,\u201d \u201cWhich are the most positive?,\u201d \u201dWhat was most positive about it / why was it most positive?,\u201d \u201cHow racially motivated did you think these tweets were?,\u201d and \u201cHow could you tell?\u201d will be used in this step. The focus group discussion will be recorded. Participants will be instructed to speak one at a time and to state their participant ID number before responding to any question or statement posed during the discussion. During transcription of the discussions, these ID numbers will be used to differentiate participant responses. If there is at least 30% disagreement from focus group participants about an intended quality of interest, the stimulus in question will be removed from the final stimuli set. So, for example, if at least four participants across a condition\u2019s two focus groups, or approximately 30% of these focus group participants, do not believe or question whether a stimulus from the race-related-positive condition is positive, it will be removed for not adequately fitting with its condition. These steps will be taken so that we can make sure that the stimuli that are included do in fact represent the conditions for which they were designed. \n\nIf a stimuli set does not have adequate ICCs (i.e., defined as being below 0.70, for all three qualities of interest), meaning that there was not consistency in quantitative ratings of the stimuli set, the qualitative responses about these qualities will be used to determine which stimuli to remove from the set. Therefore, as stated above, if there is at least 30% disagreement or more than four participants who disagree about an intended quality of interest regarding a stimulus within one of the conditions, that stimulus will be removed from the final stimuli set. After all stimuli that do not pass through the qualitative step are removed, ICC analyses on the qualities of interest for the updated stimuli set will be run again. The stimuli sets will then go through the previously stated steps dependent upon whether their quality of interest ICCs are below or above the set threshold, 0.70.\n\nOnce consistently rated and evaluated stimuli sets are established dependent upon qualities of interest, further examination of the stimuli within each condition will occur. The following steps will be carried out concurrently. The 30% or four participant threshold for disagreement within the intended conditions written about previously will also be used in this set of steps to determine if a stimulus should be removed from its condition. In one step, responses to the following questions from the questionnaire will be examined, \u201cWhen looking at this post, do you feel any changes happening to your body? (Select one option, Yes or No)  If so, please briefly explain:\u201d and \u201cWhen looking at this post, do you feel any changes in your mood or thoughts? (Select one option, Yes or No)  If so, please briefly explain:\u201d. For the participants that select yes, their open-ended responses will be examined by the research team to determine whether the changes that they write about are incongruent with the intended condition or speak to a quality of the stimulus that would not be desirable for the final stimuli set. For example, in an examining a race-related-negative stimulus, if four participants indicate that the stimulus is funny or that it makes them want to laugh, that stimulus will be removed from the stimuli set. In another step, responses to the following questions from the discussion will be examined dependent upon whether the condition is positive or negative, \u201cOf all of these tweets, which are the most stressful?\u201d and \u201cWhat was most stressful about it / why was it stressful?.\u201d For the race-related-positive and non-race-related-positive conditions, it is preferred that they are overall not stressful for the participants. For the race-related-negative and non-race-related-negative conditions, it is preferred that they are overall stressful for the participants. In another step, responses to the following questions from the discussion will be examined to determine believability of the stimuli, \u201cDid you think these were real Twitter statuses?,\u201d \u201cWhy or why not?,\u201d \u201cIs there anything we could do to make them more believable?,\u201d and \u201cWhat things did you notice while looking at them?\u201d In this step, stimuli that are not considered to be believable will not necessarily abide by the previously stated exclusion threshold. The final decision for the stimulus in question will be determined by the research team. If there is a stimulus that does not meet the threshold for believability, but maps well onto its intended condition, the research team may decide to include it within the final stimuli set if the other quantitative and qualitative responses about stimulus quality are thought to outweigh its lack of believability. \n\nAs a final step for evaluating the stimuli for inclusion within the final stimuli set, the responses to the discussion questions, \u201cWhich one of these tweets stuck out to you the most?,\u201d and \u201cWhy did it stick out to you?\u201d will be examined. Ideally, the stimuli within the final set will not be uniquely different from others within the same condition. If they were, any responses to the condition within experimental studies may be due to the unique stimulus and not the intended qualities of the condition. The exclusion threshold will not be the basis for exclusion in this step. The research team will closely examine responses to the second question. If the responses about certain stimuli indicate a unique quality of the stimulus in question that is determined to be potentially detrimental to the quality of final stimuli set, it will be removed. \n\nOther than being used for determining whether a stimulus will be included or excluded, the qualitative responses from the questionnaire and discussion will be used to later describe the stimuli within any future publications or presentations.", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question3c": "RQ1 \u2013 Focus Group (No a priori hypotheses, exploratory): See above (statistical technique) for full details.", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question4c": "RQ1 \u2013 Focus Group (No a priori hypotheses, exploratory): No covariates will be utilized in this type of analysis.", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question5c": "RQ1 \u2013 Focus Group (No a priori hypotheses, exploratory): Criteria are described in detail in the statistical technique section.", "confirmatory-analyses-third.third.question1c": "RQ3 \u2013 Online Survey &amp; Laboratory Visit (Hypotheses 3; No a priori hypotheses; Exploratory): For RQ3a, relevant variables include period (within-person; 2 levels: baseline, stimuli-presentation) 5 outcome variables (change in HRV, SI, CI, MAP, PEP), and theoretically-based control variables of  biological sex, BMI, caffeine and/or nicotine use, medication use, physical activity, and experimenter (listed with supporting citations below).

If a modification to the study protocol needs to be made based on formal or informal feedback from participants regarding the believability of the study that we did not already anticipate, we will plan to continue data collection, draft an IRB modification, and modify our protocol accordingly, noting which participants underwent data collection with the \u201cold\u201d versus \u201cnew\u201d protocol. Given sufficient resources, this may also extend our data collection timeline and we may be able to achieve the originally proposed sample size with the \u201cnew\u201d protocol, resulting in a total increase in the number of participants from which we collected data. However, we will NOT base the decision to extend data collection based on \u201cpre-viewing\u201d the data.", "recommended-methods.procedure.question9b-file": [{"file_id": "5e37905457427b010e0c56db", "file_name": "RR- Condition.pptx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/ahb98/files/osfstorage/5e37905457427b010e0c56db", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e37905457427b010e0c56db"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "d4be10abfde5ad0a0af1784c9407d536e1fe66dfa4ca61fcb18489f0660d688c"}}, {"file_id": "5e37905457427b010e0c56d9", "file_name": "NR- Condition.pptx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/ahb98/files/osfstorage/5e37905457427b010e0c56d9", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e37905457427b010e0c56d9"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "ae9c00a8edb52784167774a04faa8efdc234b57d701aca1f02b85852d1e1c8b8"}}, {"file_id": "5e37905457427b010e0c56d7", "file_name": "RR+ Condition.pptx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/ahb98/files/osfstorage/5e37905457427b010e0c56d7", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e37905457427b010e0c56d7"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "6e219cd6a3e6b60a34967c966860f412d491f6e375152c9d859e712561399c27"}}, {"file_id": "5e37905457427b010e0c56d5", "file_name": "NR+ Condition.pptx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/ahb98/files/osfstorage/5e37905457427b010e0c56d5", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e37905457427b010e0c56d5"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "020bb849f1baf172a055a2e2cbdbc698a14bff08815482bd71de6778970e907b"}}], "confirmatory-analyses-fourth.fourth.question1c": "", "confirmatory-analyses-fourth.fourth.question2c": "", "confirmatory-analyses-fourth.fourth.question3c": "", "confirmatory-analyses-fourth.fourth.question4c": "", "confirmatory-analyses-fourth.fourth.question5c": "", "confirmatory-analyses-second.second.question1c": "RQ2 \u2013 Online Survey &amp; Laboratory Visit (Hypothesis 2): Relevant variables include: condition (randomized; double-blind; 3 levels: negative-race-related, negative-non-race-related, and positive-non-race-related), 7 outcome variables (change in HRV, SI, CI, MAP, PEP, emotion \u2013 arousal, emotion - pleasure) and theoretically-based control variables of  biological sex, BMI, caffeine and/or nicotine use, medication use, physical activity, and experimenter (listed with supporting citations below).

Specific items/questions that are missing will not have values within the dataset, however participants may or may not be necessarily removed if they do not complete all questions because participants have the right to refuse to answer specific questions (with the exception of the eligibility questions). More specifically, entire participants and their subsequent scores will be removed in full from the data if the only questions that participants complete are the demographic and/or eligibility questions. In the lab visit, if experimenter and/or equipment failures occur, or if the participant chooses to discontinue participation such that continuous physiological data is not captured for all three of the measurement periods in full (baseline, stimuli presentation, and recovery), data for physiological measurements (MAP, PEP, SI, CI, HRV) will be examined with missing data analysis to determine what avenue is appropriate for the type of missing data present (i.e., MNAR, MAR, MCAR). In online survey and paper-and-pencil surveys in the lab visit, data will be examined with missing data analysis to determine what avenue is appropriate for the type of missing data present (i.e., MNAR, MAR, MCAR). \n\nb. In the online survey, failed attention checks on greater than or equal to 5% of scales with attention checks included will merit exclusion of all of the data for the online survey from that participant. In the instance of failed attention checks on less than 5% and greater than 0% of scales with attention checks included, scale scores itself for that scale will be removed. During the laboratory visit, if a participant indicates anything indicative of suspicion of the study hypotheses or their desire to provide socially desirable responses their entire laboratory visit data will be removed.\n\nc. In terms of anticipated specific data exclusion criteria due to demographic exclusions, there are none beyond pre-specified inclusion/exclusion criteria described under \u201cpre-selection rules\u201d. Participants who do not meet these inclusion/exclusion criteria will receive a message that they are ineligibile to participate in the study via the online survey or focus-group online prescreening eligibility questionnaire. Information beyond answers to these eligibility questions will not be collected from participants and therefore they will not have data on key variables to exclude from analyses. Their responses to eligibility questions will not count toward the sample size. \n\nd. Outliers will be examined and removed based on established criteria: namely, by examining absolute values of studentized residuals for observations that exceed 3 (for which we can determine if the data point is influential by comparing the studentized residual to a t distribution with n-k-2 degrees of freedom where n = sample size and k = number of predictors), undue leverage of specific observations on the entire model via Cook\u2019s D values that are greater than (4 / n-k-1) as indicated by Chatterjee &amp; Hadi (1988), undue influence as indicated by Belsley, Kuh, &amp; Welsch (1980) of specific observations on specific coefficient estimates via examination of absolute values of dffits values greater than (2*sqrt(Number of predictors \u2013 1) / sample size), and of specific observations on the specific coefficient estimates via examination of dfbetas values greater than (2/square root(sample size)). We will take these measures for identifying outliers together to inform which outliers should be removed. More specifically, if an outlier is identified as such by Cook\u2019s D, dffits, and dfbetas (all three) it will be removed. If an outlier is identified by studentized residuals and Cook\u2019s D but does not appear to have much influence on the model via dffits and dfbetas, it will not be removed. In the event that an outlier violates one or more of these cutoffs, but does not violate Cook\u2019s D, dffits, and dfbetas together, it will be retained but flagged for follow-up sensitivity analyses.\n\ne.

In that study, we presented 53 extra-dyadic behaviours to participants and asked them to:\n\n\u00b7\tIndicate whether they would consider the behaviour to be unfaithful or cheating if an individual in a serious committed dating relationship engaged in these behaviours with a person of the opposite sex.\n\u00b7\tRate the severity for each of the behaviors assuming a partner in a serious, committed dating relationship engaged in these behaviors with an opposite sex partner.\n\u00b7\tIndicate whether they would consider the behaviour to be unfaithful or cheating if an individual in a serious committed dating relationship engaged in these behaviours with a person of the same sex.\n\u00b7\tRate each behavior for severity if a partner in a serious, committed dating relationship engaged in these behaviors with a same sex partner.\n\u00b7\tCheck any of the behaviors they have engaged in with someone other than their partner while in a serious committed relationship (either a prior relationship or their current relationship).\n\u00b7\tCheck any of the behaviors that a partner in a serious, committed relationship with them has engaged in with someone else (either in a prior relationship or their current relationship).\nOne major goal of the current study is to investigate how much people\u2019s answers to these questions have changed after 10 years. The main reason we expect we might see changes in how people perceive extra-dyadic behaviours (i.e., how severe they perceive them) and how much they engage in the behaviours is related to changes in technology. Increasing use of smartphones in the past decade, the prevalence of dating applications and websites such as Tinder, and new ways of sending text messages such as direct messaging on social media or messaging applications might have influenced how people perceive and engage in extra-dyadic behaviours (e.g. by providing new media or platforms with which to engage in infidelity). \n\nFor the same reason, we included more online and technology-related items (i.e., behaviours) in our follow up study to make our list of possible extradyadic behaviours more comprehensive. To decide which items from the list of 53 behaviours to keep and which to discard for the follow-up, we presented the 53 behaviours to participants in a study in 2019 and asked them to make the same judgements as participants did in the 2009 study. Based on the results of this study, we dropped the behaviours that fewer than 10 percent of participants in the 2019 study identified as infidelity and replaced them with (a) new online and technology-related behaviours and (b) several behaviours that other researchers identified in their studies during the ten years since our 2009 study (i.e., those not included in our previous list). Combined, this process resulted in an updated list including 64 extradyadic behaviours that we will use in the current follow up study. \n\nIn the 2019 study, we also asked participants to sort the 53 behaviours into categories (via a card sort task). We will use the results of a cluster analysis performed on these data to categorize the behaviours in the present study so that we can run our analyses on the infidelity categories instead of each behaviour separately (thereby reducing the number of statistical tests we will need to perform). The four categories that emerged from the card sort task are (1) sexual behaviours, (2) emotional behaviours, (3) ambiguous behaviours (such as doing a favour for someone or spending time with them) , and (4) others (we haven\u2019t found a label that captures the range of items in this category so we might change the name of the category if we find a suitable name). The behaviours in the follow up study will be classified into the same categories plus an additional category for online behaviours. However, we might change the categories if the results of reliability tests show that the items in the same category are not coherent. \n\nIn the follow up study (the current research), we will present the list of 64 extra-dyadic behaviours to our participants and ask them to make the same judgements as participants in the 2009 study did. Our hypotheses and research questions are presented below. For each hypothesis or set of related hypotheses a rationale that supports anticipated direction is presented. Also, in the following sections, participants\u2019 own engagement in extradyadic behaviours will be referred to as \u201cinfidelity incidence\u201d ,their ratings of perceived severity of the extradaydic behaviours will be referred to as \u201cseverity ratings\u201d, and their partners\u2019 engagement in extradyadic behaviours will be called \u201cpartner\u2019s engagement in extradyadic behaviours.\u201d\n\nResearch question 1) Will severity ratings for the various types of infidelity in the current study differ from severity ratings in the study in 2009? We will examine the difference across timepoints for the sample as a whole, as well as incorporating gender of participant and gender of extradyadic partner into the analysis.\n\nResearch question 2) Will the reported incidence of different types of infidelity reported in the current study differ from the reported incidence of infidelity in 2009? We will examine the difference across timepoints for the sample as a whole, as well as incorporating gender of participant into the analysis.\n\nResearch question 3) Will partner engagement in different types of infidelity reported in the current study differ from reported partner engagement in infidelity in 2009? We will examine the difference across timepoints for the sample as a whole, as well as incorporating gender of participant into the analysis.\n\n\nResearch question 4) Do 2020 participants differ from 2009 participants in their mean score on sociosexuality? We will examine the difference across timepoints for the sample as a whole, as well as incorporating gender of participant into the analysis.\n\n\nHypothesis 1) Controlling for possible gender differences, higher severity ratings will be associated with: 1) higher attachment anxiety, 2) higher honesty-humility (HH), 3) higher jealousy, 4) lower attachment avoidance, 5) lower infidelity incidence, 6) more restricted sociosexual orientation. \n\nHypothesis 2) Controlling for possible gender differences, higher infidelity incidence will be associated with: 1) higher attachment anxiety, 2) higher attachment avoidance, 3) more unrestricted sociosexual orientation, 4) higher quality of alternatives, 5) lower HH, 6) lower commitment, 7) lower relationship satisfaction, 8) lower investment size.\n\nRationale for hypotheses 1 and 2:\n\nWith regards to honesty humility, results of a study by Bourdage, Lee, Ashton, and Perry (2007) show that higher honesty-humility is positively correlated with relationship exclusivity. Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that since people with high honesty humility value relationship exclusivity, they will tend to rate infidelity behaviours more severe and engage in infidelity behaviours less often than people who are low in honesty humility. \n\nResearch shows that attachment insecurity can be a predictor of engaging in infidelity, and therefore we hypothesized that higher attachment insecurity (both anxious and avoidant) is associated with higher infidelity incidence. However, the predicted association between attachment insecurity and severity ratings differs based on the type of attachment insecurity. This anticipated difference is related to perceived levels of threat in anxious vs avoidant individuals.  Anxious individuals are prone to overestimate threats to their romantic relationship (Collins, 1996) and they experience more jealousy in comparison to less anxious individuals (Buunk, 1997; Guerrero, 1998; Radecki-Bush, Farrell, and Bush, 1993; Sharpsteen and Kirkpatrick, 1997). Therefore, we expected higher severity ratings for anxious participants. \nIn contrast, avoidant individuals show low levels of concern about the threat of a rival (Guerrero, 1998; Sharpsteen and Kirkpatrick, 1997). In current study, we expect that highly avoidant individuals will perceive lower levels of threat when evaluating extradyadic behaviours and therefore, they will score low on severity ratings. \n\nIn addition, research shows that people with unrestricted sociosexual orientation tend to perceive extradyadic behaviours as less indicative of infidelity in comparison to people with more restricted sociosexual orientation (Mattingly, Wilson, Clark, Bequette, &amp; Weidler, 2010) which is consistent with our anticipated direction of the relationship between severity ratings and sociosexual orientation. Unrestricted sociosexual orientation is also a facilitator of engaging in infidelity (Fincham and May, 2016. Therefore, we anticipated that participants with unrestricted sociosexual orientation would report higher rates of infidelity incidence.\n\nWe also hypothesized that a high level of jealousy might lead people to perceive extradyadic behaviours as more threatening and, therefore, that we will find an association between increasing jealousy and higher scores on severity ratings.\n\nOur hypotheses regarding the Investment Model variables are based on previous research indicating that people with lower relationship commitment, lower relationship satisfaction, lower investment size, and higher quality of alternatives tend to consider extradyadic behaviours as infidelity to a lower degree (Mattingly, Wilson, Clark, Bequette, &amp; Weidler, 2010) and to report higher rates of engaging in infidelity (Drigotas, Safstrom, &amp; Gentilia, 1999; Fincham and May, 2016).. \n\nFinally, previous infidelity experience predicts future engagement in infidelity (Fincham and May, 2016). Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that people who have engaged in extradyadic behaviours will evaluate them as less severe than people who have not engaged in such behaviours and that might partially explain why they tend to engage in the infidelity more often in the future. \n\nResearch question 4) Does the use of monogamy maintenance strategies predict infidelity incidence and if so, is this relationship mediated by any of the investment model variables and does it hold equally for both genders?\n\n\nHypothesis 3) men will perceive sexual infidelity as less severe when their partner engages in it with a same- rather than opposite-sex extra-dyadic partner.\n\nHypothesis 4) Women\u2019s ratings of the perceived severity of sexual infidelity will not vary as a function of the gender of the extra-dyadic partner.\n\nWe hypothesized that male participants would judge sexual extra-dyadic behaviours less severe if their partner engaged in these behaviours with a same- rather than opposite-sex partner because women\u2019s same-sex sexual contact poses no threat to paternity certainty and is portrayed in pornography as sexually arousing for men. We predicted that gender of the extra-dyadic partner would not influence perceived severity of infidelity behaviours among women since the threat that the partner might divert resources to another may be equally high regardless of the gender of the EDP.\n\nHypothesis 5) in both studies (2009 and 2020) men will report higher rates of engaging in infidelity than women. \n\nSeveral studies show that men report higher rates of infidelity than women   (e.g., Atkins et al., 2001; Buunk &amp; Bakker, 1995; Choi et al., 1994; Treas &amp; Giesen, 2000; for a meta-analysis, see Petersen &amp; Hyde, 2010).\n\n\nHypothesis 6) The relationship between sociosexual orientation and infidelity incidence will be moderated by HH, such that those with unrestricted sociosexual orientation who are also low in HH will be more likely to report having engaged in extradyadic behaviours than people who score high on both variables. We will include gender of participant in this analysis. \n\nResearch shows that an unrestricted attitude toward sex is one of the predictors of infidelity incidence (Fincham and May, 2016). Research also indicates that higher HH scores are associated with higher relationship exclusivity (Bourdage et al., 2007). Therefore, people who are unrestricted in their sociosexual orientation might engage in extradyadic behaviours less if they score high on HH (in comparison those who are sociosexually unrestricted and low on honesty humility). \n\nResearch indicates that higher HH scores are associated with higher relationship exclusivity (Bourdage et al., 2007), so we are predicting that high HH might serve to inhibit, to some extent, those with an unrestricted sociosexual orientation from engaging in infidelity compared with those who are both unrestricted and low in HH (and therefore not much inclined to worry about  relationship exclusivity).\n\nResearch question 5) Are reports of a partner\u2019s engagement in extradyadic behaviours associated with 1) severity ratings, 2) relationship satisfaction, 4) jealousy, 5) investment size, 6) relationship commitment, and 7) quality of alternatives?\n\nResearch question 6) We will explore possible associations between a) jealousy and infidelity incidence, b) the investment model variables (commitment, investment size, quality of alternatives, relationship satisfaction) and severity ratings, e) infidelity incidence (i.e., participants\u2019 own reports of having engaged in extradyadic behaviours) and (their reports of) partner\u2019s engagement in extradyadic behaviours.\n\n"}, "study_type": {"extra": [], "value": "Survey"}, "study_type_other": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"data": "It's complicated.

Therefore, people who are unrestricted in their sociosexual orientation might engage in extradyadic behaviours less if they score high on HH (in comparison those who are sociosexually unrestricted and low on honesty humility). \n\nResearch indicates that higher HH scores are associated with higher relationship exclusivity (Bourdage et al., 2007), so we are predicting that high HH might serve to inhibit, to some extent, those with an unrestricted sociosexual orientation from engaging in infidelity compared with those who are both unrestricted and low in HH (and therefore not much inclined to worry about  relationship exclusivity).\n\nResearch question 5) Are reports of a partner\u2019s engagement in extradyadic behaviours associated with 1) severity ratings, 2) relationship satisfaction, 4) jealousy, 5) investment size, 6) relationship commitment, and 7) quality of alternatives?\n\nResearch question 6) We will explore possible associations between a) jealousy and infidelity incidence, b) the investment model variables (commitment, investment size, quality of alternatives, relationship satisfaction) and severity ratings, e) infidelity incidence (i.e., participants\u2019 own reports of having engaged in extradyadic behaviours) and (their reports of) partner\u2019s engagement in extradyadic behaviours.\n\n", "study_type": "Survey"}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children":
