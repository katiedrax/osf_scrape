It has been widely acknowledged the importance of exploring what this invisible work is, to fully appreciate the role of the district nurse (4-7). However this gap in knowledge is yet to be addressed.\n\nIn the absence of a prior systematic literature review or scoping review, the use of a scoping review methodology will provide the ideal opportunity to systematically approach reviewing all types of literature from a vast and complex base, synthesize this literature and provide a map of key concepts underpinning the nature of the phenomenon on the invisible work of district nurses (8-12).

With scoping reviews being a new and emerging methodology, these reviews have varied enormously in procedural and methodological rigour. In order to strengthen the rigour for this method Arskey and O\u2019Malley (10) developed a framework for conducting scoping reviews and welcomed other researchers to advance this framework. Levac, Colquhoun and O\u2019Brien (24) provided an extension to the framework and finally in 2015 the JBI furthered this framework and developed guidance on conducted a scoping review (13).  The JBI guidance on conducting a scoping review will guide this review (13). Illustrated below is how this prospective protocol maps to the JBI methodology:\n\n\uf0a7\tStep 1 \u2013 Defining and aligning the objective/s and question/s for the scoping review (see above Description).\n\uf0a7\tStep 2 \u2013 Developing and aligning the inclusion criteria with the objective/s and question/s (see below Data Collection Procedures (inclusion criteria) and see below Data Exclusion (exclusion criteria)).\n\uf0a7\tStep 3 \u2013 Describing the planned approach to evidence searching, selection, extraction, and charting (see below Data Collection Procedures).\n\uf0a7\tStep 4 \u2013 Searching for the evidence (see below Data Collection Procedures).\n\uf0a7\tStep 5 \u2013 Selecting the evidence (see below Data Collection Procedures).\n\uf0a7\tStep 6 \u2013 Extracting the evidence (see below Measured Variables for data charting process).\n\uf0a7\tStep 7 \u2013 Charting the evidence (see below Exploratory Analysis).\n\uf0a7\tStep 8 \u2013 Summarizing the evidence in relation to the objective/s and question/s (see below Exploratory Analysis).\n\uf0a7\tStep 9 \u2013 Consultation of information scientists, librarians, and/or experts (throughout)(see below Missing Data).\n\nAdditionally, to increase transparency of the scoping review a reporting checklist will be used, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRIMSA-ScR), that is consistent with the JBI guidance (12, 14). Application of JBI guidance and PRISMA-ScR to this scoping review will ensure the review is transparent, rigorous and reliable (12). While subjectivity cannot be totally eliminated, providing this detailed prospective protocol has aimed to increase the transparency on the systematic approach applied to the scoping review. \n\nThe scoping review will identify all sources of information that would address the scoping review question, including; primary research, systematic reviews, meta-analysis, guidelines, government policy and documents, websites and textbooks. Consistent with the JBI guidance a standard data extraction instrument will be used, described below, and there will be no critical appraisal or methodological assessment conducted, because the aim is to map all literature relevant to the scoping review question and not the best research evidence (10, 13, 15). If limits were applied based on quality of evidence it would affect the overall accuracy of the scoping review and would fail to provide a broad map highlighting gaps in knowledge. \n\nDue to the iterative nature of scoping reviews, search terms will be continuously developed. An initial search using AMED, CINAHL and Medline will be conducted, prior to finalising the prospective protocol, and initial returned results will be reviewed (title, abstract and keywords) until initial search terms are developed. It is anticipated additional search terms may be identified during the data charting process and if this is the case will be transparently reported in the final scoping review.  \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "OSF Scoping Review Protocol.docx"}, "nodeId": "yja6p", "sha256": "9b2baef18ae7342f188efa1a615e9836675a345bba17b1d624409254dd76e54d", "viewUrl": "/project/dgz3y/files/osfstorage/5e3bd9c6032a4d00c0e6e61a/", "selectedFileName": "OSF Scoping Review Protocol.docx"}], "value": ""}}}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": "Not applicable "}, "q10": {"extra": [], "value": "Registration prior to accessing the data"}, "q11": {"extra": [], "value": "Not applicable "}, "q12": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "As part of the data collection procedure (inclusion criteria) to identify all potentially relevant literature a comprehensive search strategy to identify both published and unpublished grey literature was prospectively developed as part of the scoping review protocol. This has seen a comprehensive four stage strategy being developed including; bibliographic database searching, ancestry search method, descendancy searching method and searching the grey literature (16). \n\nThe first strategy will involve a search of the bibliographic databases, using the search terms developed as part of the initial searches. This will include the following bibliographic databases; CINAHL, ASSIA, Cochrane Library, Medline, PubMed and Google Scholar. Once the searches are performed, returned results will be exported to EndNote X9.2 reference management software, to manage the searches and identify and remove duplicates (10). The search terms will also be saved as alerts on the bibliographic databases so any new publications, published during the scoping review will be identified and considered for inclusion in the scoping review. Literature published in English will be considered for inclusion in the scoping review. Initially, literature published from 1990 to 2019 will be considered for inclusion. This date range was set as literature pre Community Care Act 1990 (25) is less likely to be relevant as the work of district nursing teams changed significantly at this time, although this change will be acknowledged in the review. The date range may be broadened following an iterative approach discussed below. \n\nThe following are the initial search terms applied; district nurse, community nurse, community matron, health visitor, homecare nurse, community midwife, nurse, safe staffing, caseload profiling, caseload management, caseload analysis, workload analysis, workload tools, workload measurement tool, workforce planning, workforce measures, workload planning, community profiling, measure, community, primary care, district, home setting. Combinations of these search terms will be applied using Boolean operators, with search terms truncated for variation in spelling (for example: nurs*) and synonyms applied (18). At the onset, the search will be extended to include other community nursing professionals, for example health visitors, to scope if there is any transferable knowledge to the district nursing profession. \n\nThe second strategy that will be applied to the search will involve hand-checking reference lists contained in returned results (ancestry method)(10, 15, 16). Additionally, the descendancy method will be applied, to determine additional seminal or pivotal sources to the review question. This will be achieved by searching forward to citation indexes of articles that have cited key seminal pieces (16).\n\nThe final strategy that will be applied to the search will be to locate unpublished grey literature, from professional bodies, expert opinion and government policies and publications. While these sources are more subjective and lower in quality, their inclusion may provide useful insights that would otherwise be missed with their exclusion (13). The search of the grey literature will be conducted via government and relevant professional bodies\u2019 websites. Below is a list of the organisations to be included in the search for grey literature:\n\n\uf0a7\tAudit Scotland\n\uf0a7\tDepartment of Health (including NHS Improvement and NHS England)\n\uf0a7\tInformation Services Division \n\uf0a7\tKings Fund \n\uf0a7\tNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence \n\uf0a7\tNorthern Ireland Department of Health \n\uf0a7\tNursing and Midwifery Council\n\uf0a7\tQueens Nursing Institute \n\uf0a7\tQueens Nursing Institute Scotland \n\uf0a7\tRoyal College of Nursing \n\uf0a7\tScottish Government (including NHS Education for Scotland) \n\uf0a7\tUK Parliament\n\uf0a7\tWelsh Government (including Welsh Audit Office and National Assembly for Wales)\n\uf0a7\tWorld Health Organisation \n\nAdditionally, professional district nursing textbooks will also be considered as part of the search of the grey literature (16). To locate these textbooks a search of Google Scholar, the library catalogue at Edinburgh Napier University and the British Library catalogue (UK copyright library) will be conducted to identify texts relevant to the review question. \n\nThe search strategy detailed above as part of data collection, was checked by an experienced subject librarian, at Edinburgh Napier University, to ensure it was comprehensive in breadth prior to the scoping review protocol being registered.\n\nFollowing the search, described above, all identified citations will be uploaded to EndNote X9.2 reference management software. Titles, abstracts (or executive summaries in the grey literature) will be reviewed, and literature that meets the inclusion criteria will be retrieved in full and details recorded using the predefined Data Extraction Instrument, described below. If studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria are identified, they will be excluded, and in line with JBI guidance, the reason for exclusion will be provided in the final review (13). \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "The sample/number of included studies to be included in this scoping review is unknown.

This strategy will be applied to ensure all results following data extraction are considered, not missed, and aid identification of key themes, to support the reporting of a heterogeneous literature base (22). ", "q25": "It would be important to acknowledge while in a systematic literature review deviation from a protocol is rare, due to the iterative nature of a scoping review modifications are possible, and likely, for example extending the search terms, described above, although if changes are required to this protocol this will be transparently reported in the final scoping review (9, 13, 15).\n\nReferences (used to support development of this scoping review protocol). \n\n1.\tLeary A, Punshon G.

With scoping reviews being a new and emerging methodology, these reviews have varied enormously in procedural and methodological rigour. In order to strengthen the rigour for this method Arskey and O\u2019Malley (10) developed a framework for conducting scoping reviews and welcomed other researchers to advance this framework. Levac, Colquhoun and O\u2019Brien (24) provided an extension to the framework and finally in 2015 the JBI furthered this framework and developed guidance on conducted a scoping review (13).  The JBI guidance on conducting a scoping review will guide this review (13). Illustrated below is how this prospective protocol maps to the JBI methodology:\n\n\uf0a7\tStep 1 \u2013 Defining and aligning the objective/s and question/s for the scoping review (see above Description).\n\uf0a7\tStep 2 \u2013 Developing and aligning the inclusion criteria with the objective/s and question/s (see below Data Collection Procedures (inclusion criteria) and see below Data Exclusion (exclusion criteria)).\n\uf0a7\tStep 3 \u2013 Describing the planned approach to evidence searching, selection, extraction, and charting (see below Data Collection Procedures).\n\uf0a7\tStep 4 \u2013 Searching for the evidence (see below Data Collection Procedures).\n\uf0a7\tStep 5 \u2013 Selecting the evidence (see below Data Collection Procedures).\n\uf0a7\tStep 6 \u2013 Extracting the evidence (see below Measured Variables for data charting process).\n\uf0a7\tStep 7 \u2013 Charting the evidence (see below Exploratory Analysis).\n\uf0a7\tStep 8 \u2013 Summarizing the evidence in relation to the objective/s and question/s (see below Exploratory Analysis).\n\uf0a7\tStep 9 \u2013 Consultation of information scientists, librarians, and/or experts (throughout)(see below Missing Data).\n\nAdditionally, to increase transparency of the scoping review a reporting checklist will be used, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRIMSA-ScR), that is consistent with the JBI guidance (12, 14). Application of JBI guidance and PRISMA-ScR to this scoping review will ensure the review is transparent, rigorous and reliable (12). While subjectivity cannot be totally eliminated, providing this detailed prospective protocol has aimed to increase the transparency on the systematic approach applied to the scoping review. \n\nThe scoping review will identify all sources of information that would address the scoping review question, including; primary research, systematic reviews, meta-analysis, guidelines, government policy and documents, websites and textbooks. Consistent with the JBI guidance a standard data extraction instrument will be used, described below, and there will be no critical appraisal or methodological assessment conducted, because the aim is to map all literature relevant to the scoping review question and not the best research evidence (10, 13, 15). If limits were applied based on quality of evidence it would affect the overall accuracy of the scoping review and would fail to provide a broad map highlighting gaps in knowledge. \n\nDue to the iterative nature of scoping reviews, search terms will be continuously developed. An initial search using AMED, CINAHL and Medline will be conducted, prior to finalising the prospective protocol, and initial returned results will be reviewed (title, abstract and keywords) until initial search terms are developed. It is anticipated additional search terms may be identified during the data charting process and if this is the case will be transparently reported in the final scoping review.  \n", "q8.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e3bd9c6032a4d00c0e6e61a", "file_name": "OSF Scoping Review Protocol.docx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/dgz3y/files/osfstorage/5e3bd9c6032a4d00c0e6e61a", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e3bd9c6032a4d00c0e6e61a"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "9b2baef18ae7342f188efa1a615e9836675a345bba17b1d624409254dd76e54d"}}], "q12.question": "As part of the data collection procedure (inclusion criteria) to identify all potentially relevant literature a comprehensive search strategy to identify both published and unpublished grey literature was prospectively developed as part of the scoping review protocol. This has seen a comprehensive four stage strategy being developed including; bibliographic database searching, ancestry search method, descendancy searching method and searching the grey literature (16). \n\nThe first strategy will involve a search of the bibliographic databases, using the search terms developed as part of the initial searches. This will include the following bibliographic databases; CINAHL, ASSIA, Cochrane Library, Medline, PubMed and Google Scholar. Once the searches are performed, returned results will be exported to EndNote X9.2 reference management software, to manage the searches and identify and remove duplicates (10). The search terms will also be saved as alerts on the bibliographic databases so any new publications, published during the scoping review will be identified and considered for inclusion in the scoping review. Literature published in English will be considered for inclusion in the scoping review. Initially, literature published from 1990 to 2019 will be considered for inclusion. This date range was set as literature pre Community Care Act 1990 (25) is less likely to be relevant as the work of district nursing teams changed significantly at this time, although this change will be acknowledged in the review. The date range may be broadened following an iterative approach discussed below. \n\nThe following are the initial search terms applied; district nurse, community nurse, community matron, health visitor, homecare nurse, community midwife, nurse, safe staffing, caseload profiling, caseload management, caseload analysis, workload analysis, workload tools, workload measurement tool, workforce planning, workforce measures, workload planning, community profiling, measure, community, primary care, district, home setting. Combinations of these search terms will be applied using Boolean operators, with search terms truncated for variation in spelling (for example: nurs*) and synonyms applied (18). At the onset, the search will be extended to include other community nursing professionals, for example health visitors, to scope if there is any transferable knowledge to the district nursing profession. \n\nThe second strategy that will be applied to the search will involve hand-checking reference lists contained in returned results (ancestry method)(10, 15, 16). Additionally, the descendancy method will be applied, to determine additional seminal or pivotal sources to the review question. This will be achieved by searching forward to citation indexes of articles that have cited key seminal pieces (16).\n\nThe final strategy that will be applied to the search will be to locate unpublished grey literature, from professional bodies, expert opinion and government policies and publications. While these sources are more subjective and lower in quality, their inclusion may provide useful insights that would otherwise be missed with their exclusion (13). The search of the grey literature will be conducted via government and relevant professional bodies\u2019 websites. Below is a list of the organisations to be included in the search for grey literature:\n\n\uf0a7\tAudit Scotland\n\uf0a7\tDepartment of Health (including NHS Improvement and NHS England)\n\uf0a7\tInformation Services Division \n\uf0a7\tKings Fund \n\uf0a7\tNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence \n\uf0a7\tNorthern Ireland Department of Health \n\uf0a7\tNursing and Midwifery Council\n\uf0a7\tQueens Nursing Institute \n\uf0a7\tQueens Nursing Institute Scotland \n\uf0a7\tRoyal College of Nursing \n\uf0a7\tScottish Government (including NHS Education for Scotland) \n\uf0a7\tUK Parliament\n\uf0a7\tWelsh Government (including Welsh Audit Office and National Assembly for Wales)\n\uf0a7\tWorld Health Organisation \n\nAdditionally, professional district nursing textbooks will also be considered as part of the search of the grey literature (16). To locate these textbooks a search of Google Scholar, the library catalogue at Edinburgh Napier University and the British Library catalogue (UK copyright library) will be conducted to identify texts relevant to the review question. \n\nThe search strategy detailed above as part of data collection, was checked by an experienced subject librarian, at Edinburgh Napier University, to ensure it was comprehensive in breadth prior to the scoping review protocol being registered.\n\nFollowing the search, described above, all identified citations will be uploaded to EndNote X9.2 reference management software. Titles, abstracts (or executive summaries in the grey literature) will be reviewed, and literature that meets the inclusion criteria will be retrieved in full and details recorded using the predefined Data Extraction Instrument, described below. If studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria are identified, they will be excluded, and in line with JBI guidance, the reason for exclusion will be provided in the final review (13). \n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "Not applicable ", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "As part of the data charting process (also referred to as charting the data) a data extraction form has been jointly developed as part of this protocol, using the instrument developed as part of the JBI guidance and modified to fit the nature of this review, which includes all types of literature (13).

To influence states\u2019 treatment of their citizens, other states and international organizations deploy a broad array of tools, including moral suasion and material assistance (or more commonly the threat of its withdrawal). Although the efficacy of foreign pressure is posited to depend on how publics in target states respond, research on the consequences of these instruments has focused mainly on their impact on target states\u2019 behavior (e.g., Galtung 1967; Keck and Sikkink 1999; Peksen 2009). Consequently, evidence on the effect of foreign pressure on public opinion in target states is limited. The purpose of this project is to examine how two common tools of external influence\u2014public condemnation and economic sanctions\u2014affect domestic public opinion in states engaged on issues of concern to the international community. The literature provides competing arguments regarding the direction of these effects. On the one hand, foreign pressure is posited to provide citizens in target states with information and/or incentives that lead them to call for policy changes in line with the preferences of external actors (rationalist perspective). On the other hand, foreign pressure may be viewed by the domestic population in target states as threats to their national identity and sovereignty, inducing them to increase support for their governments\u2019 policies and practices, an outcome referred to as the \u201crally-around-the-flag\u201d or \u201cbacklash\u201d effect. In this project, we focus on both forms of external pressure to understand not only how each instrument affects public opinion in target states but also to determine whether they have complementary or countervailing effects.

This positive effect, however, is attenuated among respondents informed of both criticism and the threat of aid sanctions, suggesting that criticism alone provokes threats to national identity and sovereignty, while the threat of aid sanctions generates concern over material interests.

To influence states\u2019 treatment of their citizens, other states and international organizations deploy a broad array of tools, including moral suasion and material assistance (or more commonly the threat of its withdrawal). Although the efficacy of foreign pressure is posited to depend on how publics in target states respond, research on the consequences of these instruments has focused mainly on their impact on target states\u2019 behavior (e.g., Galtung 1967; Keck and Sikkink 1999; Peksen 2009). Consequently, evidence on the effect of foreign pressure on public opinion in target states is limited. The purpose of this project is to examine how two common tools of external influence\u2014public condemnation and economic sanctions\u2014affect domestic public opinion in states engaged on issues of concern to the international community. The literature provides competing arguments regarding the direction of these effects. On the one hand, foreign pressure is posited to provide citizens in target states with information and/or incentives that lead them to call for policy changes in line with the preferences of external actors (rationalist perspective). On the other hand, foreign pressure may be viewed by the domestic population in target states as threats to their national identity and sovereignty, inducing them to increase support for their governments\u2019 policies and practices, an outcome referred to as the \u201crally-around-the-flag\u201d or \u201cbacklash\u201d effect. In this project, we focus on both forms of external pressure to understand not only how each instrument affects public opinion in target states but also to determine whether they have complementary or countervailing effects. We believe the arguments presented in the literature should apply to a relatively wide range of issues over which the international community might seek to exert influence and should generalize to a wide variety of political-economic contexts.

With Zomba, Malawi, we assess information-based strategies for improving the tax-and-service relationship between people and their government as a part of the EGAP Metaketa II series of projects. Fees and charges for city services are the main form of municipal revenue generation in Zomba. The City of Zomba requires that every homeowner pays a \u201ccity rate\u201d (the equivalent of a property tax) to finance waste collection, street lighting, road maintenance, and other city services. Many households in the city, however, do not pay these city rates despite their desire for these municipal services. That lack of payment, along with a lack of capacity from the city, has resulted in certain wards of the city not receiving city services, which in turn has had effects on the public health and quality of life for the thousands of people living in those places. We have designed an information shock that aims to break the vicious cycle created by the lack of service provision and the lack of city rates payment. We expect a break in this cycle will produce a virtuous cycle that encourages more citizens to pay city rates and increases service provision by the city. Formalization of the relationship between the city government and its citizens should also increase citizens' trust and confidence in the city government, and perhaps government in general --- and trust and confidence, in turn, should enhance the ability of the government to serve the public."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H0: The treatment will increase information about city rates among treatment households vs. control households.

With Zomba, Malawi, we assess information-based strategies for improving the tax-and-service relationship between people and their government as a part of the EGAP Metaketa II series of projects. Fees and charges for city services are the main form of municipal revenue generation in Zomba. The City of Zomba requires that every homeowner pays a \u201ccity rate\u201d (the equivalent of a property tax) to finance waste collection, street lighting, road maintenance, and other city services. Many households in the city, however, do not pay these city rates despite their desire for these municipal services. That lack of payment, along with a lack of capacity from the city, has resulted in certain wards of the city not receiving city services, which in turn has had effects on the public health and quality of life for the thousands of people living in those places. We have designed an information shock that aims to break the vicious cycle created by the lack of service provision and the lack of city rates payment. We expect a break in this cycle will produce a virtuous cycle that encourages more citizens to pay city rates and increases service provision by the city. Formalization of the relationship between the city government and its citizens should also increase citizens' trust and confidence in the city government, and perhaps government in general --- and trust and confidence, in turn, should enhance the ability of the government to serve the public.", "q16": "H0: The treatment will increase information about city rates among treatment households vs. control households.

We would like to explore which issues may be driving the overall attitudinal changes with the following exploratory hypotheses: H5A: The treatment will increase beliefs that the city deserves to collect taxes among treatment households vs. control households.

(Exploratory hypothesis) H7: The treatment will improve citizen's tax morale more generally and increases willingness to pay taxes not directly involved with the formalization process. (Exploratory hypothesis) Each of these hypotheses concerns the effect of the intervention bundle on treatment households.

In our study, we listed ~2300 homeowners and selected about 78% of each neighborhood.

Donors have promoted the distribution of aid directly to NGOs and service providers as a means of ensuring that aid reaches the needy in contexts where local government capacity is low. But what does this process signal to citizens about the quality of their local government? And do citizens believe that such bypass aid is more or less likely to help people in the district and to support the projects in which citizens are interested? The distribution of aid directly to NGOs and service providers, rather than through the government, has been advocated as a means by which foreign aid donors can mitigate problems associated with weak governance. By sidestepping low-capacity governments, donors may be able to better assist needy citizens (Dietrich 2013, 2016; Winters 2010, 2014). Yet the decision by donors to provide aid to NGOs rather than the local government may also communicate information to citizens about the quality of government. On the one hand, insofar as citizens indicate preferences for and greater willingness to support projects described as being funded by donors (Milner, Nielson and Findley 2013), aid to NGOs may increase citizens\u2019 perceptions of the quality of both services and the government (Dietrich and Winters 2015, Sachs 2011). On the other hand, insofar as citizens believe either that governments are less relevant to service delivery when aid is delivered to NGOs or that donors\u2019 decisions to bypass governments are a result of poor governance, bypass aid may increase citizens\u2019 perceptions of the quality of service delivery but lower their perceptions of the quality of governance. We will test these hypotheses using a survey experiment conducted on a random sample of adults in 8 parishes in Eastern and Western Uganda.

We have multiple measures of each outcome, and also questions designed to assess whether the effect of aid on perceptions of governance is due to the information aid signals about governance or the presumed effects of aid on governance. A. Quality of aid projects First, we are interested in seeing whether respondents think differently about aid that goes through the government versus aid that goes to NGOs. We ask two questions to measure respondents\u2019 perceptions of the quality of aid. 1. Aid Benefits: How many people respondents think foreign aid has benefited in Yumbe (None of them, some of them, most of them, all of them) 2. Aid Responsiveness: How likely respondents think it is that foreign aid to Yumbe has been spent on the projects that the people of Yumbe wanted most (Very likely, somewhat likely, somewhat unlikely, very unlikely) B. Quality of government B1. Aid as Signal of Government Quality Do citizens make inferences about their local governments depending on whether it is receiving increased aid and whether that increased aid is going to the district government or else is going to NGOs in the district? We look at four outcomes: two related to the respondents\u2019 perceptions of the district government in question, and two related to how respondents perceive likely levels of compliance behavior among citizens in the district. 1. Performance: How well respondents think the government of Yumbe was performing in 2012 (Very well, somewhat well, somewhat poorly, very poorly) 2. Corruption: How many people in the district administration in Yumbe respondents think were involved in corruption in 2012 (None of them, some of them, most of them, all of them) 3. Compliance (I): The district government in Yumbe is responsible for collecting fees for business licenses, market stands and other such things. What proportion of people in Yumbe district do you think actually paid the fees they owed the district in 2012? (None of them, few of them, some of them, most of them) 4. Compliance (II): The district government in Yumbe is responsible for organizing community meetings on important public health issues. How many people in Yumbe district do you think actually attended the meetings on public health issues organized by the district government in 2012? (None of them, few of them, some of them, most of them) B2. Aid as Cause of Governance Quality Do citizens believe that aid will change government behavior and citizen interactions with government? We assess this by measuring respondents\u2019 perceptions of how government quality and citizen compliance will have changed over time in the wake of increasing aid flows. 1. Performance: In the past three years, do you think performance of the district administration in Yumbe district has increased or declined? (Increased, no change, declined) 2. Corruption: In the past three years, do you think the number of people in the district administration in Yumbe involved in corruption has increased or declined? (Increased, no change, declined) 3. Compliance (I): In the past three years, do you think the number of people in Yumbe district who are have actually participated in clean-up campaigns to remove garbage has increased or decreased? (Increased, no change, declined) 4. Compliance (II): In the past three years, do you think the number of people in Yumbe district who attended public health meetings organized by the district government has increased or decreased? (Increased, no change, declined) We will test hypotheses 1 and 2 by comparing outcomes in Group 1 to outcomes in Groups 2 and 2, 3, and 4. We will test hypotheses 3, 4 and 5 by comparing outcomes in Group 3 and Group 4. Our baseline analysis will be an OLS regression that includes dummy variables for each strata. In addition, we will run an OLS regression that also includes basic socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, education, religion, occupation and three need-based measures of household well-being). Finally, we will calculate the complier average treatment effect by using the treatments as instruments for whether the respondent believed (a) aid to the district had increased between 2012 and 2013 and (b) the main recipient of aid was NGOs versus the government."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Uganda"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "1104"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "1507016212 (Yale); 16141 (UIUC); 0509-2015 (Mildmay Uganda)"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "11/13/15"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Corruption", "Development", "Governance"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e38428957427b01740c25d9", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/z7gf2/providers/osfstorage/5e38428957427b01740c25d9", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/z7gf2/providers/osfstorage/5e38428957427b01740c25d9", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/z7gf2/providers/osfstorage/5e38428957427b01740c25d9?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/z7gf2/providers/osfstorage/5e38428957427b01740c25d9"}, "attributes": {"etag": "ba5aaf7480a49da62229f6b23fdc239ae8152b9f7557b223d91abc6fe38541a7", "kind": "file", "name": "20160113AA_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e38428957427b01740c25d9", "size": 345018, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "f704ca68066e7fec2a4c38badd8caccb", "sha256": "f45ee52d9e1f6c988ca8ed649dbe833ed4ffbd6c9089c5bdd8c6fcd61a7fe3d7"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 345018, "modified": "2020-02-03T15:55:53.511581+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "z7gf2", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20160113AA_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T15:55:53+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "z7gf2", "sha256": "f45ee52d9e1f6c988ca8ed649dbe833ed4ffbd6c9089c5bdd8c6fcd61a7fe3d7", "viewUrl": "/project/ekbdu/files/osfstorage/5e38428efa39b701641dbf40/", "selectedFileName": "20160113AA_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20160113AA_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Bypass Aid and Local Accountability Survey Experiment", "q2": "Kate Baldwin | Matthew Winters", "q3": "20160113AA", "q4": "01/13/2016 - 20:51", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to assignment of treatment", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "1/13/16", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "This project explores how citizens understand aid flows and, in particular, \u201cbypass aid\u201d (aid that flows to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), rather than to the government).

Compliance (I): The district government in Yumbe is responsible for collecting fees for business licenses, market stands and other such things. What proportion of people in Yumbe district do you think actually paid the fees they owed the district in 2012? (None of them, few of them, some of them, most of them) 4. Compliance (II): The district government in Yumbe is responsible for organizing community meetings on important public health issues. How many people in Yumbe district do you think actually attended the meetings on public health issues organized by the district government in 2012? (None of them, few of them, some of them, most of them) B2. Aid as Cause of Governance Quality Do citizens believe that aid will change government behavior and citizen interactions with government? We assess this by measuring respondents\u2019 perceptions of how government quality and citizen compliance will have changed over time in the wake of increasing aid flows. 1. Performance: In the past three years, do you think performance of the district administration in Yumbe district has increased or declined? (Increased, no change, declined) 2. Corruption: In the past three years, do you think the number of people in the district administration in Yumbe involved in corruption has increased or declined? (Increased, no change, declined) 3. Compliance (I): In the past three years, do you think the number of people in Yumbe district who are have actually participated in clean-up campaigns to remove garbage has increased or decreased? (Increased, no change, declined) 4. Compliance (II): In the past three years, do you think the number of people in Yumbe district who attended public health meetings organized by the district government has increased or decreased? (Increased, no change, declined) We will test hypotheses 1 and 2 by comparing outcomes in Group 1 to outcomes in Groups 2 and 2, 3, and 4. We will test hypotheses 3, 4 and 5 by comparing outcomes in Group 3 and Group 4. Our baseline analysis will be an OLS regression that includes dummy variables for each strata. In addition, we will run an OLS regression that also includes basic socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, education, religion, occupation and three need-based measures of household well-being). Finally, we will calculate the complier average treatment effect by using the treatments as instruments for whether the respondent believed (a) aid to the district had increased between 2012 and 2013 and (b) the main recipient of aid was NGOs versus the government.", "q18": "Uganda", "q19": "1104", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "1507016212 (Yale); 16141 (UIUC); 0509-2015

government institutions. Although the distribution of aid directly to NGOs and service providers has been advocated as a means of ensuring that aid reaches the needy in contexts where local government capacity is low, this type of aid may have unintended consequences on local government capacity and accountability. We will examine these possible consequences of bypass aid through an informational intervention in eight sub-counties in Uganda. The intervention varies whether adults are informed of the true implementer and funder of local projects. The informational intervention will allow us to assess whether adults who are informed that a project is donor-funded and/or NGO-implemented express different beliefs about the quality of and likelihood of accountability in the project, the performance of their local politicians, and the legitimacy of their local government as compared to otherwise similar adults who lack this information."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "We generally expect that revealing information about projects will have positive effects on our outcomes related to service accessibility, assessments of local politicians and government legitimacy.

Our research design involves an informational intervention that will vary the amount of information provided to different respondents about the funding sources and implementing partners for local development projects in their communities. Citizens in Uganda typically have a great deal of uncertainty about funding sources and implementing organizations for local development projects (Milner, Nielson and Findley 2013). As a result, by revealing the true source of funding and the true implementing partner to randomly selected citizens, we will be able to change some citizens\u2019 beliefs about the groups responsible for funding and implementing local projects. The information to be distributed in the study comes from three sources: (1) the Uganda Aid Management Platform, which is overseen by the Aid Liaison Office at the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) with assistance from USAID/Uganda and the AidData Initiative; (2) the website of the Embassy of Japan in Uganda; and (3) advance surveys with NGO officials and political elites in the study areas. The sub-counties included in the study are all home to development interventions funded by Japan\u2019s Grant Assistance for Grassroots Human Security Projects (GGP) and implemented by non-governmental organizations. We have included sub-counties that received grants between 2012 and 2015. In each of eight sub-counties, we will first select the parish in which the project is based (or that is reported to benefit most from the project). Then we will randomly select half of the polling stations in this parish for inclusion in the study. We will randomly select households in these polling stations, and then interview either an adult male or an adult female who is at home at the time of the survey within the selected households. Respondents in the household survey will be randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups indicated below; the randomization will be stratified by sub-county and gender. (A1) No information about project prior to measurement of service accessibility, electoral accountability, and government legitimacy outcomes (B1) Information about project but no attribution of responsibility for funding or implementation (B2) Information about project and source of funding but no information about implementation (B3) Information about project and institution responsible for implementation but no information about funding (B4) Information about project, funding source, and institution responsible for implementation Individuals assigned to treatment group (A1) will be told nothing about the project until after we have measured the outcome variables related to service accessibility, electoral accountability and government legitimacy and will therefore serve as a pure control. After measuring outcomes, we will tell them about the project only \u2013 as in B1 \u2013 and solicit their beliefs about the funding source and implementing partner at that time. Individuals assigned to treatment groups (B1 \u2013 B4) will be told something like this : \u201cA project to construct a girls' dormitory block at Bukooli College, as well as to construct latrines and provide water tanks, began in this district in 2013. The project cost around 350 million Ugandan shilling, and it occurred in this parish. Here is a photo of the dormitories that were constructed as a result of this project.\u201d As indicated, we also will show a photograph of the project in question to the respondents. Immediately after hearing this information and seeing the image, we will solicit from these individuals their perceptions of the project. We will ask them: (1) Before I gave you this information, had you previously heard of this project? (2) Who do you think funded the project? (3) Who do you think was in charge of managing the funds and using them to run the project? Individuals assigned to treatment group (A1) also will receive this information, see the photo, and be asked about their perceptions of the project but only after they already have answered the questions operationalizing our outcome variables related to service accessibility, electoral accountability and government legitimacy. Observations in this cell will be pooled with cell B1 for the purposes of analyzing the outcomes related to the perceptions of project quality and project accountability so long as we do not detect section ordering effects. For individuals assigned to treatment group (B1), there is no further treatment, and we will proceed to ask them the outcome questions. This group, therefore, serves as a control group that has been exposed to information about a project and that has been asked about their views of who funded and implemented the project but that has not been told the true information about funding and implementation. Individuals assigned to treatment group (B2) will be told the initial information and asked their beliefs about funding and implementation. Then they will be given additional information about funding in a form something like this: \u201cI wanted to give you some additional information about the groups involved in providing the project to construct a girls' dormitory block at Bukooli College, as well as to construct latrines and provide water tanks. The Funding for the project came from Japan. Here is a photo of the Japanese ambassador signing off on funding.\u201d As indicated, they will see an image of a Japanese official signing a document. This image will be the same for all projects. Individuals assigned to treatment group (B3) will be told the initial information and asked their beliefs about funding and implementation. Then they will be given additional information about implementation in a form something like this: \u201cI wanted to give you some additional information about the groups involved in providing the project to construct a girls' dormitory block at Bukooli College, as well as to construct latrines and provide water tanks. The organization responsible for managing the projects funds and using them to run the project was the organization Bukooli College. Here is a photo of the signboard for the organization.\u201d As indicated, these respondents will see an image representing the implementing organization (i.e., the sign outside the office of the organization). These images will be collected during interviews with officials from the implementing organizations. Individuals assigned to treatment group (B4) will be told the initial information and asked their beliefs about funding and implementation. Then they will be given additional information about funding and implementation in a form something like this: \u201cI wanted to give you some additional information about the groups involved in providing the project to construct a girls' dormitory block at Bukooli College, as well as to construct latrines and provide water tanks. The Funding for the project came from Japan. Here is a photo of the Japanese ambassador signing off on funding. The organization responsible for managing the projects funds and using them to run the project was the organization Bukooli College. Here is a photo of the signboard for the organization.\u201d As indicated, respondents in this treatment condition will see both the photo of the Japanese embassy official and of the implementing organization\u2019s signboard. Importantly, the information revealed in each community will reflect the true funder and the true implementing partner for all projects (i.e., the treatments do not involve deception). Our sample of communities includes only communities with projects funded through the GGP grant-giving mechanism of the Japanese Embassy. This allows us to hold the funder and the amount of funding for each project constant, while the implementing partner will vary by community. Prior to conducting the informational intervention, we will conduct elite surveys with (a) the leaders of the organizations that received the grants and (b) LC3 councilors in each of the parishes in which we will conduct the informational intervention. These interviews will be used to guide site selection and to develop the informational prompts. After providing respondents with the informational treatment to which they are assigned, we will ask questions designed to measure our main outcomes of interest. Our main research questions relate to the effect of bypass aid on subjects\u2019 willingness and ability to provide oversight of projects, their evaluations of local politicians and their perceptions of the legitimacy of local government. In addition, we examine the effects of bypass aid on perceptions of project quality and service accessibility. We indicate the specific questions we will use to measure each outcome in the Outcome Measures section of the attached pre-analysis plan. For each of our hypotheses, we are interested in estimating two effects \u2013 the average treatment effect across all subjects and the average treatment effect on compliers (subjects whose information was changed as a result of the informational intervention). For example, all subjects may have priors about project funding and project implementation. They may believe that the project was funded by the national government, the local government, an NGO, a foreign donor, or some other entity \u2013 or they may not know. They may believe that the project was implemented by the national government, the local government, an NGO, a foreign donor, or some other entity \u2013 or they may not know. Some people will have correct and certain priors, and some people will have incorrect or uncertain priors. We solicit these priors in all treatment conditions immediately after we describe the project. For individuals with certain and correct priors, our treatments may still have an effect via priming, but to isolate the priming from the informational effect, we will analyze effects both over the full sample and over the sample with incorrect or diffuse priors. Similarly, some individuals may have the project in mind ex ante and some may not have the project in mind. Our survey also includes a question designed to measure this, and we can examine the effect of information about the project across both the whole sample and the subset of the sample who did not have the project in mind ex ante. We will test our hypotheses related to learning about a project by comparing the differences between subjects in the following treatment arms: Effect of learning about a project: A1 vs. B1 (B2, B3, B4) Effect of learning about a donor-funded project: A1 vs. B2, B4 Effect of learning about an NGO-implemented project: A1 vs. B3, B4 We will test our hypotheses related to the differential effects of government-funded versus donor-funded and government-implemented versus NGO-implemented projects by comparing the differences between subjects in the following treatment arms: Effect of learning a project was donor-funded: B1 vs. B2, B4 Effect of learning a project was NGO-implemented: B1 vs. B3, B4 Our main tests will involve running OLS regression analyses with fixed effects for each strata. We will also run OLS regression analyses with controls for basic socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, education, religion, occupation and three need-based measures of household well-being). For the electoral accountability outcome measures, we will also include controls for political party identification and past voting behavior. For the government legitimacy outcome measures, we will control for whether or not the household has paid fees to the local government in the past."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Uganda"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "1104"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "1507016212 (Yale); 16141 (UIUC); 0509-2015 (Mildmay Uganda)"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "11/13/15"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Corruption", "Development", "Governance"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e31e2cf4b2010000a20f6b2", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/kvhyf/providers/osfstorage/5e31e2cf4b2010000a20f6b2", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/kvhyf/providers/osfstorage/5e31e2cf4b2010000a20f6b2", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/kvhyf/providers/osfstorage/5e31e2cf4b2010000a20f6b2?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/kvhyf/providers/osfstorage/5e31e2cf4b2010000a20f6b2"}, "attributes": {"etag": "45eef71f5a441fa6a4adc863970434669e8084bea641842a033e7e814baf61e0", "kind": "file", "name": "20160113AB_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e31e2cf4b2010000a20f6b2", "size": 413349, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "a65ab1d0a9e025c7548dad87d57284b9", "sha256": "0dc830ac40b482beb7081c85567f9e126d5327d7f9ae0b31edebaa1ade9d9115"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 413349, "modified": "2020-01-29T19:53:51.924433+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "kvhyf", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20160113AB_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-01-29T19:53:51+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "kvhyf", "sha256": "0dc830ac40b482beb7081c85567f9e126d5327d7f9ae0b31edebaa1ade9d9115", "viewUrl": "/project/dvbcj/files/osfstorage/5e31e2d34b2010001a20f91f/", "selectedFileName": "20160113AB_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20160113AB_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": {}, "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Bypass Aid and Local Accountability Informational Intervention", "q2": "Kate Baldwin | Matthew Winters", "q3": "20160113AB", "q4": "01/13/2016 - 21:17", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to assignment of treatment", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "1/13/16", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "This project seeks to understand the effects of \u201cbypass aid\u201d (aid that flows to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), rather than to the government) on the ability and willingness of citizens to hold service providers accountable, the ability and willingness of citizens to hold politicians accountable, and the legitimacy that citizens attach to government institutions.

It is ambiguous whether citizens who learn a project is donor-funded and/or NGO-implemented will view their government as more or less legitimate.", "q17": "This study is concerned with the effect on accountability of foreign aid that bypasses governments. Our research design involves an informational intervention that will vary the amount of information provided to different respondents about the funding sources and implementing partners for local development projects in their communities. Citizens in Uganda typically have a great deal of uncertainty about funding sources and implementing organizations for local development projects (Milner, Nielson and Findley 2013). As a result, by revealing the true source of funding and the true implementing partner to randomly selected citizens, we will be able to change some citizens\u2019 beliefs about the groups responsible for funding and implementing local projects. The information to be distributed in the study comes from three sources: (1) the Uganda Aid Management Platform, which is overseen by the Aid Liaison Office at the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) with assistance from USAID/Uganda and the AidData Initiative; (2) the website of the Embassy of Japan in Uganda; and (3) advance surveys with NGO officials and political elites in the study areas. The sub-counties included in the study are all home to development interventions funded by Japan\u2019s Grant Assistance for Grassroots Human Security Projects (GGP) and implemented by non-governmental organizations. We have included sub-counties that received grants between 2012 and 2015. In each of eight sub-counties, we will first select the parish in which the project is based (or that is reported to benefit most from the project). Then we will randomly select half of the polling stations in this parish for inclusion in the study. We will randomly select households in these polling stations, and then interview either an adult male or an adult female who is at home at the time of the survey within the selected households. Respondents in the household survey will be randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups indicated below; the randomization will be stratified by sub-county and gender. (A1) No information about project prior to measurement of service accessibility, electoral accountability, and government legitimacy outcomes (B1) Information about project but no attribution of responsibility for funding or implementation (B2) Information about project and source of funding but no information about implementation (B3) Information about project and institution responsible for implementation but no information about funding (B4) Information about project, funding source, and institution responsible for implementation Individuals assigned to treatment group (A1) will be told nothing about the project until after we have measured the outcome variables related to service accessibility, electoral accountability and government legitimacy and will therefore serve as a pure control. After measuring outcomes, we will tell them about the project only \u2013 as in B1 \u2013 and solicit their beliefs about the funding source and implementing partner at that time. Individuals assigned to treatment groups (B1 \u2013 B4) will be told something like this : \u201cA project to construct a girls' dormitory block at Bukooli College, as well as to construct latrines and provide water tanks, began in this district in 2013. The project cost around 350 million Ugandan shilling, and it occurred in this parish. Here is a photo of the dormitories that were constructed as a result of this project.\u201d As indicated, we also will show a photograph of the project in question to the respondents. Immediately after hearing this information and seeing the image, we will solicit from these individuals their perceptions of the project. We will ask them: (1) Before I gave you this information, had you previously heard of this project? (2) Who do you think funded the project? (3) Who do you think was in charge of managing the funds and using them to run the project? Individuals assigned to treatment group (A1) also will receive this information, see the photo, and be asked about their perceptions of the project but only after they already have answered the questions operationalizing our outcome variables related to service accessibility, electoral accountability and government legitimacy. Observations in this cell will be pooled with cell B1 for the purposes of analyzing the outcomes related to the perceptions of project quality and project accountability so long as we do not detect section ordering effects. For individuals assigned to treatment group (B1), there is no further treatment, and we will proceed to ask them the outcome questions. This group, therefore, serves as a control group that has been exposed to information about a project and that has been asked about their views of who funded and implemented the project but that has not been told the true information about funding and implementation. Individuals assigned to treatment group (B2) will be told the initial information and asked their beliefs about funding and implementation. Then they will be given additional information about funding in a form something like this: \u201cI wanted to give you some additional information about the groups involved in providing the project to construct a girls' dormitory block at Bukooli College, as well as to construct latrines and provide water tanks. The Funding for the project came from Japan. Here is a photo of the Japanese ambassador signing off on funding.\u201d As indicated, they will see an image of a Japanese official signing a document. This image will be the same for all projects. Individuals assigned to treatment group (B3) will be told the initial information and asked their beliefs about funding and implementation. Then they will be given additional information about implementation in a form something like this: \u201cI wanted to give you some additional information about the groups involved in providing the project to construct a girls' dormitory block at Bukooli College, as well as to construct latrines and provide water tanks. The organization responsible for managing the projects funds and using them to run the project was the organization Bukooli College. Here is a photo of the signboard for the organization.\u201d As indicated, these respondents will see an image representing the implementing organization (i.e., the sign outside the office of the organization). These images will be collected during interviews with officials from the implementing organizations. Individuals assigned to treatment group (B4) will be told the initial information and asked their beliefs about funding and implementation. Then they will be given additional information about funding and implementation in a form something like this: \u201cI wanted to give you some additional information about the groups involved in providing the project to construct a girls' dormitory block at Bukooli College, as well as to construct latrines and provide water tanks. The Funding for the project came from Japan. Here is a photo of the Japanese ambassador signing off on funding. The organization responsible for managing the projects funds and using them to run the project was the organization Bukooli College. Here is a photo of the signboard for the organization.\u201d As indicated, respondents in this treatment condition will see both the photo of the Japanese embassy official and of the implementing organization\u2019s signboard. Importantly, the information revealed in each community will reflect the true funder and the true implementing partner for all projects (i.e., the treatments do not involve deception). Our sample of communities includes only communities with projects funded through the GGP grant-giving mechanism of the Japanese Embassy. This allows us to hold the funder and the amount of funding for each project constant, while the implementing partner will vary by community. Prior to conducting the informational intervention, we will conduct elite surveys with (a) the leaders of the organizations that received the grants and (b) LC3 councilors in each of the parishes in which we will conduct the informational intervention. These interviews will be used to guide site selection and to develop the informational prompts. After providing respondents with the informational treatment to which they are assigned, we will ask questions designed to measure our main outcomes of interest. Our main research questions relate to the effect of bypass aid on subjects\u2019 willingness and ability to provide oversight of projects, their evaluations of local politicians and their perceptions of the legitimacy of local government. In addition, we examine the effects of bypass aid on perceptions of project quality and service accessibility. We indicate the specific questions we will use to measure each outcome in the Outcome Measures section of the attached pre-analysis plan. For each of our hypotheses, we are interested in estimating two effects \u2013 the average treatment effect across all subjects and the average treatment effect on compliers (subjects whose information was changed as a result of the informational intervention). For example, all subjects may have priors about project funding and project implementation. They may believe that the project was funded by the national government, the local government, an NGO, a foreign donor, or some other entity \u2013 or they may not know. They may believe that the project was implemented by the national government, the local government, an NGO, a foreign donor, or some other entity \u2013 or they may not know. Some people will have correct and certain priors, and some people will have incorrect or uncertain priors. We solicit these priors in all treatment conditions immediately after we describe the project. For individuals with certain and correct priors, our treatments may still have an effect via priming, but to isolate the priming from the informational effect, we will analyze effects both over the full sample and over the sample with incorrect or diffuse priors. Similarly, some individuals may have the project in mind ex ante and some may not have the project in mind. Our survey also includes a question designed to measure this, and we can examine the effect of information about the project across both the whole sample and the subset of the sample who did not have the project in mind ex ante. We will test our hypotheses related to learning about a project by comparing the differences between subjects in the following treatment arms: Effect of learning about a project: A1 vs. B1 (B2, B3, B4) Effect of learning about a donor-funded project: A1 vs. B2, B4 Effect of learning about an NGO-implemented project: A1 vs. B3, B4 We will test our hypotheses related to the differential effects of government-funded versus donor-funded and government-implemented versus NGO-implemented projects by comparing the differences between subjects in the following treatment arms: Effect of learning a project was donor-funded: B1 vs. B2, B4 Effect of learning a project was NGO-implemented: B1 vs. B3, B4 Our main tests will involve running OLS regression analyses with fixed effects for each strata. We will also run OLS regression analyses with controls for basic socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, education, religion, occupation and three need-based measures of household well-being). For the electoral accountability outcome measures, we will also include controls for political party identification and past voting behavior. For the government legitimacy outcome measures, we will control for whether or not the household has paid fees to the local government in the past.", "q18": "Uganda", "q19": "1104", "q20": "Yes",

After the T3 language and picture of the Smiling Sun Clinic displaying a UKAID logo, the text continues: \u201cThe goal is to enhance the visibility of UKAID\u2019s projects, to advance the UK\u2019s other foreign policy goals, and to improve the UK\u2019s image in Bangladesh.\u201d Core Measures Measures of changes in level of support for UK Foreign Aid Q1: Thinking back to the U.K. Government\u2019s current budget of \u00a3760 billion: this year, the government is expected to spend 1.4 percent of the annual budget (which is 0.7) percent of the U.K.\u2019s Gross national Income) on foreign aid to help people in poor countries. Knowing this, do you think the government should: spend more, the same amount, or less money to help people in poor countries? [Spend more; Spend the same amount; Spend less] Q2: Do you think that the United Kingdom should increase its support of the Smiling Sun Clinics as part of its foreign development assistance program? [Greatly increase; Somewhat increase; Neither increase nor decrease; Somewhat decrease; Greatly decrease] Changes in perceptions of the development effectiveness of aid Q3: Here are statements that people have made in the past about foreign aid. For each statement, please indicate your level of agreement [Strongly agree; Agree; Neither Agree nor Disagree; Disagree; Strongly Disagree] Foreign aid is an effective tool for reducing poverty in poorer countries Foreign aid is an important way of addressing global health problems Changes in evaluations of the foreign policy performance of the government Q4: On a scale from 1 (very badly) to 5) very well), can you indicate your opinion about how the Conservative government has handled the following issues?

Asking respondents to react to vignettes that provide information about hypothetical mayors, we find that corruption is consistently punished, even when politicians are described as high-performing. In addition, we have shown that citizens react more strongly to information that comes from credible sources (defined as those that lack incentives to dissemble with regard to a given piece of information). This differentiation between more and less credible sources is particularly concentrated among political sophisticates (a concept that we have operationalized using measures of education, political knowledge, and political interest). In the present study, we will use a module of questions on the Argentina Panel Election Study to (1) explore the extent to which our results from Brazil can be replicated in Argentina; (2) test hypotheses about how partisanship may moderate citizen reactions to different kinds of information sources; and (3) test hypotheses about how priming respondents about overall levels of corruption, to bring to mind impressions of the overall candidate pool, may moderate responses to corruption information in a referendum-style voting question. In addition, we will use the survey to explore the concept of political sophistication in two ways. First, we develop a new survey experimental vignette where information about a non-political behavior (a possible foul in a soccer game) is delivered by either a more or less credible source. This vignette parallels our main experimental vignette about mayoral corruption in the use of information sources of variable credibility. Using a parallel vignette structure for a non-political behavior will allow us to examine whether politically sophisticated respondents (who we have shown in previous work are more discerning about the credibility of political information sources) also discern more between information sources in a non-political context. Second, we will include two new strategic thinking questions (one original to this survey) and use these to test for heterogeneous treatment effects in both the corruption vignette and the soccer vignettes across respondents who are identified as more and less sophisticated by these questions. That is, in addition to operationalizing political sophistication through measures of political knowledge, educational attainment, and/or self-expressed political interest, we will also examine whether respondents who show evidence of strategic thinking are more likely to differentiate between credible and less credible information sources in both political and non-political settings.\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"For our main experiment on corruption, we will employ two main outcome variables: the respondent\u2019s reported vote intention for the hypothetical mayor named in the vignette, and the respondent\u2019s reported belief that the hypothetical mayor is corrupt. Unless noted otherwise (see H6-H8), our hypotheses expect a consistent effect on both measures (that is, where we expect greater respondent \u201cdisapproval\u201d of a mayor, we mean both that respondents should report being less likely to vote for the mayor and more likely to say he is corrupt). We treat vote intention as our main outcome of interest through most of this project, with one exception: when making comparisons to the non-political vignette that manipulates source credibility, we use respondent assessment of mayoral corruption as our dependent variable. H1 (Credible Information): Respondents who hear about mayoral corruption from a credible source will express greater disapproval of an incumbent mayor than those who hear about corruption from a less credible source. H2 (Conditional Effects by Sophistication): Compared to less sophisticated respondents, we expect more sophisticated respondents to exhibit greater differentiation between credible and less-credible information sources. Compared to other respondents, we expect more sophisticated respondents to be less punitive of mayors accused of corruption by less credible sources and to be relatively more punitive of mayors accused by credible sources. H3 (Conditional Effects by Copartisanship): Respondents who share a partisan identity with a mayor or an opposition party described in a vignette will react differently from non-copartisans in a number of ways that will dampen the effects described thus far. We expect respondents to heavily discount accusations of corruption, regardless of credibility, when they are made against a copartisan mayor. We also expect copartisans of an opposition party named in a vignette to give more credence to those accusations than other respondents. H4 (Conditioning Effect of Copartisanship on Political Sophistication Effects): The large amount of differentiation between more and less credible information sources that we expect to see among political sophisticates will diminish in the face of shared copartisanship with the mayor accused of corruption. Thus, among copartisans, we expect to see very little difference in the \u201cdiscernment\u201d exhibited by more and less sophisticated respondents. Or put differently, among political sophisticates, copartisans should show much less evidence of discernment between sources based on credibility as opposed to non-copartisans. H5 (Perceptions of Candidate Pool): When asked to characterize the quality of politicians in Argentina (a priming question half the sample will receive), most respondents will report that politicians are typically corrupt (highest 2 categories on a 4-point scale). H6 (Effects of Priming on Perceptions of Mayoral Corruption): Given H6, receiving the priming question should change respondents\u2019 perceptions of the likelihood the hypothetical mayor is corrupt. As compared to respondents who were not primed, primed respondents should be more likely to report that the described mayor is corrupt. This should be true for all experimental groups (control, credible accusations, and less credible accusations). As opposed to non-primed respondents, those who receive the prime should also give more homogenous responses to the question of the mayor\u2019s corruption when comparing responses between the control group (no information about corruption) and the treatment groups. We also expect less differentiation between the more and less credible information treatments for those respondents who were primed. H7 (Effects of Priming on Vote Intention): While priming will heighten beliefs that the mayor is corrupt, it will also increase beliefs that any opponent is corrupt. For that reason, within every possible vignette, we expect respondents in the primed group to be more likely to report that they would vote for the mayor as compared to respondents in the non-primed group. This difference should be greatest in the control vignettes, where the mayor does not face accusations about corruption. H8 (Effects of Political Sophistication on Reactions to the Prime): Since we expect sophisticated respondents to draw on their existing perceptions about the candidate pool even in the absence of a prime, we expect the prime to have less effect on opinions about the incumbent mayor among this group. This should be true for both assessments of the likelihood that the mayor is corrupt and for vote intention. H9 (Correlates of Strategic Thinking): Correct responses to our strategic thinking questions will correlate with traditional indicators of political sophistication (i.e., education, political knowledge, and political interest). H10 (Effects of Strategic Thinking): Conditional treatment effects among strategic thinkers will be in the same direction as those observed among political sophisticates defined using the traditional variables but will be larger in magnitude. H11 (Credible Information in Political and Non-Political Arenas): Groups that differentiate more between credible and less-credible information in the political arena will also do so in a non-political arena.\""}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "\"The main survey experiment on information credibility and reactions to political corruption takes the form of a 3X4 factorial design.

For the analyses of heterogeneous treatment effects, we will use randomization inference tests.\"", "q18": "", "q19": "", "q20": "Yes", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "", "q25": "", "q26": "Other (describe in text box below)", "q27": "MORI Argentina as part of the Argentina Panel Election Study coordinated by Noam Lupu (University of Wisconsin)", "q28": "", "q29": "", "q30": "", "q31": "", "q32": "", "q33": [""], "q34": [""], "q35": "Agree", "q36": "Agree", "q37": [], "q38": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=n95g8", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "n95g8", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "n95g8", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/d5gfm/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "d5gfm", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nywf6/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "nywf6", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0f/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0f", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/n95g8/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/n95g8/"}}], "links": {"first": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json", "last": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "prev": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=267", "next": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=269", "meta": {"total": 5469, "per_page": 10}}}
