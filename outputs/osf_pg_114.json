These refer to times when you think the child is aware of/notices the sensation, whether you think the sensation is there or not. The child may mention the sensation, or behave in a way that makes you think they are experiencing the sensation. e.g. they may complain of being cold a lot, or rub their arms to warm themselves up a lot; they may say their skin feels itchy, or scratch their body.\n\n Please read these sentences and use the scale to tell us whether they fit with the child. If you think the statement fits them completely, please circle always. If you don\u2019t think it fits them at all, please circle never.  \n\nMost of the time they are aware of (notice):\n\n(Rating Scale: Never, Occasionally, Sometimes, Usually, Always)\n\nSwallowing frequently\nA ringing in their ears\nAn urge to cough or clear their throat\nTheir body swaying when they are standing\nTheir mouth being dry \nHow fast they are breathing\nWatering or tearing of their eyes\nTheir skin itching\nNoises associated with their digestion\nEye fatigue or pain\nMuscle tension in their neck and back\nA swelling in their body or parts of their body\nAn urge to urinate\nTremor in their hands\nAn urge to defecate\nMuscle tension in their arms and legs\nStomach distension or bloatedness\nMuscle tension in their face\nGoose bumps\nFacial twitches\nBeing exhausted\nStomach and gut pains\nRolling or fluttering their eyes\nPalms sweating\nSweat on their forehead\nClumsiness or bumping into people\nTremor in their lips\nSweat in their armpits\nSensations of prickling, tingling, or numbness in their body\nThe temperature of their face (especially their ears)\nGrinding their teeth\nGeneral jitteriness\nTheir eye movements\nTheir nose itching\nThe hair on the back of their neck \u201cstanding up\u201d\nNeeding to rest\nDifficulty in focusing\nHow hard their heart is beating\nFeeling constipated\n\nAppendix F: Interoceptive Accuracy Scale - Observer Report\n\nWritten below are some sentences about how well (accurately) the child can feel things inside their body. Please read these sentences and use the scale to tell us whether they fit with the child. If you think the statement fits them completely, please circle strongly agree. If you don\u2019t think it fits them at all, please circle strongly disagree.  \n\nIt is very important that you only tell us how well you think they can feel what\u2019s inside their body without using signs from outside of their body. For example, if they can only tell their heart is beating fast by feeling their heartbeat with their hands, this would not count as correctly feeling when their heart is beating quickly.  \n\nHow will I know if the child I care for can feel this accurately?\n\nSome of these questions will be difficult to answer, and that's completely fine. Thinking about the following two questions might be helpful when making your decision:\n\nWhen have I noticed signs of the sensation? For example, for cold temperatures, you may remember a time that they had goosebumps or were shivering. Similarly, for hot temperatures, you may remember them sweating.\n\nHow did they behave as a result of this sensation? If they were visibly cold and put on an extra layer of clothing, or visibly hot and removed an item of clothing, you could assume that are good at accurately feeling when they are hot/cold, and could select Agree or Strongly Agree. If they don't do this, or don\u2019t do any other behaviour that might change their temperature (like ask for a blanket), then you could assume that they struggle to accurately feel when they are hot/cold, and select Disagree or Strongly Disagree. \n\nIf some of these questions are difficult to answer, you will be given the opportunity to give us feedback at the end of the questionnaires. Since we want to know whether these questionnaires could be useful in the future, all feedback (both positive and negative) will be very helpful!\n\n \nThey are always correct at feeling\u2026  \n\n(Rating Scale: Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neither Agree nor Disagree, Agree, Strongly Agree)\n\nWhen their heart is beating quickly \nWhen they are hungry \nWhen they are breathing quickly \nWhen they are thirsty \nWhen they need to have a wee \nWhen they need to have a poo \nWhen they taste new flavours \nWhen they are going to vomit (be sick) \nWhen they are going to sneeze \nWhen they are going to cough \nWhen they are hot or cold \nWhen they are going to fart\nWhen they are going to burp\nWhen their muscles are tired or sore \nWhen they\u2019re going to get a bruise \nWhen they are in pain \nWhen they don\u2019t have any energy \nWhen someone is touching them in a nice way \nWhen something is going to be ticklish \nWhen something is going to be itchy \n\nAppendix G: Demographic Questions\n\nQuestions for the carer\n\nAbout yourself:\nIs English your first language? - (Yes/No)\nHow old are you (in years)? - (free text response)\nWhat gender do you identify as? - (Male/Female/Other)\nWhat was your biological sex as assigned at birth? - (Male/Female/Other) \nDo you have any health conditions (either physical or psychological) that have been diagnosed by a health care professional?

Firstly, whether child age, sex, or observer self-reported interoception interact with observer report in predicting child self-report will be investigated using enter method regression analyses. The following six regressions will be conducted:\n\nRegression One: CSF IAS scores as the outcome variable. Interaction between observer report IAS scores and child age as the predictor variable.\n\nRegression Two: CSF IAS scores as the outcome variable.

The IAS requires participants to rate their accuracy in perceiving a range of body signals (e.g. \u201cI can always accurately perceive when I need to urinate\u201d).  The IAS contains 21 items rated on a scale from Strongly Agree (5) to Strongly Disagree (1). The range of scores is from 21-105, and higher scores indicate greater perceived interoceptive accuracy. Items in the scale are included based on either being related to typical sensations which have been described as interoceptive, or give rise to insula activation in the brain which is associated with interoceptive signal processing (Murphy et al., 2019).\n\nParent self-reported interoceptive attention: This will be measured using the awareness subscale of the Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ; Porges, 1993; Appendix B). This scale has 45 items with answers on a five-point ordinal scale ranging from Never (1) to Always (5) and requires participants to rate their tendency to be aware of (notice) different body sensations (e.g. \u201cMost of the time I am aware of my mouth being dry\u201d).\n\nCSR interoceptive attention: This will be measured using the simplified awareness subscale of the BPQ, adapted for children (Appendix C). This scale has 39 items with answers on a five-point ordinal scale ranging from Never (1) to Always (5). This scale was originally adapted for children by Palser, Fotopoulou, Pellicano and Kilner (2018). However, the present research will use more recent version which made minor edits to the adapted version for additional clarity (Barker et al., 2019).\n\nCSR self-reported interoceptive accuracy: This will be measured using the child adaptation of the IAS (Barker et al., 2019; Appendix D). \n\nObserver report of child interoceptive attention: Observer report of interoceptive attention will be measured using a modified version of the awareness subscale of the BPQ (Appendix E). This version has been reworded so the questions are related to the perception of another person, rather than the individual completing the questionnaire (e.g. \u201cMost of the time they are aware of their mouth being dry,\u201d rather than \u201cMost of the time I am aware of my mouth being dry.\u201d). Additional instructions for the observer have been included to avoid potential ambiguity regarding how to answer the questions.  \n\nObserver report of child interoceptive accuracy: Observer report of interoceptive attention will be measured using a modified version of the IAS (Appendix F). As above, this version has been reworded so the questions are related to the perception of another person, rather than the individual completing the questionnaire (e.g.  \u201cThey are always correct at feeling when they are hungry,\u201d rather than \u201cI am always correct at feeling when I am hungry.\u201d) Additional instructions for the observer have been included to avoid potential ambiguity regarding how to answer the questions.  \n\nAdditional Demographic Information\nA list of additional questions that participants will be asked can be found in Appendix G. These questions will be asked to obtain information relevant to our exclusion criteria (first language and atypical gender identity) as well as the primary and secondary analyses (sex, age and observer relationship to the child.\n"}, "conditions": {"extra": [], "value": "The study will have a correlational design, whereby child reports will be correlated with their respective parent reports. All participants will complete all measures designed for their age group."}, "hypothesis": {"extra": [], "value": "Previous research has suggested that interoception, defined as the perception and awareness of one\u2019s own internal state, may be implicated in the development of a range of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. Eggart, Lange, Binser, Queri, &amp; M\u00fcller-Oerlinghausen, 2019; Khalsa et al., 2018; Murphy, Brewer, Catmur, &amp; Bird, 2017; Pang et al., 2019). Because of this, it is crucial to form an in-depth understanding of how, when and why atypical interoception occurs. Since this understanding relies on the accurate and reliable measurement of interoceptive abilities, it is important that measures are validated for use across a range of ages and cognitive abilities. While valid objective measures of interoceptive accuracy and attention should be the gold standard, existing objective measures have a number of limitations (Murphy, Brewer, Coll et al., 2019; Murphy, Brewer, Hobson, Catmur, &amp; Bird, 2018; Ring, Brener, Knapp, &amp; Mailloux, 2015) and are often too time-consuming for developmental studies. Self-report measures assessing both accuracy (Murphy et al., 2020) and attention (e.g. Porges, 1993) are available for use in adults, and we are currently investigating their validity in a child and adolescent sample by assessing relationships between these interoception measures and individual difference measures known to be associated with them in adulthood (Barker, Brewer, Murphy, Viding, &amp; Bird, 2019). It is also necessary to determine whether observers can reliably report on the interoceptive abilities of children. This will not only determine whether parents could report on child abilities where children are unable to unable to communicate or complete the questionnaires themselves, but also serve as an additional validation of the child self-report scales.\n\nThe aim of this research is to test the suitability of parent/guardian report questionnaires (referred to from now on as observer report) to assess the interoceptive accuracy and attention of typical, healthy children aged 6-18 years. By comparing the similarities between observer report and child self-report (CSR) on measures of interoceptive accuracy and attention, we hope to establish whether observer report alone is sufficient to obtain information about the child\u2019s interoceptive abilities. If observer report can reliably predict CSR scores, this would support the use of observer report where necessary. Alternatively, if correlations between these measures are not strong, future work can determine which of these measures best predicts objective measures of interoceptive abilities, through association with objective measures. Furthermore, this research will measure the observer\u2019s self-report of their own interoceptive accuracy and attention in order to examine whether this affects the correlations between observer report and CSR. If an observer reports personal difficulties with interoceptive accuracy and/or attention, this may limit the extent to which they can accurately perceive this ability in others (either due to observer\u2019s own interoceptive difficulties making identification of others\u2019 interoceptive states difficult, or observer\u2019s low insight into interoceptive difficulties). The former may be analogous to difficulties recognising others\u2019 emotions in those with alexithymia, who struggle to perceive and identify their own emotions (Grynberg et al., 2012). If the factors underlying atypical interoception also underlie the recognition of interoceptive states in others, it is essential to take the interoceptive abilities of an observer into account when considering the use of observer report in future research.\n\nIf observer reports can reliably predict CSR scores in healthy children, future use of these measures may provide additional information about the level of interoceptive insight present in those with mental health conditions associated with atypical interoception (e.g. large discrepancies between observer report and CSR for interoceptive accuracy may suggest the child has a low level of interoceptive insight for accuracy, especially if multiple observer measures correlate well). Since lack of insight may be an important factor in the development of some health conditions (rather than atypical accuracy or attention per se), this would be a valuable measure to develop and apply in future research. \n\nObservers should ideally be the child\u2019s primary care-giver. However, if the primary care-giver is not available, any parent or guardian who knows the child well will be invited to complete the observer questionnaires. All observers will be asked to report their relationship to the child, in terms of biological relationship and caring role.\n"}, "study_type": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment"}, "study_type_other": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"data": "No, no data have been collected for this study yet.", "name": "Examining the association between child and parent reports of children\u2019s interoceptive accuracy and attention", "other": "Two additional regressions will be conducted as part of the secondary analyses to explore the interaction between observer reports (BPQ and IAS), child age and child sex, and whether this interaction predicts CSF scores.

These refer to times when you think the child is aware of/notices the sensation, whether you think the sensation is there or not. The child may mention the sensation, or behave in a way that makes you think they are experiencing the sensation. e.g. they may complain of being cold a lot, or rub their arms to warm themselves up a lot; they may say their skin feels itchy, or scratch their body.\n\n Please read these sentences and use the scale to tell us whether they fit with the child. If you think the statement fits them completely, please circle always. If you don\u2019t think it fits them at all, please circle never.  \n\nMost of the time they are aware of (notice):\n\n(Rating Scale: Never, Occasionally, Sometimes, Usually, Always)\n\nSwallowing frequently\nA ringing in their ears\nAn urge to cough or clear their throat\nTheir body swaying when they are standing\nTheir mouth being dry \nHow fast they are breathing\nWatering or tearing of their eyes\nTheir skin itching\nNoises associated with their digestion\nEye fatigue or pain\nMuscle tension in their neck and back\nA swelling in their body or parts of their body\nAn urge to urinate\nTremor in their hands\nAn urge to defecate\nMuscle tension in their arms and legs\nStomach distension or bloatedness\nMuscle tension in their face\nGoose bumps\nFacial twitches\nBeing exhausted\nStomach and gut pains\nRolling or fluttering their eyes\nPalms sweating\nSweat on their forehead\nClumsiness or bumping into people\nTremor in their lips\nSweat in their armpits\nSensations of prickling, tingling, or numbness in their body\nThe temperature of their face (especially their ears)\nGrinding their teeth\nGeneral jitteriness\nTheir eye movements\nTheir nose itching\nThe hair on the back of their neck \u201cstanding up\u201d\nNeeding to rest\nDifficulty in focusing\nHow hard their heart is beating\nFeeling constipated\n\nAppendix F: Interoceptive Accuracy Scale - Observer Report\n\nWritten below are some sentences about how well (accurately) the child can feel things inside their body.

If you don\u2019t think it fits them at all, please circle strongly disagree.  \n\nIt is very important that you only tell us how well you think they can feel what\u2019s inside their body without using signs from outside of their body. For example, if they can only tell their heart is beating fast by feeling their heartbeat with their hands, this would not count as correctly feeling when their heart is beating quickly.  \n\nHow will I know if the child I care for can feel this accurately?\n\nSome of these questions will be difficult to answer, and that's completely fine. Thinking about the following two questions might be helpful when making your decision:\n\nWhen have I noticed signs of the sensation? For example, for cold temperatures, you may remember a time that they had goosebumps or were shivering. Similarly, for hot temperatures, you may remember them sweating.\n\nHow did they behave as a result of this sensation? If they were visibly cold and put on an extra layer of clothing, or visibly hot and removed an item of clothing, you could assume that are good at accurately feeling when they are hot/cold, and could select Agree or Strongly Agree. If they don't do this, or don\u2019t do any other behaviour that might change their temperature (like ask for a blanket), then you could assume that they struggle to accurately feel when they are hot/cold, and select Disagree or Strongly Disagree. \n\nIf some of these questions are difficult to answer, you will be given the opportunity to give us feedback at the end of the questionnaires. Since we want to know whether these questionnaires could be useful in the future, all feedback (both positive and negative) will be very helpful!\n\n \nThey are always correct at feeling\u2026  \n\n(Rating Scale: Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neither Agree nor Disagree, Agree, Strongly Agree)\n\nWhen their heart is beating quickly \nWhen they are hungry \nWhen they are breathing quickly \nWhen they are thirsty \nWhen they need to have a wee \nWhen they need to have a poo \nWhen they taste new flavours \nWhen they are going to vomit (be sick) \nWhen they are going to sneeze \nWhen they are going to cough \nWhen they are hot or cold \nWhen they are going to fart\nWhen they are going to burp\nWhen their muscles are tired or sore \nWhen they\u2019re going to get a bruise \nWhen they are in pain \nWhen they don\u2019t have any energy \nWhen someone is touching them in a nice way \nWhen something is going to be ticklish \nWhen something is going to be itchy \n\nAppendix G: Demographic Questions\n\nQuestions for the carer\n\nAbout yourself:\nIs English your first language? - (Yes/No)\nHow old are you (in years)? - (free text response)\nWhat gender do you identify as? - (Male/Female/Other)\nWhat was your biological sex as assigned at birth? - (Male/Female/Other) \nDo you have any health conditions (either physical or psychological) that have been diagnosed by a health care professional?

Based on a power calculation conducted in Gpower (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, &amp; Lang, 2009), this will provide 80% power to detect an r value of .165 and above in a one-tailed test.\n", "analyses": "Correlations will be used to determine the relationship between scores on the observer report and CSR, for the BPQ and IAS separately. Pearson and Spearman correlations will be used for data meeting and violating assumptions of parametric tests, respectively. \n\nSubsequent analyses will examine the extent to which the correlations between observer report and CSR change as a function of child age, sex, or observer interoceptive abilities. Firstly, whether child age, sex, or observer self-reported interoception interact with observer report in predicting child self-report will be investigated using enter method regression analyses. The following six regressions will be conducted:\n\nRegression One: CSF IAS scores as the outcome variable. Interaction between observer report IAS scores and child age as the predictor variable.\n\nRegression Two: CSF IAS scores as the outcome variable. Interaction between observer report IAS scores and child sex as the predictor variable.\n\nRegression Three: CSF IAS scores as the outcome variable. Interaction between observer report IAS score and observer\u2019s self-reported IAS score as the predictor variable.\n\nRegression Four: CSF BPQ scores as the outcome variable. Interaction between observer report BPQ scores and child age as the predictor variable.\n\nRegression Five: CSF BPQ scores as the outcome variable. Interaction between observer report BPQ scores and child sex as the predictor variable.\n\nRegression Six: CSF BPQ scores as the outcome variable. Interaction between observer report BPQ score and observer\u2019s self-reported BPQ score as the predictor variable.\n\nIf assumptions for linear regressions are violated, entry method robust regressions using the default tuning function in MATLAB will be used. If serious issues with multicollinearity are encountered, ridge regressions will be used.\n\nSecondly, the correlation coefficient for observer report and CSR for each observer and child pair will be calculated to compute a new variable, labelled \u201cObserver-child consistency\u201d (OCC). Two sets of OCC scores will be calculated for scores of accuracy (using IAS scores) and attention (using BPQ scores). All OCC scores will be standardised, and Z-scores will be used as a dependent variable for additional analyses. Correlations will be conducted to examine the relationship between OCC and age, as well as between OCC and observer\u2019s self-report (for both accuracy and attention). T-tests will also be conducted to examine the differences between OCC accuracy and attention across male and female children.\n", "outliers": "Participants whose first language is not English will be excluded from the analysis. For all measures, outliers greater than three standard deviations above or below the mean will be removed. If missing data for a given participant is greater than 75%, this participant\u2019s data will be excluded. Otherwise, missing data will be imputed.\n\nAll children will be asked to report whether they feel like a boy or a girl to determine sex. A third option will also be presented (Other/Not Sure/I Don\u2019t Know). Carers will also be asked the child\u2019s biological sex at birth. Any child who chooses the third option, or any child whose gender identity differs from the sex at birth reported by their carer, will be excluded from the analyses, given that atypical gender identity could be a confounding factor for all analyses related to sex. \n", "dependent": "The key variables of interest include:\n\nParent self-reported interoceptive accuracy: This will be measured using the Interoceptive Accuracy Scale (IAS; Appendix A), which is a recently developed measure of self-reported interoceptive accuracy (Murphy et al., 2020). The IAS requires participants to rate their accuracy in perceiving a range of body signals (e.g. \u201cI can always accurately perceive when I need to urinate\u201d).  The IAS contains 21 items rated on a scale from Strongly Agree (5) to Strongly Disagree (1). The range of scores is from 21-105, and higher scores indicate greater perceived interoceptive accuracy. Items in the scale are included based on either being related to typical sensations which have been described as interoceptive, or give rise to insula activation in the brain which is associated with interoceptive signal processing (Murphy et al., 2019).\n\nParent self-reported interoceptive attention: This will be measured using the awareness subscale of the Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ; Porges, 1993; Appendix B). This scale has 45 items with answers on a five-point ordinal scale ranging from Never (1) to Always (5) and requires participants to rate their tendency to be aware of (notice) different body sensations (e.g. \u201cMost of the time I am aware of my mouth being dry\u201d).\n\nCSR interoceptive attention: This will be measured using the simplified awareness subscale of the BPQ, adapted for children (Appendix C). This scale has 39 items with answers on a five-point ordinal scale ranging from Never (1) to Always (5). This scale was originally adapted for children by Palser, Fotopoulou, Pellicano and Kilner (2018). However, the present research will use more recent version which made minor edits to the adapted version for additional clarity (Barker et al., 2019).\n\nCSR self-reported interoceptive accuracy: This will be measured using the child adaptation of the IAS (Barker et al., 2019; Appendix D). \n\nObserver report of child interoceptive attention: Observer report of interoceptive attention will be measured using a modified version of the awareness subscale of the BPQ (Appendix E). This version has been reworded so the questions are related to the perception of another person, rather than the individual completing the questionnaire (e.g. \u201cMost of the time they are aware of their mouth being dry,\u201d rather than \u201cMost of the time I am aware of my mouth being dry.\u201d). Additional instructions for the observer have been included to avoid potential ambiguity regarding how to answer the questions.  \n\nObserver report of child interoceptive accuracy: Observer report of interoceptive attention will be measured using a modified version of the IAS (Appendix F). As above, this version has been reworded so the questions are related to the perception of another person, rather than the individual completing the questionnaire (e.g.  \u201cThey are always correct at feeling when they are hungry,\u201d rather than \u201cI am always correct at feeling when I am hungry.\u201d) Additional instructions for the observer have been included to avoid potential ambiguity regarding how to answer the questions.  \n\nAdditional Demographic Information\nA list of additional questions that participants will be asked can be found in Appendix G. These questions will be asked to obtain information relevant to our exclusion criteria (first language and atypical gender identity) as well as the primary and secondary analyses (sex, age and observer relationship to the child.\n", "conditions": "The study will have a correlational design, whereby child reports will be correlated with their respective parent reports. All participants will complete all measures designed for their age group.", "hypothesis": "Previous research has suggested that interoception, defined as the perception and awareness of one\u2019s own internal state, may be implicated in the development of a range of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. Eggart, Lange, Binser, Queri, &amp; M\u00fcller-Oerlinghausen, 2019; Khalsa et al., 2018; Murphy, Brewer, Catmur, &amp; Bird, 2017; Pang et al., 2019). Because of this, it is crucial to form an in-depth understanding of how, when and why atypical interoception occurs. Since this understanding relies on the accurate and reliable measurement of interoceptive abilities, it is important that measures are validated for use across a range of ages and cognitive abilities. While valid objective measures of interoceptive accuracy and attention should be the gold standard, existing objective measures have a number of limitations (Murphy, Brewer, Coll et al., 2019; Murphy, Brewer, Hobson, Catmur, &amp; Bird, 2018; Ring, Brener, Knapp, &amp; Mailloux, 2015) and are often too time-consuming for developmental studies. Self-report measures assessing both accuracy (Murphy et al., 2020) and attention (e.g. Porges, 1993) are available for use in adults, and we are currently investigating their validity in a child and adolescent sample by assessing relationships between these interoception measures and individual difference measures known to be associated with them in adulthood (Barker, Brewer, Murphy, Viding, &amp; Bird, 2019). It is also necessary to determine whether observers can reliably report on the interoceptive abilities of children. This will not only determine whether parents could report on child abilities where children are unable to unable to communicate or complete the questionnaires themselves, but also serve as an additional validation of the child self-report scales.\n\nThe aim of this research is to test the suitability of parent/guardian report questionnaires (referred to from now on as observer report) to assess the interoceptive accuracy and attention of typical, healthy children aged 6-18 years. By comparing the similarities between observer report and child self-report (CSR) on measures of interoceptive accuracy and attention, we hope to establish whether observer report alone is sufficient to obtain information about the child\u2019s interoceptive abilities. If observer report can reliably predict CSR scores, this would support the use of observer report where necessary. Alternatively, if correlations between these measures are not strong, future work can determine which of these measures best predicts objective measures of interoceptive abilities, through association with objective measures. Furthermore, this research will measure the observer\u2019s self-report of their own interoceptive accuracy and attention in order to examine whether this affects the correlations between observer report and CSR. If an observer reports personal difficulties with interoceptive accuracy and/or attention, this may limit the extent to which they can accurately perceive this ability in others (either due to observer\u2019s own interoceptive difficulties making identification of others\u2019 interoceptive states difficult, or observer\u2019s low insight into interoceptive difficulties). The former may be analogous to difficulties recognising others\u2019 emotions in those with alexithymia, who struggle to perceive and identify their own emotions (Grynberg et al., 2012). If the factors underlying atypical interoception also underlie the recognition of interoceptive states in others, it is essential to take the interoceptive abilities of an observer into account when considering the use of observer report in future research.\n\nIf observer reports can reliably predict CSR scores in healthy children, future use of these measures may provide additional information about the level of interoceptive insight present in those with mental health conditions associated with atypical interoception (e.g. large discrepancies between observer report and CSR for interoceptive accuracy may suggest the child has a low level of interoceptive insight for accuracy, especially if multiple observer measures correlate well). Since lack of insight may be an important factor in the development of some health conditions (rather than atypical accuracy or attention per se), this would be a valuable measure to develop and apply in future research. \n\nObservers should ideally be the child\u2019s primary care-giver. However, if the primary care-giver is not available, any parent or guardian who knows the child well will be invited to complete the observer questionnaires. All observers will be asked to report their relationship to the child, in terms of biological relationship and caring role.\n", "study_type": "Experiment"}, "subjects": [[{"id":

Banissy"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "The following predictions relating to individual variability in attitudes towards touch are made for a UK adult sample, who do not report experience of long-term health conditions or impairments:\n\n1)\tBased on prior research identifying a correlation between age and attitudes to social touch, we predict that older adults will express more positive attitudes towards touch than younger adults, as measured on the Social Touch Questionnaire (STQ; Wilhem et al) and the Touch Experiences and Attitudes Questionnaire (TEAQ; Trotter et al., 2018). Note, prior work did not find associations between scores on the TEAQ and age, but the broader literature would suggest a relationship will be likely, and therefore we predict this effect. \n\n2)\tFollowing prior research identifying gender differences in attitudes to/experiences of touch (Trotter et al., 2018), we predict that females will report more positive attitudes towards touch than males, as measured on the STQ and the TEAQ, with the exception of items relating to intimate forms of touch, where gender differences have not been reported previously.\n\n3)\tPrevious research has demonstrated that trait agreeableness and openness to experience are associated with differences in touch attitudes/experiences (e.g. Dorros et al. 2008). We predict that higher trait agreeableness, and higher openness to experience will both be associated with more positive attitudes towards touch on the STQ and the TEAQ. Based on previous work, we predict to see associations between agreeableness and all touch attitude items, but for openness to experience this relationship is predicted only for items relating to non-intimate forms of touch. Trait extraversion has also been linked to increased somatosensory cortical activity in response to touch. We therefore predict to see differences in attitudes to touch in relation to trait extraversion. Given that extraverted individuals are more motivated to engage in social contact (Wilt &amp; Revelle, 2009), we predict that high extraversion will be associated with more positive attitudes to touch on the STQ and the TEAQ. Specifically, we predict to see associations for items pertaining to social forms of touch.\n\n4)\tAnxious attachment in relationships has previously been linked to increased effectiveness of pleasant (C-tactile afferent) touch in reducing pain; while avoidant attachment is associated with reduced effectiveness of pleasant touch in pain reduction (Krah\u00e9 et al., 2018). Avoidant attachment has also been linked to reduced enjoyment of social interaction with a romantic partner. We predict that a more avoidant attachment style will be associated with less positive attitudes towards touch on the STQ and TEAQ. We predict that a more anxious attachment style will be associated with more positive attitudes towards touch, and specifically that the largest effect sizes will be observed for subscales related to intimate touch, which refer to stroking or caressing (i.e. C-T optimal touch).\n\n5)\tPrior work has shown that interoceptive awareness is associated with differences in the perceived pleasantness of touch (Crucianelli et al., 2018). Additionally, it has been argued that pleasant (C-tactile afferent) touch should be considered a form of interoception, due to shared anatomical pathways with other aspects of interoceptive processing (Bj\u00f6rnsdotter, Morrison &amp; Olausson, 2010; Craig, 2003). Disorders of body image have also been linked to poor interoceptive accuracy (Pollatos et al., 2008). We therefore predict to see more positive touch attitudes on the STQ and the TEAQ for individuals with greater interoceptive accuracy. Specifically, we predict an association with items relating to intimate touch, which refer to stroking or caressing.\n\n6)\tBased on previous work identifying an association between body image and comfort with physical touch (Orbach &amp; Mikulincer, 1998), greater body acceptance is predicted to be associated with more positive attitudes towards touch on the STQ and the TEAQ, across all items.\n\nThe hypotheses above relating to age, gender, personality, attachment style, interoceptive awareness and body acceptance are made for a UK adult sample. However, prior research has identified geographical differences in social touch behaviour. We predict that individual differences in touch attitudes will also differ between groups of participants based in different countries. Our survey is available worldwide, and based on prior surveys of this type that have been conducted by the BBC and Wellcome Collection, we envisage suitable sample sizes are likely in additional European and North American countries. However, as an opportunity sampling method is being used, we will not know the location of all participants until the study closes. As such, while we expect to see variation in the factors predicting touch attitudes across different countries, we refrain from making specific directional hypotheses at this time.\n\nAdditional groups of interest in relation to individual differences in touch attitudes include participants with autism spectrum conditions, and visual or mobility impairments. These analyses will likely form a separate paper, depending upon the sample of size of participants recruited who report these conditions. Further details on this analysis will be registered as an additional subproject once sample sizes have been ascertained after the data collection is completed and accessed (this is because we will not know participant numbers in each group until the survey is finished)."}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

Comparisons will be made with ANOVA or non-parametric alternative (e.g. permutation tests). For these between-group comparisons linked to Covid-19, groups will be compared to check for any differences in control variables of interest (based on existing prior literature), including age, gender, openness to experience, agreeableness, and attachment style. If groupings differ in these variables (e.g. age, gender), these factors will be controlled for by conducting ANCOVA or by adding relevant factors as main effects in ANOVA analyses. Any main effects in the ANOVA will be followed up with Bonferroni corrected pair-wise comparisons. The grouping analysis linked to Covid-19 will likely form a separate paper with potential to additionally focus on geographical differences depending upon the sample of size of participants recruited from a specific country or sub-region (e.g. regional differences within the UK).

Banissy", "q2": "The following predictions relating to individual variability in attitudes towards touch are made for a UK adult sample, who do not report experience of long-term health conditions or impairments:\n\n1)\tBased on prior research identifying a correlation between age and attitudes to social touch, we predict that older adults will express more positive attitudes towards touch than younger adults, as measured on the Social Touch Questionnaire (STQ; Wilhem et al) and the Touch Experiences and Attitudes Questionnaire (TEAQ; Trotter et al., 2018). Note, prior work did not find associations between scores on the TEAQ and age, but the broader literature would suggest a relationship will be likely, and therefore we predict this effect. \n\n2)\tFollowing prior research identifying gender differences in attitudes to/experiences of touch (Trotter et al., 2018), we predict that females will report more positive attitudes towards touch than males, as measured on the STQ and the TEAQ, with the exception of items relating to intimate forms of touch, where gender differences have not been reported previously.\n\n3)\tPrevious research has demonstrated that trait agreeableness and openness to experience are associated with differences in touch attitudes/experiences (e.g. Dorros et al. 2008). We predict that higher trait agreeableness, and higher openness to experience will both be associated with more positive attitudes towards touch on the STQ and the TEAQ. Based on previous work, we predict to see associations between agreeableness and all touch attitude items, but for openness to experience this relationship is predicted only for items relating to non-intimate forms of touch. Trait extraversion has also been linked to increased somatosensory cortical activity in response to touch. We therefore predict to see differences in attitudes to touch in relation to trait extraversion. Given that extraverted individuals are more motivated to engage in social contact (Wilt &amp; Revelle, 2009), we predict that high extraversion will be associated with more positive attitudes to touch on the STQ and the TEAQ. Specifically, we predict to see associations for items pertaining to social forms of touch.\n\n4)\tAnxious attachment in relationships has previously been linked to increased effectiveness of pleasant (C-tactile afferent) touch in reducing pain; while avoidant attachment is associated with reduced effectiveness of pleasant touch in pain reduction (Krah\u00e9 et al., 2018). Avoidant attachment has also been linked to reduced enjoyment of social interaction with a romantic partner. We predict that a more avoidant attachment style will be associated with less positive attitudes towards touch on the STQ and TEAQ. We predict that a more anxious attachment style will be associated with more positive attitudes towards touch, and specifically that the largest effect sizes will be observed for subscales related to intimate touch, which refer to stroking or caressing (i.e. C-T optimal touch).\n\n5)\tPrior work has shown that interoceptive awareness is associated with differences in the perceived pleasantness of touch (Crucianelli et al., 2018). Additionally, it has been argued that pleasant (C-tactile afferent) touch should be considered a form of interoception, due to shared anatomical pathways with other aspects of interoceptive processing (Bj\u00f6rnsdotter, Morrison &amp; Olausson, 2010; Craig, 2003). Disorders of body image have also been linked to poor interoceptive accuracy (Pollatos et al., 2008). We therefore predict to see more positive touch attitudes on the STQ and the TEAQ for individuals with greater interoceptive accuracy. Specifically, we predict an association with items relating to intimate touch, which refer to stroking or caressing.\n\n6)\tBased on previous work identifying an association between body image and comfort with physical touch (Orbach &amp; Mikulincer, 1998), greater body acceptance is predicted to be associated with more positive attitudes towards touch on the STQ and the TEAQ, across all items.\n\nThe hypotheses above relating to age, gender, personality, attachment style, interoceptive awareness and body acceptance are made for a UK adult sample.

Analyses 1-5 will be carried out on a typical adult sample who currently reside in the UK, and indicate on the survey that \u201cI do not have any disability, long-term condition or impairment\u201d.\n\n1)\t Analysis of the factor structure underlying the STQ and the TEAQ in our sample, using factor analysis. This will likely form a stand-alone paper.\n\nConfirmatory factor analysis will be used to examine the STQ, to confirm a previously reported three-factor structure in our sample.\n\nExploratory factor analysis will be used to examine the TEAQ, given that this is a relatively new measure, and that the current survey used only 12 items (the two highest loading items on each of six subscales) from the full 57-item scale.\n\nIn addition, we will run an exploratory factor analysis on the 39 items from the STQ and TEAQ combined, to identify common latent variables underlying the two measures of touch attitudes.\n\n2)\tAnalysis of the reliability of responses on the STQ and the TEAQ. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha statistic will be calculated as a measure of internal consistency on these scales.\n\n3)\tAnalysis of the convergent validity of touch attitude scales. To examine this we will run Pearson\u2019s correlation analyses to identify the relation between the STQ and the TEAQ. Since both scales are intended to measure similar constructs, scores are expected to correlate with one another.\n\n4)\tAnalysis of individual differences associated with attitudes towards touch. This will likely form another stand-alone paper.\n\nThe following continuous variables will be correlated with STQ and TEAQ scores:\n\nAge\nGender\nPersonality traits (Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Neuroticism)\nAttachment (Anxious, Avoidant)\nInteroceptive Awareness\nBody Acceptance\nDay of completion or week of completion depending on number of survey respondents (to be defined after data is accessed). \nDo you think that touch plays an important role in your work?\n\nFor significant correlations (defined as p &lt;.005), data will be entered into regression analyses to test the relative contribution of a given predictor variable, while controlling for: age, gender, study completion date, and other significant correlates.\n\n5)\tAnalysis of the impact of Covid-19 on touch attitudes. This will likely form another stand-alone paper.\n\nThe data for this project have been collected during a period of escalating concern over Covid-19, which is likely to have changed participants attitudes towards social touch. We address this above by including the day/week of survey completion as a predictor variable in our regression analyses above, to examine how touch attitudes might have changed as the risk associated with social touch increased. \n\nIn addition, we also propose to examine how attitudes towards vary as a function of time points in geographical regions by comparing attitudes towards touch responses before ten cases of Covid-19 and after ten cases of Covid-19 in a given region of interest (e.g. in England \u2013 before 24/02/20 versus after 24/02/20 based on cases reported by Public Health England). Comparisons will be made with ANOVA or non-parametric alternative (e.g. permutation tests). For these between-group comparisons linked to Covid-19, groups will be compared to check for any differences in control variables of interest (based on existing prior literature), including age, gender, openness to experience, agreeableness, and attachment style. If groupings differ in these variables (e.g. age, gender), these factors will be controlled for by conducting ANCOVA or by adding relevant factors as main effects in ANOVA analyses. Any main effects in the ANOVA will be followed up with Bonferroni corrected pair-wise comparisons. The grouping analysis linked to Covid-19 will likely form a separate paper with potential to additionally focus on geographical differences depending upon the sample of size of participants recruited from a specific country or sub-region (e.g. regional differences within the UK). Further details on any country specific analysis outside of the UK will be registered as an additional subproject once sample sizes have been ascertained after the data collection is completed and accessed (this is because we will not know the proportion of people from different geographical regions who have completed the survey at different time points until the survey is finished).\n\n6)\tAnalysis of individual differences in touch attitudes worldwide.\n\nAt a minimum we will conduct our analyses above on participants from the UK. Where possible we will also explore additional European and North American countries, where suitable sample sizes (minimum 240 participants) can be collected. In this case, Analysis 4 will be repeated for these countries. Following these analyses, Fisher\u2019s R to Z transformations will be carried out to examine whether relationships between individual difference factors and touch attitudes differ between these groups and the UK sample. These may form separate papers or be combined with our approaches outlined above.", "q17.uploader": []}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecac48", "text": "Social and Behavioral Sciences"}]]}, "relationships": {"license": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a", "type": "licenses"}}, "children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=2xgny", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "2xgny", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "2xgny", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/hcrva/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "hcrva", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tx8h9/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "tx8h9", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5e795fc0d2833800195735d0/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5e795fc0d2833800195735d0", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/2xgny/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/2xgny/"}}, {"id": "z6jex", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "The status of semantic memory in MTL amnesia varies with demands on scene construction", "description": "To investigate whether semantic memory impairments in MTL amnesia can be understood with reference to a deficit in scene construction, the current study examined knowledge of scripts that vary in the extent to which they play out in a scene context in nine patients with MTL amnesia and eighteen healthy control subjects.  Scripts are routine activities characterized by an ordered set of actions, including some that are essential for completing the activity. Comparing performance on scene-based scripts (e.g., buying groceries at the grocery store) and object-based scripts (e.g., addressing a letter), we found that patients generated the same number of total action steps as controls for both types of script, but patients were selectively impaired at generating essential actions steps for scene-based scripts.  Furthermore, patients made more sequencing and idiosyncratic errors than controls in the scene-based, but not in the object-based, scripts.  These findings demonstrate that the hippocampus plays a critical role in the retrieval of semantic knowledge about everyday activities when such retrieval entails scene construction.
