Book ownership will be measured as one student-specific measure of treatment uptake, and will answer the question: To what extent is the program causing an increase in home-based book ownership among treatment students relative to control students? This question can be answered based on a National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) item: \u201cSome homes have 0 books while others have more than 50 books for kids. About how many books for kids do you have at home?\u201d  \nA scale to assess reading amount is adapted from Schaffner, Schiefele, and Ulferts (2013) from Becker et al.\u2019s (2010) questionnaire. In accordance with Becker et al., the Schaffner et al. (2013) scale includes two items referring to reading frequency and one item capturing reading length. To assess reading frequency, the students will be asked how many books they read in their spare time (1 = 0 books, 2 = 1\u20135 books, 3 = 6\u201310 books, 4 = 11\u201320 books, 5 = more than 20 books) and how often they read in their spare time (1 = about once a month, 2 = about once a week, 3 = several times a week, 4 = daily, 5 = several times a day). Reading length will be addressed by asking the students how long they usually read a book without taking a break (1 = 5 minutes, 2 = 15 minutes, 3 = 30 minutes, 4 = 60 minutes, 5 = more than 60 minutes). The scale refers only to reading for enjoyment because this aspect of reading amount is more strongly related to reading motivation and reading comprehension than reading for school (Cox &amp; Guthrie, 2001; Wang &amp; Guthrie, 2004). Statistically significant correlations with aspects of the home literacy environment (e.g., number of books at home) and with intrinsic (but not extrinsic) reading motivation (Schaffner et al., 2013) support the validity of this scale.\n\nThe measure of attitudes toward recreational reading will draw on the classic Elementary Reading Attitude Survey (ERAS) developed by McKenna and Kear (1990). We will use the 10-item recreational reading scale, which focuses on reading for fun outside of the school setting. Each item on the ERAS asks how children feel about a specific recreational reading activity. Children respond to each question by circling one of four cartoon-style Garfield cats whose facial expressions range from very happy to very unhappy. This scale includes items such as: \u201cHow do you feel about getting a book for a present?\u201d and \u201cHow do you feel about reading for fun at home?\u201d McKenna and Kear (1990) administered the survey to 18,138 students in Grades 1 to 6 in 95 school districts throughout 38 states, and the internal reliability coefficient was .82 for the recreational subscale. \n\nFinally, to supplement the scale of reading volume, children will also be administered questions asking how often they engaged in a series of literacy activities at home. The 10-item Literacy Habits Survey (Paris et al., 2004) has been used with beginning readers from kindergarten to third grade in previous studies, and yielded an internal reliability coefficient of .76 in a recent study by Kim (2007).

Their overall purpose is to test whether people are motivated to verify as well as to enhance their facial identity, and to what extent they are motivated to do one versus the other. The motive to self-enhance is presumed to be captured by striving for facial attractiveness: having an attractive face affords a positive evaluation whereas having an unattractive face affords a negative evaluation. The motive to self-verify is presumed to be captured by striving for facial familiarity: having a familiar face affords a sense that one's life and world are predictable, controllable, and coherent whereas having an unfamiliar face affords a sense that they are not. \n\nStudy 2 has participants to engage in two main tasks. \n\nFirst, participants envisage ways their face might look, and provide desirability ratings for these possibilities (Face Desirability Ratings). In particular, they imagine four distinct ways their face might look, and thereafter to indicate how much they ideally want their face to look like this. These four ways orthogonalize levels of attractiveness and familiarity. In the Absolute Condition, these four ways are: (a) Entirely Familiar &amp; Amazingly Attractive; (b) Entirely Familiar &amp; Hideously Unattractive; (c) Altogether Unfamiliar &amp; Amazingly Attractive; and (d) Altogether Unfamiliar &amp; Hideously Unattractive. In the Relative Condition, these four ways are: (a*) Entirely Familiar &amp; Amazingly Attractive; (e) Entirely Familiar &amp; As Attractive As It Is Now; (c*) Altogether Unfamiliar &amp; Amazingly Attractive; and (f) Altogether Unfamiliar &amp; As Attractive As it Is Now. (*=identical)\n\nSecond, participants envisage ways their face might look, and estimate the psychological effects of these possibilities being true (Face Effect Ratings). In particular, they imagine four distinct ways their face might look, and thereafter to indicate, via three separate ratings, how they would feel about their ability to \"X\" their world and life, where \"X\" is, respectively, \"predict\", \"control\", and\"make sense of\". The four distinct ways correspond to those for the desirability ratings, in the Absolute Condition and the Relative Condition. \n\nThe purpose of having two versions, with different ranges for attractiveness, is take account of the fact that the logical zero-point of facial self-enhancement (Hideously Unattractive) may not be psychologically relevant zero-point, which is liable to be shifted in the direction of the status quo point (As Attractive As It Is Now), but whose exactly location is difficult to determine. However, the psychologically relevant zero-point is likely to lie somewhere in the interval between the logical zero-point and status quo point, such that the results of both versions of the study, pertaining to the interval extremes, will enable stronger conclusions to be drawn and more informed estimates of relative self-motive strength to be made. A similar distinction in other studies in the series.\n\nIn addition, participants are asked to indicate, at the beginning of the study, the extent to which they perceive their face to be attractive and familiar, and the extent to which they desire for their face to be attractive and familiar. These perceptions and desires can themselves serve as straightforward indications of how people think they stand in terms of these identity-relevant facial characteristics, and how much they want to facially self-enhance and self-verify in both an absolute sense and a relative sense. In addition, these perceptions and desires are liable to moderate the magnitude of the other findings. "}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypothesis 0 (H0)--so dubbed as it regarded as near self-evident--is that people will strive to enhance their facial identity.\n\nHypothesis 1 (H1) is that people will strive to verify their facial identity.\n\nHypothesis 2 (H2) is that people will strive to enhance their facial identity more than they strive to verify it.\n\nThese three hypotheses yield several predictions.\n\nFIRST: As regards the extent to which participants' initial self-reported desire for their face to be attractive and familiar, we predict that they will want it to be more attractive than not (H0), and more familiar than not (H1), but also to want the former more than they want the latter (H2).\n\n(Moderation: We predict that this will also be the case even when perceptions of facial attractiveness and familiarity are controlled for. In this regard, we do not predict any definite simple correlation between the perception of one's facial attractiveness and the desire to be facially attractive: although a deficiency of facial attractiveness might amplify desire for its improvement, it might also promote a downgrading of facial attractiveness, leading to a \"draw\". As for the correlation between facial familiarity and desire for facial familiarity, a lack of variation in the former case is liable to constrain correlations to the point of uninformativeness.)\n\n(Ancillary: We predict that perceptions of attractiveness will be above the midpoint of the scale*, and, fairly trivially, that perceptions of familiarity will also be above the midpoint of the scale. We also predict, again fairly trivially, that perceptions of familiarity will be higher than perceptions of attractiveness. By default, most faces are surely nearly maximal in familiarity; but the motive to self-enhance is unlikely to be strong enough to convince nearly everyone that they are nearly maximal in attractiveness.)\n\n*Note: We make this prediction more tentatively, as it reflects actual as opposed to ideal self-perceptions.\n\n-------\n\nNext, for both Face Desirability Ratings and Face Effect Ratings--and in both the Absolute Version and the Relative Version of the study--we make predictions (i) within each of the four conditions, and (ii) between those four conditions, taking the form of simple or competitive self-enhancing effects (involving attractiveness) and self-verifying effects (involving familiarity).\n\nSECOND: Face Desirability Ratings\n\n--Between-condition predictions\n\nIn terms of Face Desirability Ratings, we predict: \n\nAn overall effect of attractiveness (H0), such that faces that are Amazingly Attractive are more desired than faces that are Hideously Unattractive (Absolute Version) or As They Are Now (Relative Version).\n\nAn overall effect of familiarity (H1), such that faces that are Entirely Familiar are more desired than faces that are Altogether Unfamiliar (Absolute &amp; Relative Versions).\n\nThe above overall effect of attractiveness will exceed the above overall effect of familiarity (H2)\n\nWe also predict that, at each of the two levels of familiarity, there will be effect of attractiveness (H0), and that at each of the two levels of attractiveness, there will be an effect of familiarity (H1). Specifically, we predict that, for the conditions labelled above, in the  Absolute Version &amp; Relative Version alike, the following differences will obtain:\n\nH0: (a) &gt; (b), (c) &gt; (d); (a) &gt; (e), (c) &gt; (f)\nH1: (a) &gt; (c), (b) &gt; (d); (e) &gt; (f)\n\nWe also predict that, in conditions pitting attractiveness against familiarity, the former will prevail, in the Absolute Version &amp; Relative Version alike:\n\nH2: (c) &gt; (b) and (c) &gt; (e)\n\n(Ancillary: We predict a further interactive effect, which is independent of our main hypotheses. It is that the effect of attractiveness will be stronger for familiar faces [or equivalently that the effect of familiarity will be stronger for attractive faces]. We make this prediction because, in addition to familiarity and attractiveness being desiderata in themselves, having a familiar face is liable to increase the self-relevance of having an attractive or unattractive face, and having an unfamiliar face is liable to decrease the self-relevance of having it, because one is rendered, respectively, more or less recognizable as oneself.)\n\n--Within-condition predictions:\n\nWe predict that participants WILL generally desire the following facial outcomes, more than they do not desire them:\n\n(a) Entirely Familiar &amp; Amazingly Attractive (consistent with H0 and H1)\n(e) Entirely Familiar &amp; As Attractive As It Is Now (consistent with H0 and H1) *\n\n*Note: We make this prediction more tentatively, as it depends on actual as opposed to ideal self-perceptions.\n\nIn addition, we predict that participants will generally NOT desire the following facial outcomes, more than they do desire them\n\n(b) Entirely Familiar &amp; Hideously Unattractive (supportive of H0 and H2)\n(c) Altogether Unfamiliar &amp; Amazingly Attractive (supportive of H1, and perhaps undermining of H2)\n\n(d) Altogether Unfamiliar &amp; Hideously Unattractive  (consistent with H0 and H1)\n(f) Altogether Unfamiliar &amp; As Attractive As it Is Now  (consistent with H0 and perhaps undermining of H2)\n\n(Moderation 1: We predict that any advantage for self-enhancing strivings above will be more apparent in the Absolute condition, where the facial attractiveness modification range is wider, than in the Relative condition, where the facial attractiveness modification range is smaller. If H2 is falsified, then it is more likely to be falsified in the Relative Condition than in the Absolute Condition, or to be more strongly falsified in the Relative Condition than in the Absolute Condition.)\n\n(Moderation 2: We predict that that the balance of self-enhancing strivings versus self-verification strivings, in the direction of the former, will be positively related to participant's self-reported desires for their face to be attractive, and negatively related to their self-reported desires for their face to be familiar.)\n\n(Moderation 3: We predict that self-enhancing strivings will be stronger (i) in women and (ii) in younger people, with such factors possibly combining synergistically. This is because, for evolutionary and lifespan reasons respectively, facial attractiveness has greater normative value for women and younger people. )\n\nTHIRD: Face Effect Ratings\n\nIn general, our predictions for Face Effect Ratings generally parallel for Face Desirability Ratings. To save space, they will not be reiterated.\n\nNote, however, two important points.\n\nFirst, there are three Face Effect Ratings for each predicted effect. These ratings are liable to be highly internally consistent, and a composite index thereof--referred to as \"tractability\", the degree to which people feel they are able to get a \"handle\" (i.e., gain \"traction\") on their life and world, by feeling it to be predictable, controllable, and coherent--will be derived. The three ratings will also be analyzed separately, but the same predictions are made in respect of all of them, and no predictions are made about differences in relative magnitude.\n\nSecond, the self-verification perspective holds that verification strivings are ultimately in the service of augmenting or maintain a sense of tractability. However, the possibility also arises, for several reasons, that self-enhancement strivings might do the same (e.g., the illusion of control is touted as one of the main examples of self-enhancement bias). However, the hypothesis that self-enhancement strivings, when satisfied, augment feelings of tractability even more than self-verification strivings, when satisfied, is perhaps surprising, given the existing view that the motives to self-enhance and self-verify compete, and that the latter sometimes dominate the former precisely in order to shore up feelings of tractability.\n\n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Other"}, "q6": {"extra": [], "value": ["For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to which they have been assigned.", "Personnel who interact directly with the study subjects (either human or non-human subjects) will not be aware of the assigned treatments.

Their overall purpose is to test whether people are motivated to verify as well as to enhance their facial identity, and to what extent they are motivated to do one versus the other.

(*=identical)\n\nSecond, participants envisage ways their face might look, and estimate the psychological effects of these possibilities being true (Face Effect Ratings). In particular, they imagine four distinct ways their face might look, and thereafter to indicate, via three separate ratings, how they would feel about their ability to \"X\" their world and life, where \"X\" is, respectively, \"predict\", \"control\", and\"make sense of\". The four distinct ways correspond to those for the desirability ratings, in the Absolute Condition and the Relative Condition. \n\nThe purpose of having two versions, with different ranges for attractiveness, is take account of the fact that the logical zero-point of facial self-enhancement (Hideously Unattractive) may not be psychologically relevant zero-point, which is liable to be shifted in the direction of the status quo point (As Attractive As It Is Now), but whose exactly location is difficult to determine. However, the psychologically relevant zero-point is likely to lie somewhere in the interval between the logical zero-point and status quo point, such that the results of both versions of the study, pertaining to the interval extremes, will enable stronger conclusions to be drawn and more informed estimates of relative self-motive strength to be made. A similar distinction in other studies in the series.\n\nIn addition, participants are asked to indicate, at the beginning of the study, the extent to which they perceive their face to be attractive and familiar, and the extent to which they desire for their face to be attractive and familiar. These perceptions and desires can themselves serve as straightforward indications of how people think they stand in terms of these identity-relevant facial characteristics, and how much they want to facially self-enhance and self-verify in both an absolute sense and a relative sense. In addition, these perceptions and desires are liable to moderate the magnitude of the other findings. ", "q4": "Hypothesis 0 (H0)--so dubbed as it regarded as near self-evident--is that people will strive to enhance their facial identity.\n\nHypothesis 1 (H1) is that people will strive to verify their facial identity.\n\nHypothesis 2 (H2) is that people will strive to enhance their facial identity more than they strive to verify it.\n\nThese three hypotheses yield several predictions.\n\nFIRST: As regards the extent to which participants' initial self-reported desire for their face to be attractive and familiar, we predict that they will want it to be more attractive than not (H0), and more familiar than not (H1), but also to want the former more than they want the latter (H2).\n\n(Moderation: We predict that this will also be the case even when perceptions of facial attractiveness and familiarity are controlled for. In this regard, we do not predict any definite simple correlation between the perception of one's facial attractiveness and the desire to be facially attractive: although a deficiency of facial attractiveness might amplify desire for its improvement, it might also promote a downgrading of facial attractiveness, leading to a \"draw\". As for the correlation between facial familiarity and desire for facial familiarity, a lack of variation in the former case is liable to constrain correlations to the point of uninformativeness.)\n\n(Ancillary: We predict that perceptions of attractiveness will be above the midpoint of the scale*, and, fairly trivially, that perceptions of familiarity will also be above the midpoint of the scale. We also predict, again fairly trivially, that perceptions of familiarity will be higher than perceptions of attractiveness. By default, most faces are surely nearly maximal in familiarity; but the motive to self-enhance is unlikely to be strong enough to convince nearly everyone that they are nearly maximal in attractiveness.)\n\n*Note: We make this prediction more tentatively, as it reflects actual as opposed to ideal self-perceptions.\n\n-------\n\nNext, for both Face Desirability Ratings and Face Effect Ratings--and in both the Absolute Version and the Relative Version of the study--we make predictions (i) within each of the four conditions, and (ii) between those four conditions, taking the form of simple or competitive self-enhancing effects (involving attractiveness) and self-verifying effects (involving familiarity).\n\nSECOND: Face Desirability Ratings\n\n--Between-condition predictions\n\nIn terms of Face Desirability Ratings, we predict: \n\nAn overall effect of attractiveness (H0), such that faces that are Amazingly Attractive are more desired than faces that are Hideously Unattractive (Absolute Version) or As They Are Now (Relative Version).\n\nAn overall effect of familiarity (H1), such that faces that are Entirely Familiar are more desired than faces that are Altogether Unfamiliar (Absolute &amp; Relative Versions).\n\nThe above overall effect of attractiveness will exceed the above overall effect of familiarity (H2)\n\nWe also predict that, at each of the two levels of familiarity, there will be effect of attractiveness (H0), and that at each of the two levels of attractiveness, there will be an effect of familiarity (H1). Specifically, we predict that, for the conditions labelled above, in the  Absolute Version &amp; Relative Version alike, the following differences will obtain:\n\nH0: (a) &gt; (b), (c) &gt; (d); (a) &gt; (e), (c) &gt; (f)\nH1: (a) &gt; (c), (b) &gt; (d); (e) &gt; (f)\n\nWe also predict that, in conditions pitting attractiveness against familiarity, the former will prevail, in the Absolute Version &amp; Relative Version alike:\n\nH2: (c) &gt; (b) and (c) &gt; (e)\n\n(Ancillary: We predict a further interactive effect, which is independent of our main hypotheses. It is that the effect of attractiveness will be stronger for familiar faces [or equivalently that the effect of familiarity will be stronger for attractive faces]. We make this prediction because, in addition to familiarity and attractiveness being desiderata in themselves, having a familiar face is liable to increase the self-relevance of having an attractive or unattractive face, and having an unfamiliar face is liable to decrease the self-relevance of having it, because one is rendered, respectively, more or less recognizable as oneself.)\n\n--Within-condition predictions:\n\nWe predict that participants WILL generally desire the following facial outcomes, more than they do not desire them:\n\n(a) Entirely Familiar &amp; Amazingly Attractive (consistent with H0 and H1)\n(e) Entirely Familiar &amp; As Attractive As It Is Now (consistent with H0 and H1) *\n\n*Note: We make this prediction more tentatively, as it depends on actual as opposed to ideal self-perceptions.\n\nIn addition, we predict that participants will generally NOT desire the following facial outcomes, more than they do desire them\n\n(b) Entirely Familiar &amp; Hideously Unattractive (supportive of H0 and H2)\n(c) Altogether Unfamiliar &amp; Amazingly Attractive (supportive of H1, and perhaps undermining of H2)\n\n(d) Altogether Unfamiliar &amp; Hideously Unattractive  (consistent with H0 and H1)\n(f) Altogether Unfamiliar &amp; As Attractive As it Is Now  (consistent with H0 and perhaps undermining of H2)\n\n(Moderation 1: We predict that any advantage for self-enhancing strivings above will be more apparent in the Absolute condition, where the facial attractiveness modification range is wider, than in the Relative condition, where the facial attractiveness modification range is smaller. If H2 is falsified, then it is more likely to be falsified in the Relative Condition than in the Absolute Condition, or to be more strongly falsified in the Relative Condition than in the Absolute Condition.)\n\n(Moderation 2: We predict that that the balance of self-enhancing strivings versus self-verification strivings, in the direction of the former, will be positively related to participant's self-reported desires for their face to be attractive, and negatively related to their self-reported desires for their face to be familiar.)\n\n(Moderation 3: We predict that self-enhancing strivings will be stronger (i) in women and (ii) in younger people, with such factors possibly combining synergistically. This is because, for evolutionary and lifespan reasons respectively, facial attractiveness has greater normative value for women and younger people. )\n\nTHIRD: Face Effect Ratings\n\nIn general, our predictions for Face Effect Ratings generally parallel for Face Desirability Ratings. To save space, they will not be reiterated.\n\nNote, however, two important points.\n\nFirst, there are three Face Effect Ratings for each predicted effect. These ratings are liable to be highly internally consistent, and a composite index thereof--referred to as \"tractability\", the degree to which people feel they are able to get a \"handle\" (i.e., gain \"traction\") on their life and world, by feeling it to be predictable, controllable, and coherent--will be derived. The three ratings will also be analyzed separately, but the same predictions are made in respect of all of them, and no predictions are made about differences in relative magnitude.\n\nSecond, the self-verification perspective holds that verification strivings are ultimately in the service of augmenting or maintain a sense of tractability. However, the possibility also arises, for several reasons, that self-enhancement strivings might do the same (e.g., the illusion of control is touted as one of the main examples of self-enhancement bias). However, the hypothesis that self-enhancement strivings, when satisfied, augment feelings of tractability even more than self-verification strivings, when satisfied, is perhaps surprising, given the existing view that the motives to self-enhance and self-verify compete, and that the latter sometimes dominate the former precisely in order to shore up feelings of tractability.\n\n", "q5": "Other", "q6": ["For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to which they have been assigned.", "Personnel who interact directly with the study subjects (either human or non-human subjects) will not be aware of the assigned treatments.

Their overall purpose is to test whether people are motivated to verify as well as to enhance their facial identity, and to what extent they are motivated to do one versus the other. The motive to self-enhance is presumed to be captured by striving for facial attractiveness: having an attractive face affords a positive evaluation whereas having an unattractive face affords a negative evaluation. The motive to self-verify is presumed to be captured by striving for facial familiarity: having a familiar face affords a sense that one's life and world are predictable, controllable,and coherent whereas having an unfamiliar face affords a sense that they are not.\n\nStudy 1 has participants indicate how they would hypothetically modify their face if they were able to, in the following situations: \n\n(a) its attractiveness is fixed (at 100%) but its familiarity can be modified; \n(b) its familiarity is fixed (at 100%) but its attractiveness can be modified; or \n(c) its attractiveness can be modified, but only such that its familiarity varies inversely with any modifications.\n\nIn addition, the study comes in two versions. In both versions, participants can modify the familiarity of their face between being Altogether Unfamiliar (0%) and Entirely Familiar (100%): that is the relevant range. However, whereas in the Absolute version, participants can modify the attractiveness of their face between being Hideously Unattractive (0%) and Amazingly Attractive (100%), in the Relative version, participants can modify the attractiveness of their face between being As It Is Now (0% = status quo) and being Amazingly Attractive (100% *more* attractive). The purpose of having two versions, with different ranges for attractiveness, is take account of the fact that the logical zero-point of facial self-enhancement (Hideously Unattractive) may not be psychologically relevant zero-point, which is liable to be shifted in the direction of the status quo point (As It Is Now), but whose exactly location is difficult to determine. However, the psychologically relevant zero-point is likely to lie somewhere in the interval between the logical zero-point and status quo point, such that the results of both versions of the study, pertaining to the interval extremes, will enable stronger conclusions to be drawn and more informed estimates of relative self-motive strength to be made. \n\nThe Absolute Version of the study features only scenarios (b) and (c) above.\nThe Relative Version of the study features scenarios (a), (b), and (c).\n\nIn addition, participants are asked to indicate, at the beginning of the study, the extent to which they perceive their face to be attractive and familiar, and the extent to which they desire for their face to be attractive and familiar. These perceptions and desires can themselves serve as straightforward indications of how people think they stand in terms of these identity-relevant facial characteristics, and how much they want to facially self-enhance and self-verify in both an absolute sense and a relative sense. In addition, these perceptions and desires are liable to moderate the magnitude of the other findings. "}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypothesis 0 (H0)--so dubbed as it regarded as near self-evident--is that people will strive to enhance their facial identity.\n\nHypothesis 1 (H1) is that people will strive to verify their facial identity. \n\nHypothesis 2 (H2) is that people will strive to enhance their facial identity more than they strive to verify it.\n\nThese three hypotheses yield several predictions.\n\nFIRST: As regards the extent to which participants' initial self-reported desire for their face to be attractive and familiar, we predict that they will want it to be more attractive than not (H0), and more familiar than not (H1), but also to want the former more than they want the latter (H2).\n\n(Moderation: We predict that this will also be the case even when perceptions of facial attractiveness and familiarity are controlled for. In this regard, we do not predict any definite simple correlation between the perception of one's facial attractiveness and the desire to be facially attractive: although a deficiency of facial attractiveness might amplify desire for its improvement, it might also promote a downgrading of facial attractiveness, leading to a \"draw\". As for the correlation between facial familiarity and desire for facial familiarity, a lack of variation in the former case is liable to constrain correlations to the point of uninformativeness.)\n\n(Ancillary: We predict that perceptions of attractiveness will be above the midpoint of the scale*, and, fairly trivially, that perceptions of familiarity will also be above the midpoint of the scale. We also predict, again fairly trivially, that perceptions of familiarity will be higher than perceptions of attractiveness. By default, most faces are surely nearly maximal in familiarity; but the motive to self-enhance is unlikely to be strong enough to convince nearly everyone that they are nearly maximal in attractiveness.)\n\n*Note: We make this prediction more tentatively, as it reflects actual as opposed to ideal self-perceptions.\n\n\nSECOND: in the Absolute Version of the study, we predict that, in Condition (b), participants will move their face closer to being Amazing Attractive than to being Hideously Unattractive, with familiarity held constant at 100% (H0); and in Condition (a), that participants will move their face to be closer to being Entirely Familiar than it is to being Altogether Unfamiliar, with attractiveness being held constant at 100% (H1). In Condition (c), we also predict that participants will move their face closer to being Amazing Attractive than to being Hideously Unattractive (H0). This will demonstrate that, even when antagonized by self-verification strivings (reflected in the trade-off between making their face less familiar as they make it more attractive) self-enhancement strivings persist. At the same time, we predict that facial attractiveness augmentation will be curtailed in Condition (c) relative to Condition (b), thereby demonstrating the operation of self-verification verification strivings over and above self-enhancement strivings. Still, in predicting that participants will move their face closer to being Amazing Attractive than to being Hideously Unattractive, we also predict that self-enhancement strivings will dominate self-verification strivings (H2). Finally, we predict that participants will, in Condition (b), move their face closer to being Amazing Attractive than to being Hideously Unattractive than they will, in Condition (a), move their face to be closer to being Entirely Familiar than it is to being Altogether Unfamiliar. This again would also reflect self-enhancement strivings dominating self-verification strivings (H2). \n\nTHIRD: in the Relative Version of the study, we predict that, in Condition (b), participants will make their face more attractive than As It Is Now (H0). We further predict that they will move their face closer to being Amazing Attractive than to being As It Is Now (H0). In Condition (c), we also predict that participants will make their face more attractive than it is As It Is Now (H0). This will demonstrate that, even when antagonized by self-verification strivings (reflected in the trade-off between making their face less familiar as they make it more attractive) self-enhancement strivings persist. At the same time, we predict that facial attractiveness augmentation will be curtailed in Condition (c) relative to Condition (b), thereby demonstrating the operation of self-verification verification strivings over and above self-enhancement strivings. Still, we still predict that participants will move their face closer to being Amazing Attractive than to being As It Is Now, consistent with self-enhancement strivings dominating self-verification strivings.\n\n(Moderation 1: We predict that any advantage for self-enhancing strivings above will be more apparent in the Absolute condition, where the facial attractiveness modification range is wider, than in the Relative condition, where the facial attractiveness modification range is smaller. If H2 is falsified, then it is more likely to be falsified in the Relative Condition than in the Absolute Condition, or to be more strongly falsified in the Relative Condition than in the Absolute Condition.)\n\n(Moderation 2: We predict that that the balance of self-enhancing strivings versus self-verification strivings, in the direction of the former, will be positively related to participant's self-reported desires for their face to be attractive, and negatively related to their self-reported desires for their face to be familiar.)\n\n(Moderation 3: We predict that self-enhancing strivings will be stronger (i) in women and (ii) in younger people, with such factors possibly combining synergistically. This is because, for evolutionary and lifespan reasons respectively, facial attractiveness has greater normative value for women and younger people. )"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Other"}, "q6": {"extra": [], "value": ["For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to which they have been assigned.", "Personnel who interact directly with the study subjects (either human or non-human subjects) will not be aware of the assigned treatments.

Their overall purpose is to test whether people are motivated to verify as well as to enhance their facial identity, and to what extent they are motivated to do one versus the other. The motive to self-enhance is presumed to be captured by striving for facial attractiveness: having an attractive face affords a positive evaluation whereas having an unattractive face affords a negative evaluation. The motive to self-verify is presumed to be captured by striving for facial familiarity: having a familiar face affords a sense that one's life and world are predictable, controllable,and coherent whereas having an unfamiliar face affords a sense that they are not.\n\nStudy 1 has participants indicate how they would hypothetically modify their face if they were able to, in the following situations: \n\n(a) its attractiveness is fixed (at 100%) but its familiarity can be modified; \n(b) its familiarity is fixed (at 100%) but its attractiveness can be modified; or \n(c) its attractiveness can be modified, but only such that its familiarity varies inversely with any modifications.\n\nIn addition, the study comes in two versions. In both versions, participants can modify the familiarity of their face between being Altogether Unfamiliar (0%) and Entirely Familiar (100%): that is the relevant range.

The purpose of having two versions, with different ranges for attractiveness, is take account of the fact that the logical zero-point of facial self-enhancement (Hideously Unattractive) may not be psychologically relevant zero-point, which is liable to be shifted in the direction of the status quo point (As It Is Now), but whose exactly location is difficult to determine. However, the psychologically relevant zero-point is likely to lie somewhere in the interval between the logical zero-point and status quo point, such that the results of both versions of the study, pertaining to the interval extremes, will enable stronger conclusions to be drawn and more informed estimates of relative self-motive strength to be made. \n\nThe Absolute Version of the study features only scenarios (b) and (c) above.\nThe Relative Version of the study features scenarios (a), (b), and (c).\n\nIn addition, participants are asked to indicate, at the beginning of the study, the extent to which they perceive their face to be attractive and familiar, and the extent to which they desire for their face to be attractive and familiar. These perceptions and desires can themselves serve as straightforward indications of how people think they stand in terms of these identity-relevant facial characteristics, and how much they want to facially self-enhance and self-verify in both an absolute sense and a relative sense.

In addition, whereas an Absolute Version of the study features all three conditions, and facial attractiveness can be modified across the full range, from Hideously Unattractive to Amazingly Attractive, the Relative Version of the study features only Condition (b) and (c), and facial attractiveness can be modified only across the partial range, from As I Am Now to Amazingly Attractive. The within-group conditions are not randomized but presented in quasi-fixed order, the reason being that Condition (c) is harder to understand, and better presented after another condition, which it builds on. The preceding condition is always just Condition (b) in the Relative Version, but is Condition (a) and Condition (b) Absolute Version, whose order is duly systematically counterbalanced in the order that participants complete the study online, which approximates complete randomization and ensures equivalent sample size.

This effect is defined by the reduction of congruency effects in post-conflict trials. Two theoretical approaches compete for the explanation of this phenomenon: Control accounts describe the CSE as the result of adaption processes, which regulate the attentional focus to the task-relevant dimension and/or result in the inhibition of task-irrelevant information. In contrast, binding accounts attribute the CSE to the learning of stimulus-response (S-R) combinations. This type of short term associative learning is referred to as binding.  In subsequent trials the partial retrieval of such bound S-R combinations leads to impaired performance in comparison to the complete retrieval of an S-R combination or no retrieval at all.\nRecent theories tried to integrate both approaches. So, it is hypothesized that not only S-R combinations can be bound and retrieved, but also the current cognitive state, which would also include the degree of cognitive control currently implemented. There is first evidence indicating that the binding and retrieval of such control states impact on the CSE (Dignath, Johannsen, Hommel, &amp; Kiesel, 2019). \nWith this study we want to replicate the first two studies that investigated the decay of control states (OSF Registration: https://osf.io/8thvs and https://osf.io/m8kbt).

This effect is defined by the reduction of congruency effects in post-conflict trials. Two theoretical approaches compete for the explanation of this phenomenon: Control accounts describe the CSE as the result of adaption processes, which regulate the attentional focus to the task-relevant dimension and/or result in the inhibition of task-irrelevant information. In contrast, binding accounts attribute the CSE to the learning of stimulus-response (S-R) combinations. This type of short term associative learning is referred to as binding.  In subsequent trials the partial retrieval of such bound S-R combinations leads to impaired performance in comparison to the complete retrieval of an S-R combination or no retrieval at all.\nRecent theories tried to integrate both approaches. So, it is hypothesized that not only S-R combinations can be bound and retrieved, but also the current cognitive state, which would also include the degree of cognitive control currently implemented. There is first evidence indicating that the binding and retrieval of such control states impact on the CSE (Dignath, Johannsen, Hommel, &amp; Kiesel, 2019). \nWith this study we want to replicate the first two studies that investigated the decay of control states (OSF Registration: https://osf.io/8thvs and https://osf.io/m8kbt).

We will compute attitudes toward racial minorities relative to Whites by subtracting mean attitudes toward Whites from mean attitudes toward each racial minority group (Kinder &amp; Kam, 2009). We will combine these indicators into a scale of average favorability toward people of color relative to Whites. \n\n2) Perceived discrimination toward racial minorities: participants will be asked how much discrimination there is in the United States against African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, and Whites individually and respond on a 7-point scale (1 = very little discrimination, 7 = a lot of discrimination). We will compute perceived discrimination against racial minorities relative to Whites by subtracting mean perceived discrimination toward Whites from mean perceived discrimination toward each racial minority group. We will combine these indicators into a scale of average perceived discrimination toward people of color relative to Whites. \n\n3) Support for anti-immigration measures: participants will be asked how much they support or oppose the four following anti-immigration measures and respond on a 7-point scale (1 = strongly oppose, 7 = strongly support): \u201cIncrease the time required for immigrants to become eligible for U.S. citizenship\u201d, \u201cIncrease the level of federal resources for arresting undocumented immigrants (i.e., ICE)\u201d, \u201cRenew temporary relief from deportation for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children (i.e., DACA)\u201d, and \u201cProvide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants (i.e., DREAM Act)\u201d. The last two measures will be reverse coded, and we will use responses to these items to create a scale of average opposition to immigration. \n\n4) Self-reported political ideology: pre- and post-manipulation, participants will be asked their political ideology and respond on a 7-point scale (1 = extremely liberal, 7 = extremely conservative). \n\nBecause we are using a mediation design (Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986) to test whether Black Americans\u2019 reaction to Latinx growth is driven by cultural threat and Asian Americans\u2019 reaction to Latinx growth is driven by group status threat, the cultural threat mediator will be measured by asking participants for their perceptions of the cultural standing of Americans: participants will be asked the extent to which being truly American is reflected by \u201cHaving been born in America\u201d, \u201cHaving lived in America for most of one\u2019s life\u201d, and \u201cCelebrating American holidays\u201d on a 7-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). We will take the mean score of responses to these three items to create a scale of average cultural threat.\n\nIn turn, the group status threat mediator will be measured by asking participants for their perceptions of the status of immigrants: participants will be asked the extent to which being an immigrant in the United States is reflected by \u201cHaving specialized or technical skills\u201d, \u201cPossessing high levels of education\u201d, and \u201cHaving high professional ambitions\u201d on a 7-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree).
