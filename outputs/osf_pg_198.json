In this norm, each cue word elicited three responses, but in the degree calculation here, only the first response will be used. The total degree of a word is the sum of its (a) out-degree and (b) in-degree. Out-degree refers to the number of distinct responses a cue word elicits. For example, if \"dog\" elicits \"cat\", \"bark\", and \"pet\", the word \"dog\" will therefore have an out-degree of 3. In-degree, on the other hand, refers to how many times a word has been given as a response. For example, if \"cat\" elicits \"dog\", and \"animal\" also elicits \"dog\", the word \"dog\" will have an in-degree of 2. In this example, the word \"dog\" will have a total degree of 3 plus 2 (i.e., 5) Note, in the calculation of both in- and out-degrees, I follow Nelson et al. (2004) in that a response is only considered \"valid\" if at least two persons in the norming study gave it as the response.

Monitor and acceptance theory (MAT) is a new framework to test and make predictions regarding the outcomes of mindfulness (Lindsay &amp; Creswell, 2017) Acceptance, combined with attention monitoring has been shown to enhance cognition when affect is present, in addition to improving stress related health outcomes, and reducing negative reactivity (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress) (Lindsay &amp; Creswell, 2017).  This project is seeking to understand the relationships among dispositional mindfulness, divided attention, dispositional resilience (i.e., hardiness), psychological well-being, self-compassion, mindset, and perceived stress.  The Philadelphia Mindfulness Scale (PHLMS) is a valid and reliable measure that examines mindfulness on 2 dimensions awareness and acceptance. This 20-item scale uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (very often)\n(Cardaciotto, Herbert, Forman, Moitra, &amp; Farrow, 2008).\n\nDivided attention (i.e., 3-D multiple object tracking) refers to the ability to monitor and track multiple objects for short periods of time (Parsons et al., 2014) and will be measured using the NeuroTracker (Cognisens). The NeuroTracker task consists of following 4 of 8 target objects in a 3-dimensional space for 20 trials of 8 second duration (3 times).  After 8 seconds the participant is asked to identify the targets and if correct, the speed of the objects increases for the next trial.  If incorrect, the speed of the objects in the next trial decreases. The dependent measure is the averaged visual tracking speed over 60 trials.\n\nDispositional resilience (i.e., hardiness) refers to one's ability to interpret stressful events using a general framework of a strong sense of life and work commitment, a greater feeling of control over life events, and an openness to change and challenge (Kobasa, 1979). The Dispositional Resilience Scale (Bartone, 2014) will be used to measure this construct.\n\nWhile there are a number of ways to define psychological well-being, the PERMA model advocated by Seligman (2011) will be used in this study.  Based in a framework of positive psychology, Seligman suggests there are five pillars to psychological well-being:  positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment.  The PERMA-Profiler (Butler &amp; Kern, 2016) will be used to measure this construct.\n\nSelf-compassion refers to the tendency to be open to one's experiences of suffering and to respond with self-kindness, taking an understanding and nonjudgmental attitude toward the failure, and believing that the experience is a common human experience (Neff, 2003).  The Self-Compassion Scale (Neff, 2003) will be used to measure this construct.\n\nDweck (2006) identified two ways in which individuals can view their abilities.  An individual with a fixed mindset views abilities as innate qualities; there is no changing what you are born with.  Whereas individuals with a growth mindset believe that abilties can be learned and acquired through effort and experience.  We will measure participants' mindset towards attentional training using Dweck's (2006) fixed/growth mindset questionnaire.\n\nPersonal relative deprivation is a subjective measurement of feelings of anger and resentment based on an immediate social comparison to one's peer group (Smith, Pettigrew, Peppen, &amp; Bialosiewicz, 2012). Relative deprivation has been shown to influence a number of psychological outcomes at the individual level, including problem gambling, mental health, and physical health (Callan et al., 2008; Callan, Shead, &amp; Olson, 2011; Mishra &amp; Carleton, 2015).\n\nMost of the constructs discussed so far, with the exception of divided attention, have been clearly shown to be related to the experience of stress.  Consequently, the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983) will be included to objectively measure feelings of perceived stress over the past month.\n\nThroughout all the constructs outlined above, there is some debate as to whether they are dispositional (i.e., trait-like personality characteristics) or are factors that can be learned and acquired through interventions.  It is the ultimate purpose of this project to ascertain the relationships among these psychological constructs as a first step to determine the existence and extent of those relationships."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "1. The primary hypothesis that we are investigating for this study is whether there is a relationship between NeuroTracker (NT; 3DMOT) speed scores and dispositional mindfulness as measured by the PHLMS.

Secondly, we predict that awareness and acceptance scores will positively correlate with PERMA scores, dispositional Hardiness scores, self-compassion scores and a growth mindset. \n3. Thirdly, we predict that awareness and acceptance skills will be negatively associated with perceived stress scores and relative deprivation scores. \n4. Personal relative deprivation scores will predict both perceived stress and PERMA scores, while awareness and acceptance scores we predict will moderate this relationship. \n5.

Dorsch", "q3": "Mindfulness is described as attention and awareness in the present moment, while experiencing the present moment with an open and non-judgemental attitude (Kabatt-Zin, 1994; Lindsay &amp; Creswell, 2017). Monitor and acceptance theory (MAT) is a new framework to test and make predictions regarding the outcomes of mindfulness (Lindsay &amp; Creswell, 2017) Acceptance, combined with attention monitoring has been shown to enhance cognition when affect is present, in addition to improving stress related health outcomes, and reducing negative reactivity (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress) (Lindsay &amp; Creswell, 2017).  This project is seeking to understand the relationships among dispositional mindfulness, divided attention, dispositional resilience (i.e., hardiness), psychological well-being, self-compassion, mindset, and perceived stress.  The Philadelphia Mindfulness Scale (PHLMS) is a valid and reliable measure that examines mindfulness on 2 dimensions awareness and acceptance. This 20-item scale uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (very often)\n(Cardaciotto, Herbert, Forman, Moitra, &amp; Farrow, 2008).\n\nDivided attention (i.e., 3-D multiple object tracking) refers to the ability to monitor and track multiple objects for short periods of time (Parsons et al., 2014) and will be measured using the NeuroTracker (Cognisens). The NeuroTracker task consists of following 4 of 8 target objects in a 3-dimensional space for 20 trials of 8 second duration (3 times).  After 8 seconds the participant is asked to identify the targets and if correct, the speed of the objects increases for the next trial.  If incorrect, the speed of the objects in the next trial decreases. The dependent measure is the averaged visual tracking speed over 60 trials.\n\nDispositional resilience (i.e., hardiness) refers to one's ability to interpret stressful events using a general framework of a strong sense of life and work commitment, a greater feeling of control over life events, and an openness to change and challenge (Kobasa, 1979). The Dispositional Resilience Scale (Bartone, 2014) will be used to measure this construct.\n\nWhile there are a number of ways to define psychological well-being, the PERMA model advocated by Seligman (2011) will be used in this study.  Based in a framework of positive psychology, Seligman suggests there are five pillars to psychological well-being:  positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment.  The PERMA-Profiler (Butler &amp; Kern, 2016) will be used to measure this construct.\n\nSelf-compassion refers to the tendency to be open to one's experiences of suffering and to respond with self-kindness, taking an understanding and nonjudgmental attitude toward the failure, and believing that the experience is a common human experience (Neff, 2003).  The Self-Compassion Scale (Neff, 2003) will be used to measure this construct.\n\nDweck (2006) identified two ways in which individuals can view their abilities.  An individual with a fixed mindset views abilities as innate qualities; there is no changing what you are born with.  Whereas individuals with a growth mindset believe that abilties can be learned and acquired through effort and experience.  We will measure participants' mindset towards attentional training using Dweck's (2006) fixed/growth mindset questionnaire.\n\nPersonal relative deprivation is a subjective measurement of feelings of anger and resentment based on an immediate social comparison to one's peer group (Smith, Pettigrew, Peppen, &amp; Bialosiewicz, 2012).

Consequently, the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983) will be included to objectively measure feelings of perceived stress over the past month.\n\nThroughout all the constructs outlined above, there is some debate as to whether they are dispositional (i.e., trait-like personality characteristics) or are factors that can be learned and acquired through interventions.  It is the ultimate purpose of this project to ascertain the relationships among these psychological constructs as a first step to determine the existence and extent of those relationships.", "q4": "1. The primary hypothesis that we are investigating for this study is whether there is a relationship between NeuroTracker (NT; 3DMOT) speed scores and dispositional mindfulness as measured by the PHLMS. We predict that there will be a positive relationship between awareness scores and NT scores.\n2. Secondly, we predict that awareness and acceptance scores will positively correlate with PERMA scores, dispositional Hardiness scores, self-compassion scores and a growth mindset. \n3. Thirdly, we predict that awareness and acceptance skills will be negatively associated with perceived stress scores and relative deprivation scores. \n4. Personal relative deprivation scores will predict both perceived stress and PERMA scores, while awareness and acceptance scores we predict will moderate this relationship. \n5.
