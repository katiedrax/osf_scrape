Despite an increase in sociopolitical conflicts globally, we know relatively little about the factors that influence divestment from conflict zones. In this project we examine the decision of foreign divestment from Burma. We do so by drawing on institutional and social movement theories, which consider how firms respond to governments and activists, respectively. Consistent with these theories, we contend that MNEs will divest from conflict zones when (1) home governments enact legislation critical of a host country and (2) NGO and shareholder activists put pressure on MNEs to act in a socially responsible manner. In an observational component of this project, we examine the divestment decisions of 442 MNEs from thirty-one countries operating in Burma between 1995 and 2002. During this time period, many MNEs exited the country while the incumbent military government continued repression of its constituents. Burma is a salient context to explore divestment given the multitude of pressures that MNEs confronted in this decision process.

public opinion polling on citizens in the western democracies, very little is known about how citizens in newly democratizing countries react to such information. Very little is also known about how citizens form their priors about what outcome they expect to occur. The primary motivation of this study is explore whether exposure to political polling information changes people\u2019s views both in the short term before an election and in the longer term after the election. In the study, I collect a reliable sample-based estimate of candidate support prior to an election and then use this information as a treatment in a lab environment. The study is designed to help answer the question about what impact polling information has in the context of a Georgian election and how incentivization changes the quality of people\u2019s guesses about election outcomes. A secondary motivation also informs the study. Given recent scandals about polling in Georgia, the study attempts to estimate the true level of trust in political opinion polls in Georgia using a double list experiment. Research Design: Part 1 of the study design involves administering a sample survey to a representative sample of the population in a municipality bordering the city of Tbilisi, Georgia (Kaspi). 800 interviews will be attempted with a target response of 700. This survey is composed of approximately 30 questions as well as 2 randomization protocols. In the first randomization protocol, in the treatment group, respondents will be told that they will receive a monetary reward based on their predictions about the outcome of an election and a game will be played in order to elicit both respondent\u2019s point estimates and the variation around such point estimates about the election outcome. Before playing this game, they will have four practice rounds where the enumerator flips a coin four times and respondents are asked to predict the outcome of this coin flip. After the election, they will then receive a monetary reward based on their guesses. In the control group, respondents will be asked to make their guesses without incentivization. In a second randomization within the same survey, a double list experiment will be carried out to, where the sensitive item is public opinion polls and the goal is to understand the true level of trust in public opinion polls. Because the list experiment follows the incentivized experiment, there may be an interaction between the first and the second experiment. I divide those are are incentivized in the first randomization protocol into three groups for the double list experiment. Therefore, given the sample size, I only give the control treatment of asking each item independently to those who are not incentivized. The three types of lists are randomized for incentivized participant in the first experiment. All other elements of the survey are administered to all respondents. The dependent variables for the survey are the game predictions and the outcome of the list experiment. Part 2 will take place in Kaspi. The research protocol involves 3 phases. In phase 1, subjects will be recruited only from the town of Kaspi and several demographic variables will be collected to use block assignment to treatment. Subjects (approximately 225) will be then assigned to either one of two treatment groups or a control group. They will be assigned to treatment using multivariate continuous blocking. In phase 2, subjects will be asked to elicit their priors about election related outcomes as well as several demographic questions and behavioral questions about legitimacy and election related outcomes.

Very little is also known about how citizens form their priors about what outcome they expect to occur. The primary motivation of this study is explore whether exposure to political polling information changes people\u2019s views both in the short term before an election and in the longer term after the election. In the study, I collect a reliable sample-based estimate of candidate support prior to an election and then use this information as a treatment in a lab environment. The study is designed to help answer the question about what impact polling information has in the context of a Georgian election and how incentivization changes the quality of people\u2019s guesses about election outcomes. A secondary motivation also informs the study. Given recent scandals about polling in Georgia, the study attempts to estimate the true level of trust in political opinion polls in Georgia using a double list experiment. Research Design: Part 1 of the study design involves administering a sample survey to a representative sample of the population in a municipality bordering the city of Tbilisi, Georgia (Kaspi). 800 interviews will be attempted with a target response of 700. This survey is composed of approximately 30 questions as well as 2 randomization protocols. In the first randomization protocol, in the treatment group, respondents will be told that they will receive a monetary reward based on their predictions about the outcome of an election and a game will be played in order to elicit both respondent\u2019s point estimates and the variation around such point estimates about the election outcome. Before playing this game, they will have four practice rounds where the enumerator flips a coin four times and respondents are asked to predict the outcome of this coin flip. After the election, they will then receive a monetary reward based on their guesses. In the control group, respondents will be asked to make their guesses without incentivization. In a second randomization within the same survey, a double list experiment will be carried out to, where the sensitive item is public opinion polls and the goal is to understand the true level of trust in public opinion polls. Because the list experiment follows the incentivized experiment, there may be an interaction between the first and the second experiment. I divide those are are incentivized in the first randomization protocol into three groups for the double list experiment. Therefore, given the sample size, I only give the control treatment of asking each item independently to those who are not incentivized. The three types of lists are randomized for incentivized participant in the first experiment. All other elements of the survey are administered to all respondents. The dependent variables for the survey are the game predictions and the outcome of the list experiment. Part 2 will take place in Kaspi. The research protocol involves 3 phases. In phase 1, subjects will be recruited only from the town of Kaspi and several demographic variables will be collected to use block assignment to treatment. Subjects (approximately 225) will be then assigned to either one of two treatment groups or a control group. They will be assigned to treatment using multivariate continuous blocking. In phase 2, subjects will be asked to elicit their priors about election related outcomes as well as several demographic questions and behavioral questions about legitimacy and election related outcomes. Those that are assigned to treatment will receive radio stories constructed from local media AND a radio story constructed from aggregate survey data collected in the survey carried out in Part 1. There are two different treatment groups. One group is told in the story that an American academic carried out the survey and a second is told that a local research organization carried out the survey. The control group will only receive radio stories from the local media. After the news stories, the same questions asked at the beginning of phase 2 will be repeated.

multilaterals, and non-governmental organizations. However, as the initial disaster evolved into a long-term development crisis, the inefficiencies of aid efforts became increasingly visible despite a large, well-rounded, high-profile international presence and many attempts at donor coordination. Though donor harmonization efforts are believed to increase the efficiency of aid allocation, many development professionals in Haiti at the time were seemingly uninterested, or at least unable to coordinate aid. While sitting in on a weekly coordination meeting between 60 relief workers, journalist Janet Reitman observed \u201ccomplaining\u201d and lack of dialogue, noting that \u201cin the end, nothing was decided\u201d (2011). Functionally, these meetings could have facilitated a more effective allocation of aid in the midst of the crisis and saved lives in the process. Instead, donors were unmotivated to participate, causing these efforts to devolve into \u201can exercise in futility,\u201d a description that could be applied all-too-often in multi-stakeholder international development efforts (Reitman 2011). This experience exemplifies tragic consequences of donor fragmentation in times when aid matters most. A more coordinated aid strategy could have at least moderated the chaos of Haiti\u2019s aid management in the midst of a national disaster and would likely have expedited the recovery process. This case illustrates the dire need for a new model of cooperation across donors both in times of crisis and for long term growth and development in nations receiving aid. Motivated both by the mandate for coordination as defined in international agreements, as well as these past challenges, we explore different attitudes and practices in the development community with respect to donor coordination. Our research question centers around whether donors respond to efforts to increase coordination and how they might be motivated to do so. More specifically, does referencing credible evidence on the benefits of donor harmonization induce project managers to take steps towards coordination? Does offering an incentive of public credit or invoking career incentives induce participation among donors? While opinions as to why fragmentation exists are plentiful, scoping these ideas will be an essential component of any effort to \u201cde-mystify\u201d donor coordination. Thus, this experiment is as much about identifying problems as it is about proposing solutions. Through an email and survey-based randomized evaluation, we will attempt to address these questions as well as identify barriers to coordination and whether donor institutions are actively encouraging coordination in the field. In light of the growing emphasis on aid effectiveness and transparency in international development, research and policy communities have promoted donor coordination as a key element of this endeavor. The 2005 Paris Declaration called for better \u201charmonization\u201d across donors and suggested that development efforts should be \u201cmore transparent and collectively effective.\u201d The declaration boldly states that improving aid effectiveness is not only \u201cnecessary,\u201d but also \u201cfeasible across all aid modalities.\u201d This operational tenet implies a great need for improvements in harmonization and collaboration across the spectrum of both donor and recipient countries; thus, the declaration develops a narrative for a new paradigm for foreign aid to that effect. Subsequent conferences at Accra in 2008 and Busan in 2011 continued the discussion of aid effectiveness, together forming the \u201cParis Agenda\u201d which highlights donor coordination as an essential element of aid improvement (Bigsten & Tengstam 2014). Outside these official channels, researchers have continued the discussion of the mechanics of donor fragmentation and its impact on the effectiveness of foreign aid delivery. The issue of how to address the effectiveness of foreign aid has been heavily debated topic both in policy and academic communities. Through the years it has become apparent that foreign aid in of itself is not a silver bullet for global poverty, bearing only a weak relationship with improved development outcomes (Bourgignon & Sundberg 2007; Easterly et al, 2003; Rajan and Subramainian, 2005). In the literature, recommendations for a renewed emphasis on country ownership of aid and performance-based allocation highlight the nuances of coordination strategies between donors and target countries. A Rahman and Sawada study in 2010 utilized OECD CRS data to study incidences of \u201cfree-riding\u201d among donors. The empirical results of the study suggest that competition among donors generates an insufficient supply of foreign aid, though coordination efforts alone may not solve this problem without accompanying reforms in the structure of donor incentives. One way to incentivize coordination may be to create a \u201crecognition\u201d incentive that publicly names donors participating in coordination. The resulting public and social stigma would pressure donors into coordinating at the risk of appearing unresponsive to calls for harmonization. In addition to suggesting a change in donor incentives, the Paris Agenda puts the burden on both donors and recipients to coordinate and reform the aid allocation process. Some have argued that it is the call for improved governance and management on the part of aid recipients embedded in the Paris Agenda that holds the greatest potential for improving aid effectiveness (Rogerson 2005). Moreover, Knack and Rahman (2007) find in their research on donor fragmentation that \u201ccompetitive donor practices...erode administrative capacity in recipient country governments.\u201d Proliferation of aid increases transaction costs to recipient governments, \u201coverwhelming\u201d recipients\u2019 ability to effectively organize and administer aid (Knack & Sawada 2012). In addition to decreasing the value of aid, proliferation has been shown to negatively impact recipient countries\u2019 economic growth (Kimura et al. 2007). Countries with higher amounts of concentrated aid appear to demonstrate increased aid effectiveness, though there appear to be diminishing returns to concentration. Kimura even states that \u201clack of international aid coordination leads to the lack of ownership and lower capacities of aid recipients and hinders their growth potential\u201d (2007). However, the impact of donor coordination requires much further research: as well as lowering transaction costs for recipients, coordination could adversely impact effectiveness by introducing the free-rider problem among coordinating donors (Kimura et al. 2007). A potential solution to aid proliferation is concentrating aid, or encouraging donors to focus on particular regions or countries (Acharya et al. 2006). While coordination is another possible solution, Acharya finds that it faces high negotiation costs as do other proposed remedies such as sector-wide approaches (SWAps), budget support, and sector specialization (2006). Some scholars remain even more skeptical, claiming that many econometric studies of aid effectiveness are susceptible to sample modification or additional controls and are thus fragile (Roodman 2007). Pursuing more randomized field experiments may help alleviate some of these concerns in the literature on donor coordination, impact on recipient countries, and overall aid effectiveness. It has been noted that coordination reduces transaction costs for donors and provides better allocation of donor dollars across recipient countries, though this assumes donors\u2019 primary goal is the eradication of global poverty (Bigsten and Tengstam 2014; Lawson 2009). In fact, divergent strategic interests and differing structures of bureaucratic incentives among aid agencies may be significant obstacles for donor coordination (Winters 2012). Studies on career motivation identify individual and situational or organizational characteristics as important factors of career decisions and behaviors (London 1983). The more importance an individual places on his or her career and the more an organization incentivizes advancement, the more likely individuals are to behave in ways that organizations deem optimal. For example, if a donor organization links coordination to career advancement and promotion, individuals may be more likely to participate in harmonization activities (if their individual career motivations are aligned accordingly). Shortly after the Paris Declaration, Bigsten (2006) suggested that differences across donors in terms of their respective rules and procedures complicate the aid allocation process and raises costs overall. In many cases, work is duplicated in the process of needs assessments and evaluations. Coordination problems may also be compounded by procedural nuances and language barriers. In a worst case scenario, the inefficiencies generated by donor fragmentation can undermine governance in recipient countries by overburdening governments and distorting incentives. At the time of the Paris Declaration and Accra Agenda, transaction costs were identified as a key obstacle to aid efficiency. Indeed, addressing the issue of transaction costs had been considered \u201cone of the fundamental objectives of the Paris Declaration.\u201d However, throughout the implementation process for the Agenda, it has become apparent that identifying the true nature of these transaction costs, much less addressing them, is easier said than done. On a broader scale, despite the notion that harmonization would likely lead to better development outcomes, coordinating across donors continues to be more widely embraced in theory than in practice. A 2010 US Congressional Report admitted that despite support for goals outlined in the Paris Declaration, the US lacks \u201ca comprehensive strategy for donor coordination.\u201d Indeed, Aldasoro et al. (2010) notes that the US has experienced \u201ca systematic decrease in coordination\u201d since the advent of the Paris Agenda. Across all donors, Nunnencamp, Ohler, & Thiele (2013) find that \u201caid fragmentation persisted after the Paris Declaration and coordination among donors has even weakened.\u201d Despite more overlap in aid, coordination shortcomings may be attributed to information asymmetries, non-altruistic goals of aid, and the proliferation of many diverse donor organizations on the international scene (Nunnencamp et al. 2013). Additionally, donors may be less willing to engage in coordination if they fear it may reduce country ownership of aid, another key principle outlined in the Paris Declaration (Winters 2012). In a study of harmonization obstacles to local governance aid in Indonesia, Winters finds that donors themselves create the barriers to coordination by hindering coordination of agencies within recipient governments (2012). Using an innovative network model connecting donor organizations, recipient countries, and aid sectors, Coscia, Hausmann & Hidalgo (2013) find coordination achieves roughly 60% of its maximum potential and advocate a more decentralized approach to coordination among donors. It is possible that donor harmonization is now being viewed as an unattainable, even annoying, ideal that is irksome to development professionals. The usage of the term \u201ccoordination\u201d may be problematic as it is rapidly becoming \u201cone of the most tired and deceptive terms in the business\u201d (Acharya et al. 2006). This experiment seeks to explain the nature of the dissonance between rhetoric and reality and whether it is an issue of motivation or simply a lack of appropriate tools and methodologies to facilitate cooperation. It is apparent that donor norms articulated in the agenda of Paris, Accra, and Busan along with other international initiatives embrace the notion of increased harmonization across donors as a way to improve development outcomes. However, as the literature above suggests, there exists a significant disparity between policy ideals and practice. In light of these observations, a number of questions emerge as to the feasibility of coordination at an operational level. Despite the generally favorable view of donor coordination in the literature, it remains unclear how individuals within the donor community view these international initiatives, the issue of coordination, and the role they play in facilitating it. Using an experimental approach, our study addresses existing attitudes toward coordination at the project management level in an attempt to understand the nature of the disconnect between international standards and their implementation. In short, we are asking if project managers inclined to coordinate, what motivates them to do so, and, if motivated, whether sufficient tools and mechanisms are in place to coordinate aid efforts.

Coordination is a time-intensive endeavor, requiring project managers to devote precious resources to activities in which they may not be truly motivated to participate. We use cooperation (defined as opening the email and clicking the link to the survey) in our coordination initiative as a proxy for actual interest in coordination and willingness to coordinate, or at least recognition of a need. By entering the survey, project managers have signaled their interest and willingness to dedicate time for coordination. In this experiment, we are testing different motivations for donor coordination using two sets of hypotheses: one set based on our two control conditions, and the other based on our three treatment conditions. First, we test donor reactions to the word \u201ccoordination.\u201d Our baseline condition does not include the term \u201ccoordination\u201d anywhere and does not include any motivational treatment language. Our second control condition also does not include motivational treatment language, but email subject lines will include the term \u201ccoordination.\u201d These two control conditions will serve as comparisons for treatment conditions and will also allow for tests of whether the use of the term \u201ccoordination\u201d impacts email open rates and survey completion rates. The three treatment conditions that we use in this study allow for hypotheses regarding various motivations for coordination. We expect that if (1) project managers perceive coordination as a mode to advance their careers, they will coordinate. Our second motivational treatment implies that if (2) credible evidence supports the practice of coordination, then, when presented with that evidence, project managers will coordinate. Our third and final motivational treatment suggests that if (3) there is public recognition tied to coordination, or alternately, public stigma tied to lack thereof, then project managers will elect to coordinate. We hypothesize that email open rates, survey start rates, and survey completion rates will be higher in all three of these treatment conditions than in the control conditions. \""}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "\"Outcome Measure To adequately capture different motivational treatments and their impact on coordination efforts, we have embedded outcome measures progressively through the experiment. The first outcome measures the email open rate, which will capture subject-line treatment effects. This serves as a proxy for whether donors respond to attempts at coordination by measuring whether donors are at all interested in reading an email on coordination. The subject lines of treatment emails will mention donor coordination and echo the treatments embedded in the email. The first control email will not mention donor coordination at all in the subject line or email body, and will serve as a baseline for open rates of all emails. The second control email will have a subject line of only \u201cDonor Coordination Initiative,\u201d and will not include any motivating treatments. The second outcome measures the click-rate of the survey link and other treatment-specific links, capturing the email treatment effects. Clicking the survey link serves as a proxy for whether or not donors are motivated to coordinate conditional on what motivational treatment they have or have not received. The language of the treatment and control emails also contains various links to scholarly evidence or AidData\u2019s website, both of which back-up claims made in the email. Clicking these links indicates interest in gaining more knowledge about a treatment claim or AidData\u2019s organization. The third outcome measure tracks the completion rate of the survey and responses to survey questions. The survey is separated into three \u201cpages,\u201d so partial completion will be able to be tracked. Survey questions include descriptive information about the Task Team Leader\u2019s position, how long he or she has worked at the World Bank, the number and type of projects that he or she manages, and regional and sectoral specialization. Subsequent questions ask respondents to identify if they are currently participating in coordination efforts and if so, how they are coordinating with other donors. Additionally, Task Team Leaders will be asked to describe how coordination might be improved and to identify barriers and potential solutions to the problem of donor coordination. Donors will be asked if coordinating with other organizations is encouraged at their organization and whether it factors into decisions regarding promotion or recognition. The survey completion rate and answers to survey questions serve as a proxy for donor commitment to address an initiative to enhance coordination efforts. Treatment and Control Conditions As articulated above, our treatments will observe three different motivations to coordinate along with two controls, one with donor coordination language, the other neutral. The treatment language will be embedded in both email subject lines and the email body itself. The first control email will simply seek survey information about donors and will not mention donor coordination or harmonization, as these may be \u201cbuzzwords\u201d that could be offputting to some recipients. The subject line and email language will only mention a \u201cdonor survey\u201d to \u201clearn from development professionals about donor activities in the field.\u201d The second control will ask participants to participate in a \u201cdonor harmonization initiative\u201d by filling out the survey. It will reference previous donor harmonization efforts and their unclear effects via links in the treatment language text. Importantly, the two email controls will not provide other motivating language that may influence donors to coordinate. Public and social stigma will be used in the first treatment by telling donors that public credit will be given to donors participating in the initiative. A program report will be published on AidData.org, including a list of survey respondents who wish to be acknowledged for participating in this donor coordination effort. Donors choosing not to participate may be perceived as unable to coordinate due to other demands on their time and attention, or unwilling to comply with the recommendations for increasing aid effectiveness set forth in the Paris Agenda. From this perspective, a low response rate may still prove insightful as it continues to provide insight on what is or is not an effective approach to address coordination. The second treatment will seek to motivate donors through credible, scholarly evidence indicating why coordination improves aid outcomes. This treatment will specifically link to a 2007 study published in Journal of Development Economics by Knack and Rahman that suggests that donor fragmentation results in lower bureaucratic quality among recipients. Because \u201cgreater donor coordination should help to improve governance in the recipient countries,\u201d donors should support coordination efforts and take the survey. The final treatment will use encouragement from organizational superiors as a motivating factor for donor coordination. The World Bank and many other donor institutions have vocalized their support of coordination efforts in the abstract, acknowledging the problems inherent in aid fragmentation. In a speech to the World Health Assembly in May 2013, World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim stated that donor coordination should be central to the Bank\u2019s strategy, arguing that \u201c[donor] fragmentation is literally killing people. We must take action to fix it now.\u201d By citing this quote and implying the connection between donor coordination and successful outcomes for Task Team Leaders at the World Bank, this treatment will compel respondents to become involved in coordination and click the survey. In an effort to boost response rates, across all treatment and control groups, follow-up reminder emails to participate will be sent if respondents don\u2019t initially open the email. These reminders will include relevant treatment or control language. The survey itself will be uniform across participants. Subject Pool Subjects will be randomly assigned to control and treatment groups from a list of World Bank Task Team Leaders (TTLs). All subjects will be experienced employees of the World Bank with decision-making authority over project management in the field. We expect to send survey email treatments to about 1200 potential participants. However, the voluntary nature of participation in the survey allows participants to select in or out of the study at their own discretion, so we expect that our treatment-on-treated subject pool for the third outcome measure to be smaller. Randomization We will use block randomization to ensure balance between the three treatment groups and two control groups. From our pool of TTLs, we will block subjects by the aid sector of the project that the TTL managers identified in terms of World Bank sector breakdowns. For the purposes of this experiment, including maintaining blocks of a manageable size and retaining sufficient power, we have used the 10 main sectors identified by the World Bank\u2019s sectoral categories. We have coded the TTL portfolios in our sample accordingly using data from the primary sector of the project they manage. In addition to sectoral blocking, we will block participants by region where they primarily work. Projects are assigned one of seven regional codes, which we will use as the TTL\u2019s primary region of focus. Data Analysis Protocol Concerns regarding the sensitivity of our treatment language to existing attitudes in the donor community have prompted us to develop a pre-test protocol to assess the appropriateness of our intervention. Prior to launching the pilot study, we contacted 10-15 individuals at the World Bank, AidData, and other donor organizations with whom AidData has an established working relationship in order to screen our treatments, acquire feedback, and adapt the experimental design to maximize its effectiveness. We screened reaction to potential buzzwords such as \u201cdonor coordination\u201d and \u201caid harmonization\u201d and the experiment structure, and adjusted treatment language and formatting accordingly in preparation to launch the protocol. Once the pre-test results have been assessed and applied to our treatment protocol, we will launch the pilot phase to the sample population under a blocked approach to randomized assignment. Mailchimp will be used to deliver the treatment and control emails and track click-rates of the survey and embedded links, including AidData\u2019s website, reference materials like the Paris Declaration and, in some cases, additional sources which vary by treatment (see appendix for detailed treatment language). Qualtrics software will then be used to administer the survey and subsequently log the qualitative and binary responses from participants. Thus, utilizing Mailchimp and Qualtrics, we will observe quantitative outcome measures of opening the initial email and clicking on the survey, as well as the binary, qualitative, and scalar data provided by survey responses. Difference-in-means tests will be used to assess treatment effects across our treatment and control groups accompanied by logistic regression analysis with covariates as a robustness check. Covariates for analysis will include gender, work experience, project location and region, sector, and project size (based on the project\u2019s budget) gathered from our survey data and baseline data on the TTLs. Analysis Plan To distinguish the treatment effects across our three motivational email treatment groups, we will employ difference in means tests to analyze effects for each of the experimental conditions and controls. In order to adequately address the issue of balance across our sample and to control for any heterogeneity of outcomes, we will employ logit regression analysis with the covariates outlined above. This serves as an attempt to statistically control for the most measurable confounds. Planned covariates for analysis of treatment effects will include gender, number of projects a Task Team Leader has led as a proxy for experience level, as well as relevant project locations, sectors, and size. The survey itself (see appendix) will provide qualitative, categorical, and binary data for further research and analysis. The survey will be uniform across all treatment and control groups and is primarily for the purpose of our own learning. In an effort to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying challenges associated with coordination, respondents will be provided with an opportunity to identify key obstacles and challenges, articulate their views on the issue of donor fragmentation, and their perceptions of the culture of coordination at the World Bank. Additionally, respondents will be prompted to identify potential solutions or tools that they believe could help overcome the obstacles they have identified to facilitate improved coordination and more effective aid outcomes. Through summary statistics and qualitative data emerging from survey responses, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the coordination debate through an examination of trends in the characteristics of respondents and frequently identified obstacles to coordination.

However, as the initial disaster evolved into a long-term development crisis, the inefficiencies of aid efforts became increasingly visible despite a large, well-rounded, high-profile international presence and many attempts at donor coordination. Though donor harmonization efforts are believed to increase the efficiency of aid allocation, many development professionals in Haiti at the time were seemingly uninterested, or at least unable to coordinate aid. While sitting in on a weekly coordination meeting between 60 relief workers, journalist Janet Reitman observed \u201ccomplaining\u201d and lack of dialogue, noting that \u201cin the end, nothing was decided\u201d (2011). Functionally, these meetings could have facilitated a more effective allocation of aid in the midst of the crisis and saved lives in the process. Instead, donors were unmotivated to participate, causing these efforts to devolve into \u201can exercise in futility,\u201d a description that could be applied all-too-often in multi-stakeholder international development efforts (Reitman 2011). This experience exemplifies tragic consequences of donor fragmentation in times when aid matters most. A more coordinated aid strategy could have at least moderated the chaos of Haiti\u2019s aid management in the midst of a national disaster and would likely have expedited the recovery process. This case illustrates the dire need for a new model of cooperation across donors both in times of crisis and for long term growth and development in nations receiving aid. Motivated both by the mandate for coordination as defined in international agreements, as well as these past challenges, we explore different attitudes and practices in the development community with respect to donor coordination. Our research question centers around whether donors respond to efforts to increase coordination and how they might be motivated to do so. More specifically, does referencing credible evidence on the benefits of donor harmonization induce project managers to take steps towards coordination? Does offering an incentive of public credit or invoking career incentives induce participation among donors? While opinions as to why fragmentation exists are plentiful, scoping these ideas will be an essential component of any effort to \u201cde-mystify\u201d donor coordination. Thus, this experiment is as much about identifying problems as it is about proposing solutions. Through an email and survey-based randomized evaluation, we will attempt to address these questions as well as identify barriers to coordination and whether donor institutions are actively encouraging coordination in the field. In light of the growing emphasis on aid effectiveness and transparency in international development, research and policy communities have promoted donor coordination as a key element of this endeavor. The 2005 Paris Declaration called for better \u201charmonization\u201d across donors and suggested that development efforts should be \u201cmore transparent and collectively effective.\u201d The declaration boldly states that improving aid effectiveness is not only \u201cnecessary,\u201d but also \u201cfeasible across all aid modalities.\u201d This operational tenet implies a great need for improvements in harmonization and collaboration across the spectrum of both donor and recipient countries; thus, the declaration develops a narrative for a new paradigm for foreign aid to that effect. Subsequent conferences at Accra in 2008 and Busan in 2011 continued the discussion of aid effectiveness, together forming the \u201cParis Agenda\u201d which highlights donor coordination as an essential element of aid improvement (Bigsten & Tengstam 2014). Outside these official channels, researchers have continued the discussion of the mechanics of donor fragmentation and its impact on the effectiveness of foreign aid delivery. The issue of how to address the effectiveness of foreign aid has been heavily debated topic both in policy and academic communities. Through the years it has become apparent that foreign aid in of itself is not a silver bullet for global poverty, bearing only a weak relationship with improved development outcomes (Bourgignon & Sundberg 2007; Easterly et al, 2003; Rajan and Subramainian, 2005). In the literature, recommendations for a renewed emphasis on country ownership of aid and performance-based allocation highlight the nuances of coordination strategies between donors and target countries. A Rahman and Sawada study in 2010 utilized OECD CRS data to study incidences of \u201cfree-riding\u201d among donors. The empirical results of the study suggest that competition among donors generates an insufficient supply of foreign aid, though coordination efforts alone may not solve this problem without accompanying reforms in the structure of donor incentives. One way to incentivize coordination may be to create a \u201crecognition\u201d incentive that publicly names donors participating in coordination. The resulting public and social stigma would pressure donors into coordinating at the risk of appearing unresponsive to calls for harmonization. In addition to suggesting a change in donor incentives, the Paris Agenda puts the burden on both donors and recipients to coordinate and reform the aid allocation process. Some have argued that it is the call for improved governance and management on the part of aid recipients embedded in the Paris Agenda that holds the greatest potential for improving aid effectiveness (Rogerson 2005). Moreover, Knack and Rahman (2007) find in their research on donor fragmentation that \u201ccompetitive donor practices...erode administrative capacity in recipient country governments.\u201d Proliferation of aid increases transaction costs to recipient governments, \u201coverwhelming\u201d recipients\u2019 ability to effectively organize and administer aid (Knack & Sawada 2012). In addition to decreasing the value of aid, proliferation has been shown to negatively impact recipient countries\u2019 economic growth (Kimura et al. 2007). Countries with higher amounts of concentrated aid appear to demonstrate increased aid effectiveness, though there appear to be diminishing returns to concentration. Kimura even states that \u201clack of international aid coordination leads to the lack of ownership and lower capacities of aid recipients and hinders their growth potential\u201d (2007). However, the impact of donor coordination requires much further research: as well as lowering transaction costs for recipients, coordination could adversely impact effectiveness by introducing the free-rider problem among coordinating donors (Kimura et al. 2007). A potential solution to aid proliferation is concentrating aid, or encouraging donors to focus on particular regions or countries (Acharya et al. 2006). While coordination is another possible solution, Acharya finds that it faces high negotiation costs as do other proposed remedies such as sector-wide approaches (SWAps), budget support, and sector specialization (2006). Some scholars remain even more skeptical, claiming that many econometric studies of aid effectiveness are susceptible to sample modification or additional controls and are thus fragile (Roodman 2007). Pursuing more randomized field experiments may help alleviate some of these concerns in the literature on donor coordination, impact on recipient countries, and overall aid effectiveness. It has been noted that coordination reduces transaction costs for donors and provides better allocation of donor dollars across recipient countries, though this assumes donors\u2019 primary goal is the eradication of global poverty (Bigsten and Tengstam 2014; Lawson 2009). In fact, divergent strategic interests and differing structures of bureaucratic incentives among aid agencies may be significant obstacles for donor coordination (Winters 2012). Studies on career motivation identify individual and situational or organizational characteristics as important factors of career decisions and behaviors (London 1983). The more importance an individual places on his or her career and the more an organization incentivizes advancement, the more likely individuals are to behave in ways that organizations deem optimal. For example, if a donor organization links coordination to career advancement and promotion, individuals may be more likely to participate in harmonization activities (if their individual career motivations are aligned accordingly). Shortly after the Paris Declaration, Bigsten (2006) suggested that differences across donors in terms of their respective rules and procedures complicate the aid allocation process and raises costs overall. In many cases, work is duplicated in the process of needs assessments and evaluations. Coordination problems may also be compounded by procedural nuances and language barriers. In a worst case scenario, the inefficiencies generated by donor fragmentation can undermine governance in recipient countries by overburdening governments and distorting incentives. At the time of the Paris Declaration and Accra Agenda, transaction costs were identified as a key obstacle to aid efficiency. Indeed, addressing the issue of transaction costs had been considered \u201cone of the fundamental objectives of the Paris Declaration.\u201d However, throughout the implementation process for the Agenda, it has become apparent that identifying the true nature of these transaction costs, much less addressing them, is easier said than done. On a broader scale, despite the notion that harmonization would likely lead to better development outcomes, coordinating across donors continues to be more widely embraced in theory than in practice. A 2010 US Congressional Report admitted that despite support for goals outlined in the Paris Declaration, the US lacks \u201ca comprehensive strategy for donor coordination.\u201d Indeed, Aldasoro et al. (2010) notes that the US has experienced \u201ca systematic decrease in coordination\u201d since the advent of the Paris Agenda. Across all donors, Nunnencamp, Ohler, & Thiele (2013) find that \u201caid fragmentation persisted after the Paris Declaration and coordination among donors has even weakened.\u201d Despite more overlap in aid, coordination shortcomings may be attributed to information asymmetries, non-altruistic goals of aid, and the proliferation of many diverse donor organizations on the international scene (Nunnencamp et al. 2013). Additionally, donors may be less willing to engage in coordination if they fear it may reduce country ownership of aid, another key principle outlined in the Paris Declaration (Winters 2012). In a study of harmonization obstacles to local governance aid in Indonesia, Winters finds that donors themselves create the barriers to coordination by hindering coordination of agencies within recipient governments (2012). Using an innovative network model connecting donor organizations, recipient countries, and aid sectors, Coscia, Hausmann & Hidalgo (2013) find coordination achieves roughly 60% of its maximum potential and advocate a more decentralized approach to coordination among donors. It is possible that donor harmonization is now being viewed as an unattainable, even annoying, ideal that is irksome to development professionals. The usage of the term \u201ccoordination\u201d may be problematic as it is rapidly becoming \u201cone of the most tired and deceptive terms in the business\u201d (Acharya et al. 2006). This experiment seeks to explain the nature of the dissonance between rhetoric and reality and whether it is an issue of motivation or simply a lack of appropriate tools and methodologies to facilitate cooperation. It is apparent that donor norms articulated in the agenda of Paris, Accra, and Busan along with other international initiatives embrace the notion of increased harmonization across donors as a way to improve development outcomes. However, as the literature above suggests, there exists a significant disparity between policy ideals and practice. In light of these observations, a number of questions emerge as to the feasibility of coordination at an operational level. Despite the generally favorable view of donor coordination in the literature, it remains unclear how individuals within the donor community view these international initiatives, the issue of coordination, and the role they play in facilitating it. Using an experimental approach, our study addresses existing attitudes toward coordination at the project management level in an attempt to understand the nature of the disconnect between international standards and their implementation. In short, we are asking if project managers inclined to coordinate, what motivates them to do so, and, if motivated, whether sufficient tools and mechanisms are in place to coordinate aid efforts.

Coordination is a time-intensive endeavor, requiring project managers to devote precious resources to activities in which they may not be truly motivated to participate. We use cooperation (defined as opening the email and clicking the link to the survey) in our coordination initiative as a proxy for actual interest in coordination and willingness to coordinate, or at least recognition of a need. By entering the survey, project managers have signaled their interest and willingness to dedicate time for coordination. In this experiment, we are testing different motivations for donor coordination using two sets of hypotheses: one set based on our two control conditions, and the other based on our three treatment conditions. First, we test donor reactions to the word \u201ccoordination.\u201d Our baseline condition does not include the term \u201ccoordination\u201d anywhere and does not include any motivational treatment language. Our second control condition also does not include motivational treatment language, but email subject lines will include the term \u201ccoordination.\u201d These two control conditions will serve as comparisons for treatment conditions and will also allow for tests of whether the use of the term \u201ccoordination\u201d impacts email open rates and survey completion rates. The three treatment conditions that we use in this study allow for hypotheses regarding various motivations for coordination. We expect that if (1) project managers perceive coordination as a mode to advance their careers, they will coordinate. Our second motivational treatment implies that if (2) credible evidence supports the practice of coordination, then, when presented with that evidence, project managers will coordinate. Our third and final motivational treatment suggests that if (3) there is public recognition tied to coordination, or alternately, public stigma tied to lack thereof, then project managers will elect to coordinate. We hypothesize that email open rates, survey start rates, and survey completion rates will be higher in all three of these treatment conditions than in the control conditions. \"", "q17": "\"Outcome Measure To adequately capture different motivational treatments and their impact on coordination efforts, we have embedded outcome measures progressively through the experiment. The first outcome measures the email open rate, which will capture subject-line treatment effects. This serves as a proxy for whether donors respond to attempts at coordination by measuring whether donors are at all interested in reading an email on coordination. The subject lines of treatment emails will mention donor coordination and echo the treatments embedded in the email. The first control email will not mention donor coordination at all in the subject line or email body, and will serve as a baseline for open rates of all emails. The second control email will have a subject line of only \u201cDonor Coordination Initiative,\u201d and will not include any motivating treatments. The second outcome measures the click-rate of the survey link and other treatment-specific links, capturing the email treatment effects. Clicking the survey link serves as a proxy for whether or not donors are motivated to coordinate conditional on what motivational treatment they have or have not received. The language of the treatment and control emails also contains various links to scholarly evidence or AidData\u2019s website, both of which back-up claims made in the email. Clicking these links indicates interest in gaining more knowledge about a treatment claim or AidData\u2019s organization. The third outcome measure tracks the completion rate of the survey and responses to survey questions. The survey is separated into three \u201cpages,\u201d so partial completion will be able to be tracked. Survey questions include descriptive information about the Task Team Leader\u2019s position, how long he or she has worked at the World Bank, the number and type of projects that he or she manages, and regional and sectoral specialization. Subsequent questions ask respondents to identify if they are currently participating in coordination efforts and if so, how they are coordinating with other donors. Additionally, Task Team Leaders will be asked to describe how coordination might be improved and to identify barriers and potential solutions to the problem of donor coordination. Donors will be asked if coordinating with other organizations is encouraged at their organization and whether it factors into decisions regarding promotion or recognition. The survey completion rate and answers to survey questions serve as a proxy for donor commitment to address an initiative to enhance coordination efforts. Treatment and Control Conditions As articulated above, our treatments will observe three different motivations to coordinate along with two controls, one with donor coordination language, the other neutral. The treatment language will be embedded in both email subject lines and the email body itself. The first control email will simply seek survey information about donors and will not mention donor coordination or harmonization, as these may be \u201cbuzzwords\u201d that could be offputting to some recipients. The subject line and email language will only mention a \u201cdonor survey\u201d to \u201clearn from development professionals about donor activities in the field.\u201d The second control will ask participants to participate in a \u201cdonor harmonization initiative\u201d by filling out the survey. It will reference previous donor harmonization efforts and their unclear effects via links in the treatment language text. Importantly, the two email controls will not provide other motivating language that may influence donors to coordinate. Public and social stigma will be used in the first treatment by telling donors that public credit will be given to donors participating in the initiative. A program report will be published on AidData.org, including a list of survey respondents who wish to be acknowledged for participating in this donor coordination effort. Donors choosing not to participate may be perceived as unable to coordinate due to other demands on their time and attention, or unwilling to comply with the recommendations for increasing aid effectiveness set forth in the Paris Agenda. From this perspective, a low response rate may still prove insightful as it continues to provide insight on what is or is not an effective approach to address coordination. The second treatment will seek to motivate donors through credible, scholarly evidence indicating why coordination improves aid outcomes. This treatment will specifically link to a 2007 study published in Journal of Development Economics by Knack and Rahman that suggests that donor fragmentation results in lower bureaucratic quality among recipients. Because \u201cgreater donor coordination should help to improve governance in the recipient countries,\u201d donors should support coordination efforts and take the survey. The final treatment will use encouragement from organizational superiors as a motivating factor for donor coordination. The World Bank and many other donor institutions have vocalized their support of coordination efforts in the abstract, acknowledging the problems inherent in aid fragmentation. In a speech to the World Health Assembly in May 2013, World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim stated that donor coordination should be central to the Bank\u2019s strategy, arguing that \u201c[donor] fragmentation is literally killing people. We must take action to fix it now.\u201d By citing this quote and implying the connection between donor coordination and successful outcomes for Task Team Leaders at the World Bank, this treatment will compel respondents to become involved in coordination and click the survey. In an effort to boost response rates, across all treatment and control groups, follow-up reminder emails to participate will be sent if respondents don\u2019t initially open the email. These reminders will include relevant treatment or control language. The survey itself will be uniform across participants. Subject Pool Subjects will be randomly assigned to control and treatment groups from a list of World Bank Task Team Leaders (TTLs). All subjects will be experienced employees of the World Bank with decision-making authority over project management in the field. We expect to send survey email treatments to about 1200 potential participants. However, the voluntary nature of participation in the survey allows participants to select in or out of the study at their own discretion, so we expect that our treatment-on-treated subject pool for the third outcome measure to be smaller. Randomization We will use block randomization to ensure balance between the three treatment groups and two control groups. From our pool of TTLs, we will block subjects by the aid sector of the project that the TTL managers identified in terms of World Bank sector breakdowns. For the purposes of this experiment, including maintaining blocks of a manageable size and retaining sufficient power, we have used the 10 main sectors identified by the World Bank\u2019s sectoral categories. We have coded the TTL portfolios in our sample accordingly using data from the primary sector of the project they manage. In addition to sectoral blocking, we will block participants by region where they primarily work. Projects are assigned one of seven regional codes, which we will use as the TTL\u2019s primary region of focus. Data Analysis Protocol Concerns regarding the sensitivity of our treatment language to existing attitudes in the donor community have prompted us to develop a pre-test protocol to assess the appropriateness of our intervention. Prior to launching the pilot study, we contacted 10-15 individuals at the World Bank, AidData, and other donor organizations with whom AidData has an established working relationship in order to screen our treatments, acquire feedback, and adapt the experimental design to maximize its effectiveness. We screened reaction to potential buzzwords such as \u201cdonor coordination\u201d and \u201caid harmonization\u201d and the experiment structure, and adjusted treatment language and formatting accordingly in preparation to launch the protocol. Once the pre-test results have been assessed and applied to our treatment protocol, we will launch the pilot phase to the sample population under a blocked approach to randomized assignment. Mailchimp will be used to deliver the treatment and control emails and track click-rates of the survey and embedded links, including AidData\u2019s website, reference materials like the Paris Declaration and, in some cases, additional sources which vary by treatment (see appendix for detailed treatment language). Qualtrics software will then be used to administer the survey and subsequently log the qualitative and binary responses from participants. Thus, utilizing Mailchimp and Qualtrics, we will observe quantitative outcome measures of opening the initial email and clicking on the survey, as well as the binary, qualitative, and scalar data provided by survey responses. Difference-in-means tests will be used to assess treatment effects across our treatment and control groups accompanied by logistic regression analysis with covariates as a robustness check. Covariates for analysis will include gender, work experience, project location and region, sector, and project size (based on the project\u2019s budget) gathered from our survey data and baseline data on the TTLs. Analysis Plan To distinguish the treatment effects across our three motivational email treatment groups, we will employ difference in means tests to analyze effects for each of the experimental conditions and controls. In order to adequately address the issue of balance across our sample and to control for any heterogeneity of outcomes, we will employ logit regression analysis with the covariates outlined above. This serves as an attempt to statistically control for the most measurable confounds. Planned covariates for analysis of treatment effects will include gender, number of projects a Task Team Leader has led as a proxy for experience level, as well as relevant project locations, sectors, and size. The survey itself (see appendix) will provide qualitative, categorical, and binary data for further research and analysis. The survey will be uniform across all treatment and control groups and is primarily for the purpose of our own learning. In an effort to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying challenges associated with coordination, respondents will be provided with an opportunity to identify key obstacles and challenges, articulate their views on the issue of donor fragmentation, and their perceptions of the culture of coordination at the World Bank. Additionally, respondents will be prompted to identify potential solutions or tools that they believe could help overcome the obstacles they have identified to facilitate improved coordination and more effective aid outcomes. Through summary statistics and qualitative data emerging from survey responses, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the coordination debate through an examination of trends in the characteristics of respondents and frequently identified obstacles to coordination.

T1, T2 and T3 are the treatment dummies for tariff 1 (loss-framed private interests), tariff 2 (gain-framed private and social interests) and tariff 3 (loss-framed private and social interests) respectively. The control group tariff is the gain-framed private interests tariff since this is the default method of marketing energy tariffs. Hypotheses 3-4 will be tested by creating pooled treatment and control groups. The equation will be the same as (1) and (2) above however the treatment dummies will be as follows: - to test H3: participants assigned to tariff 1 and 3 will be combined and compared to participants assigned to tariff 0 and 2. The latter serves as the control group. - to test H4: participants assigned to tariff 2 and 3 will be combined and compare to participants assigned to tariff 0 and 1. The latter serves as the control group. Heterogeneous treatment effects will be estimated by interacting treatment status with the variable of interest Z firstly without control variables as in equation (1) and then with control variables as in equation (2).
