Pathophysiologically it is based on neurodegeneration, which is associated with brain amyloid \u00df (A\u00df) deposition and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) burden. Both processes are known to begin years before the first symptoms of cognitive decline.The stage of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a preclinical stage of AD and describes a condition where healthy adults are concerned about a cognitive decline, while performance on neuropsychological testing is within normal limits and activities of daily living are preserved. Individuals with SCD with a biomarker-based evidence of AD are at higher risk for developing cognitive decline.\n\nWithin this systematic review and metaanalysis we want to investigate the estimated clinical progression rate to dementia in individuals with subjective cognitive decline with regard to their biomarker profile for Alzheimer's disease. \n\nMethod:\nThis systematic review employs a four-step search strategy. 1) First, search terms and search strings are developed and pretested in PubMed. Search strings are three-parted with one section referring to subjective cognitive decline, another to the biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and a third fraction consisting of the clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease. All parts will be combined using the Boolean Operator \u201cAND\u201d. 2) After the pretest, key publications will be identified and analyzed for wording used in title and abstract as well as index terms. This step\naims at expanding and adapting search terms to cover additional and divergent wording. 3) After search terms and search strings are finalized for PubMed, the search strategy will be adapted to each of the additional databases and\nthe actual search will be conducted in the following databases: 1. PubMed 2. Cochrane Library 3. PsycINFO. The reference list of all publications included in the review will be hand searched for additional studies that meet the following inclusion criteria: To be included in this review articles must be published in a peer-reviewed journal and written in English with full-text available. No time filters will be employed. Studies must include the detection of biomarkers for AD in CSF or by means of neuroimaging, such as Amyloid- and/or Tau-PET-CT. Articles will be screened by title and abstract for eligibility by two independent reviewers using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any discrepancies will be resolved through discussion and when necessary through review by a third reviewer. If eligibility is unclear, full text review will be undertaken of studies deemed potential eligible by title/abstract screening. Articles selected for full-text review will then be reviewed employing the same standard. Excluded articles will be coded for reason of exclusion. Data synthesis will be assisted by an evaluation matrix developed for the purpose of this review.

We control for repeated measures by utilizing linear mixed effects regression and modeling participant level random intercepts. \n\nBeliefs, perceived norms, and behavioral intentions are measured across five different preventative health behaviors: Leaving your home only for essentials; Avoiding face-to-face interactions with friends; Engaging in physical contact with no one other than those you live with; Self-quarantining if feeling sick for a minimum of 14 days; Regular hand washing for 20 seconds. \n\nAll measures across all behaviors are captured cross-sectionally using 0-100 sliding scales on the online Qualtrics survey platform. \n\nSee attached \u201cSurvey Language (Study 1)\u201d documents for all measurement specifics. \n", "conditions": "No conditions. This survey is cross-sectional and correlational, and involves no experimental manipulations. ", "hypothesis": "Our research question relates to (1) the (in)congruence between individuals\u2019 beliefs about COVID-19 prevention behaviors and their forecast of others\u2019 beliefs (i.e., perceived social norms) about such behavior, and (2) whether this incongruence is associated with intentions to engage in those behaviors in the future. All hypotheses will be tested in an American convenience sample. \n\nConfirmatory Hypothesis 1a predicts a pluralistic ignorance effect of norm-underestimation in participants\u2019 forecast of others\u2019 beliefs (perceived norms). We predict that participants' forecasts of others\u2019 beliefs about the importance and impact of COVID-19 prevention behaviors will be significantly lower than their own beliefs along those dimensions. \n\nExploratory Hypothesis 1b predicts that political orientation and reactance will moderate the pluralistic ignorance effect, such that mean difference between participants\u2019 own beliefs and their perceived norms will vary along participants\u2019 levels of self-reported political ideology and reactance. We make no explicit predictions as to the direction of moderation. \n\nExploratory Hypothesis 1c predicts that the mean differences between perceived norms and beliefs will be moderated by the specific behaviors and specific measures (importance and impact) being asked about. We make no explicit predictions as to what behavior/measure will exhibit relatively higher or lower levels of pluralistic ignorance. \n\nConfirmatory Hypothesis 2 predicts that participants\u2019 own beliefs and perceived norms will each independently and positively predict behavioral intentions. \n\nExploratory Hypothesis 3 will examine whether the within-participant difference between beliefs and perceived norms is uniquely associated with behavioral intentions. This is exploratory because we make no prediction as to which direction of the beliefs-norms difference will be uniquely associated with behavioral intentions. \n", "study_type": "Survey", "study_type_other": ""}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecac48", "text": "Social and Behavioral Sciences"}, {"id": "584240da54be81056cecac68", "text": "Psychology"}, {"id": "584240da54be81056cecaab6", "text": "Social Psychology"}]]}, "relationships": {"license": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a", "type": "licenses"}}, "children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=236cy", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "236cy", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "236cy", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/9wvqa/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "9wvqa", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hqd39/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "hqd39", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5d2d2268d28338002c2432d2/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5d2d2268d28338002c2432d2", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/236cy/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/236cy/"}}, {"id": "bkec9", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Countering COVID-19 misinformation with humor and active inoculation", "description": "The purpose of the study is to investigate different messaging strategies (active vs. passive inoculation, humor vs. non-humor) to identify which message strategy is most effective debunking misinformation about COVID-19.

While helminthiases have received national attention through mass deworming efforts, the epidemiology of intestinal protozoa in Niger remains underexamined. This study employed real-time PCR diagnostics to describe the prevalence of two schistosomes, four soil-transmitted helminths, and one protozoan parasite in Boboye Department, Dosso Region. Prevalence was assessed using bulk stool specimens collected from a population-based sample of 86 children residing in 9 communities. Anthropometric measurements were used to calculate child growth z-scores and stool consistency was graded. Helminths were absent from the study population, with the exception of a single Schistosoma haematobium infection (1/86; 1.2%). Giardia duodenalis was the only protozoa present, detected in 65% (56/86) of children. Prevalence of G. duodenalis peaked in 2-year-olds with 88% (15/17) positivity. The population was generally undernourished, though growth indices did not differ significantly between children with and without G. duodenalis infection.", "category": "project", "custom_citation":
