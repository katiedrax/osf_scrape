Participants will then complete two runs of an eye-tracking task with calibration performed before both runs. In each run, participants will see front-facing images of faces either before or after surgical treatment to correct hemifacial microsomia. Hemifacial microsomia is a developmental disorder that, without treatment, renders faces asymmetrical. Participants will see face images belonging to 17 different people before and after corrective treatment (N = 34 images). These images were then duplicated and mirrored, minimizing effects of left gaze bias and improving statistical power, resulting in a total of N = 68 images per run (Alpers, 2008; Alpers &amp; Gerdes, 2007; Meyer-Marcotty, Gerdes, Reuther, Stellzig-Eisenhauer, &amp; Alpers, 2010; Meyer-Marcotty, Gerdes, Stellzig-Eisenhauer, &amp; Alpers, 2011; Quast et al., 2018). Each image is shown to participants for 5 seconds in a pseudo-randomized fashion (both regarding order of appearance and the side of the screen on which it appears; Meyer-Marcotty et al., 2011; Warne, Hallac, Kane, Derderian, &amp; Seaward, 2019). Images will be separated by periods of fixation lasting 1.5 seconds. Each run takes around 10 minutes to complete. Four areas of interest (AOIs) have been defined on each face: cheek and ear (CE), forehead and orbit (FO), mandible and chin (MC), and nose and lips (NL). For each AOI, we will calculate numbers of and durations of fixations for each image.\n\nNext, participants will complete the Implicit Association Test (IAT), where they will associate good and bad words with people before and after surgery to correct a facial anomaly.

The effects of such biases on behavior, however, are poorly understood.

Importantly, we further predict that those people who look away most often will demonstrate the strongest implicit biases, and that this relationship will be mediated by trait disgust sensitivity.

Participants will then complete two runs of an eye-tracking task with calibration performed before both runs. In each run, participants will see front-facing images of faces either before or after surgical treatment to correct hemifacial microsomia. Hemifacial microsomia is a developmental disorder that, without treatment, renders faces asymmetrical. Participants will see face images belonging to 17 different people before and after corrective treatment (N = 34 images). These images were then duplicated and mirrored, minimizing effects of left gaze bias and improving statistical power, resulting in a total of N = 68 images per run (Alpers, 2008; Alpers &amp; Gerdes, 2007; Meyer-Marcotty, Gerdes, Reuther, Stellzig-Eisenhauer, &amp; Alpers, 2010; Meyer-Marcotty, Gerdes, Stellzig-Eisenhauer, &amp; Alpers, 2011; Quast et al., 2018).

For each AOI, we will calculate numbers of and durations of fixations for each image.\n\nNext, participants will complete the Implicit Association Test (IAT), where they will associate good and bad words with people before and after surgery to correct a facial anomaly.

Past research has shown that high social class is associated with beliefs about the essentialism of social class (Kraus &amp; Keltner, 2013), and high (vs. low) social class individuals are more likely to emphasize trait attributions rather than socio-environmental attributions (Kraus et al., 2012). As such, we predict individuals with higher SSC-Com should have less malleable lay beliefs about (a) intelligence and (b) social class and (c) more essentialist beliefs about social class (Hypothesis 1). These beliefs are chosen because they tap into the vertical, hierarchical nature of social class.  \n\nPersonal Relative Deprivation (PRD) is a measure of how unfair and disadvantaged an individual believes they are relative to a group or individual (Smith et al., 2012). As both SSC-Com and PRD have to do with an individual\u2019s rank relative to society, and as individuals with higher subjective social class generally feel less relative deprivation (Callan, Kim, Gheorghiu &amp; Matthews, 2017), we expect that SSC-Com is a negative predictor of PRD (Hypothesis 2). However, at the same time, individuals who experience higher levels of PRD are expected to feel like their current situation (in having less than they believe they deserve) is due to causes they cannot control, leading to a more fixed worldview. We expect PRD to predict less malleable lay beliefs of intelligence and social class and more essentialist beliefs about social class (Hypothesis 3).\n\nSocial Dominance Orientation (SDO), a measure of individuals\u2019 endorsement of beliefs of group hierarchy (Ho, Sidanius, Kteily, &amp; Sheehy-Skeffington, 2016), is also likely reflected in how individuals compare themselves with others in their community. We propose that individuals with higher levels of SSC-Com will also have higher levels of SDO (Hypothesis 4). In turn, greater endorsement of group hierarchy should also be reflected in less malleable lay beliefs about intelligence and social class and more essentialist beliefs about social class (Hypothesis 5). We also posit that the effects of SSC-Com on these beliefs are mediated through PRD (Hypothesis 6a) and SDO (Hypothesis 6b), which represent two facets of vertical hierarchy. \n\nAt the same time, there has been growing evidence for political conservatism as motivated cognition. Conservative individuals have various cognitive styles and mechanisms towards resisting change, justifying inequality, accepting current social structures, and endorsing group-based dominance (Jost et al., 2003; Van Hiel &amp; Mervielde, 2002). Endorsement of group-based dominance has been suggested to serve as a way for individuals to justify favourable social ranking and position of power over other groups (Schmitt, Branscombe &amp; Kappen, 2003) and liberals has consistently been shown to endorse less group-based dominance and more egalitarian values than conservatives (Kugler, Jost &amp; Noorbaloochi, 2014; Milojev et al., 2014). As such, liberals may favor more malleable and constructivist explanations overall. Since intelligence and class are desirable features, we expect conservatives to favor more fixed and dispositional explanations for their social ranking, a tendency that should increase with how well they think they are doing relative to others. In other words, we posit that higher SSC-Com will predict less malleable lay beliefs of intelligence and social class and more essentialist beliefs about social class for conservatives, but not for liberals (Hypothesis 1*). \n\nOther tenets of conservative ideology include resistance to change, acceptance of inequality, and acceptance of social structures. Accordingly, how deprived conservatives feel relative to similar others should be relatively stable regardless of their subjective social rank. We thus predict no significant effect of SSC-Com on PRD for conservatives, whereas for liberals we expect higher SSC-Com to predict lower levels of PRD (Hypothesis 2*). It follows that we predict the mediating effects of PRD to be significant for liberals but not for conservatives (Hypothesis 6a*). \n\nIn addition, greater endorsement of group hierarchy is associated with individuals of high status (Sidanius, Levin &amp; Pratto, 1996), and research suggests conservatives (relative to liberals) are more likely to have favourable self-enhancements (Wojcik et al., 2015) and have greater endorsement of group hierarchy (Van Hiel &amp; Mervielde, 2002). Taken together, these findings suggest that when conservatives perceive their subjective social status to be high, they would also have higher levels of SDO as a way to further enhance their status. We posit that for conservatives, SSC-Com predicts higher levels of SDO (Hypothesis 4*) and SDO mediates the effects of SSC-Com on lay beliefs about (a) intelligence and (b) social class and (c) essentialist beliefs about social class (Hypothesis 6b*). Since liberals have been shown to be lower than conservatives in self-enhancement as well as general endorsement for group hierarchy, we are agnostic about the effect of SSC-Com on SDO and the mediating role of SDO in the effects of SSC-Com on lay beliefs about (a) intelligence and (b) social class and (c) essentialist beliefs about social class for liberals. \n"}, "question6a": {"extra": [], "value": "N/A"}}}, "confirmatory-analyses-first": {"value": {"first": {"value": {"question1c": {"extra": [], "value": "For each variable, a composite score will be computed by averaging across items.

Past research has shown that high social class is associated with beliefs about the essentialism of social class (Kraus &amp; Keltner, 2013), and high (vs. low) social class individuals are more likely to emphasize trait attributions rather than socio-environmental attributions (Kraus et al., 2012).
