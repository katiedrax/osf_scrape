Additionally, we will measure the vividness of the visual image for each stimulus by asking participants \"How vivid was your visual image?\" on a 5-point-Likert scale (from 1. not vivid at all to 5. completely vivid as if I would see it).\n5. We will also measure people\u2019s ability to vividly imagine scenes and objects based on self-report via the Vividness of visual imagery questionnaire (VVIQ).  \n6. In addition, participants will fill out one part of the Vienna Art Interest and Art Knowledge Questionnaire (VAIAK), which measures Art Interest (Specker et. al, 2018).\n7. We will also collect the following demographic data: sex, age, and highest education degree.\n8.

The diagnosis is based on the composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI) \u2013 lifetime version 2.1, which is based on the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria (Burke, Regier, &amp; Sartorius, 1988). \nThe severity of the diagnosed disorder was measured by the life-chart questionnaire (Penninx et al., 2008).The life-chart interview retrospectively assesses the associated burden of present depression and/or anxiety symptoms for each month during the 9-year follow-up period. The symptom burden was rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0=no/minimal symptoms to 4= symptoms with severe burden. \nIn order to increase the accuracy of this retrospective assessment, the respondents were asked to name important events that happened during the follow-up period to refresh their memory.  Given that more recent assessments tend to be more accurate and given that health care use was also retrospectively assessed across 6-month periods, we decided to use assessments of symptom burden across the last 6 months before each follow-up assessment. \n\n\n2.\t Use of mental health-care assessed with the TIC-P questionnaire\n\nThe Tic-P is a generic questionnaire that includes 11 questions about type and frequency of health-care services used within the past 6 months (Bouwmans et al., 2013) .\n\n3.\tExplanatory variables for the post-hoc analysis \n \nDemographic variables: Sex (male, female), age, education. \n\nAttitudes towards mental health care: Nivel self-reported questionnaire. \n\nSubjective need: PNCQ interview.\n\nPresence of a chronic disease: Self-report questions chronic diseases.\n\nSeverity of depressive symptoms: Inventory of depressive symptoms. \n\nSeverity of anxiety symptoms: Beck anxiety index.\n\nSuicidal ideation:  Beck suicidal ideation.\n\nPresence of bipolar disorder: CIDI bipolar. \n\nPresence of post-traumatic stress disorder: PTSS-scale of complaints PSS-I. \n\nType of mental-health care setting: Tic-P.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "1.\tObjective need: composite score of the CIDI and the Life-time questionnaire \n\nIn order to enable the identification of mental health-care need over time we will develop a composite score of the CIDI questionnaire and the Life-time questionnaire.

We will therefore standardize each mental health-care service cost based on the CBS index costs (CBS, 2019).

For the analysis, Mplus and SPSS will be used. To identify the course-specific classes, latent class growth analysis (LCGA) will be performed for objective need and mental health-care use separately. LCGA is a statistical method, classifying individuals into classes based on their most probable longitudinal response patterns on each variable. It is a very suitable method to identify inter-individual differences in intra-individual change (Jung &amp; Wickrama, 2008). \n\nAfterwards, identified trajectories of these two variables will be combined. Thus, a parallel process latent class growth analysis (pp-LCGA) will be used to identify classes based on simultaneous trajectories for both variables, namely objective need and mental health-care use (Muth\u00e9n &amp; Muth\u00e9n, 2012). This can help to identify mismatch and match between trajectories of objective need and use of mental healthcare over time. The model fit will be assessed using criteria such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), to decide for the number of classes. \n\nOnce the classes have been identified, we will descriptively assess the relationship between the explanatory variables and the classes and conduct multiple comparison testing.

As LCGA is a data-exploration technique rather than a method to test a simple null-hypothesis, a power calculation can be simulated by means of a Monte Carlo study, in order to be able to decide whether a sample size is sufficient (Muth\u00e9n &amp; Muth\u00e9n, 2012)\n\n  Moreover, several previously published studies that successfully used LCGA to estimate subgroups with different depression course trajectories used smaller or comparable sample sizes(n=205-2,660) (Mowbray, Mcbeath, Bank, &amp; Newell, 2016; Wardenaar, Monden, Conradi, &amp; Jonge, 2015; Weeghel, Id, Schaefer, Weeghel, &amp; Mulder, 2019). We therefore assume having an adequate sample size to estimate meaningful classes. \n\n", "q15": "Not applicable ", "q20": "\nWe will generate composite scores for the main variables: mental health-care use and objective need, for further explanation see the above-mentioned sections. \n", "q21": "For the first analysis, we will estimate LCGA models with increasing numbers of classes and will use information criteria (Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion) to select the optimal model given the data (Hoyle, 2012). However, parsimony and interpretability will also be taken into account because these measures do not always agree.  \n\nFor the second analysis, the Bonferroni correction, confidence intervals and effect sized will be used when describing the groups post-hoc based on multiple comparisons. \n", "q22": "We will investigate the distribution of the data through boxplots and we will handle outliers by trimming or recoding to missing values (Wilcox RR, 2001). Furthermore, If the model cannot be identified because of potential remaining outliers we will use weighted least squares information instead of maximum likelihood estimation.", "q23": "For second analysis we will use multiple imputation, if the number of missing cases is large and can be compared to the complete cases. ", "q24": "In this study we will conduct an exploratory analysis, to identify different patterns of mismatch and match trajectories for objective need and mental health-care use. For the analysis, Mplus and SPSS will be used. To identify the course-specific classes, latent class growth analysis (LCGA) will be performed for objective need and mental health-care use separately. LCGA is a statistical method, classifying individuals into classes based on their most probable longitudinal response patterns on each variable. It is a very suitable method to identify inter-individual differences in intra-individual change (Jung &amp; Wickrama, 2008). \n\nAfterwards, identified trajectories of these two variables will be combined. Thus, a parallel process latent class growth analysis (pp-LCGA) will be used to identify classes based on simultaneous trajectories for both variables, namely objective need and mental health-care use (Muth\u00e9n &amp; Muth\u00e9n, 2012). This can help to identify mismatch and match between trajectories of objective need and use of mental healthcare over time. The model fit will be assessed using criteria such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), to decide for the number of classes. \n\nOnce the classes have been identified, we will descriptively assess the relationship between the explanatory variables and the classes and conduct multiple comparison testing. Therefore, depending on whether the outcome classes are ordinal or not, we will use ordinal logistic regression or multinomial logistic regression. \n", "q25": "Bibliography\n\nAdams, G.

NESDA is a multisite, naturalistic cohort study Netherland Study of Depression and Anxiety that investigates long-term courses of people with depression and/or anxiety and their use of different health-care services. The cohort consists of 2981 participants, aged 18-65 years. Recruitment took place at the GP, and in primary mental health-care and specialized mental health-care settings. The participants had (high risk of) depressive and/or anxiety disorders or were healthy controls. The data of the participants were collected at baseline and 1, 2, 4, 6 and 9 years after baseline. A more detailed description about the procedures of the NESDA study can be found elsewhere (Penninx et al., 2008).\n\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Outcome variables for the main analysis:\n\n1.\tObjective need \nObjective need is defined as the presence of a current (6 month prevalence) diagnosis and severity of a depressive and/or anxiety disorder. The diagnosis is based on the composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI) \u2013 lifetime version 2.1, which is based on the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria (Burke, Regier, &amp; Sartorius, 1988). \nThe severity of the diagnosed disorder was measured by the life-chart questionnaire (Penninx et al., 2008).The life-chart interview retrospectively assesses the associated burden of present depression and/or anxiety symptoms for each month during the 9-year follow-up period. The symptom burden was rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0=no/minimal symptoms to 4= symptoms with severe burden. \nIn order to increase the accuracy of this retrospective assessment, the respondents were asked to name important events that happened during the follow-up period to refresh their memory.  Given that more recent assessments tend to be more accurate and given that health care use was also retrospectively assessed across 6-month periods, we decided to use assessments of symptom burden across the last 6 months before each follow-up assessment. \n\n\n2.\t Use of mental health-care assessed with the TIC-P questionnaire\n\nThe Tic-P is a generic questionnaire that includes 11 questions about type and frequency of health-care services used within the past 6 months (Bouwmans et al., 2013) .\n\n3.\tExplanatory variables for the post-hoc analysis \n \nDemographic variables: Sex (male, female), age, education. \n\nAttitudes towards mental health care: Nivel self-reported questionnaire. \n\nSubjective need: PNCQ interview.\n\nPresence of a chronic disease: Self-report questions chronic diseases.\n\nSeverity of depressive symptoms: Inventory of depressive symptoms. \n\nSeverity of anxiety symptoms: Beck anxiety index.\n\nSuicidal ideation:  Beck suicidal ideation.\n\nPresence of bipolar disorder: CIDI bipolar. \n\nPresence of post-traumatic stress disorder: PTSS-scale of complaints PSS-I. \n\nType of mental-health care setting: Tic-P.\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "1.\tObjective need: composite score of the CIDI and the Life-time questionnaire \n\nIn order to enable the identification of mental health-care need over time we will develop a composite score of the CIDI questionnaire and the Life-time questionnaire. Therefore, to also include participants with no diagnosis, we aim to transform the initial 4-point scale of the Life-chart questionnaire into a 5-point scale, defining 0= no diagnosis, 1= diagnosis and no/minimal symptoms 2= diagnosis and mild symptoms, 3= diagnosis and moderate symptoms, 4= diagnosis severe/very severe. \n\n2.\tMental health-care use: Weighted scoring of the Tic-P questionnaire \nSince the severity of disorder determines the type of mental health-service and thus the corresponding costs for each session, we weighted each type of service differently, e.g. GP= 66 EUR and hospitalization=302 EUR (Roijen, Linden, Bouwmans, Kanters, &amp; Tan, 2015). We will therefore standardize each mental health-care service cost based on the CBS index costs (CBS, 2019). Afterwards a composite score will be generated for mental health care use by multiplying the frequency of usage with the standardized expenses for one session in each type of mental health-care service used, based on the Dutch guidelines for economic evaluations of health-care (Roijen et al., 2015)\n\n", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "We will use the parallel process latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to identify potential mismatch and match trajectories. \n\nWe will conduct multiple comparison testing for the second hypothesis, to describe these potential mismatch and match classes.

We will use structural MRI data and supervised machine learning to estimate each participant\u2019s brain age gap, that is the difference between the brain-predicted age and the chronological age of the individual. A larger brain age gap (indicative for accelerated brain aging) has been shown to be associated with various brain disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar spectrum disorders, multiple sclerosis, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia (Kaufmann et al., 2019). Consistently, a growing body of evidence suggests that brain age is linked to physical, cognitive and mental health (Cole, Marioni, Harris, &amp; Deary, 2019; Gaser &amp; Franke, 2019), and may serve as a prospective indicator for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Franke &amp; Gaser, 2012) as well as mortality (Cole et al., 2018). Due to its involvement in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, brain age also appears to be an encouraging marker for neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD.\n\nASD is associated with delays in developmental mile stones, such as delays in the development of motor skills (Provost, Lopez, &amp; Heimerl, 2007) and language (Matson, Mahan, Kozlowski, &amp; Shoemaker, 2010). This may suggest an underlying delay of brain development in individuals with ASD. Furthermore, previous studies have shown a link between ASD and pronounced age-related cortical thinning (Khundrakpam, Lewis, Kostopoulos, Carbonell, &amp; Evans, 2017) and initial increase followed by accelerated decrease in overall brain volume (Courchesne, Campbell, &amp; Solso, 2011; Lange et al., 2015). These findings may suggest that the brain ages prematurely in individuals with ASD. Nevertheless, Kaufman et al. (2019) directly investigated brain age in ASD and reported no significant differences in affected individuals when compared to healthy controls. The authors used data from the open source database ABIDE (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/), which provides a variety of MRI and psychometric data for individuals with ASD and healthy controls on a broad age spectrum. Notably, the vast majority of ABIDE participants, including those with ASD, show average or above-average intelligence (Di Martino et al., 2014). This raises the question whether individuals with ASD in the ABIDE dataset rather represent \u201chigh functioning ASD\u201d, which may result in only subtle differences in brain morphology when compared to healthy controls. In this case, research on brain ageing in ASD may crucially benefit from taking into account the available information on symptom severity and cognitive functioning.\n\nIn keeping with this, previous studies showed that more severe autistic symptoms are also accompanied by more pronounced structural brain aberrations (Chaste et al., 2013; Hazlett et al., 2017; Khundrakpam et al., 2017). Additionally, autistic symptoms typically improve with age, and especially repetitive behaviors can be mostly observed during childhood (Esbensen, Seltzer, Lam, &amp; Bodfish, 2009; Shattuck et al., 2007). Therefore, taking into account symptom severity might be more conclusive when looking at brain maturation in individuals with ASD than solely considering diagnosis status. Consequently, this study aims to investigate if symptom severity is associated with the extent to which brain ageing is altered in individuals with ASD.\n\nAlthough cognitive impairment is not a symptom of ASD, individuals with ASD often have an intellectual disability. Baio and colleagues (2018) found that among 8-years-old individuals with ASD, 31% had an intellectual disability (IQ \u2264 70) and 25% had an IQ lower than or equal to 85. The combination of ASD and intellectual disability is commonly referred to as \u201clow functioning ASD\u201d. Individuals with ASD and average or above-average IQ are usually more independent in everyday activities and have a higher chance of occupation (Billstedt, Gillberg, &amp; Gillberg, 2011). Although it is unclear how IQ relates to brain age in children and adolescents, in healthy adults, higher cognitive functioning has been associated with lower brain age gap (Poulton, Ramrakha, Caspi, Moffitt, &amp; Ahmad, 2019). On this account, we seek to investigate whether cognitive functioning is associated with brain age in a sample of children, adolescents and adults with and without ASD. In addition, higher levels of general intelligence might be a protective factor in ASD. Thus, we want to examine whether general intelligence may interact with diagnosis status and symptom severity, respectively, in predicting the biological age of the brain. \n\nWhile a lower brain age gap has commonly been linked to beneficial health outcomes, this may reasonably not apply to developmental disorders and cognitive functioning in children and adolescents. In an exploratory analysis, we will thus investigate if age moderates the association between brain age gap and each of our variables of interest (diagnosis status, symptom severity, and IQ).\n\n\nTo summarize, this study aims to investigate if diagnosis status, IQ, and diagnosis status x IQ impact the biological age of the brain. Further, we will address whether symptom severity, IQ, and symptom severity x IQ impact on brain age in individuals with ASD. In an exploratory manner, we will further address whether age moderates the associations between brain age and each of our variables of interest (diagnosis group, symptom severity, and IQ).\n\nReferences\n\nBaio, J., Wiggins, L., Christensen, D.

In the following, we describe the procedure of how we will derive brain age estimates. \n\nMRI preprocessing. Structural T1 magnetic resonance imaging data will be preprocessed using the voxel-based morphometry pipeline of cat12 (r1364, http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de) for spm12 (r7487) in Matlab 2018b. In brief, preprocessing involves affine and DARTEL registration of brain images to a reference brain, segmentation into gray matter, white matter, and cerebro-spinal fluid, bias correction for intensity inhomogeneity, and modulation of segmentations to account for the amount of volume changes due to spatial registration. Processed images will be smoothed by applying the 8x8x8mm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) gaussian kernel with subsequent resampling to 8mm3 voxel size. We have previously published a script with detailed cat12 settings on the OSF server (https://osf.io/pbd5w/).\n\nFeature set for machine learning. We will estimate the biological age of the brain from both gray and white matter segmentations. The preprocessed images will comprise 16128 voxels each. We will exclude voxels that do not show any variation across individuals (e.g. background voxels). Typically, voxel-based images are characterized by substantial spatial correlations. To remove redundant information and reduce dimensionality, we will conduct a principal component analysis (PCA) using the Matlab built-in function pca. Notably, Franke et al. (2010) reported a higher accuracy of the age estimation models when a larger number of principal components was entered into the prediction models. Our own previous analyses in unrelated data sets suggest that the first 500 principal components will capture more than 90% of the total variance, and will enable model training in a reasonable period of time with advanced computational resources.\n\nMachine learning algorithms. Age estimation models will be trained using a sparse Bayesian vector machine in Matlab (Tipping, 2001), and the gradient boosting package \u2018xgboost\u2019 v.0.82.1 in R (Chen et al., 2019). The relevance vector machine (RVM) was developed as a probabilistic equivalent to the popular support vector regression (SVR). It uses Bayesian inference and its solutions are particularly sparse in the sense that they utilize fewer kernel functions than SVR. We will make use of the RVM using the SparseBayes v.2 toolbox in Matlab with the wrapper and kernel function by Qiu (2019).\n\nFurther, we will apply the xgboost algorithms, which have been widely used in the field of supervised machine learning. We will train our models with both the tree and linear gradient booster. The learning rate will be set to eta = 0.02 with 5000 training iterations and an early-stopping after 50 iterations in the case of no further model improvement. The maximum tree depth will be set to 3. Default settings will be used for all other training parameters. We previously published an R script with the specified settings on the OSF server (https://osf.io/xdnjb/).\n\nModel training and application. Age estimation models will be trained with the first 500 principal components serving as features (as described above) and chronological age serving as outcome variable. Model training will be carried out in healthy controls by pursuing a tenfold cross-validation approach with 100 repeats. Models will be applied to both healthy controls (those who are not used for model training) and individuals with autism. We will randomly split the healthy control sample into ten equal-sized subsets. Nine of the ten subsets will serve as training sample, while the remaining subset and all individuals with autism will serve as test sample. Brain images of the training sample will undergo PCA, and transformation parameters will subsequently be applied to calculate pca scores in the test sample. After the first model is trained and tested, the next subset and all autism individuals serve as test sample, while the other nine healthy control subsets are selected as training sample. This procedure is carried on until each subset will have served exactly once as test sample. The tenfold cross-validation procedure will be repeated 100 times, so that 100 predictions will be made for each healthy control and 1000 predictions will be made for each autism individual. To carry out the analyses, we will adapt an R script that we previously published the OSF server (https://osf.io/xdnjb/).\n\nPrimary outcome variable. The tenfold cross-validation approach with 100 repeats will be performed for each tissue type (gray and white matter) and model type (relevance vector machine, xgboost tree, and xgboost linear). The resulting brain age estimates will be averaged for each tissue and model type. Subsequently, brain age gap will be calculated as the difference between the estimated brain age and the chronological age of the individual. Our primary outcome variable will be the grand mean of brain age gap estimates across all tissue and model types. We will also report results of the gray matter and white matter grand mean.\n\nReferences\n\nChen, T., He, T., Benesty, M., Khotilovich, V., Tang, Y., Cho, H., \u2026 Li, Y.

We will use structural MRI data and supervised machine learning to estimate each participant\u2019s brain age gap, that is the difference between the brain-predicted age and the chronological age of the individual. A larger brain age gap (indicative for accelerated brain aging) has been shown to be associated with various brain disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar spectrum disorders, multiple sclerosis, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia (Kaufmann et al., 2019). Consistently, a growing body of evidence suggests that brain age is linked to physical, cognitive and mental health (Cole, Marioni, Harris, &amp; Deary, 2019; Gaser &amp; Franke, 2019), and may serve as a prospective indicator for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Franke &amp; Gaser, 2012) as well as mortality (Cole et al., 2018). Due to its involvement in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, brain age also appears to be an encouraging marker for neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD.\n\nASD is associated with delays in developmental mile stones, such as delays in the development of motor skills (Provost, Lopez, &amp; Heimerl, 2007) and language (Matson, Mahan, Kozlowski, &amp; Shoemaker, 2010). This may suggest an underlying delay of brain development in individuals with ASD. Furthermore, previous studies have shown a link between ASD and pronounced age-related cortical thinning (Khundrakpam, Lewis, Kostopoulos, Carbonell, &amp; Evans, 2017) and initial increase followed by accelerated decrease in overall brain volume (Courchesne, Campbell, &amp; Solso, 2011; Lange et al., 2015). These findings may suggest that the brain ages prematurely in individuals with ASD. Nevertheless, Kaufman et al. (2019) directly investigated brain age in ASD and reported no significant differences in affected individuals when compared to healthy controls. The authors used data from the open source database ABIDE (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/), which provides a variety of MRI and psychometric data for individuals with ASD and healthy controls on a broad age spectrum. Notably, the vast majority of ABIDE participants, including those with ASD, show average or above-average intelligence (Di Martino et al., 2014). This raises the question whether individuals with ASD in the ABIDE dataset rather represent \u201chigh functioning ASD\u201d, which may result in only subtle differences in brain morphology when compared to healthy controls. In this case, research on brain ageing in ASD may crucially benefit from taking into account the available information on symptom severity and cognitive functioning.\n\nIn keeping with this, previous studies showed that more severe autistic symptoms are also accompanied by more pronounced structural brain aberrations (Chaste et al., 2013; Hazlett et al., 2017; Khundrakpam et al., 2017). Additionally, autistic symptoms typically improve with age, and especially repetitive behaviors can be mostly observed during childhood (Esbensen, Seltzer, Lam, &amp; Bodfish, 2009; Shattuck et al., 2007). Therefore, taking into account symptom severity might be more conclusive when looking at brain maturation in individuals with ASD than solely considering diagnosis status. Consequently, this study aims to investigate if symptom severity is associated with the extent to which brain ageing is altered in individuals with ASD.\n\nAlthough cognitive impairment is not a symptom of ASD, individuals with ASD often have an intellectual disability. Baio and colleagues (2018) found that among 8-years-old individuals with ASD, 31% had an intellectual disability (IQ \u2264 70) and 25% had an IQ lower than or equal to 85. The combination of ASD and intellectual disability is commonly referred to as \u201clow functioning ASD\u201d. Individuals with ASD and average or above-average IQ are usually more independent in everyday activities and have a higher chance of occupation (Billstedt, Gillberg, &amp; Gillberg, 2011). Although it is unclear how IQ relates to brain age in children and adolescents, in healthy adults, higher cognitive functioning has been associated with lower brain age gap (Poulton, Ramrakha, Caspi, Moffitt, &amp; Ahmad, 2019). On this account, we seek to investigate whether cognitive functioning is associated with brain age in a sample of children, adolescents and adults with and without ASD. In addition, higher levels of general intelligence might be a protective factor in ASD. Thus, we want to examine whether general intelligence may interact with diagnosis status and symptom severity, respectively, in predicting the biological age of the brain. \n\nWhile a lower brain age gap has commonly been linked to beneficial health outcomes, this may reasonably not apply to developmental disorders and cognitive functioning in children and adolescents. In an exploratory analysis, we will thus investigate if age moderates the association between brain age gap and each of our variables of interest (diagnosis status, symptom severity, and IQ).\n\n\nTo summarize, this study aims to investigate if diagnosis status, IQ, and diagnosis status x IQ impact the biological age of the brain. Further, we will address whether symptom severity, IQ, and symptom severity x IQ impact on brain age in individuals with ASD. In an exploratory manner, we will further address whether age moderates the associations between brain age and each of our variables of interest (diagnosis group, symptom severity, and IQ).\n\nReferences\n\nBaio, J., Wiggins, L., Christensen, D.

In the following, we describe the procedure of how we will derive brain age estimates. \n\nMRI preprocessing. Structural T1 magnetic resonance imaging data will be preprocessed using the voxel-based morphometry pipeline of cat12 (r1364, http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de) for spm12 (r7487) in Matlab 2018b. In brief, preprocessing involves affine and DARTEL registration of brain images to a reference brain, segmentation into gray matter, white matter, and cerebro-spinal fluid, bias correction for intensity inhomogeneity, and modulation of segmentations to account for the amount of volume changes due to spatial registration. Processed images will be smoothed by applying the 8x8x8mm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) gaussian kernel with subsequent resampling to 8mm3 voxel size. We have previously published a script with detailed cat12 settings on the OSF server (https://osf.io/pbd5w/).\n\nFeature set for machine learning. We will estimate the biological age of the brain from both gray and white matter segmentations. The preprocessed images will comprise 16128 voxels each. We will exclude voxels that do not show any variation across individuals (e.g. background voxels). Typically, voxel-based images are characterized by substantial spatial correlations. To remove redundant information and reduce dimensionality, we will conduct a principal component analysis (PCA) using the Matlab built-in function pca. Notably, Franke et al. (2010) reported a higher accuracy of the age estimation models when a larger number of principal components was entered into the prediction models. Our own previous analyses in unrelated data sets suggest that the first 500 principal components will capture more than 90% of the total variance, and will enable model training in a reasonable period of time with advanced computational resources.\n\nMachine learning algorithms. Age estimation models will be trained using a sparse Bayesian vector machine in Matlab (Tipping, 2001), and the gradient boosting package \u2018xgboost\u2019 v.0.82.1 in R (Chen et al., 2019). The relevance vector machine (RVM) was developed as a probabilistic equivalent to the popular support vector regression (SVR). It uses Bayesian inference and its solutions are particularly sparse in the sense that they utilize fewer kernel functions than SVR. We will make use of the RVM using the SparseBayes v.2 toolbox in Matlab with the wrapper and kernel function by Qiu (2019).\n\nFurther, we will apply the xgboost algorithms, which have been widely used in the field of supervised machine learning. We will train our models with both the tree and linear gradient booster. The learning rate will be set to eta = 0.02 with 5000 training iterations and an early-stopping after 50 iterations in the case of no further model improvement. The maximum tree depth will be set to 3. Default settings will be used for all other training parameters. We previously published an R script with the specified settings on the OSF server (https://osf.io/xdnjb/).\n\nModel training and application. Age estimation models will be trained with the first 500 principal components serving as features (as described above) and chronological age serving as outcome variable. Model training will be carried out in healthy controls by pursuing a tenfold cross-validation approach with 100 repeats. Models will be applied to both healthy controls (those who are not used for model training) and individuals with autism. We will randomly split the healthy control sample into ten equal-sized subsets. Nine of the ten subsets will serve as training sample, while the remaining subset and all individuals with autism will serve as test sample. Brain images of the training sample will undergo PCA, and transformation parameters will subsequently be applied to calculate pca scores in the test sample. After the first model is trained and tested, the next subset and all autism individuals serve as test sample, while the other nine healthy control subsets are selected as training sample. This procedure is carried on until each subset will have served exactly once as test sample. The tenfold cross-validation procedure will be repeated 100 times, so that 100 predictions will be made for each healthy control and 1000 predictions will be made for each autism individual. To carry out the analyses, we will adapt an R script that we previously published the OSF server (https://osf.io/xdnjb/).\n\nPrimary outcome variable. The tenfold cross-validation approach with 100 repeats will be performed for each tissue type (gray and white matter) and model type (relevance vector machine, xgboost tree, and xgboost linear). The resulting brain age estimates will be averaged for each tissue and model type. Subsequently, brain age gap will be calculated as the difference between the estimated brain age and the chronological age of the individual. Our primary outcome variable will be the grand mean of brain age gap estimates across all tissue and model types. We will also report results of the gray matter and white matter grand mean.\n\nReferences\n\nChen, T., He, T., Benesty, M., Khotilovich, V., Tang, Y., Cho, H., \u2026 Li, Y.

Avoidant responses will be scored as 1 (vs 0) and will be averaged per participant, per CS prior to statistical analysis.\n(5) To investigate whether the return of the availability of avoidance after extinction learning results in the recovery of the conditioned response during a re-extinction phase in high socially anxious participants, a repeated measures ANCOVA will be conducted with SCR towards the CS (CS+ vs CS-) added to the model as a within subject factor with SPIN, IU and trait anxiety scores added as continuous predictor variables. \n\n         Where a significant interaction is observed with social anxiety in the above analyses, we will perform follow-up pairwise comparisons on the estimated marginal means of the relevant conditions estimated at specific social anxiety values of + or \u2013 1 SD of the mean SPIN score. Similar analyses have been published elsewhere (Morriss, Macdonald, &amp; van Reekum, 2016; Morriss, McSorley, &amp; van Reekum, 2017). Further, In case of high collinearity possibly resulting in a null effect and to check for consistency of conclusions, we will ascertain whether social anxiety by itself is associated with these effects by repeating all ANCOVAs reported above with only the SPIN added to the model as a continuous predictor variable.\n\nExploratory Analysis \u2013 As above, any significant effects associated with IU or trait anxiety will be followed up with pairwise comparisons on the estimated marginal means of the relevant conditions estimated at specific IU/trait value of + or \u2013 1 SD of the mean IU/trait score. We will also examine whether higher social anxiety is associated with increased ratings of expectancy towards the CS+ throughout the task. We will conduct a 2 X 7 repeated measures ANCOVA with CS (CS+ vs CS-) and Time (mid acquisition, post acquisition, post avoidance learning, mid extinction, post extinction, post avoidance test, post re-extinction) as within subject factors and SPIN, IU and trait anxiety scores added as continuous predictor variables. Further, to examine the consistency of findings between self-report measures of social anxiety, we will repeat all analyses replacing SPIN scores with scores from the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (BFNES).     \n", "outliers": "Checks for outliers will not be performed for trait, IU and social anxiety scores. This is based on the premise that any identified outliers might reflect true variation in levels of anxiety or intolerance of uncertainty. This is also true for avoidance behaviour and US expectancy ratings. \n\nWe will check for outliers in our SCR data and will exclude any participant that displays a CS+ vs CS- difference score of + or \u2013 3 SD from the group mean. \n\nOnce data collection is complete, we will identify non-learners (individuals who do not learn the association between the CS+ and US) and non-responders (individuals who do not demonstrate a SCR in trials that do not include the US). We will first run the analyses including these participants and then again with these participants excluded. If excluding such participants does not change the pattern or significance of the results of SCR, for reasons of completeness we will include non-learners and non-responders in our analysis. If excluding such individuals alters the pattern or significance of SCR findings, non-learners and non-responders will be omitted from the analysis. ", "dependent": "We will measure skin conductance responses, expectancy ratings and avoidant behaviour during an associative threat learning and avoidance task. To assess social anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty and trait anxiety, we will administer the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) (Connor, Davidson, Churchill, Sherwood, Foa, &amp; Weisler), The Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (BFNES)(Carleton, McCreary, Norton, &amp; Asmundson, 2006), The Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS) (Freeton, Rh\u00e9aume, Letarte, Dugas, &amp; Ladouceur, 1994) and the trait version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg &amp; Jacobs, 1968). ", "conditions": "The experimental task will include five phases; threat acquisition, avoidance learning, response prevention and extinction learning, avoidance test, and re-extinction. All participants will complete all five phases. During threat acquisition, participants will be presented with images of the neutral facial expressions of two separate female identities (CS), appearing on the screen one at a time. The neutral expression of one of these individuals (CS+) will be paired with a loud female voice shouting \u201cGet lost\u201d and an electric shock (US) to the little finger during 50% of CS+ trials (i.e. a partial reinforcement schedule). The 50% pairing rate is designed to maximise the unpredictability of the CS+/US contingency. The other neutral face (CS-) will never be paired with the US or any other stimulus. During the avoidance learning phase, the CS+ and CS- will be presented in the same manner as during threat acquisition, however, participants will be given the opportunity to avoid the US on any given trial by pressing the space bar. If the participant chooses not to avoid they will always receive the US during CS+ trials, however, the US will never be presented during CS- trials, regardless of avoidant behaviour. If the participant chooses to avoid, the US will not be presented during that trial. The response prevention and extinction learning phase will then take place during which participants will be presented with the CS+ and CS- but with no opportunity to avoid and no reinforcement of the US. Next, in order to assess the persistence of avoidance responding, the opportunity to avoid will be returned within the avoidance test phase. During the avoidance test phase the US will never be presented. During a final re-extinction phase, the opportunity to avoid will again be removed in order to measure the persistence of threat extinction following renewed avoidance availability. \n\nConditioning contingencies will be counterbalanced across participants with half of participants receiving identity A paired with the US and the other half of participants receiving identity B paired with the US. \n", "hypothesis": "In this experiment, we primarily seek to examine the effects of social anxiety on the persistence of avoidance after threat extinction. \n\n We have several hypotheses: \n(1) During threat acquisition, all participants regardless of their level of social anxiety will exhibit greater levels of conditioned responding, indexed by larger skin conductance response (SCR) magnitudes and higher expectancy ratings, towards a learned threat (CS+) versus safety (CS-) cue. \n(2) During an avoidance learning phase, we expect high levels of social anxiety to be associated with increased avoidance of both learned threat (CS+) and safety (CS-) cues, indicated by a button press. \n(3) The extinction learning phase will be split into \u2018early\u2019 and \u2018late\u2019 phases (i.e. first 8 CS+ and CS- trials vs last 8 CS+ and CS- trials). We expect that during early threat extinction all participants, regardless of level of social anxiety, will demonstrate a significantly larger SCR towards the CS+ compared to the CS-. Also, we expect all participants to demonstrate successful threat extinction as demonstrated by a lack of differential SCR between the CS+ and CS-, during the late part of the extinction learning phase. \n(4) Following a threat extinction phase, we predict that high social anxiety will be associated with a stronger return of avoidant behaviour towards both threat (CS+) and safety cues (CS-) during an avoidance test phase.\n(5) The return of the availability of avoidance after threat extinction will result in the recovery of the conditioned response, as demonstrated by an elevated SCR to the CS+ compared to the CS-, in individuals exhibiting higher relative to lower levels of social anxiety. \n\nWe will test the specificity of social anxiety effects, as measured by the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN), by controlling for trait anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty (IU), both of which have been associated with deficits in safety learning within previous work (Morriss, Christakou, &amp; Van Reekum, 2015, 2016; Morriss &amp; van Reekum, 2019, Sehlmeyer et al., 2011). \n", "study_type": "Experiment"}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href":
