Borghi"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "The capability to build and use abstract concepts (ACs), such as \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d, is one of the hallmark of human cognition and one of the more sophisticated abilities we possess. Compared to concrete concepts (CCs), ACs have more heterogeneous members and do not possess a single object as referent (Borghi &amp; Binkofski, 2014). Furthermore, they are more detached from exteroceptive perceptual experience and may be more grounded in interoceptive experience (Barsalou, 2003; Connell &amp; Lynott, 2012; Connell, Lynott, &amp; Banks, 2018), more complex and variable within and across participants, and are characterized by linguistic and contextual variability to a larger extent than CCs (Falandays &amp; Spivey, 2019; Schwanenflugel, Akin, &amp; Luh, 1992). ACs are generally acquired later along development (AoA Age of Acquisition) and more through linguistic explanations than through perception, i.e., indicating their physical referents (MoA Modality of Acquisition) (Villani, Lugli, Liuzza, &amp; Borghi, in press; Wauters, Tellings, Van Bon, &amp; Van Haaften, 2003). \nAccording to multiple representation views (Borghi et al., 2017; Borghi &amp; Cimatti, 2009; Dove, 2011, 2018; Kousta, Vigliocco, Vinson, Andrews, &amp; Del Campo, 2011; Kousta, Vinson, &amp; Vigliocco, 2009; Newcombe, Campbell, Siakaluk, &amp; Pexman, 2012), ACs would be grounded in sensorimotor experience, like concrete ones, but they would activate to a larger extent linguistic, emotional and social experience associated to their referent. While much evidence have been provided, on the role played by both linguistic experience (review in (Borghi, Barca, Binkofski, Castelfranchi, et al., 2018; Lupyan &amp; Winter, 2018; Recchia &amp; Jones, 2012)) and emotional experience (e.g. (Kousta et al., 2011; Siakaluk, Knol, &amp; Pexman, 2014; Vigliocco, Perniss, &amp; Vinson, 2014) for ACs learning, the role of social experience has not received the same attention. \nThe multiple representation theory that has emphasized the role of sociality for ACs is the Words As social Tools (WAT) proposal (Borghi, Barca, Binkofski, Castelfranchi, et al., 2018; Borghi &amp; Binkofski, 2014). According to WAT, sociality would be crucial for both acquisition, representation and use of ACs (Fini &amp; Borghi, 2019). The acquisition of ACs would involve linguistic and social experience more than the acquisition of CCs, because the members of the latter are more heterogeneous and dissimilar. \nNumerous studies have recently shown that ACs processing involves the activation of the mouth motor system (Barca, Mazzuca, &amp; Borghi, 2017; Borghi, Barca, Binkofski, &amp; Tummolini, 2018; Borghi, Flumini, Cimatti, Marocco, &amp; Scorolli, 2011; Borghi &amp; Zarcone, 2016; Dreyer &amp; Pulverm\u00fcller, 2018; Ghio, Vaghi, Perani, &amp; Tettamanti, 2016; Granito, Scorolli, &amp; Borghi, 2015) (review in (Borghi, Barca, Binkofski, &amp; Tummolini, 2018)). We propose that the engagement of the mouth motor system might be required either to re-enact the experience of conceptual acquisition, to use inner speech to help us retrieve word meaning, or to prepare ourselves to refer to others that can complement our lacking knowledge. When we process ACs we would experience, indeed, the metacognitive feeling that our conceptual knowledge is not adequate (Shea, 2018), and we would prepare ourselves to ask the other\u2019s help \u2013 possibly authoritative others \u2013 to complement it (Prinz, 2014). \nThe present study aims at investigating the relationship between processing of ACs and the social dimension. Specifically, we will test whether the \u201csocial metacognition\u201d mechanism exists, and whether it influences our relationship with our informants/\u201cintellectual referents\u201d. In a first training phase participants will be shown images and will have to guess the concept they refer to. They will be allowed to ask for information to two confederates: one confederate will give them hints helpful to guess the CCs, another the ACs. Participants will be informed that these confederates can decide to what extent they will help them in the experimental phase by giving a different number of hints/suggestions taken from a list. Participants will then have to perform a joint-grasping, non-verbal, task with the two confederates, and finally another guessing section with the same persons. \n\n                                                      Experiment overview \n\nThe experiment will be composed by different phases. The first one is a familiarization phase: \nparticipants will be asked to perform an interactive task (\u201cJoint-Grasping Task\u201d (Candidi et al., 2017; Era, Candidi, Gandolfo, Sacheli, &amp; Aglioti, 2018; Gandolfo, Era, Tieri, Sacheli, &amp; Candidi, 2019; Moreau, Candidi, Era, Tieri, &amp; Aglioti, 2018; Lucia M. Sacheli, Candidi, Era, &amp; Aglioti, 2015; Lucia M. Sacheli, Christensen, et al., 2015; Lucia M. Sacheli, Tieri, Aglioti, &amp; Candidi, 2018)). They will face an avatar on the screen and they will have to predict the actions of the virtual partner in order to plan their own actions towards a bottle-shaped object. More specifically, participants will not be directly informed about which part of the bottle-shaped object they will have to grasp (either the upper part with a precision grip or the lower part with a power grip) but they will be asked to perform either imitative (both performing a precision grip or a power grip) or complementary actions (one performing a precision grip and the other a power grip, or vice-versa) with respect to the avatar\u2019s ones. Afterwards they will perform a concept guessing task: they will be shown photos and asked to guess the abstract or CCs that each picture evokes, by taking advantage of hints provided by the two different confederates (one for the abstract, one for the CCs). The second phase is the experimental one: participants will first perform the concept guessing task with either the confederate of abstract and of CCs using a subset of the available images, and immediately after they will perform the interactive task with the avatar. \nCrucially, although the perceptual appearance of the avatar will remain invariant, in a cover story participants will be told that the virtual character is embodying in real time the movements of the corresponding confederates, that are interacting with the participants from another room. \nWe hypothesize that, when participants are required to guess ACs, they might need more help from the partner compared to when they are asked to guess CCs. The attempt to gain the other\u2019s help should be reflected in promoting a successful, synchronous motor interaction with the avatar. It has been shown, that inducing a negative relationship between interacting individuals makes them achieve a worse performance in the \u201cJoint-Grasping task\u201d (Lucia Maria Sacheli, Candidi, Pavone, Tidoni, &amp; Aglioti, 2012), possibly suggesting that participants are representing each-others\u2019 actions less. Moreover, we hypothesize that participants will show more automatic imitation (visuo-motor interference effects) of the movements of the confederate helping them to guess ACs, to create a positive relationship with this person, because they need more the hints of the confederate to guess abstract than CCs. Indeed, it has been shown that the automatic and unconscious imitation of other\u2019s movements creates a positive social relationship between the interacting agents (Lakin &amp; Chartrand, 2003; Lakin, Jefferis, Cheng, &amp; Chartrand, 2003; Salazar K\u00e4mpf et al., 2017). The \u201cJoint Grasping Task\u201d that we are planning to use in the present study has been shown to elicit automatic imitation when participants perform complementary interactions both with a virtual (Candidi et al., 2017; Era, Candidi, et al., 2018; Gandolfo et al., 2019; Moreau et al., 2018; Lucia M. Sacheli, Candidi, et al., 2015; Lucia M. Sacheli, Christensen, et al., 2015; Lucia M. Sacheli et al., 2018) and with a human (Candidi et al., 2017; Curioni, Minio-Paluello, Sacheli, Candidi, &amp; Aglioti, 2017; Era, Candidi, et al., 2018; Lucia M. Sacheli, Tidoni, Pavone, Aglioti, &amp; Candidi, 2013; Lucia Maria Sacheli et al., 2012) partner.\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "We will strive to verify a twofold general hypothesis: \na) In order to guess the meaning of abstract compared with CCs participants would more heavily need the presence of others. Specifically, in our case more hints/suggestions will be necessary in order to guess the meaning of abstract than of concrete words. \nb) When interacting with a person who will help them in guessing abstract in comparison to CCs, participants will try to facilitate more the non-verbal interaction with the first, in order to have the benefit of her intellectual support. \nHypothesis 1 (directional): dependent variable = number of suggestions. We predict that the number of suggestions required by participants will be higher with ACs than with CCs \nHypothesis 2 (directional): VAS scale. Dependent variable: ratings. We predict that participants will evaluate that the contribution of others is more important for ACs than for CCs learning. \nHypothesis 3 (directional): interactive task. We predict that the synchrony between participant and the avatar and the automatic imitation (visuo-motor interference effects) of its movements will be higher with ACs than with CCs. \nSpecifically, we expect that the Grasping Asynchrony (GAsynchr), i.e., absolute value\nof time delay between the participant\u2019s and virtual character\u2019s index-thumb contact-times on the bottle-shaped object will be smaller with AC than CCs\u2019 partner.\nMoreover, we expect visuo-motor interference will be higher (when performing power grips, maximum wrist height will be higher during complementary compared to imitative movements, while maximum grip aperture will be bigger when performing precision grips in complementary actions compared to imitative ones) in the ACs condition in comparison to the CCs one.\n\n\n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Borghi", "q3": "The capability to build and use abstract concepts (ACs), such as \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d, is one of the hallmark of human cognition and one of the more sophisticated abilities we possess. Compared to concrete concepts (CCs), ACs have more heterogeneous members and do not possess a single object as referent (Borghi &amp; Binkofski, 2014). Furthermore, they are more detached from exteroceptive perceptual experience and may be more grounded in interoceptive experience (Barsalou, 2003; Connell &amp; Lynott, 2012; Connell, Lynott, &amp; Banks, 2018), more complex and variable within and across participants, and are characterized by linguistic and contextual variability to a larger extent than CCs (Falandays &amp; Spivey, 2019; Schwanenflugel, Akin, &amp; Luh, 1992). ACs are generally acquired later along development (AoA Age of Acquisition) and more through linguistic explanations than through perception, i.e., indicating their physical referents (MoA Modality of Acquisition) (Villani, Lugli, Liuzza, &amp; Borghi, in press; Wauters, Tellings, Van Bon, &amp; Van Haaften, 2003). \nAccording to multiple representation views (Borghi et al., 2017; Borghi &amp; Cimatti, 2009; Dove, 2011, 2018; Kousta, Vigliocco, Vinson, Andrews, &amp; Del Campo, 2011; Kousta, Vinson, &amp; Vigliocco, 2009; Newcombe, Campbell, Siakaluk, &amp; Pexman, 2012), ACs would be grounded in sensorimotor experience, like concrete ones, but they would activate to a larger extent linguistic, emotional and social experience associated to their referent. While much evidence have been provided, on the role played by both linguistic experience (review in (Borghi, Barca, Binkofski, Castelfranchi, et al., 2018; Lupyan &amp; Winter, 2018; Recchia &amp; Jones, 2012)) and emotional experience (e.g. (Kousta et al., 2011; Siakaluk, Knol, &amp; Pexman, 2014; Vigliocco, Perniss, &amp; Vinson, 2014) for ACs learning, the role of social experience has not received the same attention. \nThe multiple representation theory that has emphasized the role of sociality for ACs is the Words As social Tools (WAT) proposal (Borghi, Barca, Binkofski, Castelfranchi, et al., 2018; Borghi &amp; Binkofski, 2014). According to WAT, sociality would be crucial for both acquisition, representation and use of ACs (Fini &amp; Borghi, 2019). The acquisition of ACs would involve linguistic and social experience more than the acquisition of CCs, because the members of the latter are more heterogeneous and dissimilar. \nNumerous studies have recently shown that ACs processing involves the activation of the mouth motor system (Barca, Mazzuca, &amp; Borghi, 2017; Borghi, Barca, Binkofski, &amp; Tummolini, 2018; Borghi, Flumini, Cimatti, Marocco, &amp; Scorolli, 2011; Borghi &amp; Zarcone, 2016; Dreyer &amp; Pulverm\u00fcller, 2018; Ghio, Vaghi, Perani, &amp; Tettamanti, 2016; Granito, Scorolli, &amp; Borghi, 2015) (review in (Borghi, Barca, Binkofski, &amp; Tummolini, 2018)). We propose that the engagement of the mouth motor system might be required either to re-enact the experience of conceptual acquisition, to use inner speech to help us retrieve word meaning, or to prepare ourselves to refer to others that can complement our lacking knowledge. When we process ACs we would experience, indeed, the metacognitive feeling that our conceptual knowledge is not adequate (Shea, 2018), and we would prepare ourselves to ask the other\u2019s help \u2013 possibly authoritative others \u2013 to complement it (Prinz, 2014). \nThe present study aims at investigating the relationship between processing of ACs and the social dimension. Specifically, we will test whether the \u201csocial metacognition\u201d mechanism exists, and whether it influences our relationship with our informants/\u201cintellectual referents\u201d. In a first training phase participants will be shown images and will have to guess the concept they refer to. They will be allowed to ask for information to two confederates: one confederate will give them hints helpful to guess the CCs, another the ACs. Participants will be informed that these confederates can decide to what extent they will help them in the experimental phase by giving a different number of hints/suggestions taken from a list. Participants will then have to perform a joint-grasping, non-verbal, task with the two confederates, and finally another guessing section with the same persons. \n\n                                                      Experiment overview \n\nThe experiment will be composed by different phases. The first one is a familiarization phase: \nparticipants will be asked to perform an interactive task (\u201cJoint-Grasping Task\u201d (Candidi et al., 2017; Era, Candidi, Gandolfo, Sacheli, &amp; Aglioti, 2018; Gandolfo, Era, Tieri, Sacheli, &amp; Candidi, 2019; Moreau, Candidi, Era, Tieri, &amp; Aglioti, 2018; Lucia M. Sacheli, Candidi, Era, &amp; Aglioti, 2015; Lucia M. Sacheli, Christensen, et al., 2015; Lucia M. Sacheli, Tieri, Aglioti, &amp; Candidi, 2018)). They will face an avatar on the screen and they will have to predict the actions of the virtual partner in order to plan their own actions towards a bottle-shaped object. More specifically, participants will not be directly informed about which part of the bottle-shaped object they will have to grasp (either the upper part with a precision grip or the lower part with a power grip) but they will be asked to perform either imitative (both performing a precision grip or a power grip) or complementary actions (one performing a precision grip and the other a power grip, or vice-versa) with respect to the avatar\u2019s ones. Afterwards they will perform a concept guessing task: they will be shown photos and asked to guess the abstract or CCs that each picture evokes, by taking advantage of hints provided by the two different confederates (one for the abstract, one for the CCs). The second phase is the experimental one: participants will first perform the concept guessing task with either the confederate of abstract and of CCs using a subset of the available images, and immediately after they will perform the interactive task with the avatar. \nCrucially, although the perceptual appearance of the avatar will remain invariant, in a cover story participants will be told that the virtual character is embodying in real time the movements of the corresponding confederates, that are interacting with the participants from another room. \nWe hypothesize that, when participants are required to guess ACs, they might need more help from the partner compared to when they are asked to guess CCs. The attempt to gain the other\u2019s help should be reflected in promoting a successful, synchronous motor interaction with the avatar. It has been shown, that inducing a negative relationship between interacting individuals makes them achieve a worse performance in the \u201cJoint-Grasping task\u201d (Lucia Maria Sacheli, Candidi, Pavone, Tidoni, &amp; Aglioti, 2012), possibly suggesting that participants are representing each-others\u2019 actions less. Moreover, we hypothesize that participants will show more automatic imitation (visuo-motor interference effects) of the movements of the confederate helping them to guess ACs, to create a positive relationship with this person, because they need more the hints of the confederate to guess abstract than CCs. Indeed, it has been shown that the automatic and unconscious imitation of other\u2019s movements creates a positive social relationship between the interacting agents (Lakin &amp; Chartrand, 2003; Lakin, Jefferis, Cheng, &amp; Chartrand, 2003; Salazar K\u00e4mpf et al., 2017). The \u201cJoint Grasping Task\u201d that we are planning to use in the present study has been shown to elicit automatic imitation when participants perform complementary interactions both with a virtual (Candidi et al., 2017; Era, Candidi, et al., 2018; Gandolfo et al., 2019; Moreau et al., 2018; Lucia M. Sacheli, Candidi, et al., 2015; Lucia M. Sacheli, Christensen, et al., 2015; Lucia M. Sacheli et al., 2018) and with a human (Candidi et al., 2017; Curioni, Minio-Paluello, Sacheli, Candidi, &amp; Aglioti, 2017; Era, Candidi, et al., 2018; Lucia M. Sacheli, Tidoni, Pavone, Aglioti, &amp; Candidi, 2013; Lucia Maria Sacheli et al., 2012) partner.\n", "q4": "We will strive to verify a twofold general hypothesis: \na) In order to guess the meaning of abstract compared with CCs participants would more heavily need the presence of others. Specifically, in our case more hints/suggestions will be necessary in order to guess the meaning of abstract than of concrete words. \nb) When interacting with a person who will help them in guessing abstract in comparison to CCs, participants will try to facilitate more the non-verbal interaction with the first, in order to have the benefit of her intellectual support. \nHypothesis 1 (directional): dependent variable = number of suggestions. We predict that the number of suggestions required by participants will be higher with ACs than with CCs \nHypothesis 2 (directional): VAS scale. Dependent variable: ratings. We predict that participants will evaluate that the contribution of others is more important for ACs than for CCs learning. \nHypothesis 3 (directional): interactive task. We predict that the synchrony between participant and the avatar and the automatic imitation (visuo-motor interference effects) of its movements will be higher with ACs than with CCs. \nSpecifically, we expect that the Grasping Asynchrony (GAsynchr), i.e., absolute value\nof time delay between the participant\u2019s and virtual character\u2019s index-thumb contact-times on the bottle-shaped object will be smaller with AC than CCs\u2019 partner.\nMoreover, we expect visuo-motor interference will be higher (when performing power grips, maximum wrist height will be higher during complementary compared to imitative movements, while maximum grip aperture will be bigger when performing precision grips in complementary actions compared to imitative ones) in the ACs condition in comparison to the CCs one.\n\n\n", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

More specifically, we have set as expected effects sizes the eta squared values obtained by (Lucia M. Sacheli, Christensen, et al., 2015) (.4), where the same avatar interactive task was exploited. The output indicates that in a 2x2x2 within factors design,  a power of .95 and an eta squared of .4 (as in (Lucia M.

Generally, BF10 values greater than 3 indicate moderate evidence for the alternative over the null hypothesis. Conversely, BF10 lower than 1/3 is considered to provide moderate evidence in favour of the null hypothesis over the alternative (Jeffreys, 1961; Lee &amp; Wagenmakers, 2014). Bayesian statistical analyses will be performed using JASP (JASP version 0.8.12 (Love et al., 2015)).\nFor the Concept Guessing Task the Number of Suggestions and VAS scale will be analyzed by means of Paired-Sample T-Test to compare Abstract and CCs.\n", "q22": "Excluded from the analyses are those trials in which participants:\na) missed the touch-sensitive markers, preventing a response from being recorded, b) released the start button before the \u201cgo\u201d instruction, or c) did not respect their Imitative/Complementary instructions. \nAt the trial level, behavioral or kinematic values that fall 2.5 SDs above or below each individual mean for each experimental condition will be excluded as outliers.

groups that are seen as part of the stereotypes of US political parties. Specifically, it looks at whether changes in the stereotypes of a political party alter levels of attachment to that party. It also looks at whether stereotype changes affect the ideological placements of parties and individuals, policy positions of individuals, and whether changes in party stereotype alter the evaluations of particular political groups. Party identification is a central concept in the study of political science, yet there is little consensus regarding why individuals identify with particular parties, or why this identification may change over time. This project aims to further our understanding of party identification by exploring whether the strength of attachments that citizens hold towards particular parties is related to the social groups they ascribe to that party. I hypothesize that when individuals perceive that supporters of a particular party as demographically similar to themselves, they will feel a greater sense of attachment to that party, and conversely, when they perceive party supporters as dissimilar to themselves on demographic grounds, they will feel a weaker attachment to that party. This question has not been explored before, and an experimental approach is required in order to answer this research question.

Specifically, it looks at whether changes in the stereotypes of a political party alter levels of attachment to that party. It also looks at whether stereotype changes affect the ideological placements of parties and individuals, policy positions of individuals, and whether changes in party stereotype alter the evaluations of particular political groups. Party identification is a central concept in the study of political science, yet there is little consensus regarding why individuals identify with particular parties, or why this identification may change over time. This project aims to further our understanding of party identification by exploring whether the strength of attachments that citizens hold towards particular parties is related to the social groups they ascribe to that party. I hypothesize that when individuals perceive that supporters of a particular party as demographically similar to themselves, they will feel a greater sense of attachment to that party, and conversely, when they perceive party supporters as dissimilar to themselves on demographic grounds, they will feel a weaker attachment to that party. This question has not been explored before, and an experimental approach is required in order to answer this research question.

By \"performance-based voting\", we refer to the practice of conditioning vote choices on candidates' expected competence and effort at providing public goods to their constituents, in contrast to with affinity- or identity-based voting. Our goal is to test whether performance-based voting in municipal elections can be increased by providing voters with the opportunity to gain first-hand experience with municipal decision process. The experiment will be carried out in rural municipalities that are located within six of Burkina Faso's thirteen administrative regions. We conjecture that personal exposure to municipal decision processes induces greater awareness of and more personal reflection about the responsibilities of municipal politicians, in a more intensive and profound way than third-party-mediated information about municipal decision processes could normally be expected to. Greater awareness of the responsibilities of municipal politicians, in turn, could cause voters to place greater weight on their performance. Therefore, we expect that personal exposure to municipal decision processes will increase performance-based voting. The upcoming 2016 municipal elections in Burkina Faso offer a unique opportunity to investigate the relationship between personal exposure to municipal decision processes and performance-based voting. The reason is that under the current transitional regime, voters can be exposed to real-world municipal institutions and decision processes without simultaneously being exposed to either the incumbent government or to the opposition candidates. The elected municipal governments have been temporarily suspended and have been replaced by externally appointed special delegations that are not themselves contesting in the upcoming municipal elections. The members of the special delegations fulfill the responsibilities of the elected municipal councilors, and the presidents of the special delegations fulfill the responsibilities of the mayors. Municipal decision-making under the special delegations operates within the same legal framework as previously under the elected councils and mayors. This rare and unusual situation makes it possible to manipulate citizens' exposure to municipal decision processes relatively independently of citizens' informedness about the performance of the previous incumbent government, and vice versa. It becomes possible to disentangle the two processes much more than it would normally be possible and to test more directly how exposure to municipal decision processes alters voters' processing of and response to performance information. In the experiment, we use two sequential, cross-cutting treatments to manipulate both citizens' personal exposure to municipal decision processes, as well as their access to performance information about the previous incumbent, independently of one another. To manipulate citizens' personal exposure to municipal decision processes, our local collaboration partner, the Programme d'Appui aux Collectivit\u00e9s Territoriales (PACT) works with the presidents of the special delegations to personally invite randomly selected voting-age citizens from different villages to attend a special delegation meeting, typically for the first time in their lives. After completion of the citizen-invitation intervention, we provide a random subset of voters in the treatment and control groups of the meeting-invitation intervention with performance information about the previous incumbent municipal government. This performance information was collected in 2014, prior to the political transition. Therefore, it is unambiguously attributable to the previous elected municipal government, rather than to the non-elected interim government, and will be presented accordingly. Our primary outcomes of interest are (1) vote choice, (2) voter turnout, and (3) the weight voters give to performance information in their vote choice. The key hypotheses are specified below. We plan to submit a detailed research design document and pre-analysis plan prior to the implementation of the performance information treatment. The performance information treatment will be carried out in conjunction with a citizen survey that targets individuals assigned to the treatment and control conditions of the meeting-invitation intervention. This survey will take place prior to the 2016 municipal elections. The purpose of this initial design registration is to document the central hypotheses and research design features of this study prior to the public release of results from any other study that is part of the EGAP Metaketa cluster on information and voter behavior. At the time of the design registration, some details of the research design, sample and data analysis strategy for this study are still being finalized.

By \"performance-based voting\", we refer to the practice of conditioning vote choices on candidates' expected competence and effort at providing public goods to their constituents, in contrast to with affinity- or identity-based voting. Our goal is to test whether performance-based voting in municipal elections can be increased by providing voters with the opportunity to gain first-hand experience with municipal decision process. The experiment will be carried out in rural municipalities that are located within six of Burkina Faso's thirteen administrative regions. We conjecture that personal exposure to municipal decision processes induces greater awareness of and more personal reflection about the responsibilities of municipal politicians, in a more intensive and profound way than third-party-mediated information about municipal decision processes could normally be expected to. Greater awareness of the responsibilities of municipal politicians, in turn, could cause voters to place greater weight on their performance. Therefore, we expect that personal exposure to municipal decision processes will increase performance-based voting. The upcoming 2016 municipal elections in Burkina Faso offer a unique opportunity to investigate the relationship between personal exposure to municipal decision processes and performance-based voting. The reason is that under the current transitional regime, voters can be exposed to real-world municipal institutions and decision processes without simultaneously being exposed to either the incumbent government or to the opposition candidates. The elected municipal governments have been temporarily suspended and have been replaced by externally appointed special delegations that are not themselves contesting in the upcoming municipal elections. The members of the special delegations fulfill the responsibilities of the elected municipal councilors, and the presidents of the special delegations fulfill the responsibilities of the mayors. Municipal decision-making under the special delegations operates within the same legal framework as previously under the elected councils and mayors. This rare and unusual situation makes it possible to manipulate citizens' exposure to municipal decision processes relatively independently of citizens' informedness about the performance of the previous incumbent government, and vice versa. It becomes possible to disentangle the two processes much more than it would normally be possible and to test more directly how exposure to municipal decision processes alters voters' processing of and response to performance information. In the experiment, we use two sequential, cross-cutting treatments to manipulate both citizens' personal exposure to municipal decision processes, as well as their access to performance information about the previous incumbent, independently of one another. To manipulate citizens' personal exposure to municipal decision processes, our local collaboration partner, the Programme d'Appui aux Collectivit\u00e9s Territoriales (PACT) works with the presidents of the special delegations to personally invite randomly selected voting-age citizens from different villages to attend a special delegation meeting, typically for the first time in their lives. After completion of the citizen-invitation intervention, we provide a random subset of voters in the treatment and control groups of the meeting-invitation intervention with performance information about the previous incumbent municipal government. This performance information was collected in 2014, prior to the political transition. Therefore, it is unambiguously attributable to the previous elected municipal government, rather than to the non-elected interim government, and will be presented accordingly. Our primary outcomes of interest are (1) vote choice, (2) voter turnout, and (3) the weight voters give to performance information in their vote choice. The key hypotheses are specified below. We plan to submit a detailed research design document and pre-analysis plan prior to the implementation of the performance information treatment. The performance information treatment will be carried out in conjunction with a citizen survey that targets individuals assigned to the treatment and control conditions of the meeting-invitation intervention. This survey will take place prior to the 2016 municipal elections. The purpose of this initial design registration is to document the central hypotheses and research design features of this study prior to the public release of results from any other study that is part of the EGAP Metaketa cluster on information and voter behavior. At the time of the design registration, some details of the research design, sample and data analysis strategy for this study are still being finalized. We will not access data or results from any other Metaketa study until the pre-analysis plan for this study has been finalized.", "q16": "We seek to test three families of hypotheses, related to (1) the validation of our theoretical assumptions, (2) the effects of performance information, and (3) the effects of personal exposure to municipal decision processes. 1. Theoretical assumptions Hypothesis 1.1: The more enthusiastic a voter is about her most-preferred candidate, the greater is her motivation to vote. Hypothesis 1.2: The more indifferent a voter is between her most-preferred candidate and other candidates, the lower is her motivation to vote. 2. Effects of performance information Hypothesis 2.1a: Access to performance information increases pro-incumbent voting, if the incumbent's performance is better than the voter had expected. Hypothesis 2.1b: Access to performance information decreases pro-incumbent voting, if the incumbent's performance is worse than the voter had expected. 3. Effects of invitation to municipal council/special delegation meeting Hypothesis 3.1: Personal invitations to special delegation meetings reinforce the effect of performance information on vote choice. Hypothesis 3.2: Personal invitations to special delegation meetings cause voters to place greater weight on expected performance in forming their candidate preferences. Hypothesis 3.3: Personal invitations to a special delegation meeting increase citizens' motivation to vote.

politicians often express their ideas (Massaro & Stryker, 2012; Zarefsky, 1992). This political communication style runs counter to democratic virtues such as well-justified arguments and respectful interactions. Its use is therefore problematic from a normative point of view, yet there are indications that it is an effective communication style to persuade citizens. The goal of the present project is to investigate this tension and study the effects of politicians\u2019 uncivil and simplified debating style on 1) citizens\u2019 level of trust in politics, and 2) politicians\u2019 effectiveness to persuade citizens. We expect to find tensions as communication styles that are effective for politicians to persuade voters might not be beneficial to the evaluation of trustworthiness of the politician and political system (see e.g. Mutz & Reeves, 2005). Moreover, we expect these relationships to be moderated by individual level characteristics such as political cynicism and education level (see below, and see preregistration analysis plan for more details, pp. 4-7).

Second, the tension we expect to observe might be stronger when both elements are present in one political speech. In other words, we do not only compare uncivil versus civil communication, and simplified versus well-justified communication. We also compare political communication that is both uncivil and simplified to communication that is both civil and well-justified. The reason is that we expect effects to be stronger when politicians use a debating style that is both uncivil and simplified, because this means that politicians violate social norms twice: H3a: Politicians\u2019 combined use of uncivil language and simplified arguments leads to lower levels of trust in politics than civil language and well-justified arguments.

distances by text or voice as well as money transfers, the mobile phone holds immense potential, especially for those who traditionally face high costs and steep barriers to long-distance communication, access to information, and secure banking. Despite the exponential spread of mobile phones and their increasing adoption in digital development initiatives, such as financial inclusion, improved health and real-time citizen feedback, there have been few randomized controlled trials (RCT) that rigorously assess the effects of mobile phone ownership. This paper presents the research design for one of the first large-scale RCTs in this field focusing on women in Tanzania. Similar to other low-income countries, in Tanzania women are significantly less likely to own mobile phones than men. Our research seeks to better understand the consequences of this gender gap and how it can be overcome. The RCT presented in this paper represents the third phase of a multi-phase study we initiated in 2014 to assess the impact of mobile phone ownership on women\u2019s empowerment in Tanzania. Phase 1 was a small pilot conducted in 2014 over two months with some 50 women around Dar es Salaam. Working with Kidogo Kidogo, a social venture created to help close the mobile gender gap by providing low-income women with cost-free mobile handsets, we employed a wait-list experimental design (in which half of the participants received a basic phone handset [Nokia 105], SIM card and starter credit at the beginning of the study and the other half received the package at the end) to assess the short-term effects of mobile phone ownership among female small business owners. Phase 2 is also in collaboration with Kidogo Kidogo as well as the mobile network operator, Tigo. It is about to be implemented and will run for six months. It includes around 400 women in Rufiji and Kilwa Districts in Coastal Tanzania. In addition to the control and phone groups included in phase 1, it also includes a cash placebo condition\u2014in which some participants will randomly be assigned the equivalent of the phone package as an unconditional cash transfer. Phase 3 builds on and represents a major extension of Phase 1 and Phase 2. It will run for one year and include 2,000 women across Tanzania in urban, peri-urban and rural settings. Building on phase 2, phase 3 will include the cost-free distribution of basic mobile phones and a low-cash placebo ($25) as well as the introduction of smartphones and higher-cash placebo ($90). Through a full factorial design, the experiment will also include the assignment of data plans, solar electrical chargers, and onboarding (group distribution and training). In the rest of this paper we elaborate on the planned research in Phase 3, including the experimental design and procedures, the treatments and treatment assignments, and outcomes of interest and theoretical expectations. We begin with a discussion of the study\u2019s motivation and the findings from the Phase 1 pilot study. 2-MOTIVATION One of the most important advances over the last quarter century has been the advent of low-cost mobile phones and the subsequent introduction of smartphones. These devices have revolutionized not just communication but also banking, citizen engagement, and access to information for people worldwide (Cairncross 2001; Aker and Mbiti 2010). As fast as this technological revolution is spreading, mobile and smartphone ownership is far from universal. Critical disparities exist. Two of the most significant are the gender gap and the urban-rural gap. According to existing research, women are 14 percent less likely to own a mobile phone than men in a low or middle-income country (GSMA 2015). The gap is even starker among rural women. This differential access is important in that it potentially reinforces or even worsens social inequality\u2014a significant barrier to economic development. When women face political, social, and economic discrimination and marginalization, society as a whole is less productive, its institutions are less responsive, and it produces fewer public goods; these negative effects are also borne by future generations (World Bank 2012). At the micro-level, women without low-cost access to information and communication are denied the agency and voice that come from mobile phone technology (Klugman et al. 2014). Moreover, as mobile money platforms come to dominate personal banking in developing countries, unequal access of mobile phone technology prevents women and the rural poor from receiving the financial security and inclusion that comes from mobile money (Jack and Suri 2014; Kendall and Voorhies 2014; Gates 2015). Increasing evidence points to the negative effects of the mobile phone-ownership gap on uptake and use of digital financial services. Financial Inclusions Insights finds in Tanzania, the country of interest in this study, that rural women have the lowest usage rate of mobile money\u2014around 28% (compared to the national average of 48%)\u2014largely because they have the lowest mobile phone ownership rate\u201430% (compared to the national average of 60%) (Null et al 2015). This is not just a problem of the rural poor, however. Though the scale of the problem is smaller in urban areas, even among those around Dar es Salaam, the lack of cellphone ownership constrains mobile money use as we found in Phase 1 of our RCT (see discussion in section 3). Our study aims to directly address the question of the link between mobile phone ownership and use of mobile financial services. We are particularly interested in the pathway and conditions by which new phone owners become mobile money adoptees and mobile money users, enabling greater savings and fuller engagement with the formal economy. This study would directly complement the aforementioned financial inclusion tracking services and pioneering work by Jennifer Aker and colleagues (Aker et al. 2014) by providing rigorous evidence of the impact of mobile phone ownership on the uptake and use of digital financial services. To date there has been little experimental evidence brought to bear on this foundational step in the process of financial inclusion. But as is becoming clear, potential access to and ownership of mobile phone technology are not equivalent (Gates 2014). Until obstacles to mobile phone ownership for women, the poor, and rural residents are overcome, the development potential of mobile phone technology, especially digital financial services, will not be realized. 2.1-Banking the Unbanked: The Promise of Digital Financial Services In practice the lack of financial services means that most exchanges take place using cash, which entails significant transaction costs. It also puts large purchases or receipts at high risk of theft. And, perhaps most importantly, cash economies demotivate savings. Extensive evidence from psychology and behavioral economics suggests that humans engage in a form of \u201cmental accounting\u201d in which they treat various budget categories as having different levels of liquidity, with cash being the most likely to be spent immediately and savings the least (see Kahneman and Tversky 1984; Thaler 1980, 2015; Heath and Soll 1996; Hastings and Shapiro 2013). While access to financial services does not guarantee savings, of course, it does appear to significantly increase the likelihood that people will delay gratification and put money away for later use (Dupas et al. 2014)\u2014which has impressive downstream effects on household livelihood and on enabling credit markets. The challenge then becomes how to get poor people access to financial services in systems where barriers to formal banking\u2014through demanding reference requirements, prohibitive minimum balances, and extortionary withdrawal fees\u2014are exceptionally high (see Beck et al. 2008). Mobile financial platforms present a possible solution. Just as mobile phones circumvented the bureaucratic red tape and technical barriers of land-line telephony and therefore gave billions of poor people around the world access to communications technology for the first time, so too might the low entry barriers, ubiquity, and user friendliness of mobile money cause a leapfrogging of stodgy banking practices and an enabling of financial services for the poor. However, here again the gender gap plays a key role, as women are significantly less likely than men to own mobile phones and therefore to possess the platform necessary for mobile payments (Scharwatt and Minischetti 2014). While digital financial services are not a panacea, and users report problems with network systems going offline and agents proving unreliable (Altai Consulting 2015), prior studies suggest that mobile money indeed improves the range of financial services available to the poor and reduces their vulnerabilities to negative economic shocks (Jack and Suri 2014). Households using mobile money are more likely to save money, send or receive remittances, make other formal financial transactions, have a bank account, and own insurance (Mirzoyants 2013). Moreover, studies of certain sectors, such as smallholder farming, find that access to mobile money is associated with improved agricultural production and profitability related to greater investment in fertilizer, pesticides and hired labor and lower transaction costs in selling produce (Kikulwe, Fischer, and Qaim 2014). The potential objections to such observational studies, however, take aim at the direction of causality. Do people with better financial means and savvy happen to use mobile money, which therefore leads to a mere statistical correlation, or does mobile money actually cause improved financial services outcomes? To our knowledge only one randomized control trial, whose methodology enables an unambiguous answer to the question of causality, bears directly on this question. Aker, Boumnijel, McClelland and Tierney (2014) randomly assigned whether recipients of a cash transfer program in Niger received their payments in envelopes containing paper currency or through a mobile money platform. Interestingly, subjects who received the transfer through the mobile platform showed a greater diversity in their diets and their children on average ate more meals per day than subjects in the cash by envelope condition. Aker et al. (2014) speculate that this was likely due to the lower time demands of receiving the payments by cellphone than by traveling and waiting in line to collect the cash. The results of the study are provocative, but they leave open many questions about which factors condition the adoption of mobile financial services and subsequently lead to better outcomes. Randomized evaluation, because in expectation the random assignment of the intervention balances and therefore neutralizes all other potentially confounding factors, enables the precise estimation of causal effects. However, to our knowledge no randomized control trial has yet been performed that assesses the factors that cause uptake of mobile financial services for the poor. Given the importance of access to formal accounts and payments in combatting poverty, this study will therefore tackle the question in the most rigorous and scientific manner available. Curiously, no large-scale experiment assessing the general effects of mobile ownership on women\u2019s welfare has likewise yet been undertaken."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "One important question is whether we see treatment effects among women in rural areas of Tanzania. As educated, relatively well-off market traders and small-business owners with extensive prior phone experience, urban and even peri-urban are well-positioned to immediately take advantage of full phone ownership. They may not be as constrained by costs of charging or top-up credit. These factors may contribute to strong immediate impact of phone distribution that we have seen in a prior study (Roessler et al. 2014). On average, women in rural areas will be less educated, less independent and less well-off. Overall this may constrain their phone use. At the same time, however, as these women face steeper barriers to long-distance communication, access to information, and secure banking, even low levels of phone use may lead to significant improvements in terms of economic independence, empowerment and self-efficacy. A second key question is how phones compare as a development intervention to the equivalent value of the phone as cash. Introducing a placebo cash condition will be useful both methodologically and substantively. Methodologically, it will help to reduce concern that treatment effects are due to desirability bias from the experimental design (in which subjects report a positive change in their behavior not necessarily due to the benefits of the phone but because of a conscious or subconscious social desire to please the surveyors who distributed the valuable good). Substantively, it will speak to the broader policy question of the merits of technology transfers vs. unconditional cash transfers as poverty-alleviation tools. While there is growing evidence extolling the benefits of both mobile phone ownership and unconditional cash transfers, these two instruments have rarely been compared to each other. Is a woman better off receiving a phone that gives her the power of low-cost communication, information access and mobile banking or collecting the equivalent in cash (representing two weeks\u2019 worth of wages for the average Tanzanian) that she can decide how to use as she best sees fit? We thus will test the following primary hypotheses: H1: Bequests of cellular phones will significantly increase subjects\u2019 use of digital financial services compared to control in rural areas. H2: Bequests of cellular phones will significantly increase subjects\u2019 use of digital financial services compared to the placebo cash condition in rural areas. We will also evaluate the following secondary hypotheses: H3: Bequests of cellular phones will significantly increase subjects\u2019 subjective well-being in terms of economic welfare, social connectedness, healthcare quality, political empowerment, and personal security compared to control in rural areas. H4: Bequests of cellular phones will significantly increase subjects\u2019 subjective well-being in terms of economic welfare, social connectedness, healthcare quality, political empowerment, and personal security compared to the placebo cash condition in rural areas."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "To test the impact of mobile phone ownership on uptake and usage of digital financial services and downstream effects on women\u2019s empowerment, we are undertaking a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) among 400 mobile-less women in two districts of Pwani Region of Tanzania\u2014Rufiji and Kilwa. Treatment Conditions The experiment has three study groups. Mobile Phone Condition: Building on a pilot study carried out around Dar es Salaam in summer of 2014, one of the core treatments in Phase 2 will be the distribution of cost-free basic mobile handsets (such as the Nokia 105 mobile phone or equivalent) with SIM card, roughly $5 of starter credit, and a training session on how to use the phone (which includes instructions on how to add credit, check one\u2019s balance, make and receive calls, send SMS, register and use mobile money, and use the mobile money account for savings). 150 women will be assigned to the phone condition. Cash Placebo Condition: Another 100 women will be randomly assigned to receive an unconditional cash transfer of roughly $25 in Tanzanian Shillings (the equivalent value of the phone and sim card). The cash represents a \u201cplacebo\u201d condition\u2014in the sense that it simulates the actual treatment by giving the participants a valuable good but it does not contain the information, communication, and banking properties that come with the phone. Thus, it will help us to isolate the precise effects of these properties of interest (ICT + financial services) while helping to rule out any bias that may arise from social desirability effects in which subjects given a valuable good feel compelled to tell the enumerators what they believe the researchers want to hear. Accordingly, the placebo condition need not be cash; we could offer a radio that is the same value as the phone but does not it include the communication and banking properties. We prefer to use cash as the placebo condition, however, because it is valuable in its own right vis-\u00e0-vis the control group to learn how a sudden non-trivial windfall affects non-phone owners\u2019 use of digital financial services. Moreover, we could also learn whether participants who receive the cash transfer convert it into a phone, and if not, why not. Control Group: Finally, we will randomly assign 150 women to the control group. These women will not receive a phone or cash transfer until the study is completed. Recruitment and Random Assignment to Treatment In this study we are targeting female smallholder farmers living in the Rufiji and Kilwa Districts of Pwani Region, Tanzania. Recruitment and screening of participants for mobile phone ownership prior to the start of the study will be undertaken by the Journalists Environmental Association of Tanzania (JET), an NGO that works to promote good governance, sustainable agricultural practices, and climate change mitigation in Tanzania. JET will recruit participants from the regular network of farmers it works within the districts. To reduce adverse selection into the program by existing phone owners, during initial recruitment and screening of non-phone owners, potential participants will be informed about a new development program for non-phone owners that JET is planning in conjunction with its partner, CARE International, but they will not learn it involves the distribution of cost-free phones. For those who are then eligible for the program and consent to participate, a team of female enumerators from REPOA, a research institute in Tanzania, will provide the participants with additional information and see if they are still interested in the program. Participants will be read the following prompt: \u201cThe Journalists Environmental Association of Tanzania (JET) and CARE International are working together on a program initiative in your area. The program is in partnership with the mobile network operator, Tigo Tanzania, and Kidogo Kidogo\u2014a social enterprise that works with women in Tanzania. The program entails the provision of mobile phones or a small cash grant to women who do not already own a phone. If you do already own a phone, unfortunately, you are not eligible to participate. Tigo and Kidogo Kidogo are undertaking this initiative because they think it is important that everyone has access to mobile phones. It decided to work with JET and CARE because of the great work the organizations are doing in your districts. Each person selected for the program will receive a mobile phone with a Tigo sim card or a cash grant. The phone packages are donated free of cost from Kidogo Kidogo and Tigo and are the property of the program recipient. The cash is provided by JET and CARE and can be used however the recipient decides is best. It is important to note: though everyone in the program will receive a mobile phone or cash, unfortunately at this time, Tigo and Kidogo Kidogo do not have enough phones available to give to everyone right now. But don\u2019t worry; they are going to get more phones soon. If you don\u2019t receive a phone or cash grant now, you will get one as the rest of the phones become available, probably in a few months. To determine how to distribute the phones that are available now, Kidogo Kidogo and Tigo will use a lottery or luck of the draw. Each person who agrees to participate in the program will be entered into the lottery. Kidogo Kidogo and Tigo will then randomly draw names based on the number of phones they have available. If your name is drawn, you will be notified by JET and someone from Kidogo Kidogo will come to give you the phone in the near future. Others will be notified once Kidogo Kidogo and Tigo acquire more phones.\u201d If a respondent consents to participate, we will then proceed to ask them if they would be willing to take part in a survey. The survey will establish baseline levels of mobile phone access, use of digital financial services, socio-economic characteristics, individual efficacy, employment and farming practices, social connectedness, level of income generation and savings, household gender roles and bargaining, and political participation. After the baseline, we will then randomly assign individuals to the main treatment conditions (control, phone group or cash group) using the data collected from the survey to block randomize on village, age, socio-economic status, and current phone access. Distribution of Intervention A week or so after the completion of the baseline survey, those participants who have been assigned to the phone and cash groups will be notified by JET. The women in the phone group will be invited to a training workshop where they will receive their phone and a training session on its use. The women in the cash group will also be invited to a pick up their cash from a JET officer."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Tanzania"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "400"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "BYU: X15229"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "30-Jul-15"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q32": {"extra": [], "value": "C93, D14, G21"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design", "Field Experiments", "Statistics"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Development", "Gender"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e38422657427b01630c41bf", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/dpsqr/providers/osfstorage/5e38422657427b01630c41bf", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/dpsqr/providers/osfstorage/5e38422657427b01630c41bf", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/dpsqr/providers/osfstorage/5e38422657427b01630c41bf?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/dpsqr/providers/osfstorage/5e38422657427b01630c41bf"}, "attributes": {"etag": "777e48ecfb403b020c1fa07b4d7f32002cce1c30629e732f5614e7caed77daea", "kind": "file", "name": "20151119AB_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e38422657427b01630c41bf", "size": 583102, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "82ae22f00472350866e9c83afc3df83c", "sha256": "c643ae73b6fae3c30c241c75144cdb034db9dec7f441630aa2fee5d178d256cd"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 583102, "modified": "2020-02-03T15:54:14.387542+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "dpsqr", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20151119AB_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T15:54:14+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "dpsqr", "sha256": "c643ae73b6fae3c30c241c75144cdb034db9dec7f441630aa2fee5d178d256cd", "viewUrl": "/project/39fnp/files/osfstorage/5e38422a57427b016c0c3ca4/", "selectedFileName": "20151119AB_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20151119AB_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Please Hold the Phone: A Field Experiment on Mobile Technology, Uptake of Digital Financial Services and Women\u2019s Empowerment", "q2": "Philip Roessler | Daniel Nielson | Flora Myamba", "q3": "20151119AB", "q4": "11/20/2015 - 04:45", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to any research activities", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "11/19/15", "q12": "", "q13": "Yes", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "1-INTRODUCTION As a low-cost device that enables instant communication over vast distances by text or voice as well as money transfers, the mobile phone holds immense potential, especially for those who traditionally face high costs and steep barriers to long-distance communication, access to information, and secure banking.

Just as mobile phones circumvented the bureaucratic red tape and technical barriers of land-line telephony and therefore gave billions of poor people around the world access to communications technology for the first time, so too might the low entry barriers, ubiquity, and user friendliness of mobile money cause a leapfrogging of stodgy banking practices and an enabling of financial services for the poor. However, here again the gender gap plays a key role, as women are significantly less likely than men to own mobile phones and therefore to possess the platform necessary for mobile payments (Scharwatt and Minischetti 2014). While digital financial services are not a panacea, and users report problems with network systems going offline and agents proving unreliable (Altai Consulting 2015), prior studies suggest that mobile money indeed improves the range of financial services available to the poor and reduces their vulnerabilities to negative economic shocks (Jack and Suri 2014). Households using mobile money are more likely to save money, send or receive remittances, make other formal financial transactions, have a bank account, and own insurance (Mirzoyants 2013). Moreover, studies of certain sectors, such as smallholder farming, find that access to mobile money is associated with improved agricultural production and profitability related to greater investment in fertilizer, pesticides and hired labor and lower transaction costs in selling produce (Kikulwe, Fischer, and Qaim 2014). The potential objections to such observational studies, however, take aim at the direction of causality. Do people with better financial means and savvy happen to use mobile money, which therefore leads to a mere statistical correlation, or does mobile money actually cause improved financial services outcomes? To our knowledge only one randomized control trial, whose methodology enables an unambiguous answer to the question of causality, bears directly on this question. Aker, Boumnijel, McClelland and Tierney (2014) randomly assigned whether recipients of a cash transfer program in Niger received their payments in envelopes containing paper currency or through a mobile money platform. Interestingly, subjects who received the transfer through the mobile platform showed a greater diversity in their diets and their children on average ate more meals per day than subjects in the cash by envelope condition. Aker et al. (2014) speculate that this was likely due to the lower time demands of receiving the payments by cellphone than by traveling and waiting in line to collect the cash. The results of the study are provocative, but they leave open many questions about which factors condition the adoption of mobile financial services and subsequently lead to better outcomes. Randomized evaluation, because in expectation the random assignment of the intervention balances and therefore neutralizes all other potentially confounding factors, enables the precise estimation of causal effects. However, to our knowledge no randomized control trial has yet been performed that assesses the factors that cause uptake of mobile financial services for the poor. Given the importance of access to formal accounts and payments in combatting poverty, this study will therefore tackle the question in the most rigorous and scientific manner available. Curiously, no large-scale experiment assessing the general effects of mobile ownership on women\u2019s welfare has likewise yet been undertaken.", "q16": "One important question is whether we see treatment effects among women in rural areas of Tanzania. As educated, relatively well-off market traders and small-business owners with extensive prior phone experience, urban and even peri-urban are well-positioned to immediately take advantage of full phone ownership. They may not be as constrained by costs of charging or top-up credit. These factors may contribute to strong immediate impact of phone distribution that we have seen in a prior study (Roessler et al. 2014). On average, women in rural areas will be less educated, less independent and less well-off. Overall this may constrain their phone use. At the same time, however, as these women face steeper barriers to long-distance communication, access to information, and secure banking, even low levels of phone use may lead to significant improvements in terms of economic independence, empowerment and self-efficacy. A second key question is how phones compare as a development intervention to the equivalent value of the phone as cash. Introducing a placebo cash condition will be useful both methodologically and substantively. Methodologically, it will help to reduce concern that treatment effects are due to desirability bias from the experimental design (in which subjects report a positive change in their behavior not necessarily due to the benefits of the phone but because of a conscious or subconscious social desire to please the surveyors who distributed the valuable good). Substantively, it will speak to the broader policy question of the merits of technology transfers vs. unconditional cash transfers as poverty-alleviation tools. While there is growing evidence extolling the benefits of both mobile phone ownership and unconditional cash transfers, these two instruments have rarely been compared to each other. Is a woman better off receiving a phone that gives her the power of low-cost communication, information access and mobile banking or collecting the equivalent in cash (representing two weeks\u2019 worth of wages for the average Tanzanian) that she can decide how to use as she best sees fit? We thus will test the following primary hypotheses: H1: Bequests of cellular phones will significantly increase subjects\u2019 use of digital financial services compared to control in rural areas. H2: Bequests of cellular phones will significantly increase subjects\u2019 use of digital financial services compared to the placebo cash condition in rural areas. We will also evaluate the following secondary hypotheses: H3: Bequests of cellular phones will significantly increase subjects\u2019 subjective well-being in terms of economic welfare, social connectedness, healthcare quality, political empowerment, and personal security compared to control in rural areas. H4: Bequests of cellular phones will significantly increase subjects\u2019 subjective well-being in terms of economic welfare, social connectedness, healthcare quality, political empowerment, and personal security compared to the placebo cash condition in rural areas.", "q17": "To test the impact of mobile phone ownership on uptake and usage of digital financial services and downstream effects on women\u2019s empowerment, we are undertaking a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) among 400 mobile-less women in two districts of Pwani Region of Tanzania\u2014Rufiji and Kilwa. Treatment Conditions The experiment has three study groups. Mobile Phone Condition: Building on a pilot study carried out around Dar es Salaam in summer of 2014, one of the core treatments in Phase 2 will be the distribution of cost-free basic mobile handsets (such as the Nokia 105 mobile phone or equivalent) with SIM card, roughly $5 of starter credit, and a training session on how to use the phone (which includes instructions on how to add credit, check one\u2019s balance, make and receive calls, send SMS, register and use mobile money, and use the mobile money account for savings). 150 women will be assigned to the phone condition. Cash Placebo Condition: Another 100 women will be randomly assigned to receive an unconditional cash transfer of roughly $25 in Tanzanian Shillings (the equivalent value of the phone and sim card). The cash represents a \u201cplacebo\u201d condition\u2014in the sense that it simulates the actual treatment by giving the participants a valuable good but it does not contain the information, communication, and banking properties that come with the phone. Thus, it will help us to isolate the precise effects of these properties of interest (ICT + financial services) while helping to rule out any bias that may arise from social desirability effects in which subjects given a valuable good feel compelled to tell the enumerators what they believe the researchers want to hear. Accordingly, the placebo condition need not be cash; we could offer a radio that is the same value as the phone but does not it include the communication and banking properties. We prefer to use cash as the placebo condition, however, because it is valuable in its own right vis-\u00e0-vis the control group to learn how a sudden non-trivial windfall affects non-phone owners\u2019 use of digital financial services. Moreover, we could also learn whether participants who receive the cash transfer convert it into a phone, and if not, why not. Control Group: Finally, we will randomly assign 150 women to the control group. These women will not receive a phone or cash transfer until the study is completed. Recruitment and Random Assignment to Treatment In this study we are targeting female smallholder farmers living in the Rufiji and Kilwa Districts of Pwani Region, Tanzania. Recruitment and screening of participants for mobile phone ownership prior to the start of the study will be undertaken by the Journalists Environmental Association of Tanzania (JET), an NGO that works to promote good governance, sustainable agricultural practices, and climate change mitigation in Tanzania. JET will recruit participants from the regular network of farmers it works within the districts. To reduce adverse selection into the program by existing phone owners, during initial recruitment and screening of non-phone owners, potential participants will be informed about a new development program for non-phone owners that JET is planning in conjunction with its partner, CARE International, but they will not learn it involves the distribution of cost-free phones. For those who are then eligible for the program and consent to participate, a team of female enumerators from REPOA, a research institute in Tanzania, will provide the participants with additional information and see if they are still interested in the program. Participants will be read the following prompt: \u201cThe Journalists Environmental Association of Tanzania (JET) and CARE International are working together on a program initiative in your area. The program is in partnership with the mobile network operator, Tigo Tanzania, and Kidogo Kidogo\u2014a social enterprise that works with women in Tanzania. The program entails the provision of mobile phones or a small cash grant to women who do not already own a phone. If you do already own a phone, unfortunately, you are not eligible to participate. Tigo and Kidogo Kidogo are undertaking this initiative because they think it is important that everyone has access to mobile phones. It decided to work with JET and CARE because of the great work the organizations are doing in your districts. Each person selected for the program will receive a mobile phone with a Tigo sim card or a cash grant. The phone packages are donated free of cost from Kidogo Kidogo and Tigo and are the property of the program recipient. The cash is provided by JET and CARE and can be used however the recipient decides is best. It is important to note: though everyone in the program will receive a mobile phone or cash, unfortunately at this time, Tigo and Kidogo Kidogo do not have enough phones available to give to everyone right now. But don\u2019t worry; they are going to get more phones soon. If you don\u2019t receive a phone or cash grant now, you will get one as the rest of the phones become available, probably in a few months. To determine how to distribute the phones that are available now, Kidogo Kidogo and Tigo will use a lottery or luck of the draw. Each person who agrees to participate in the program will be entered into the lottery. Kidogo Kidogo and Tigo will then randomly draw names based on the number of phones they have available. If your name is drawn, you will be notified by JET and someone from Kidogo Kidogo will come to give you the phone in the near future. Others will be notified once Kidogo Kidogo and Tigo acquire more phones.\u201d If a respondent consents to participate, we will then proceed to ask them if they would be willing to take part in a survey. The survey will establish baseline levels of mobile phone access, use of digital financial services, socio-economic characteristics, individual efficacy, employment and farming practices, social connectedness, level of income generation and savings, household gender roles and bargaining, and political participation. After the baseline, we will then randomly assign individuals to the main treatment conditions (control, phone group or cash group) using the data collected from the survey to block randomize on village, age, socio-economic status, and current phone access. Distribution of Intervention A week or so after the completion of the baseline survey, those participants who have been assigned to the phone and cash groups will be notified by JET. The women in the phone group will be invited to a training workshop where they will receive their phone and a training session on its use. The women in the cash group will also be invited to a pick up their cash from a JET officer.", "q18": "Tanzania", "q19": "400", "q20": "Yes", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "BYU: X15229",

This experiment is part of a series of experiments in the 2018 general election to build on this prior research. This experiment focuses on encouraging the return of mail ballots requested by voters. Twenty-eight states plus DC allow voters to request a mail ballot from election officials without an \u201cexcuse\u201d (i.e. \u201cno excuse absentee voting\u201d) and 19 states allow voters to request a mail ballot for specific reasons (the remaining 3 states send all voters a ballot by mail).

Increased feelings of political efficacy are correlated with higher turnout, so this encouragement is expected to increase turnout. It is frequently used in voter mobilization treatments delivered in other forms of communication (see Green and Gerber 2015).", "q16": "See attached pre-analysis plan document", "q17": "See attached

The civil servant of the Danish Central Government find herself \u2013 if not continuously every day, then at least in certain situations \u2013 in an unsolvable value conflict between truth, legality, and professional standards on the one hand, and loyality towards the Minister on the other. Naturally, this conclusion sparked a lot of debate in Denmark. Several judicial notables proposed critique of the politicization of the civil service, and the Political Science Prof. Peter Munk Christiansen expressed his fear that the recent developments in media and political processes would \"compromise professional standards and the honesty of the Danish model\" (B\u00f8gelund 2015). The Danish Ministry of Finance adressed the debate by publishing the so-called Kodex VII. This 60 pages long booklet (incl. a small collection of concrete cases) was directed at the civil servants themselves, and was merely supposed to remind them of their most central obligations and duties. Only a week later, a committee under the former Permanent Secretary Bo Smith \u2013 established a year prior by the civil servants' own labor union DJ\u00d8F \u2013 reached the soothing conclusion that \"there has not been an increase in the amount of instances [from 1980 onwards], and the instances in question have only to a minor extent reflected the relationship between politicians and civil servants\". Furthermore, the committee added, civil servants and politicians alike do indeed \"generally practice a well-developed sense of the circumstances by which civil servants must act in a democratic state with rule of law\" (Bo Smith: 20-21). In short: Those outside of the central administration see fundamental problems in the present system, whereas the central administration itself is strongly convinced that there is no such issue, and that the cooperation between politicians and civil servants remains sound. What to believe? The literature on Public Values has pointed towards the potentiality of similar value conflicts (most recently J\u00f8rgensen & Rutgers 2015 and J\u00f8rgensen & Vrangb\u00e6k 2013), but it still lacks to present unequivocal empirical evidence for this claim. In a meta-review of the current knowledge about the value conflicts between political efficiency and civil servant-integrity, de Graaf & Van der Wal (2010: 628) tellingly conclude that the literature still hasn't provided more than \"partial and varying evidence that points to an existing trade-off between integrity and effectiveness in which effectiveness seems to prevail\". Hence, I have set out to answer the following question: Do civil servants in the Danish Central Government give so much prior to political loyalty that it negatively affects their compliance with honesty, legality, and professional standards? And if yes: What can we do to solve this problem? Particularly in the view of the Public Values literature's persisting empirical deficiencies, I attempt to answer this question by utilizing a (at least in public administration research) relatively unorthodox theory from social and cognitive psychology: 'Identity Priming'. According to social-psychological identity theory, we are all bearers of a wide range of identities. Each of these identities are inseperably connected with a set of specific norms that proscribe certain kinds of behavior. The extent to which a given identity, and its corresponding norms, proscribe individual behavior is determined by the saliency of this given identity in the mind of the individual. Departing from recent experimental economical science's application of social identity theory (Akerlof & Kranton 2000; Benjamin et al 2010; Benabou & Tirol 2011), it is a central assumption in the 'Identity Priming' literature that it is possible to prime people with certain aspects of their social identity, thereby non-conciously forcing them to act as if they were indeed in a situation in which this identity aspect was most salient. This theoretical framework opens up for very reliable studies of different aspects of people's identities. With 'Identity Priming' I am able to investigate specifically, whether future as well as present-day Danish Central Government civil servants \u2013 when this exact aspect of their identity is most salient \u2013 unconciously adjust their behavior toward more obedience at the expense of honesty, legality, and professional standards."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "(1): When faced with the dilemma, respondents primed with their (future) professional identity as civil servants will prioritize loyalty at the expense of honesty, legality, and professional standards. In concrete terms, I expect the respondents in the treatment group to be more inclined (than the respondents in the control group) to solve the tasks in the survey-experiment in accordance with the instructions of the authority. (2): (1) will increasingly be the case, the more the respondent identifies with the civil servant identity. The priming-effect will increase with the amount of experience the respondents have working as student assistants (etc.) in the Central Government, and the more they wish to be employed in the Central Government after graduating.

A central element of the survey is based on deception, and all respondents received thorough de-briefing afterwards. All appr. 200 respondents are Political Science students from Denmark. They represent several semesters as well as different levels of student work experience. Political Science students are a particularly well-suited group to the study of the Danish Central Government, as the majority of them will be employed there after graduation, and as Political Sciencists represent the majority of employees there. Furthermore, a significant amount of them have already been employed in the Central Government as student assistents etc. The 'Identity Priming' conditions involves asking the respondent 6 questions about either student-related or civil servant-related issues. As a manipulation check, the respondents are subsequently asked to provide a short description of a person of their choice, then to evaluate their well-being on three dimensions with the famous Self-Assessment Manikins. After the 'Identity Priming' and manipulation check, the two experimental tasks are provided. The first task presents a simple table. Below the table is a short description that postulates that the table shows a certain causal relationship. This is, however, not the case \u2013 which ought to be obivous for all Political Science students with even the most basic methodological skills. The respondents are nevertheless asked to provide arguments in favor of the false causal relationship. The question is how many of them will obstruct to this task. The second task involves a multiple choice test.

They merely have to choose the right one (which is, obviously, \"High: US; Medium: Poland; Low: India\"). When they do, however, they are told that their answer is wrong. They are provided with another opportunity to answer, and the question is, how many will change their answers in order to satisfy the authorities demands. Eventually (in the very end of the survey, after the experimental tasks), the respondents are provided with a randomly allocated vignette situation involving (depending on the 'Identity Priming') a student/civil servant that discovers an obvious flaw in an examination question/policy paper proposal, and then having to choose between ignoring the flaw or pointing it out to the examiner/Minister.

Governments around the world are building platforms to collect information from citizens. As part of these programs, agencies increasingly seek to leverage mobile technologies to engage beneficiaries in monitoring at lower costs and with the potential to generate more useful data. Unfortunately, existing research \u2014 which tends to be conceptual or descriptive \u2014 has provided little guidance about whether mobile technologies can enhance public engagement with government by facilitating regular, high-quality, and useful feedback about the quality of public services. This experimental study of citizen monitoring of solid waste services is uniquely suited to answer foundational questions about citizen engagement with governments as mobile technologies become universally adopted. Because solid waste services are visible, we can verify the quality and timeliness of reports.

This variable combines questions about Holocaust denial and conspiracy theories related to Jewish world domination, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the Islamic State/ISIS: \u2013 The United States is secretly trying to help the Islamic State (ISIS) take power in Syria and Iraq. \u2013 Abu Bakr Al-Bagdadi, the leader of the Islamic State (ISIS), is an Israeli intelligence agent. \u2013 Millions of Jews died in the Holocaust in Europe during World War II. \u2013 The number of Jews who died in the Holocaust has been greatly exaggerated. \u2013 The United States is trying to destroy the Islamic State (ISIS). \u2013 Jewish leaders are secretly conspiring to achieve world domination. \u2013 Arabs carried out the attacks against the United States (the World Trade Center and the Pentagon) on September 11, 2001. \u2013 Jews carried out the September 11, 2001 attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the United States. We will take the mean of these eight outcome measures which are measured on a four-point scale from \"Very accurate\" to \"Not at all accurate\" after reverse-coding as appropriate so that higher values indicate greater misperceptions. If the questions used for this measure scale together using principal components factor analysis, we will create a composite measure of conspiracy and misperception belief and use it as our primary outcome measure. However, regardless of how well the questions scale together, we will also analyze responses to each question separately and group them by the misperception or conspiracy in question - i.e., 9/11, Holocaust/Jewish conspiracy, and ISIS. (Note: Though we will analyze the component questions of our primary outcome measure using principal component factor analysis, we will construct any combined outcome measure as a mean for ease of interpretation.) We will also examine three secondary outcome measures: 1) attitudes towards democracy, 2) sympathy with individuals who fight for the Islamic State, and 3) and a post-treatment measure of anti-Western attitudes. First, we will construct a composite measure of attitudes toward democracy using the four measures of support for democracy below plus the question about the trade-off between security and stability. Each will be measured on a four-point scale from \"Strongly agree\" to \"Strongly disagree\" after reverse-coding as appropriate so that higher values indicate greater opposition to democracy. (If the questions used for this measure do not scale together, we may analyze them separately or consider a subset.) To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statements? \u2013 In a democracy, the economy runs badly \u2013 Democracies are indecisive and have too much quibbling \u2013 Democracies are not good at maintaining order \u2013 Democracy is a Western form of government which is not compatible with Islam Please indicate whether you agree or disagree with the following statement: Respect for human rights in (Egypt/Saudia Arabia) is important, but promoting security and stability is more important. Sympathy for fighters in the Islamic State will be measured based on responses to the following question, which is again measured on a four-point scale from \"Strongly agree\" to \"Strongly disagree\" so that higher values indicate greater sympathy. Please indicate whether you agree or disagree with the following statement: Even though I don't agree with everything they do, I can understand why someone would go to fight for the Islamic State. Finally, we will create a composite measure of anti-Western attitudes using responses to the questions below after response-coding as appropriate so that higher values indicate greater anti-Western attitudes. (If the questions used for this measure do not scale together, we may analyze each of them separately.) Which comes closer to describing your view? \u2013 Western music, movies, and television have hurt morality in our country \u2013 Western music, movies and television have NOT hurt morality in our country Which of these characteristics do you associate with people in Western countries such as the United States and Europe? \u2013 Selfish \u2013 Respectful of women \u2013 Tolerant \u2013 Honest \u2013 Generous \u2013 Violent \u2013 Greedy \u2013 Immoral \u2013 Arrogant Response options: \u2013 Yes, associate \u2013 No, do not associate \u2013 Don't know Both attitudes towards democracy and our post-treatment measure of anti-Western attitudes will be analyzed and constructed using principal components factor analysis, which allows for differential weights and also accounts for differing numbers of response options. Because sympathy with individuals who fight for the Islamic State is only one question, we will analyze responses to that measure directly. Statistical analyses For each of our analyses, we will use OLS with robust standard errors. Unless otherwise noted, all experimental treatment effects will be estimated as intent to treat effects. Our primary model will be pooled regressions for respondents from Egypt and Saudi Arabia with country fixed effects, but we will also estimate pooled regressions fully interacting the country of the respondent with our main explanatory variables. If we cannot reject the null of no difference between countries, we will present the pooled model. If the effects of key explanatory variables differ between countries, we will present separate models by country in the main text for expositional clarity and present interactive models in an appendix. We will estimate marginal effects as appropriate when interaction terms are included in our models. (We will also estimate our treatment effect models with standard demographic controls that include demographic controls for age, sex, religion (Egyptian Coptic Christians), socioeconomic status, education, and an indicator for non-citizen residents of Saudi Arabia along with country fixed effects and report them if the treatment effect estimate is substantively different from the model only including country fixed effects.) For H1, we estimate the correlation between pre-treatment anti-Western attitudes and conspiracy and misperception belief in a model that controls for fixed effects as well as demographic controls for age, sex, religion (Egyptian Coptic Christians), socioeconomic status, education, and an indicator for non-citizen residents of Saudi Arabia. To measure anti-Western attitudes, we will analyze responses to the following pre-treatment questions using principal component factor analysis and construct a composite measure as a factor score: Please indicate if you have a very favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable opinion of each of the countries listed below. \u2013 United States \u2013 Israel \u2013 United Kingdom How favorable or unfavorable is your opinion of the following groups? \u2013 Jews \u2013 Christians \u2013 Americans If the country or group-based measures of anti-Western attitudes do not scale well together, we will analyze each group separately, considering attitudes towards Christians, Jews, Americans, the US, the UK, and Israel separately. (We will also evaluate RQ3a using this model, which allows us to estimate whether belief in conspiracy theories and misperceptions differs between respondents in Egypt and Saudi Arabia conditional on the observable characteristics described above. We will also estimate a version of the model in which we omit the control, religion, socioeconomic status, and education variables, which are arguably post-treatment for country-level difference. If the results are substantively different in this model, we will report it instead.) For RQ1, we will estimate the same model as H1 but also interact our measure of pre-treatment anti-Western attitudes with either a measure of political knowledge or a measure of respondent education in separate models. The knowledge score will be computed as the sum of correct answers to the following battery measuring both current and historical political knowledge: Which country is Bashar al-Assad the leader of? \u2013 Syria \u2013 Iraq \u2013 Iran \u2013 Jordan Who is the Supreme Leader of Iran? \u2013 Hassan Rouhani \u2013 Saddam Hussein \u2013 Sayyid Ali Khamenei \u2013 Hamid Karzai Who is the prime minister of the United Kingdom? \u2013 David Cameron \u2013 Tony Blair \u2013 Barack Obama \u2013 Angela Merkel Which country first used the atomic bomb? \u2013 Japan \u2013 Germany \u2013 Soviet Union \u2013 United States of America Which country tore down a wall and reunified itself after the end of the Cold War? \u2013 Germany \u2013 Cuba \u2013 Poland \u2013 South Africa Which leader helped India achieve independence from Britain in 1947? \u2013 Mahatma Gandhi \u2013 Benazir Bhutto \u2013 Manmohan Singh \u2013 Narendra Modi We will analyze responses to the knowledge scale using factor analysis and construct separate current events and historical knowledge scale measures if two subscales do not scale well together. The education measure will be provided by YouGov from their panel demographics. For H2a, we estimate the correlation between self-reported feelings of control and conspiracy and misperception belief in a model that controls for fixed effects as well as demographic controls for age, sex, religion (Egyptian Coptic Christians), socioeconomic status, education, and an indicator for non-citizen residents of Saudi Arabia. To measure feelings of control, we will analyze responses to the following pre-treatment questions on a four-point agree/disagree scale using principal components factor analysis and construct a composite measure as a factor score: -I can solve the problems I have. -I sometimes feel I am being pushed around. -I have little control over what happens to me. -I can do just about anything I really set my mind to. -I often feel helpless in dealing with the problems of life. -What happens to me in the future depends mostly on me. -There is little I can do to change important things in my life. (If the items do not scale well together, we may instead construct the control measure using a subset of items with better measurement properties.) For H2b and RQ2, we will use OLS with robust standard errors to estimate the effects of the low control manipulation on our composite measure of conspiracy and misperception belief. The effect of the low control manipulation will be estimated relative to both the high control manipulation (for H2b) and the placebo (for RQ2). The model will be specified as y=b0+b1*low_control+b2*high_control+b3*saudi_arabia. We will then compute the low control effect as b2-b1 for H2 and examine b1 for RQ2. (We may also estimate the model with the standard set of demographic covariates described above in addition to the KSA fixed effect if including those demographic measures has a substantively important effect on the precision of our treatment effect estimate but in that case both models will be reported.) In evaluating these findings and H3a/H3b, we will also consider the effects of the treatment on our manipulation check measure: Some people feel they have completely free choice and control over their lives, while other people feel that what they do has no real control over what happens to them. In general, how much control do you feel you have over what happens in your life? -No control -Very little control -Some control -Quite a bit of control -A great deal of control -Total control This outcome variable will be evaluated using the same model/approach as H2b and RQ2. If the treatment has the expected effect, it may increase people's reported feelings of control. However, we are not confident that the treatment will necessarily affect this measure. It is possible that people who feel less in control after the manipulation may seek to alleviate that uncomfortable feeling by reasserting their feelings of control over their life. We will therefore use the manipulation check to provide context to our main tests of H2b and RQ2 described above. If the low control manipulation has a large and statistically significant effect on our post-treatment measure of self-reported feelings of control (i.e., meets the criteria for a strong instrument), we will also estimate an instrumental variables regression that uses assignment to the low control condition as an instrument for post-treatment self-reported feelings of control. We will then estimate a local average treatment effect (LATE) of variation in feelings of control for people whose feelings of control were affected by the experimental manipulation. For H3a, we estimate whether the association between pre-treatment self-reported feelings of control and conspiracy and misperception belief is moderated by pre-treatment anti-Western attitudes in a model that also controls for fixed effects as well as demographic controls for age, sex, religion (Egyptian Coptic Christians), socioeconomic status, education, and an indicator for non-citizen residents of Saudi Arabia. (This model will again use the measures of feelings of control and anti-Western attitudes constructed according to the procedure described above for H2a and H1, respectively.) For H3b, we will estimate a similar model to H2b but interact our indicators for our low and high control conditions with our measure of pre-treatment anti-Western attitudes as used in H1. We will use this interaction to see if the effect of our treatments on conspiracy and misperception belief is moderated by anti-Western attitudes. The model will be specified as y=b0+b1*low_control+b2*high_control+b3*anti_Western_attitudes+b4*low_controlXanti_western+b5*high_controlXanti_western+b6*saudi_arabia. We will then compute the marginal effect of low versus high control over the range of anti-Western attitudes using a procedure similar to that described in Brambor et al. 2006 but implementing the robustness checks and recommendations of Hainmeuller et al. (N.d.). (Note: We may again estimate the model with the standard set of demographic covariates described above in addition to the KSA fixed effect if including those demographic measures has a substantively important effect on the precision of our treatment effect estimate but in that case both models will be reported.) To test RQ3b, we will also evaluate whether the effect of reminders of feelings of low control on belief in conspiracy theories and misperceptions differs between respondents in Egypt and Saudi Arabia (compared to respondents in the high control condition). This model will be specified as y=b0+b1*low_control+b2*high_control+b3*saudi_arabia+b4*low_controlXsaudi_arabia+b5*high_controlXsaudi_arabia. We will estimate the marginal effect of low control (versus high) for both Egypt and Saudia Arabia and also evaluate whether the difference between the marginal effects is statistically significant. Finally, our analyses for RQ4a-RQ4c will repeat the analysis described above for H2b but with the dependent variable as attitudes towards democracy (RQ4a), sympathy for fighting for the Islamic State (RQ4b), and attitudes toward the West (RQ4c), which will be measured as described above. (All results will be unweighted. Regression results for individual ordered dependent variables will be verified for robustness using ordered probit. The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity.)"}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Egypt, Saudi Arabia"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "n=1000 in Egypt and n=1000 in KSA"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "Dartmouth College STUDY00029363, American University IRB-2016-234"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "Dartmouth 3/2/16, American 2/18/16"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q27": {"extra": [], "value": "YouGov MENA"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Conflict and Violence", "Ethnic Politics"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e3842ddfa39b701641dbfdc", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/f2rh5/providers/osfstorage/5e3842ddfa39b701641dbfdc", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/f2rh5/providers/osfstorage/5e3842ddfa39b701641dbfdc", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/f2rh5/providers/osfstorage/5e3842ddfa39b701641dbfdc?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/f2rh5/providers/osfstorage/5e3842ddfa39b701641dbfdc"}, "attributes": {"etag": "1def862702c598388552b7716aa5ff3d2f406f6c6e541e2ebfaeb1a7e67e1dea", "kind": "file", "name": "20160401AA_protocol.pdf", "path": "/5e3842ddfa39b701641dbfdc", "size": 148738, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "9d70928b90c917d69aedd45682a05108", "sha256": "a8ee92864d743587a6cad23ea69bbfdea23352ad123a7ce985dd39dc336a3a91"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 148738, "modified": "2020-02-03T15:57:17.240889+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "f2rh5", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20160401AA_protocol.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T15:57:17+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "f2rh5", "sha256": "a8ee92864d743587a6cad23ea69bbfdea23352ad123a7ce985dd39dc336a3a91", "viewUrl": "/project/pxfu4/files/osfstorage/5e3842e257427b01610c3dd1/", "selectedFileName": "20160401AA_protocol.pdf"}], "value": "20160401AA_protocol.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Conspiracy and Misperception Beliefs in the Middle East and North Africa", "q2": "Brendan Nyhan | Thomas Zeitzoff", "q3": "20160401AA", "q4": "04/02/2016 - 02:00", "q5": "We thank the Nelson A.

However, we still know relatively little about how people acquire these false or unsupported beliefs and why they seem to hold on to them so tenaciously.

This experiment tests whether feelings of a lack of control contribute to belief in conspiracy and misperception beliefs and whether those effects vary by country or the misperception in question. We will also examine the observational relationship between conspiracy and misperception beliefs and other relevant attitudes and characteristics. The effects of feelings of control - associations in observational data and experimental effects: H1: Anti-Western attitudes will be positively associated with belief in conspiracy theories and misperceptions. RQ1: Is the association between anti-Western attitudes and belief in conspiracy theories and misperceptions moderated by respondents' political and historical knowledge or level of education?

RQ2: Will respondents who are reminded of feelings of low control report greater belief in conspiracy theories and misperceptions than those in the placebo condition? H3a: The association between self-reported feelings of control and belief in the conspiracy theories and misperceptions will vary depending on respondents' attitudes toward the West.

Primary and secondary outcome measures Our primary outcome variable is a composite measure of conspiracy and misperception belief.

The model will be specified as y=b0+b1*low_control+b2*high_control+b3*saudi_arabia. We will then compute the low control effect as b2-b1 for H2 and examine b1 for RQ2. (We may also estimate the model with the standard set of demographic covariates described above in addition to the KSA fixed effect if including those demographic measures has a substantively important effect on the precision of our treatment effect estimate but in that case both models will be reported.) In evaluating these findings and H3a/H3b, we will also consider the effects of the treatment on our manipulation check measure: Some people feel they have completely free choice and control over their lives, while other people feel that what they do has no real control over what happens to them. In general, how much control do you feel you have over what happens in your life? -No control -Very little control -Some control -Quite a bit of control -A great deal of control -Total control This outcome variable will be evaluated using the same model/approach as H2b and RQ2. If the treatment has the expected effect, it may increase people's reported feelings of control. However, we are not confident that the treatment will necessarily affect this measure. It is possible that people who feel less in control after the manipulation may seek to alleviate that uncomfortable feeling by reasserting their feelings of control over their life. We will therefore use the manipulation check to provide context to our main tests of H2b and RQ2 described above. If the low control manipulation has a large and statistically significant effect on our post-treatment measure of self-reported feelings of control (i.e., meets the criteria for a strong instrument), we will also estimate an instrumental variables regression that uses assignment to the low control condition as an instrument for post-treatment self-reported feelings of control. We will then estimate a local average treatment effect (LATE) of variation in feelings of control for people whose feelings of control were affected by the experimental manipulation. For H3a, we estimate whether the association between pre-treatment self-reported feelings of control and conspiracy and misperception belief is moderated by pre-treatment anti-Western attitudes in a model that also controls for fixed effects as well as demographic controls for age, sex, religion (Egyptian Coptic Christians), socioeconomic status, education, and an indicator for non-citizen residents of Saudi Arabia. (This model will again use the measures of feelings of control and anti-Western attitudes constructed according to the procedure described above for H2a and H1, respectively.) For H3b, we will estimate a similar model to H2b but interact our indicators for our low and high control conditions with our measure of pre-treatment anti-Western attitudes as used in H1. We will use this interaction to see if the effect of our treatments on conspiracy and misperception belief is moderated by anti-Western attitudes. The model will be specified as y=b0+b1*low_control+b2*high_control+b3*anti_Western_attitudes+b4*low_controlXanti_western+b5*high_controlXanti_western+b6*saudi_arabia. We will then compute the marginal effect of low versus high control over the range of anti-Western attitudes using a procedure similar to that described in Brambor et al. 2006 but implementing the robustness checks and recommendations of Hainmeuller et al. (N.d.). (Note: We may again estimate the model with the standard set of demographic covariates described above in addition to the KSA fixed effect if including those demographic measures has a substantively important effect on the precision of our treatment effect estimate but in that case both models will be reported.) To test RQ3b, we will also evaluate whether the effect of reminders of feelings of low control on belief in conspiracy theories and misperceptions differs between respondents in Egypt and Saudi Arabia (compared to respondents in the high control condition). This model will be specified as y=b0+b1*low_control+b2*high_control+b3*saudi_arabia+b4*low_controlXsaudi_arabia+b5*high_controlXsaudi_arabia. We will estimate the marginal effect of low control (versus high) for both Egypt and Saudia Arabia and also evaluate whether the difference between the marginal effects is statistically significant. Finally, our analyses for RQ4a-RQ4c will repeat the analysis described above for H2b but with the dependent variable as attitudes towards democracy (RQ4a), sympathy for fighting for the Islamic State (RQ4b), and attitudes toward the West (RQ4c), which will be measured as described above. (All results will be unweighted. Regression results for individual ordered dependent variables will be verified for robustness using ordered probit. The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity.)", "q18": "Egypt, Saudi Arabia", "q19": "n=1000 in Egypt and n=1000 in KSA", "q20": "No", "q21":
