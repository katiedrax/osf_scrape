This study replicates Bliss et al (2005), reviews the past 5 years (2015-2019) to detect recent trends, and extends past research by investigating whether school psychological research has adopted open science practices.

Smileys can be seen as digital representatives of a real smile and have been developed to give people the opportunity to non-verbally express their feelings and emotions in CMC. Previous research found that using smileys does indeed affect the perception of the sender of a text message. Specifically, smileys reduce perceptions of competence in professional contexts, but no conclusive effect on warmth was observed. Importantly, previous research has not accounted for gender as a moderator of these links.\n\nIn this experiment, we test whether the gender of the sender of a message moderates this relationship in a professional context. Participants will see messages with smileys (compared to plain text) sent by female vs. male senders framed as colleagues and it will be assessed how the recipient perceives the personality of the sender (warmth and competence) and how desirable the sender of the message would find it to actually work together with the sender of the message (colleague desirability).\n\nWe believe that for men, participants are more likely to discount the non-verbal CMC behavior as a source of incompetence, because this runs counter to the prevalent gender stereotype that men - especially in professional contexts - are competent. For women, on the other hand, \"incompetent\" non-verbal behavior is in line with gender stereotypes. Therefore, we believe that the effect of using smileys in professional contexts will decrease perceptions of competence, but more strongly for women.\n\nOn the flipside, for women \"warm\" non-verbal behavior is in line with gender stereotyping. Therefore, we believe that the effect of using smileys in professional contexts will increase perceptions of warmth, but more strongly for women.\n\nFInally, because previous research suggests that smileys are seen as inappropriate in a professional setting, we believe using smileys leads to lower ratings of colleague desirability.

We are interested in investigating the aspects of plants that enable us to distinguish touchable plants from poisonous ones. \n\nPrevious studies suggest that even young infants seem to differentiate plants from artifacts and treat them differently. Infants are hesitant to touch plants rather than artifacts (Wertz &amp; Wynn, 2014a; W\u0142odarczyk, Elsner, Schmitterer, &amp; Wertz, 2018), and they exhibit more social looking to adults when presented with plants compared to other object types (Elsner &amp; Wertz, 2019).\n\nIn the current study, we examine infants\u2019 differentiation between plants from artifacts by manipulating one feature of plants: the skeletal structure. The skeletal structure of plants has unique properties \u2013 organized around a skeleton with a primary vertical axis and roughly symmetrical, branching limbs and roots \u2013 distinctively different from animals and artifacts (Feldman &amp; Singh, 2006).\n\nWe present two stimulus objects to infants.

As in the previous study, parents will be asked to rate on a five point Likert scale (1 = never, to 5 = nearly every day) (i) how often their child interacts with plants, (ii) how often they point out or name different plants for their child, (iii) how often their child sees them caring for plants around the house/in a garden, (iv) how often their child tries to touch indoor plants and (v) outdoor plants, (vi) how often they stop their child from touching plants, and (vii) whether they stop their child from touching all plants (Yes/No).  \n\nMain experiment\nAdapted from the studies of Wertz &amp; Wynn (2014a) and W\u0142odarczyk et al., (2018), infants sit on their parents\u2019 laps across a table from an experimenter who places two objects, one at a time, in front of the infant while saying \u201cLook what I\u2019ve got\u201d. The experimenter only touches the bottom of the structures, a container, throughout the experiment. Parents keep their eyes closed throughout, and the experimenter looks down at the bottom of the structures with a neutral expression. Presentation order of the two objects are counterbalanced. \n\nTrials terminate (i) when the infant touches the top part of the object, or (ii) 30 seconds elapse without a touch. A touch is counted as the moment that any part of the infant\u2019s hand comes in contact with the object. \n\nIf infants fail to touch both objects, the experiment repeats the procedure for a second round of testing. \n", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Participants will be contacted from an existing database of infants whose parents have signed up to participate in studies at Harvard.
