I2 ranges between 0% and 100%, and it is considered low, moderate, large and very large for values &lt;25%, 25\u201349%, 50\u201374% and &gt;75%, respectively.\nEstimation of prediction intervals\nTo further account for heterogeneity between studies we will calculate 95% prediction intervals (PIs) for the summary random effect estimates, which represent the range in which the effect estimates of future studies will fall (Inthout et al., 2016). \nAssessment of small study effects\nWe will examine whether smaller studies provide higher efficacy estimates as compared with larger studies, which is an indication of publication bias, true heterogeneity, or chance (Sterne et al. 2011). An indication of small study effects will be evaluated by the Egger\u2019s regression asymmetry test (P\u22640.10) (Egger et al., 1997) and checking whether the random effects summary estimate will be larger than the point estimate of the largest study. \nEvaluation of excess significance\nThe excess significance bias will be evaluated by calculating whether the observed number of studies with nominally statistically significant results (\u201cpositive\u201d studies, P &lt;0.05) is different as compared with the expected number of studies with statistically significant results (Ioannidis and Trikalinos, 2007). The expected number of statistically significant studies will be calculated from the sum of the statistical power estimates for each component study using an algorithm from a non-central t distribution (Lubin et al., 1990).The power estimates of each component study depend on the plausible effect size for the tested association, which will be assumed to be the effect of the largest study (that is, the smallest standard error) in each association. Excess significance for individual meta-analyses was determined at P\u22640.10 (Ioannidis and Trikalinos, 2007).\nAssessment of strength of associations\nStrength of associations will be assessed by using established umbrella review criteria (Solmi et al., 2018; Barbui et al., 2020). Briefly, associations that will present nominally significant random-effects summary estimates (i.e., P-value\u22640.05) will be classify as \u201cconvincing\u201d, \u201chighly suggestive\u201d, \u201csuggestive\u201d, or \u201cweak\u201d evidence. Specifically, meta-analyses are not intended to be suggestive of bias (Class I) whenever they meet the following criteria: p value &lt; 10-6 based on random effects meta-analysis; &gt;1000 participants; low or moderate between-study heterogeneity (I\u00b2 &lt; 50%); 95% PI that excludes the null value; and no evidence of small study effects and excess significance. Highly suggestive evidence (Class II) requires &gt;1000 participants, highly significant summary associations (p value &lt; 10-6 by random-effects) and 95% PI not including the null value. Suggestive evidence (Class III) criteria require only &gt;1000 participants and p value \u2264 0.001 by random-effects meta-analysis. Weak evidence (Class IV) criteria require only p value \u2264 0.05. Associations are considered non-significant if p 0.05.\nCredibility of evidence\nAs additional step, we will use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology for evaluating the credibility of evidence for each outcome measure (Guyatt et al., 2008). The GRADE rating will allow to determine whether the credibility for a given outcome may be considered high (further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect), moderate (further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate), low (further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate), or very low (very uncertain about the estimate of effect).\n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "N/A"}, "q21": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q23": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "References\nAROMATARIS E, FERNANDEZ R, GODFREY CM, HOLLY C, KHALIL H, TUNGPUNKOM P.

Next, participants will complete several surveys (demographics, Right-Wing Authoritarianism, Actively Open-Minded Thinking, and Social Dominance Orientation).

For counterbalancing purposes, participants will be tested in two waves of data collection.

The sharing of non-scientific content can be dangerous if these opinions influence other people and lead to negative affectivity.
