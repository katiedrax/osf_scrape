This will be referred to as \u2018partisanship-over-policy effect\u2019. \n\nH1a-c (non-directional): Political ideology, actual knowledge, and perceived knowledge will moderate the effect of source partisanship x participant partisanship on policy support.\n\nH2 (directional): Source partisanship x participant partisanship effect on trust in expertise: Participants will trust expertise more if it pertains to experts who share their partisan allegiance (EU experts if Remain voter, UK experts if Leave voter) and will be more willing to trust the use of this evidence in policy-making. Conversely, participants will trust expertise less if it pertains to experts on the opposite side of their partisan allegiance (EU experts if Leave voter, UK experts if Remain voter), and will be less willing to trust the use of this evidence in policy-making.\n\nH3 (directional): Perceived similarity with the source will moderate the effect of source partisanship x participant partisanship on trust in expertise.\n\nH4 (directional): Trust will partially mediate the \u2018partisanship-over-policy effect\u2019. \n\nH5 (non-directional): Source partisanship x participant partisanship effect on legitimacy of expertise: We predict an interaction effect on legitimacy of expertise (i.e. on whether experts should contribute to the political process as input, throughput or output). \n\nH6 (directional): Source partisanship x participant partisanship effect on behavioural measure: Participants will be more willing to write a letter to their local MP supporting/opposing the policy if the policy was proposed by the side matching their partisan allegiance (EU if Remain voter, UK if Leave voter) than by the side with the opposing partisan allegiance (EU if Leave voter, UK is Remain voter). \n\nRESEARCH QUESTION 2:\n\n2.1 \nTYPES OF TRUST: Healthy trust (= healthy vulnerability to positive motivations and past experiences of other actors - e.g., \u2018trust in family, that is based on past experience); Excessive trust (= not applying proper levels of skepticism to information coming from their own party); Mistrust (= vigilance, healthy skepticism, or a \u2018cautious attitude that propels citizens to maintain a watchful eye on the political and social happenings within their communities\u201d, Lenard, 2008); Distrust (= heuristic cynicism).\n\nH1 (directional): Source partisanship x participant partisanship effect on rankings of types of trust: Participants will rank Distrust and Excessive Trust as more representative of them and Healthy Trust and Mistrust as less representative of them if it pertains to experts who share their partisan allegiance (EU experts if Remain voter, UK experts if Leave voter) than if it pertains to experts on the opposite side of their partisan allegiance (EU experts if Leave voter, UK experts if Remain voter).\n\nH2 (directional): Source partisanship x participant partisanship effect on types of trust: Participants will display more Excessive Trust in expertise, more Distrust in expertise, but not more Healthy Trust or Mistrust in expertise if it concerns experts who share their partisan allegiance (EU experts if Remain voter, UK experts if Leave voter) than if it concerns experts who don\u2019t (EU experts if Leave voter, UK experts if Remain voter).  \n\n2.2 \nTYPES OF TRUST: Trust in impact vs. production science \nH1 (directional): Participant ideology will influence trust in impact vs. production science (McCright, Dentzman, Charters &amp; Dietz, 2013): Liberals will trust impact science more and conservatives will trust production science more. \n\nH2 (directional): Participant\u2019s partisanship will influence trust in impact vs. production science: Remain voters will trust impact science more than Leave voters; the latter will trust production science more than the former.\n\nH3 (non-directional): Source partisanship x participant partisanship will influence participants\u2019 trust in impact vs. production science. \n\n2.3 \nCOMPONENTS OF TRUST (adapted from Hendriks, Kienhues &amp; Bromme, 2015; Hamm, Smidt &amp; Mayer, 2019): Competence, integrity, benevolence, quality of science.\n\nH1 (directional): Source partisanship x participant partisanship effect on components of trust: Participants who judge a policy advised by experts who share their partisan allegiance (EU experts if Remain voter, UK experts if Leave voter) will judge the experts at the source of the policy as having more benevolence, more integrity, and performing a better-quality science, but not as more competent, than participants who judge a policy advised by experts who do not share their partisan allegiance (EU experts if Leave voter, UK experts if Remain voter).  \n\n", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Additionally, initial scoping searching had missed the update completed by Hill and Knox in 2013, which updated their 2006 review.  The original protocol can be viewed here: osf.io/pzcbq. \n\nThe literature will be searched systematically using the Scopus, Medline and PsychINFO databases. A comprehensive review was completed by Hill and Knox (2013) therefore results will be limited to those published from 2013 onwards. Duplications will be checked and removed.  In contrast to the original protocol publication more comprehensive searches have now been completed therefore the following terms are felt to be appropriate and will be employed in the searches. How these are implemented will also vary between databases given the differences in their functionality. The search terms are: \n\ntraining (in title)\n\nAND therapist  OR  psychologist  OR  psychotherapist  OR  \"cognitive behavioral therapist\"  OR  \"cognitive behavioural therapist\"  OR  cbt  OR  counselor  OR  counsellor \n\nAND abilit*  OR  skill  OR  competence \n\nInclude: English language only, studies published from 2013-present\n\nOnce this search is complete forward and backwards searches will be completed.

Backward searches will be completed by looking through reference lists. \n\nThe grey literature will be searched using Google Scholar and dissertations will be searched for using https://ethos.bl.uk/ \n\nAll identified studies will be systemically assessed for inclusion using PRISMA guidelines (Moher, Liberati, Tezlaff, &amp; Altman, 2009).
