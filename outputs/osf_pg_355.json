Militarization has taken place in the form of police adopting characteristics of the armed forces\u2014as with SWAT teams in the United States\u2014and in the form of constabularized militaries taking on domestic law enforcement roles, as in many Latin American countries. In such places as Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Venezuela, the armed forces conduct semi-permanent law-enforcement tasks across the national territory, including patrolling neighborhoods, staffing checkpoints, conducting arrests, and serving as prison guards. Although a growing body of research points to mixed results (den Heyer 2013; American Civil Liberties Union 2014; Cooper 2015; Singal 2014; Delehanty et al 2017), the militarization of law enforcement has enjoyed widespread public support. According to the Americas Barometer, over 60% of Latin Americans approve of the military intervening in combating crime. However, in this context of uncertainty about militarization\u2019s consequences, the reasons behind this popularity remain poorly understood. This study seeks to answer the following main questions: 1. Do people perceive more militarized law enforcement personnel to be more effective? 2. If so, do certain attributes (e.g., uniform, weapons, gender, skin color) contribute to this perception? 3. Is there a relationship between militarization and perceptions of effectiveness, respect for civil liberties, proclivity to corruption, and willingness to accept militarization of law enforcement in one\u2019s neighborhood? 4. Is militarization of law enforcement associated with a particular government ideology? 5. Does the nature of the perceived threat shape differences in perceptions about militarization?"}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Main Effects Effectiveness H1a: Military uniform will increase perceptions of effectiveness. H1b: Assault rifle will increase perceptions of effectiveness. H1c: Male will increase perceptions of effectiveness. H1d: Light skin will increase perceptions of effectiveness. H2: The difference in perceived effectiveness will be greater when respondents receive information about the type of threat in terms of fighting crime as opposed to providing public safety/law enforcement. Civil liberties H3a: Military uniform will be associated with a higher likelihood of violating civil liberties. H3b: Assault rifle will be associated with a higher likelihood of violating civil liberties. H3c: Male will be associated with a higher likelihood of violating civil liberties. H3d: Dark skin will be associated with a higher likelihood of violating civil liberties. Corruption H4a: Military uniform will be associated with lower corruption. H4b: Assault rifle will be associated with lower corruption. H4c: Female will be associated with lower corruption. H4d: Light skin will be associated with lower corruption. Support for operating in one\u2019s neighborhood H5a: Military uniform will be associated with support for operating in one\u2019s neighborhood in Mexico, but opposition in the US. (Differentiated effect based on perceptions of violence.) H5b: Assault rifle will be associated with support for operating in one\u2019s neighborhood in Mexico, but opposition in the US. (Differentiated effect based on perceptions of violence.) H5c: Female will be associated with support for operating in one\u2019s neighborhood. H5d: Light skin will be associated with support for operating in one\u2019s neighborhood. Ideology H6a: Military uniforms will be associated with right-wing governments. H6b: Assault rifle will be associated with right-wing governments. H6c: Female will be associated with right-wing governments. (No priors for light vs dark skin and ideology). H7: The difference in association with right-wing governments between military and police will be greater when respondents receive information about public safety as opposed to fighting crime. Heterogeneous effects Although we may not have enough statistical power to evaluate main effects by subgroups, we advance the following hypotheses regarding heterogeneous effects given baseline characteristics. More militarized features (e.g., a military uniform, assault rifle) will be perceived as more effective among respondents that are white, favor order over liberty, identify as conservative, identify with right-of-center parties (such as the Republican Party in the US or the PAN in Mexico), distrust the police, trust the armed forces, do not interact with the police frequently, feel insecure in their neighborhoods, and have been victims of crime."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "We follow an image-based conjoint design and mediation analysis to understand whether people generally prefer more militarized law enforcement personnel, which factors contribute to this perception, and whether support is contingent on the type of security threat implied. Respondents will first be asked to read a short sentence in which we explain that they will be looking at images of two people. Following the statement, respondents will be presented with two similar images (controlling for the pose, size, height, facial expression, background) of security agents. The images will randomly vary in four attributes (uniform, weapon, race, and sex) for a total of 16 different profiles.

Militarization has taken place in the form of police adopting characteristics of the armed forces\u2014as with SWAT teams in the United States\u2014and in the form of constabularized militaries taking on domestic law enforcement roles, as in many Latin American countries. In such places as Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Venezuela, the armed forces conduct semi-permanent law-enforcement tasks across the national territory, including patrolling neighborhoods, staffing checkpoints, conducting arrests, and serving as prison guards. Although a growing body of research points to mixed results (den Heyer 2013; American Civil Liberties Union 2014; Cooper 2015; Singal 2014; Delehanty et al 2017), the militarization of law enforcement has enjoyed widespread public support. According to the Americas Barometer, over 60% of Latin Americans approve of the military intervening in combating crime. However, in this context of uncertainty about militarization\u2019s consequences, the reasons behind this popularity remain poorly understood. This study seeks to answer the following main questions: 1. Do people perceive more militarized law enforcement personnel to be more effective? 2. If so, do certain attributes (e.g., uniform, weapons, gender, skin color) contribute to this perception? 3. Is there a relationship between militarization and perceptions of effectiveness, respect for civil liberties, proclivity to corruption, and willingness to accept militarization of law enforcement in one\u2019s neighborhood? 4. Is militarization of law enforcement associated with a particular government ideology? 5. Does the nature of the perceived threat shape differences in perceptions about militarization?", "q16": "Main Effects Effectiveness H1a: Military uniform will increase perceptions of effectiveness. H1b: Assault rifle will increase perceptions of effectiveness. H1c: Male will increase perceptions of effectiveness. H1d: Light skin will increase perceptions of effectiveness. H2: The difference in perceived effectiveness will be greater when respondents receive information about the type of threat in terms of fighting crime as opposed to providing public safety/law enforcement. Civil liberties H3a: Military uniform will be associated with a higher likelihood of violating civil liberties. H3b: Assault rifle will be associated with a higher likelihood of violating civil liberties. H3c: Male will be associated with a higher likelihood of violating civil liberties. H3d: Dark skin will be associated with a higher likelihood of violating civil liberties. Corruption H4a: Military uniform will be associated with lower corruption. H4b: Assault rifle will be associated with lower corruption. H4c: Female will be associated with lower corruption. H4d: Light skin will be associated with lower corruption. Support for operating in one\u2019s neighborhood H5a: Military uniform will be associated with support for operating in one\u2019s neighborhood in Mexico, but opposition in the US. (Differentiated effect based on perceptions of violence.) H5b: Assault rifle will be associated with support for operating in one\u2019s neighborhood in Mexico, but opposition in the US. (Differentiated effect based on perceptions of violence.) H5c: Female will be associated with support for operating in one\u2019s neighborhood. H5d: Light skin will be associated with support for operating in one\u2019s neighborhood. Ideology H6a: Military uniforms will be associated with right-wing governments. H6b: Assault rifle will be associated with right-wing governments. H6c: Female will be associated with right-wing governments. (No priors for light vs dark skin and ideology). H7: The difference in association with right-wing governments between military and police will be greater when respondents receive information about public safety as opposed to fighting crime. Heterogeneous effects Although we may not have enough statistical power to evaluate main effects by subgroups, we advance the following hypotheses regarding heterogeneous effects given baseline characteristics. More militarized features (e.g., a military uniform, assault rifle) will be perceived as more effective among respondents that are white, favor order over liberty, identify as conservative, identify with right-of-center parties (such as the Republican Party in the US or the PAN in Mexico), distrust the police, trust the armed forces, do not interact with the police frequently, feel insecure in their neighborhoods, and have been victims of crime.", "q17": "We follow an image-based conjoint design and mediation analysis to understand whether people generally prefer more militarized law enforcement personnel, which factors contribute to this perception, and whether support is contingent on the type of security threat implied. Respondents will first be asked to read a short sentence in which we explain that they will be looking at images of two people. Following the statement, respondents will be presented with two similar images (controlling for the pose, size, height, facial expression, background) of security agents. The images will randomly vary in four attributes (uniform, weapon, race, and sex) for a total of 16 different profiles. Following the two images, respondents are asked questions on effectiveness, government affiliation, desirability, corruption, and civil liberties.

The research is one of the outcomes of a larger study financed by a Grant from the Investigation and Innovation Agency (ANII) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ministerio del Interior) of Uruguay [Grant FSSC-1-2018-1-147750]. When citizens are witnesses to crimes, several factors weigh on their choice of whether to report the crime to police. In this paper, we consider three. First, what is their level of confidence in what the police are able to do? Second, we consider the nature of who is committing the crime--random strangers or established drug gangs? Third, how much fear do the citizens have of retaliation by criminals for snitching? We believe that all of these factors can affect law-abiding citizens in any place. In our study, we plan to estimate the degree to which these various factors are important to people. Increasing citizens\u2019 willingness to report crimes is a major concern for public security. Since most public security interventions rely on identifying crime patterns based on reported crimes, understanding people\u2019s behavioral tendencies is the starting point to nudge them to decide to report crimes. Uruguay has seen a big increase in crimes related to gang activities. This increase is primarily related to small bands of drug sellers who fight for territory and occupy big neighborhoods in Montevideo\u2019s boundaries. Not only are people who live in those neighborhoods affected by these circumstances, but this also affects people living in other neighborhoods where there are no gangs. In these wealthier parts of the city, property crimes with violence have increased since drug gangs have emerged on the outskirts.

The other treatment is whether the respondent was seen by the criminals or not. Thus, each surveyed individual will be randomly assigned to one of the four possible conditions based on all of the pairwise combinations of these two treatments. Importantly, considering these four categories, we will test that control variables are balanced across treatments. In other words, the average value of each covariate should be equal regardless of the assigned vignette. After reading the vignette, the respondent is then asked to rate on a scale of 1 to 7 how likely he or she would be to report this crime to the police. This 1 to 7 rating of willingness to report crime serves as our dependent variable. We will estimate a multilevel linear model, with random effects for 62 neighborhoods, of willingness to report crime.

The respondent will be given one of four possible conditions based on a 2x2 design. One treatment is whether the respondent recognizes the criminals as being from a local drug band or not. The other treatment is whether the respondent was seen by the criminals or not. Thus, each surveyed individual will be randomly assigned to one of the four possible conditions based on all of the pairwise combinations of these two treatments. Importantly, considering these four categories, we will test that control variables are balanced across treatments. In other words, the average value of each covariate should be equal regardless of the assigned vignette. After reading the vignette, the respondent is then asked to rate on a scale of 1 to 7 how likely he or she would be to report this crime to the police. This 1 to 7 rating of willingness to report crime serves as our dependent variable. We will estimate a multilevel linear model, with random effects for 62 neighborhoods, of willingness to report crime. Besides indicators for the two treatments, and their interaction, we also will include a measure of confidence in the police as a predictor to test our third hypothesis. We also will control for having been a victim of a crime, gender, and any imbalanced covariates.", "q18": "Uruguay", "q19": "1200", "q20": "Yes", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24":
