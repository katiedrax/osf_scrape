In order to manage the increased presentations, District Health Boards (DHBs) have implemented various initiatives to kerb demand and redirect patients at the front door, such as Emergency Q. Emergency Q is an app (Apple and Android) which can issue free vouchers to direct low-acuity ED patients to Afterhours Urgent Care consultations during times when ED is busy, to encourage patients to go to alternative service providers for low acuity conditions.  The impact of these initiatives on vulnerable populations with health inequities has not been understood.   \n\nPacific peoples make up more than 7% of the New Zealand population.   By 2026, it is estimated that 10% of the population will identify with one or more Pacific ethnic groups.   Pacific peoples refer to a diverse group of ethno linguistically different people, but with shared cultural values of the importance of family, spirituality, community and respect.   In \u2019Ala Mo\u2019ui, the Ministry of Health stated the long-term outcome focus for Pacific peoples for 2014-2018 was for \u2018Pacific peoples [to] experience equitable health outcomes and lead independent lives.\u2019 \n\nThis outcome has yet to be realised.  Resources, including information on how to access public services, are not equally distributed across different groups in New Zealand.  The current healthcare system has been set up so that some groups are able to engage more easily with healthcare services and derive more benefit from it than others.   Non-Maaori, Non-Pacific people experience higher rates of health and wellbeing than Pacific people in almost every Ministry of Health indicator reported by ethnicity.4\n\nCounties Manukau DHB has the largest combined adult-paediatric ED in Australasia.  It is also home to the greatest number of Pacific peoples of all DHBs, responsible for the health of nearly forty per cent of all Pacific peoples living in New Zealand.  \n\nAt Counties Manukau DHB, Pacific patients make up 21% of the catchment population but 34% of all ED presentations, making them the highest users of ED by prioritised ethnicity group.3 In June 2019, Emergency Q was introduced to the ED of Counties Manukau DHB to redirect low-acuity ED patients to Urgent Afterhours Centres.  \n\nThe reasons for Pacific patients use of ED for low acuity conditions is unclear, and it is also unclear whether interventions such as Emergency Q will support appropriate and equitable access to health services for Pacific peoples.   \n\nThe aim of this research is to:\n+ Identify key drivers for Pacific patients\u2019 use of ED for low acuity conditions\n\nThe objectives of this research are to: \n+ Identify key drivers for Pacific patients\u2019 use of ED for low acuity conditions according to international literature \n\nThis is a protocol for a mixed-methods systematic literature review on drivers for Pacific patients\u2019 decisions to utilise ED for low acuity conditions.\n\nMethods\nThe study will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocol (PRISMA-P).  (Appendix 1) The methodology for this study will be registered on Open Science Framework, an international register of systematic reviews. \n\nEligibility criteria\nThis review will include all studies, published between 2000 and 2020, written in the English language, which reported reasons for human patients choosing to use the emergency department for low-acuity conditions.  Low-acuity will be defined as any condition that could reasonably be seen by a General Practitioner or equivalent in the country of study, equivalent to Australasian Triage Scale scores of 4 and 5 described in Table 1.  \n\nTable 1.

Databases searched will include: Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), The Cochrane Library (via Wiley Online Library), Google Scholar, ProQuest and CINAHL (Ebsco).  Journals searched will include Journal of the Polynesian Society and PINI (Pacific Islands News &amp; Information), Contemporary Pacific Journal and Pacific Health Dialog.  In addition, reference lists will be hand searched.  \nGray literature will be searched for on the repository website nzresearch.org.nz, the Ministry of Health's Health Statistics website and the Ministry of Health Pacific Health website.  To identify any unpublished work, Pacific health and Emergency Medicine researchers known to the researchers will be contacted.\n\nSearch strategy\nCombinations of key words and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) were used on each information source listed.  The search strategy will be piloted and refined for each source (Appendix 2).  A professional healthcare librarian (DH) and specialist Pacific librarian (JMM) helped develop the search strategy. \n\nStudy records\nAll references will be managed using EndNote X9 (Web of Science Group). This software will be used to discard duplicates and manage papers. Data will be collected using Microsoft Excel 2020.\n\nSelection Process\nAbstracts of identified papers will be reviewed by one researcher (CY) for appropriateness of inclusion into the literature review.  At this stage, articles will be classified as \u2018for inclusion\u2019 or \u2018excluded\u2019.  The titles and classifications of all articles will be recorded.  Full-texts will be retrieved for any papers in which there is doubt regarding inclusion and these will be read by all researchers and decided by consensus after discussion.  A selection of these abstracts will be read by the second and third researchers (VN, VS).\n\nThe full texts of all included articles will be obtained. The full articles will be read by one researcher (CY) to evaluate relevance.  The results of inclusion decisions will be discussed with second and third researchers (VS and VN).  The number of included and excluded papers at each step of the process will be shown through a PRISMA diagram. \n\nData collection process and items\nThe following data will be collected:\na)\tTitle\nb)\tAuthors\nc)\tStudy aims\nd)\tPatient population, including ethnicity where available\ne)\tInclusion and exclusion criteria\nf)\tItems required for quality assessment (MMAT) \nCY will collect this data and VS and VN will randomly and independently check a selection of studies to test intercoder agreement.\n\nQuality assessment\nQuality of methods will be assessed by one researcher (CY) using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT).   Any ambiguity will be resolved by discussion with VS and VN.  Appendix 1 outlines the data collection criteria for assessing quality of included studies, with explanations of terms for consistency.\n\nData synthesis\nDrivers for Pacific patient utilisation of Emergency Department or Emergency Room services will be synthesised and evaluated using the qualitative assessment method described by Thomas. \n\nDissemination\nThe results of this analysis will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.  Further, CY will present the findings of the research at Counties Manukau District Health Board\u2019s Pacific Health Planning day, which will help inform service delivery planning for this population.\n\nCultural appropriateness\nVN is Associate Professor of Pacific Health.  Further, this research will be supported by extensive senior involvement of Pacific academic and health service professionals who will help ensure that findings are interpreted in a culturally appropriate way that supports positive outcomes for Pacific people.\n\nEthics\nEthics approval will not be sought as this is a review of published literature.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "20200407 Search strategy for submission to OSF.docx"}, "nodeId": "63nyt", "sha256": "3ae35bf6a1c61fbf14e5295bbcf7e569a2eb27b1c56985c03d7c011f245d0611", "viewUrl": "/project/63nyt/files/osfstorage/5e8be6c4d6973500eebdb0aa", "selectedFileName": "20200407 Search strategy for submission to OSF.docx"}, {"data": {"name": "20200407 Literature review protocol for registration with OSF.docx"}, "nodeId": "63nyt", "sha256": "d25c11162bec6e01df5539378d79a2570db3ff8bbbb970a2a25918daadba31f4", "viewUrl": "/project/63nyt/files/osfstorage/5e8be5f8f1353500e5d594d4", "selectedFileName": "20200407 Literature review protocol for registration with OSF.docx"}], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"summary": "Researchers:\nCatherine Yang [CY] , Executive Management, Counties Manukau District Health Board, 100 Hospital Road, Otahuhu, Auckland.

In order to manage the increased presentations, District Health Boards (DHBs) have implemented various initiatives to kerb demand and redirect patients at the front door, such as Emergency Q. Emergency Q is an app (Apple and Android) which can issue free vouchers to direct low-acuity ED patients to Afterhours Urgent Care consultations during times when ED is busy, to encourage patients to go to alternative service providers for low acuity conditions.  The impact of these initiatives on vulnerable populations with health inequities has not been understood.   \n\nPacific peoples make up more than 7% of the New Zealand population.   By 2026, it is estimated that 10% of the population will identify with one or more Pacific ethnic groups.   Pacific peoples refer to a diverse group of ethno linguistically different people, but with shared cultural values of the importance of family, spirituality, community and respect.   In \u2019Ala Mo\u2019ui, the Ministry of Health stated the long-term outcome focus for Pacific peoples for 2014-2018 was for \u2018Pacific peoples [to] experience equitable health outcomes and lead independent lives.\u2019 \n\nThis outcome has yet to be realised.  Resources, including information on how to access public services, are not equally distributed across different groups in New Zealand.  The current healthcare system has been set up so that some groups are able to engage more easily with healthcare services and derive more benefit from it than others.   Non-Maaori, Non-Pacific people experience higher rates of health and wellbeing than Pacific people in almost every Ministry of Health indicator reported by ethnicity.4\n\nCounties Manukau DHB has the largest combined adult-paediatric ED in Australasia.

Pencegahan dan Pemberantasan Pandemi Coronavirus Disease (Covid)-19", "description": "Aliran hukum positivism melahirkan pemikiran yang menyatakan bahwa satu-satunya hukum merupakan undang-undang. Aliran positivisme mengedepankan undang-undang tertulis, kaum positivis hukum dengan tegas memisahkan hukum yang ada dengan hukum yang seharusnya ada, pemisahan antara wilayah kontemplatif dan wilayah empiris. Produk hukum seperti Undang-Undang Tentang Kekarantinaan Kesehatan ini merupakan bukti empiris yang selama ini telah dilakukan kajian empiris baik oleh pakar-pakar hukum dan pakar-pakar di bidang kesehatan. Adanya pandemic coronavirus diseas (Covid) 19 menjadikan produk undang-undang dalam UU kekarantinaan kesehatan menjadi penting. Kemampuan virus menyebar dengan cepat dan kemampuannya dalam menimbulkan dampak yang fatal bagi kesehatan menyebabkan karantina kesehatan harus segera dilakukan. Penulis ingin mengkaji permasalahan yang muncul yaitu tentang legal positivsme untuk penerapan UU Nomor 6 Tahun 2018 serta dampak yang ditimbulkan jika asas tersebut tidak dilakukan di tengah pandemic Covid-19 ini. Dari hasil kajian, ditemukan bukti bahwa pemerintah belum menjalankan amanat dalam UU Kekarantinaan Kesehatan dengan tidak melakukan karantina wilayah secara ketat, yang berakibat meluasnya dampak yang ditimbulkan yaitu kasus positif bertambah banyak dan kematian meningkat. Hal ini disebabkan karena kurangnya sarana prasarana dalam memenuhi Alat Pelindung Diri (APD) dan alat-alat medis (pemeriksaan penunjang) termasuk ketersediaan bed isolasi dan ventilator yang sangat terbatas. Pandemi ini juga mengakibatkan terhambatnya roda perekonomian dengan banyaknya sekotr-sektor yang mengalami kerugian. Pemerintah tidak mengupayakan adanya karantina wilayah dikarenakan mempertimbangkan faktor ekonomi serta kemungkinan adanya kekhawatiran jika pemerintah tidak mampu membiayai seluruh masyarakat yang terdampak jika nanti karantina wilayah benar-benar diberlakukan.

dissatisfaction in a representative adult sample", "description": "Body dissatisfaction is not only associated with negative emotions but also is a risk factor for the development of depressive and anxiety symptoms, poor quality of life, health risk behaviours, disordered eating and clinical eating disorders in males and females (McLean &amp; Paxton, 2019).  Consequently, understanding risk factors that contribute to the development of body dissatisfaction has been a focus of research (e.g., Rodgers, Paxton, &amp; McLean, 2014).  Risk factor research has been guided by a number of theoretical models, but a dominant one is the Tripartite Influence Model (Thompson, Heinberg, Altabe, &amp; Tantleff-Dunn, 1999).  This model emphasises sociocultural risk factors, particularly social environments in which there are high levels of exposure to society\u2019s appearance ideals (i.e., thin for females, and lean and muscular for males) including family, peers and media environments (Rodgers, McLean, &amp; Paxton, 2015).  Of these environments, recent research has examined the potential risk factor role of high levels of exposure to social media, the focus of the present research in which data were collected annually across three years (2016, 2017, 2018) in a large representative community sample of adult New Zealanders.\n\nExposure to social media has been proposed to be a risk factor for the development of body dissatisfaction for a number of reason (see Tamplin, McLean, &amp; Paxton, 2018).  A combination of peer and media environments, social media is highly visual and content frequently shows idealised images. It is proposed that these images create unrealistic appearance standards that are, for most people, impossible to attain and thus result in negative self-evaluation of one\u2019s own body (Tamplin et al., 2018).  Further the highly interactive nature of social media is likely to add to their negative impact in this regard (McLean, Paxton, Wertheim, &amp; Masters, 2015).\nEmpirical research provides support for a relationship between greater social media exposure and greater body dissatisfaction.  For example, a meta-analysis of cross-sectional relationships found a significant but small, positive relationship between social media use and body dissatisfaction (Saiphoo, &amp; Vahedi, 2019).  In addition, experimental studies find that exposure to idealised social media images compared to non-appearance social media images have a negative impact on short-term body dissatisfaction (e.g., Tamplin et al., 2018). \n\nHowever, these studies do not provide information about the temporal relationship between social media use and body dissatisfaction, for which prospective studies are required.  One prospective study reflects on this issue.  In a study of adolescent girls and boys, De Vries, Peter, de Graaf, and Nikken (2016) found that higher social media use predicted body dissatisfaction up to 18-months later.  However, a major limitation of research in this area is the lack of longitudinal data in adult community samples that allows examination of the temporal relationships between social media use and body image.  Although the Tripartite Influence Model proposes elevated (social) media use will increase risk of future body dissatisfaction, it is also feasible that body dissatisfaction may increase social media use (Saiphoo &amp; Vahedi, 2019), perhaps in an attempt to seek appearance related information to guide self-improvement.  Although prospective relationships in both directions are plausible, previous data do not exist to guide predictions as to the strength of the relationships. Thus, we will compare the strength of proposed relationships in each direction.\n\nWe propose to overcome this limitation regarding lack of examination of temporal relationships between social media use and body dissatisfaction in adults by examining data from the large longitudinal study of a representative sample of New Zealand adults, the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS).  We will examine relationships between self-reported frequency of social media use and body dissatisfaction at three time points, 2016, 2017, 2018. We propose that social media use will predict increases in body dissatisfaction across three time points.\n\nFurther, an exploratory aim is to examine the moderating role of gender, age and body mass index (BMI).  There is relatively little data to guide hypotheses regarding moderators. However, we propose that gender will not moderate the relationship between social media use and body image across time, as one systematic review did not find gender moderated cross-sectional relationships between these two variables (Holland &amp; Tiggemann, 2016).  In relation to age, although body dissatisfaction is frequently present in midlife (McLean, Paxton, &amp; Wertheim, 2010), a 20-year follow-up study of college students found body dissatisfaction to be lower in midlife than in college years (Keel, Baxter, Heatherton, &amp; Joiner, 2007).  Thus, there may also be a change in factors that influence body dissatisfaction across age.  In relation to BMI, although higher BMI typically predicts the development of body dissatisfaction (Paxton, Eisenberg, &amp; Neumark-Sztainer, 2006), there has been little examination of BMI as a potential moderator of the influence of social media on body dissatisfaction.  It is feasible that individuals with higher compared with lower BMI would be more negatively affected by the idealised appearance images presented on social media.  We plan to explore this possibility.\n\nFinally, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES) and relationship status, have been observed in some research to have an impact on the development of body dissatisfaction (Laus, Almeida &amp; Klos, 2018; Paxton et al., 2006).  However, these variables are not the focus of the present research and so will be controlled for in analyses.\n\nIn summary, this study will examine bi-directional prospective relationships between social media use and body dissatisfaction in a large representative sample of New Zealand adults. Analyses will control for SES, ethnicity and relationship status and also examine the moderating role of gender, age, and BMI, predicting that the relationship between social media use and body dissatisfaction will be stronger in younger participants and participants with higher BMI. Gender is not expected to moderate the prospective relationships between social media and body dissatisfaction.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-05T23:18:16.825054", "date_modified": "2020-04-05T22:53:14.287148", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["Body dissatisfaction", "Body Image", "Social Media Use"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [""], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "9082c713d2d6fe7549ccf45061923028763c07b3ee333f54b8de8ad4b7e358b44d801aacb0909cf8069c24ff6657a21a438df7967be0bbd57eb2ec20458c5f72d1a8b62fbc3e71f4370abaee955c8fd91847eaab3401296462074f6feb778ffb36d4354f217552a1decfb71ec3ecb7e31de67ee8ac51a315d60e93add0dd3ddef1bb56eb79b70f1df5e2bd80870e29e1", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-05T23:18:16.808673", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Mathew D.

Initially we will describe the data, including missing values and what was done to account for them. In order to account for potential invariance over measurement occasions, we will test this as a stationary CLPM where autoregressive terms across adjacent pairs of years are constrained to equality (e.g., Social Media Use T9 -&gt; Social Media Use T10 is constrained to equality with Social Media Use T8 -&gt; Social Media Use T9), along with cross-lagged terms across adjacent pairs of years (e.g., Social Media Use T9 -&gt; Body Dissatisfaction T10 is constrained to equality with Social Media Use T8 -&gt; Body Dissatisfaction T9). Then we will test the CLPM, by calculating univariate Wald tests of parameter constraint to assess whether the size of a given set of paths differed significantly from another set of paths. Specifically, we will assess the differences between autoregressive paths, and separately assess differences between the cross-lagged paths.

Initially we will describe the data, including missing values and what was done to account for them. In order to account for potential invariance over measurement occasions, we will test this as a stationary CLPM where autoregressive terms across adjacent pairs of years are constrained to equality (e.g., Social Media Use T9 -&gt; Social Media Use T10 is constrained to equality with Social Media Use T8 -&gt; Social Media Use T9), along with cross-lagged terms across adjacent pairs of years (e.g., Social Media Use T9 -&gt; Body Dissatisfaction T10 is constrained to equality with Social Media Use T8 -&gt; Body Dissatisfaction T9). Then we will test the CLPM, by calculating univariate Wald tests of parameter constraint to assess whether the size of a given set of paths differed significantly from another set of paths. Specifically, we will assess the differences between autoregressive paths, and separately assess differences between the cross-lagged paths. Should Wald tests of parameter constraints be insufficient for model testing, we will use model constraints to test differences between reciprocal, causality, reverse causality, and stability models.\nSee \"NZAVS T8 T9 T10 body image syntax for stationary CLPM over three timepoints.txt\"\n\n\u2022\tAs a further analysis, we will test for moderation.
