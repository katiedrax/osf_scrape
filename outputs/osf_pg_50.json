Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) (Bartholomew &amp; Horowitz\u2019s, 1991). RQ consists of four short paragraphs reflecting the relationship styles of four adult attachment styles; secure, preoccupied, dismissing and fearful. Participants tick which best fits them and rate each style on a 7-point Likert scale according to how much they agree with the style, from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The scale can be calculated into two underlying dimensions, attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance, which will be used for analysis. \n6.

The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC; Schwarz, 1978) will be used to evaluate and compare models, with the smallest value indicating the best fitting model. In relation to the BIC, (Raftery, 1996) suggested that a 2-6 point difference offers evidence of model superiority, a 6-10 point difference indicates strong evidence of model superiority, and a difference greater than 10 points indicates very strong evidence of model superiority.\n\nExperiment: \nThe standard p &lt;.05 criteria will be used to determine if the ANCOVA results are significantly different from those expected if the null hypothesis were correct, as we expect a smaller effect size.

Verb aspect is thought to act as a processing cue since it has been shown that the construal of events when reading or listening to event descriptions is influenced by inflectional verb morphology. In English, the imperfective aspect (She was writing) can emphasize the dynamic, ongoing nature of events and can encourage an internal perspective (Madden &amp; Zwaan, 2003). Perhaps as a result, imperfective (vs. perfective) facilitates the processing of the location where the action takes place (seen as event background information, cf., Ferretti et al., 2007). In contrast, the perfective aspect (She wrote) could focus the interpreter\u2019s attention on the static, completed end state of situations and encourage a goal-driven, external perspective. Relatedly, perfective (vs. imperfective) has been suggested to facilitate the processing of action-related instruments (cf., Ferretti et al., 2001).  However, much of this evidence is derived from English, which encodes aspect grammatically.    \n\tLanguages vary in how they convey aspect, and it is possible this variation can have implications for how event knowledge is activated in response to aspect.  In English, aspect is conveyed grammatically by the verb phrase. Verbs assign thematic roles which can give rapid access to situation knowledge, and the grammatical form of a verb influences access to this knowledge.\nHowever, in German aspect is expressed lexically through temporal adverbs among others. In this project, we explore to what extent and when aspectual adverbs in German rapidly shift a comprehender\u2019s attention to event information.  Specifically, we ask whether German, like English, shifts attention towards locations (vs. instruments) when processing imperfective (vs. perfective) aspect markers and vice versa. If we find similarities in German and English, then this would suggest similarity in the mapping from grammatically- versus lexically-realized aspect to event representations.\nIf we find cross-linguistic differences in aspectual processing, then we would conclude that visual attention and the construction of event representations are influenced by the lexical (vs. grammatical) realization of aspect. However, subsequent studies using the same setup and design would have to be conducted both using lexical and (standard) grammatical aspect in English to underscore this conclusion.\nWe use as our launching point a previous (unpublished) visual-world eye-tracking study (here referred to as Experiment 1) that investigated whether lexical aspect in German (a non-aspect language) resembles grammatical aspect processing in English.  We measured whether event-related location and instrument information varies in sentences containing imperfective and perfective aspectual adverbs. German adults heard sentences with imperfective or perfective aspect and a location or instrument prepositional phrase (PP), e.g., (1) Das M\u00e4dchen schrieb geradeAdv / k\u00fcrzlichAdv in der SchuleLOC_PP / mit dem F\u00fcllerINST_PP. Lit. trans.: \u2018The girl wrote currentlyAdv / recentlyAdv at the schoolINST_PP / with the fountain penINST_PP.\u2019, while inspecting four images: a verb-related instrument &amp; location and two distracters (see Figure 1). We recorded reaction times and accuracy in a post-trial task (click on the picture which matches the sentence).\n\tThe findings of Experiment 1 illustrated that aspect influenced processing of event information in the eye-movement data, but not in the post-trial data.  Participants fixated the location (vs. instrument) picture more after hearing an imperfective (vs. perfective) aspect adverb marker and the instrument (vs. location) picture more when hearing a perfective (vs. imperfective) aspect marker. We assume that increased fixations to the location / instrument after processing the imperfective / perfective aspect marker indicate facilitation in processing the respective location / instrument PP upon it\u2019s mention. This is in line with linking hypotheses in visual-world studies that have interpreted more fixations to an object as indicating attention to / thinking about that object (Pyykk\u00f6nnen-Klauck &amp; Crocker, 2016) and with earlier studies investigating priming effects (e.g., Arai et al., 2007). However, the gaze pattern reported in Experiment 1 (see above) were not anticipatory, and only occurred in the PP (prepositional phrase) region (loc_PP, inst_PP, see (1)). No other effects (e.g., anticipatory effects in the aspect marker region) reached significance. The post-trial click data did not reveal any significant differences due to aspect.\n\tOne question that arose in our analysis was whether the post-trial task might emphasize the importance of the location/instrument region of the sentence and hence might bias sentence processing away from the aspect marker and any potential anticipatory effects in the aspect region. The task in Experiment 1 was a post-trial task in which participants were asked to click on the picture mentioned in the sentence. We think that the post-trial task emphasized the PP because it is heard at the end of the sentence and participants\u2019 task was to click on its referent (a location/instrument picture on the screen). Sentence aspect on the other hand did not play a role in fulfilling the task and might hence have been ignored. Additionally, although the instructions emphasized the importance of fast and accurate responses, the task was not challenging for participants, as evidenced by high accuracy values; they knew what to expect after every single trial. This task focus on the PP could have in turn also affected the real-time results. Perhaps, participants\u2019 gaze in Experiment 1 did not show anticipatory aspect effects in the aspect region of the sentence and no interaction between aspect and location/instrument in the PP region because they waited until sentence end to identify the PP.\n\tEven though task effects in visual world eye tracking studies have been reported and discussed (cf., Altmann &amp; Kamide, 1999; Kreysa &amp; Knoeferle, 2011; Salverda et al., 2011; Tanenhaus et al., 2000), not many studies have explicitly investigated whether the reported effects may be task-specific or not. Altmann and Kamide (1999), for example, found delayed but qualitatively similar fixation patterns in a look-and-listen task compared to participants\u2019 having to judge whether the sentence they heard \u201ccould in principle apply to the picture\u201d (p. 251). Kreysa and Knoeferle (2011) on the other hand found qualitatively different response times but also differences in fixations patterns depending on the task. In the experiments participants watched a speaker in a video uttering either a German subject-verb-object (SVO) or object-verb-subject (OVS) sentence. The sentences were about characters performing actions towards each other. In addition, and simultaneously to seeing the speaker, participants also saw the characters displayed on a computer screen. Experiment 1 asked participants to identify the patients of the actions described in the sentences, in experiment 2 the task was to verify thematic role relations. Fixation patterns during sentence processing differed by task: When the task focused on patient identification, shifts in fixations to the target patient were greater in SVO than in OVS sentences since in OVS sentences, the patient had already been identified at the beginning of the sentence. When the task was to verify thematic role relations, gaze shifts to the patient were greater in OVS than SVO sentences. \n\tThese results suggest that the task mediates the distribution of attention in the visual world (cf., Salverda et al., 2011). Hence, if the effects that we observed in Experiment 1 during referent verification hold up across tasks we would assume that they are independent of task-specific allocation of attention and that they likely hold up during perhaps more natural look-and-listen tasks. If, however, we find different fixation and / or reaction time patterns when different tasks are employed, we might assume that task-mediated attention is a (strong) predictor of effects found in real-time language processing studies and more specifically can mediate event representations during aspectual language processing.\n\tThis pre-registered first follow-up study will adapt the task to a look-and-listen paradigm that does not involve an overt response. We will encourage participant attention in the study by instructing them that they will be asked to perform a post-experiment memory/sentence-picture completion task after the eye-tracking portion of the study. The post-experiment memory/sentence-picture completion task will proceed as follows: participants will be presented with all items (and half of the fillers) again. They will see the exact picture quadruplets they encountered in the eye-tracking experiment. The critical sentence will be presented in text below the pictures. The critical sentence they heard in the experiment will be presented up to the aspect marker (e.g., Das M\u00e4dchen schrieb gerade/k\u00fcrzlich\u2026, lit. transl: The girl wrote currently/recently\u2026). Their task is to choose the picture that completes the sentence they heard in the experiment (see Figure 1). We will measure reaction times to correct choices and choice accuracy. In this look-and-listen follow-up study, the focus on the PP region is hence reduced. As a result, their attention during the look-and-listen part of the experiment should be distributed more evenly across the whole sentence and the pictures. The post-experiment task, on the other hand, might highlight the aspect marker more than it was the case in the post-trial task and / or reduce the focus of attention on the PP region compared to the post-trial task in Experiment 1. Even though in the post-experiment task, participants still have to click on the location/instrument picture (i.e., the PP) which completes the sentence, the part of the sentence which helps them to complete the sentence correctly is only presented up to the aspect marker. Hence, the aspect marker becomes the final presented sentence region (in contrast to Experiment 1 in which the PP region was the final presented sentence region) and might be used as a cue, together with the verb, to trigger participants\u2019 memories regarding the end of the sentence (i.e., the location vs. the instrument PP).", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-14T11:54:21.557300", "date_modified": "2020-04-07T11:47:07.565921", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Maquate", "Borovsky", "Knoeferle"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "59aa229d5548fbeb827bab22867ff25adabf37ee36853268f64c257643793d5f4132615f1c86d1cf0d29407e9c97ef155895ee1409424defe6e4cbd7db767bca852d380a5f52d395bdc162a960554151dabb6e99200fa1a5f63aa462932e25bebabb6072e3945e05309a632954329baa0a2d659c5c6aa666290abdac3ee074cb0ed618332cd561a07e6322381b3a06d4", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-14T11:54:21.538191", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Katja Maquate, Arielle Borovsky, Pia Knoeferle"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Predictions for Eye-tracking data:\nNull hypothesis: If aspect and PP type do not influence real-time language processing, we should not find differences in fixations to instrument/location pictures between conditions.\n\nAH1) If the eye-tracking results from Experiment 1 are genuine effects and extend across task differences we should replicate the effects found in Experiment 1:\n\ta) a main effect of PP type (i.e., location vs. instrument prepositional phrase, see Study Design) during the prepositional phrase (PP) region.

Alternatively, if the task in Experiment 1 did not mask a potential interaction, we should replicate the non-significant interaction from Experiment 1. \n\n\nPredictions for post-experiment sentence-completion task\nOur main predictions focus on the task-mediated effects during the look-and-listen part of the experiment. However, aspectual event processing could also influence the post-experiment sentence-completion data pattern. Kreysa et al., 2018 found post-trial task differences when the task differed in focus (i.e., object depiction vs. role relations). Abashidze et al., (2019), on the other hand, had participants perform a post-look-and-listen event memory task (for future vs. past events) and found corroborating offline effects in the post-experiment to the online look-and-listen effects. Hence, on-line processing effects seem to be short-lived (i.e., post-trial) but can also extend to short-term memory (post-experiment). However, it is unclear, if the effects we predict for real-time aspectual event processing also extend to short-term memory. If they don\u2019t, we might not find any post-experiment effects. However, if they do, we predict the following:\n(Note: these analyses are pre-planned to be supplemental)\n\nPredictions choice accuracy: \nNull hypothesis: If aspect activation does not extend beyond immediate processing then we expect no offline accuracy difference between conditions.\nAH1a) If we replicate the post-trial results from Experiment 1, choice accuracy for instrument pictures should be higher than for location pictures, regardless of aspect marker and regardless of PP type. Additionally, if participants correctly remember sentence endings, we should find a main effect of PP type: Picture choice accuracy should be higher for location pictures (vs. instruments) when the sentence in the experiment contained a location (vs. instrument) PP and vice versa, regardless of aspect marker.\nAH1b) If aspect influences choice accuracy offline, we expect a (complimentary to the eye-tracking results from Experiment 1) main effect of aspect in the accuracy data: This effect did not come out in the offline data of Experiment 1; however, in this look-and-listen follow-up study, the focus on the PP region is reduced in the post-experiment picture-sentence completion task. Hence, in contrast to Experiment 1, we might find a main effect of aspect offline in this follow-up study. Effect pattern: Picture choice accuracy should be higher for locations (than instruments) when the sentence in the experiment contained an imperfective (vs. perfective) aspect marker and picture choice accuracy should be higher for instruments (than locations) when the sentence in the experiment contained a perfective (vs. imperfective) aspect marker, regardless of PP type named in the experiment. \n\nAH2) If imperfective aspect favors locations and perfective aspect favors instruments (cf., Ferretti et al., 2001, 2007) we could find an interaction between aspect and PP type: Even though we did not observe this interaction in the offline data of Experiment 1, the reduced focus on the PP in the post-experiment picture-sentence completion task could foster this interaction. Effect pattern: If the task assumptions hold, then picture choice accuracy should be higher for location pictures (vs. instruments) when a sentence in the experiment contained an imperfect (vs. perfective) aspect marker and a location (vs. instrument) PP. The opposite should be the case for instrument picture choices. \n\nPredictions for reaction times (correct trials only):\nNull Hypothesis: If aspect activation does not extend beyond immediate processing then we expect no reaction-time difference between conditions.\nAH1a) If the instrument bias we saw in Experiment 1 in the accuracy data (and also in a picture-cloze pretest from Experiment 1) extends to reaction times, RT to instrument pictures could be faster than RTs to location pictures regardless of aspect or PP type. Even though this effect was not observed in Experiment 1, the post-experiment sentence completion task could, in contrast to the post-trial task from Experiment 1, bring out RT differences to a greater extent This could be due to the difference in task presentation and the task itself (click on the picture mentioned in the sentence): Although the instructions emphasized the importance of fast and accurate responses, the click-on-picture task was not challenging for participants and they knew what to expect after every single trial. Accuracy was at ceiling. These reasons might have overshadowed potential RT difference for location vs. instrument pictures (and also between conditions). \n     The post-experiment picture-sentence completion task is likely much more challenging, since participants have to memorize what they heard and saw during the experiment and in addition they don\u2019t have access to the full information, i.e., the PP is omitted in the picture-sentence completion task. To the extent that this holds, we may see evidence for an instrument bias also in the RT data: RT to the correct pictures could be faster for instrument PP (vs. location PP) regardless of aspect. Although we did not see this effect in Experiment 1, due to the post-experiment memory task being more cognitively demanding compared to the post-trial task, we might observe this effect in this follow-up study. That is, there might not have been RT differences between conditions in Experiment 1 because participants did not have to think carefully before clicking on the PP mentioned in the picture. However, in the post-experiment memory/sentence-completion task, clicking on the correct picture is more cognitively demanding; as a result, it could bring out the instrument bias we observed in the accuracy data in Experiment 1 also in the RT data of this follow-up study. This would strengthen evidence regarding the instrument bias found in the cloze-pretest and the accuracy data in Experiment 1.\n\nAH1b) If task differences between Experiment 1 and this follow-up increase the emphasis on the aspect region, we might see a main effect of aspect (which was not present in Experiment 1): RT to the correct pictures could be faster for imperfective (vs. perfective) aspect markers, regardless of PP type.\n\nAH2) If imperfective aspect favors locations and perfective aspect favors instruments (cf., Ferretti et al., 2001, 2007) we could find an interaction between aspect and PP type: Picture choice RT could be faster for location pictures (vs. instruments) when a sentence in the experiment contained an imperfect (vs. perfective) aspect marker and a location (vs. instrument) PP.

The display repetitions for each item pair (i.e., the 4 pictures of a pair) are constructed such that the repetitions don\u2019t follow directly after another and the picture positions within the display vary. Every item is interspersed by two fillers and no two items follow directly after each other. Additionally, no two items presented in the same condition follow each other.

Fixation probabilities often violate the homogeneity of variance assumption, this is not the case for log ratios of looks (cf., Arai, van Gompel &amp; Scheepers, 2008). Reaction time data are positively skewed and thus often not normally distributed. Log transforming reaction times and also fixations helps to approach a normal distribution. \nAll fixed effects will be sum-coded: this allows fixed effect interpretation similar to traditional ANOVA effects (i.e., main effects by averaging over the other factor and interactions). Fixed effects will also be centered to avoid collinearity.\n", "q19": "We will use lmerTest (Satterthwhaite approximation) to obtain p-values, i.e., we will not perform model comparison for fixed effects (see Luke, 2017).

For smaller sample sizes, LRT is anticonservative. Satterthwhaite approximation for degrees of freedom produced acceptable Type 1 error rates even for small sample sizes, i.e., type 1 error rates were closest to 0.5 using Satterthwhaite (and Kennward-Roger) approximations (compared with LRT and parametric bootstrapping, see Luke, 2017).

Random effect structure reduction is done with REML=FALSE. Random effect structure reduction will be done by assessing the variance each of the random slopes captures in the model (using VarCorr(model) and summary(rePCA(model)). If a variance component does not capture any (meaningful) variance, it will be removed from the model. The random effect structure will be reduced until the model converges and all variance components capture variance explained by the model. This is the most parsimonious (in contrast to the maximal and often overfitted) model (see Bates et al., 2015). We will not look at the fixed effects before the most parsimonious model has been obtained. If two (or more) models converge and seem to capture the variance equally well, the models will be compared using the anova (model1, model2) function to determine which model provides the better fit for the data. When the model that best fits the data is found, REML is set to TRUE for more precise parameter estimation in that model and only then will we look at the fixed effects using summary(model). The fixed effects part of the model remains unchanged. \n", "q17.uploader": []}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecac48", "text": "Social and Behavioral Sciences"}, {"id": "584240d954be81056ceca960", "text": "Linguistics"}, {"id": "584240da54be81056cecabe1", "text": "Psycholinguistics and Neurolinguistics"}]]}, "relationships": {"license": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965", "type": "licenses"}}, "children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=fp4wc", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/de-1/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "de-1", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "fp4wc", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "fp4wc", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/8gvjq/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "8gvjq", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fxjqb/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "fxjqb", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5e795fc0d2833800195735d0/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5e795fc0d2833800195735d0", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/fp4wc/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/fp4wc/"}}, {"id": "jukm4", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Creativity &amp;

Realistic tasks have the advantage of being more attractive than other divergent thinking tasks (such as the Alternative Uses Task; Guilford, 1968), because the realism can be more interesting than an abstract problem, and it is possible that the individual has more relevant experience and, therefore, relevant information (Runco, Dow, &amp; Smith, 2006). The realistic problems are open-ended questions, but unlike other divergent tasks, the problems focus on situations that participants might actually experience. Specifically, in the present study two general problems that have been used in past research (e.g., Runco, Illies, &amp; Eisenman, 2005) are adopted, along with two problems specifically referring to the COVID-19 scenario. An example problem for the COVID-19 scenario is: \u201cAt the end of the Coronavirus emergency, open-air concerts are restarting. Finally, you can listen live you preferred artist, but there is the obligation to ensure a distance of 1 meter, otherwise a fine of 300 euros/dollars is imposed. You are still determined to go to the concert. What do you do to be sure that no one will approach you less than 1 meter?\u201d \nParticipants are asked to produce as many alternative solutions as they can in 3 minutes for each problem. Each response will be then evaluated for originality by two independent expert raters. All the responses will be copied into a spreadsheet and sorted alphabetically within each problem. This method will ensure that the raters will be blind to several factors that could bias their ratings: the response serial position in the set, the total number of responses in the set, and the preceding and following responses. The two raters will read all the responses prior to scoring them, and they will score the responses separately. Each response will receive a rating on a 1 (not at all original) to 5 (highly original) scale using the procedure proposed by Silvia and colleagues (2008). Furthermore, the fluency score as the total number of responses in the production of alternative solutions for each participant will be calculated both for general problems and for COVID-19 problems.\n\n\n- Creative self-beliefs.\nSelf-perception of creativity is evaluated with the Short Scale of the Creative Self (SSCS; Karwowski et al., 2012). This scale provides separate indicators of creative self-efficacy (CSE) and creative personal identity (CPI). These two constructs are evaluated by 11 items, 6 which measures CSE and 5 which measures CPI. Exemplary items are: \u201cI trust my creative abilities\u201d and \u201cBeing a creative person is important to me\u201d. All items are rated using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 \u201cdefinitely not\u201d to 5 \u201cdefinitely yes\u201d.\n\n\n- Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) Scale.\nThe TIPI Scale is a methodology developed within the Big-Five theoretical framework, which has been demonstrated to allow a rapid and valid assessment of the five personality dimensions (Gosling, Rentfrow, &amp; Swann, 2003). Each item in this 10-item version represents one pole of the Big Five dimensions. As for format, each item consists of two descriptors, separated by a comma. Each item is rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (disagree strongly) to 7 (agree strongly). Participants are instructed to write one of the seven numbers next to each of the 10 items to indicate the extent to which they see themselves fitting the descriptors.\n\n\n- Mental health outcomes: depression and distress.\nDepression is assessed with the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Spitzer et al. 1999), which is a self-report questionnaire that efficiently allow a rapid DSM-IV criteria-based depression diagnosis. PHQ-9 has been demonstrated to have a high criterion validity as a diagnostic measure, both with respect to DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria (Loewe, Spitzer, et al., 2004; Loewe, Grafe, et al., 2004). Moreover, it has been shown that PHQ-9 is particularly sensitive to change and accurately reflect depression outcomes (Loewe, Kroenke, et al., 2004). Specifically, the scale make reference to symptoms happening in the last 14 days.\nDistress to the COVID-19 situation is assessed with the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised scale (IES-R; Creamer et al., 2003; Weiss &amp; Marmar, 1997) which is probably the most diffused measure in the field of traumatic stress. This scale assessed the three dimensions defining a traumatic stress reaction through three subscales: intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal. Specifically, the scale asks respondents about the frequency with which each symptom has occurred over the past week. In particular, for the present study the scale makes specifically reference to the COVID-19 emergence, giving a description of the COVID-19 outbreak to which participants should refer during the completion of the scale (\"Local, state, and national governments have taken measures aimed at preventing the rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus, including social isolation. These measures have been taken because of the dangerous nature of the virus and the present lack of a vaccine or an effective treatment for the illness the virus causes\").\n\n\n- Demographic variables (which will be used to provide a specific characterisation of the sample tested in the study):\n\nAge (from 18 to 100) \n\nGender (3 options):\n1.\t Male\n2.\t Female\n3.\t Other\n\nHave you been hospitalized for a neurological or mental health condition (2 options)?\n1.\t Yes\n2.\t No\n\nIn which country are you nowadays (open question)?\n\nIn which region are you nowadays (open question)?\n[This question and the previous one have been merged in the US version of the survey into a single question \"In which country are you nowadays?\" including the list of the 50 states to choose from] \n\nMaximum educational degree achieved (6 options): \n1.\t Primary school\n2.\t Lower secondary school\n3.\t High secondary school\n4.\t Master-Degree\n5.\t Post-graduate degree\n6.\t Ph.D.\n[Because of a different organisation in the educational system, this question presents the following options in the US version of the survey:\n- High School\n- Some College\n- College Graduate\n- Master\u2019s Degree\n- Some graduate school\n- Graduate Degree]\n\nWhich is your employment status (7 options):\n1.\t Unemployed\n2.\t Student\n3.\t Student-Worker\n4.\t Part-Time Work\n5.\t Full-Time Work\n6.\tSelf-employed\n7.\t Pensioner/retiree\n[Because of a different organisation in the employment system, this question presents the following options in the US version of the survey:\n1.\t Unemployed\n2.\t Part-Time Work\n3.\t Full-Time Work\n4.\t Self-employed \n5.\t Retiree]"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q16": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Exposure to COVID-19 will be scored as a sum (ranging from 3 to 12) of the following variables: number of infected persons in participant\u2019s region at the moment of the participation in the study (1=low; 2=medium; 3=high taking into account the national average); number of contacts outside of with whom participant was currently quarantining in the last 14 days (1=low; 2=medium; 3=high); frequency of contacts with persons affected from Coronavirus in the last 14 days (1=low; 2=medium; 3=high); acquaintances affected by Coronavirus (0=no; 1=yes); relatives affected by Coronavirus (0=no; 1=yes); death among persons the participant know due to Coronavirus (0=no; 1=yes)."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q17": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "The pattern of relations specified via the model of hypotheses proposed in the attached Figure will be investigated through a structural equation model using the Mplus software (Muth\u00e9n &amp; Muth\u00e9n, 1998\u20132015), with an observed score for the COVID-19 exposure variable and four latent variables (Plasticity, defined by the Openness and Extraversion manifest variables; Stability, defined by the Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Agreeableness manifest variables; Creative Self-Beliefs, defined by the Creative Identity and  Creative Self-Efficacy manifest variables; Psychological Discomfort defined by IES-R Avoidance, Intrusion, and Hyperarousal, and the PHQ-9 Depression manifest variables; Creative performance defined by the manifest variables of Fluency and Originality in the two types of divergent thinking problems)."}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Hypothetical model.pdf"}, "nodeId": "9s8r2", "sha256": "5baf2c860f14e9f55a88a8daf0e61d9b63ae2e3196a54f2a2a99867c3d6da5b0", "viewUrl": "/project/jukm4/files/osfstorage/5e94da4a43016603a9a06fd8/", "selectedFileName": "Hypothetical model.pdf"}], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "The main predictors and the hypothesized mediation effect will be examined using a bootstrap estimation with 5,000 samples (Muth\u00e9n &amp; Muth\u00e9n, 1998\u20132015).

Specifically, for the present study two problems related to the everyday life are used and two problems specifically referring to the COVID-19 situation. The context manipulation (everyday vs. COVID-19) of the problems allows us to explore the creative performance as a function of the specific stressful condition associated to the COVID-19. Creative self-beliefs are measured through the Short Scale of Creative Scale (Karwowski et al., 2012), measuring creative self-efficacy and creative identity. Finally, we take into account the predictive effect of personality, which can predict both creativity (Karwowski &amp; Lebuda, 2016; Feist, 1998) and mental health outcomes (Kotov et al., 2010). \n\nThe study will be conducting as an observational study via a survey created through the online PsyToolkit platform (Stoet, 2010, 2017). Using institutional channels (University websites) and social networks, the online link to the study will be spread in order to recruit volunteers. The online procedure has a total duration of around 20 minutes. After the initial written informed consent, participants will complete four blocks of tasks composed by: 1) two realistic problems (one general and one COVID-related problem), 2) two questionnaires (SSCS scale and PHQ-9 scale), 3) two realistic problems (one general and one COVID-related problem), 4) two questionnaires (TIPI, IES-R). Within each block the order of the tasks/questionnaires will be fully randomized across participants. Finally, a series of demographic questions (gender, age, nation, region, education level, type of work) along with questions asking for exposure to COVID-19 (see variables section) are included.", "q6.uploader": [], "q10.question": "The study will be conducting using the online PsyToolkit platform (Stoet, 2010, 2017). Using institutional channels (University websites) and social networks, the online link to the study will be spread in order to recruit volunteers (recruiting participants from the age of 18 years).\n\nAround 600 participants are planned to be involved in the study. Participants completing less than 80% of the online study will be excluded from the data analysis. Moreover, participants reporting current or past neurological or psychopathological problems will be excluded from the study.\n\nWe have set up the study in PsyToolKit and because of the exceptionality of the situation related to the COVID-19 emergence we intend to begin the study promptly. We anticipate that data collection will take approximately two weeks since several authors will collect data simultaneously over different countries in Europe and the United States. The scoring of the data would take around three weeks as well as data analysis would take approximately three weeks/one month.", "q10.uploader": [], "q14.question": "", "q14.uploader": [], "q15.question": "- Exposure to COVID-19.\nExposure to COVID-19 will be scored as a sum (ranging from 3 to 12) of the following variables: number of infected persons in participant\u2019s state/region at the moment of the participation in the study (1=low; 2=medium; 3=high taking into account the national average); number of contacts outside of with whom participant was currently quarantining in the last 14 days (1=low; 2=medium; 3=high); frequency of contacts with persons affected from Coronavirus in the last 14 days (1=low; 2=medium; 3=high); acquaintances affected by Coronavirus (0=no; 1=yes); relatives affected by Coronavirus (0=no; 1=yes); death among persons the participant know due to Coronavirus (0=no; 1=yes).\n\nIn the following the items and scales for this variable:\n\nHow much contact in person have you had outside of with whom you are currently quarantining in the last 14 days (4 options)?\n1. None\n2. On one or two occasions\n3. About once a week\n4. About once a day\n\nHow frequently have you come into contact in person with someone with a Coronavirus diagnosis in the last 14 days (5 options)?\n1.\tNever\n2.\tRarely\n3.\tAbout once a week\n4.\tSeveral times a week\n5.\tEvery day\n\nHad been Coronavirus diagnosed in people you know (2 options)?\n1.\t Yes\n2.\t No\n\nHad been Coronavirus diagnosed in a family member (2 options)?\n1.\t Yes\n2.\t No\n\nHave you lost anyone you know to Coronavirus (2 options)?\n1.\t Yes\n2.\t No\n\n\n- Divergent thinking performance: Realistic Problems.\nCreative performance is scored through a classical divergent thinking task: realistic problems. Realistic tasks have the advantage of being more attractive than other divergent thinking tasks (such as the Alternative Uses Task; Guilford, 1968), because the realism can be more interesting than an abstract problem, and it is possible that the individual has more relevant experience and, therefore, relevant information (Runco, Dow, &amp; Smith, 2006). The realistic problems are open-ended questions, but unlike other divergent tasks, the problems focus on situations that participants might actually experience. Specifically, in the present study two general problems that have been used in past research (e.g., Runco, Illies, &amp; Eisenman, 2005) are adopted, along with two problems specifically referring to the COVID-19 scenario. An example problem for the COVID-19 scenario is: \u201cAt the end of the Coronavirus emergency, open-air concerts are restarting. Finally, you can listen live you preferred artist, but there is the obligation to ensure a distance of 1 meter, otherwise a fine of 300 euros/dollars is imposed. You are still determined to go to the concert. What do you do to be sure that no one will approach you less than 1 meter?\u201d \nParticipants are asked to produce as many alternative solutions as they can in 3 minutes for each problem. Each response will be then evaluated for originality by two independent expert raters. All the responses will be copied into a spreadsheet and sorted alphabetically within each problem. This method will ensure that the raters will be blind to several factors that could bias their ratings: the response serial position in the set, the total number of responses in the set, and the preceding and following responses. The two raters will read all the responses prior to scoring them, and they will score the responses separately. Each response will receive a rating on a 1 (not at all original) to 5 (highly original) scale using the procedure proposed by Silvia and colleagues (2008). Furthermore, the fluency score as the total number of responses in the production of alternative solutions for each participant will be calculated both for general problems and for COVID-19 problems.\n\n\n- Creative self-beliefs.\nSelf-perception of creativity is evaluated with the Short Scale of the Creative Self (SSCS; Karwowski et al., 2012). This scale provides separate indicators of creative self-efficacy (CSE) and creative personal identity (CPI). These two constructs are evaluated by 11 items, 6 which measures CSE and 5 which measures CPI. Exemplary items are: \u201cI trust my creative abilities\u201d and \u201cBeing a creative person is important to me\u201d. All items are rated using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 \u201cdefinitely not\u201d to 5 \u201cdefinitely yes\u201d.\n\n\n- Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) Scale.\nThe TIPI Scale is a methodology developed within the Big-Five theoretical framework, which has been demonstrated to allow a rapid and valid assessment of the five personality dimensions (Gosling, Rentfrow, &amp; Swann, 2003). Each item in this 10-item version represents one pole of the Big Five dimensions. As for format, each item consists of two descriptors, separated by a comma. Each item is rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (disagree strongly) to 7 (agree strongly). Participants are instructed to write one of the seven numbers next to each of the 10 items to indicate the extent to which they see themselves fitting the descriptors.\n\n\n- Mental health outcomes: depression and distress.\nDepression is assessed with the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Spitzer et al. 1999), which is a self-report questionnaire that efficiently allow a rapid DSM-IV criteria-based depression diagnosis. PHQ-9 has been demonstrated to have a high criterion validity as a diagnostic measure, both with respect to DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria (Loewe, Spitzer, et al., 2004; Loewe, Grafe, et al., 2004). Moreover, it has been shown that PHQ-9 is particularly sensitive to change and accurately reflect depression outcomes (Loewe, Kroenke, et al., 2004). Specifically, the scale make reference to symptoms happening in the last 14 days.\nDistress to the COVID-19 situation is assessed with the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised scale (IES-R; Creamer et al., 2003; Weiss &amp; Marmar, 1997) which is probably the most diffused measure in the field of traumatic stress. This scale assessed the three dimensions defining a traumatic stress reaction through three subscales: intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal. Specifically, the scale asks respondents about the frequency with which each symptom has occurred over the past week. In particular, for the present study the scale makes specifically reference to the COVID-19 emergence, giving a description of the COVID-19 outbreak to which participants should refer during the completion of the scale (\"Local, state, and national governments have taken measures aimed at preventing the rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus, including social isolation. These measures have been taken because of the dangerous nature of the virus and the present lack of a vaccine or an effective treatment for the illness the virus causes\").\n\n\n- Demographic

In addition to the emotional burden for the mother, it can severely affect the cognitive, emotional and social development of the offspring. Although there are effective options for early intervention, a major problem in the treatment of PPD is its early recognition. In the past, attempts have been made to predict postpartum depression. However, most attempts have either been late in the postpartum period, only reached a low sensitivity, or were only based on a single time point for prediction. Furthermore, adjustment disorder (AD), another condition that is frequently associated with childbirth, has been ignored as potential differential diagnosis in those predictions. Therefore, we aimed at predicting the diagnosis of PPD as early as possible in our explanatory analysis. We evaluated the potential predictive power of combinations of demographic and clinical risk factors, postnatal depression and attachment scores, and mood and stress levels. Our classifiers reached a high balanced accuracy (BA) already at week 3 for the differentiation of healthy controls from PPD and AD (HC vs. PPD: BA = 0.87, HC vs. AD: BA = 0.91), and a high balanced accuracy for the differentiation of PPD and AD at week 6 (BA = 0.76). The best classifiers included either the mood level alone (PPD vs. AD), mood level in combination with postnatal depression scores (HC vs. PPD), or mood level in combination with postnatal depression and attachment scores (HC vs. AD).

However, most attempts have either been late in the postpartum period, only reached a low sensitivity, or were only based on a single time point for prediction. Furthermore, adjustment disorder (AD), another condition that is frequently associated with childbirth, has been ignored as potential differential diagnosis in those predictions. Therefore, we aimed at predicting the diagnosis of PPD as early as possible in our explanatory analysis.

You said that you found a new apartment and would be spending the whole day moving. A volunteered to help you move.

(2006):\nRecently, you got a job in a new company and met a new colleague, A. You and A chatted together occasionally. One day, A asked you what you would be doing next Saturday. You said that you found a new apartment and would be spending the whole day moving. A volunteered to help you move. That Saturday, you saw A outside of your apartment early in the morning, ready to help. A helped you for most of the day until you completed your move. With the help of A, you saved lots of time and effort. Afterwards, you learned the reason why A offered to help.\nIn the control condition, participants read \u2018A hoped that you could undertake some of their work in the future\u2019. In the gratitude condition, participants read \u2018Having experienced moving house alone, A knew how hard and tiring it was and did not want you to suffer\u2019. The latter description of the intent of A\u2019s helping behaviour proved to be efficient in inducing gratitude (Watkins et al., 2006). Afterwards, participants rated how much gratitude, shame, unhappiness, anger, indebtedness, and guilt they felt towards A, to what extent they thought A concerned for their benefits, to what extent they wanted to build a friendship with A, to what extent they thought a friendship with A would benefit them in the future, how much cost they thought A undertook for helping them, how much benefit they thought they received from A (1 = not at all, 9 = very much).\nThe participants then imagined the following situation and answered a series of questions:\nColleague A, who helped you move before, do not come to work on a Friday afternoon. You know that A is going hiking without leave. Your boss is very angry because of A\u2019s absence and asks you why A is absent.\n\nMoral violation (lying): How likely you are to lie to your boss in order to help A.\nHarm avoidance: To what extent you want to reduce A\u2019s potential losses when answering your boss\u2019s question.\nMoral judgment: To what extent A\u2019s behaviour is immoral.\nMoral principle: To what extent you concern for your own honesty when answering your boss\u2019s question\nConcerns for one\u2019s own benefits: To what extent you concern for your own benefits when answering your boss\u2019s question.\n\n\n", "q6.uploader": [], "q10.question": "Participants will be recruited through advertisements posted on the BBS of our university.

research. While there are numerous studies that investigate well-being among students, and others that explore teacher well-being, it is often the case that they are researched in isolation from one another, despite being interconnected with the same university environment. In the present study we conduct semi-structured interviews to comprehensively investigate the interaction between student and teacher well-being. In doing this, we explore similarities and differences in how students and teachers define their perceptions of well-being at the university, and how the two overlap. Gaining knowledge about this topic is important for understanding how teachers and students can benefit from one another in terms of maintaining and fostering well-being in the university environment.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-14T08:16:31.203607", "date_modified": "2020-04-06T09:33:57.574845", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["Health Psychology", "Higher Education", "Interview Study", "Learning Environment", "Qualitative Research", "Resilience", "Self-Determination Theory", "Semi-structured Interviews", "Student Well-Being", "University", "Wellbeing", "Well-Being"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["not applicable"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "6801d122ecbe36df0bfdcf8bcfcca9d17a8a2c32d1756645c7b02802b9d2c3ca833d70c32b47a402814c689b5d59ea13a32ad95c7dd959b2cd54c5f4a76fa8e43cfd546ac3c1c8df9ef684edbd2435fdc0e167d71845065d5b34fba2543e696b320758be6d45160f5a90be46fc7fc4dd4a8d3366f2eb6ecb2815983c4c3be195bcc48dafbb73363301ebd01642c6f43c", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-14T08:16:31.180243", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Lisa Kiltz, E.P.W.A.
