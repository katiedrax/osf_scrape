failure to pay fines or failure to appear in court. We want to survey why residents have not restored their driver\u2019s license, and how having a suspended driver\u2019s license has affected their life.

First, we will collect anonymous demographic information from participants, including age, race, gender, family size, and income. \n\n2. Next, we will also ask participants about some factors of their day to day life, including employment history, how often they interact with law enforcement, how much they trust the criminal justice system, what their preferred form of communication with the justice system is (phone call, text, etc.), and whether their current address is up to date with the NC DMV.

Based on participant responses to whether their license is suspended, they will be directed to one of two blocks of questions.\n\tA. Participants who do have a suspended license will answer questions about their experiences having a suspended license, and how it has affected their day to day life. This includes questions on:\n-Why the license was suspended?\n-What year the license was suspended\n-How the license has affected getting to work, keeping a job, feeling stressed, grocery shopping, accessing childcare, getting children to school, accessing leisure activities, pursuing education, spending times with friends, paying rent, going to the doctor, and getting medication.\n-Life changes as the result of suspension, such as having to move and going off medications.\n-Attempts to restore their license, or reasons for not doing so.\n-Whether they still drive with a suspended license, why, and how often.\n\n\tB.

We are also interested in learning more about the process for participants that have suspended licenses, including what may have prevented them from restoring their license.\n\nWe are also interested in comparing participants above the poverty line to those below the poverty line, with the goal of determining if poor participants are more negatively impacted by a license suspension (or hypothetical suspension) than participants above the poverty line.\n\nIf we get enough (&gt;75) participants in relevant conditions, we may also compare participants with actual suspensions to those without suspensions offering hypothetical ratings of the DVs, to see if participants can correctly imagine how a license suspension would impact them. \n\nFinally, we predict that at least 30% of participants who provide PII and report not having a suspended license will actually have a suspended license when cross-referenced by AOC data. We make this prediction based on an earlier project (forthcoming at UCLA Criminal Law Review: Modjadidi, Crozier &amp; Garrett) that over 30% of a paper version of this survey was returned as undeliverable.

We want to survey why residents have not restored their driver\u2019s license, and how having a suspended driver\u2019s license has affected their life. Such information will give us a better understanding of how license suspension policies may put citizens into an inescapable cycle of being unable to pay fines, and result in indefinite suspensions for relatively minor legal infractions.\n\nThe project will also be comparing answers from those who live above the poverty line to those who live below the poverty line.\n\nSampling\n\nWe will recruit 800 North Carolina residents total.  400 participants will have incomes below the poverty line and four hundred participants will have incomes above the poverty line. Further, we plan to collect some participant identification information (names and birthdates) from 200 participants (100 above the poverty line, 100 below).\n\nParticipants recruited by Qualtrics will be emailed a link to the Qualtrics survey about participants\u2019 experiences having a suspended driver\u2019s license. Qualtrics recruits participants through volunteers who provide email addresses. \n\n200 participants will be asked to voluntarily provide their name for the research team to cross reference with a publicly available list of people with suspended licenses, to verify whether their licenses are actually suspended or not.  Evidence shows that people may have suspended licenses and not know it. The list of suspended drivers is available via a request from The Administrative of the Courts (AOC) and the Automated Criminal/Infractions System (ACIS).\n\nWe will also ask participants to provide their name and contact information if they would like to schedule a follow up interview.  Participants also have the option of being contacted if they are unaware of their license status and want to know if it is suspended.\n\n\n\nMethod / Procedure\n\nThe survey will collect information from participants on several measures.\n\n1. First, we will collect anonymous demographic information from participants, including age, race, gender, family size, and income. \n\n2. Next, we will also ask participants about some factors of their day to day life, including employment history, how often they interact with law enforcement, how much they trust the criminal justice system, what their preferred form of communication with the justice system is (phone call, text, etc.), and whether their current address is up to date with the NC DMV. Importantly, we will also ask if their license is currently suspended.\n\n3. Based on participant responses to whether their license is suspended, they will be directed to one of two blocks of questions.\n\tA. Participants who do have a suspended license will answer questions about their experiences having a suspended license, and how it has affected their day to day life. This includes questions on:\n-Why the license was suspended?\n-What year the license was suspended\n-How the license has affected getting to work, keeping a job, feeling stressed, grocery shopping, accessing childcare, getting children to school, accessing leisure activities, pursuing education, spending times with friends, paying rent, going to the doctor, and getting medication.\n-Life changes as the result of suspension, such as having to move and going off medications.\n-Attempts to restore their license, or reasons for not doing so.\n-Whether they still drive with a suspended license, why, and how often.\n\n\tB. Participants who do not have a suspended license will answer these questions in the hypothetical \u2013 \u201cimagine if you had a license, how would it affect getting to work / keeping a job / etc.\u201d\n4. Participants will then be asked if they have anything else to add in a free response text, and then be directed to a second survey (to maintain anonymity) to provide PII if they choose.\n\n\nOur complete survey is attached in QSF and .pdf form\n\nResearch Questions &amp; Analysis Plan\nThis project is primarily exploratory and descriptive. We make no confirmatory hypotheses.\n\nFirst and foremost, we are interested in learning more about how a driver\u2019s license suspension affects the day to day life of participants.

This research has implications in domains where individuals must rely on their own, independent knowledge to forecast future events.  That is, rather than collaborate with or aggregate across estimates from multiple judges, an individual can simulate the benefits related to crowd wisdom by sampling repeatedly from their own knowledge.

Mostly, classes with high type frequency show a regular conjugation pattern whereas classes with low type frequency show an irregular conjugation pattern (Goldberg 2019: 66-68).\n\nWithin the classes with low type frequency, token frequency influences whether a member will stay in the class or change to the type frequent class: token frequent members stay in the type infrequent class, while token infrequent members change to the type frequent class (Bybee and Thompson 1997). This principle has been studied in several corpus studies (e.g., Nowak 2015, Sch\u00e4fer 2016). However, psycholinguistic studies on frequency and variation do not exist. \n\nIn the past, psycholinguistic studies focussed on the difference between the processing of regular and irregular morphology and on the question whether token frequency only influences the processing of irregular conjugation, but not of regular conjugation (dual mechanism model by Pinker and Prince 1991; see Bornkessel-Schlesewsky 2009: 47-68 for an overview over the studies). Token frequency influences reaction times with regard to irregular verbs in general: Clahsen et al. (2001) report that preterite forms of irregular German verbs with a low frequency of preterite forms elicit slower reaction times in a lexical decision task than preterite forms of verbs with a high frequency of preterite forms. \nHowever, it has not been studied so far whether variation caused by low frequency might affect reaction times. It would be interesting to test whether the results of Clahsen et al. (2001) also hold for regular forms of irregular verbs with differing token frequencies. Additionally, it has not been examined whether variation can be detected in reaction times before it is visible in corpora. Here, irregular verbs are of interest that do not vary in corpora yet but have similar token frequencies as verbs that already show variation. Again, not only the reaction times elicited by irregular forms but also by regular forms of the verbs are of interest.\n\nThis study aims to answer the research questions with the help of a lexical decision task. For the task, verbs are used that belong to the type infrequent irregular (strong) conjugation class in German. The verbs have differing participle frequencies and show different degrees of variation in corpora. Participants are asked to judge the participle forms of the test verbs which are presented with strong (irregular) as well as weak (regular) inflection."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "frequent vs. infrequent\n\nThe reaction times depend on the frequency of the test verbs: Reaction times are lower for frequent strong verbs (over 13 hits per million tokens), whereas reaction times are higher for infrequent strong verbs (up to 2 hits per million tokens). This can be observed for weak as well as strong forms and for the acceptance as well as the rejection of forms. The relative frequency of the test verbs is determined with the help of the word frequencies provided by the digital dictionary of the German language (Digitales W\u00f6rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache, Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften).\n\nWith the help of the design, reaction times can be interpreted as an indicator for variation. From a frequency-based view, reaction times should be shorter for frequent verbs than for infrequent verbs (Clahsen et al. 2001). The design allows to control for the general influence of frequency: Weak forms of token frequent verbs (e.g., \"gezieht\" instead of \"gezogen\" 'pulled') occur extremly seldom in language use and are thus not token frequent. A fast rejection of these forms can therefore not be traced back to the frequency of the forms. The same logic holds for weak forms of infrequent verbs (\"gefechtet\" instead of \"gefochten\" 'fenced') that are not attested in corpora yet (ratio of more than 100 strong forms to one weak form).  \nDifferences in reaction times can thus be interpreted as an indicator for variants:  entrenched forms are accepted fast and forms that are unlikely to be produced are rejected fast whereas the judgement of variants takes longer because two forms with equal function exist. Hence, the form \"gezieht\" should be rejected fast, but not \"geflechtet\": \"geflechtet\" is not attested in corpora yet, but the strong participle of \"flechten\" is similar frequent as the participles of other verbs that already show variation (e.g., \"salzen\" 'to salt'). Crucially, the hypothesised difference in reaction times cannot be traced back to differences in token frequency between the verb forms, as the token frequency of both forms (\"geflechtet\" and \"gezieht\") is equally low because both forms are nearly inexistent. \n\nattested vs. not attested\n\nThe infrequent verbs are divided into the categories variation attested in corpora and variation not attested in corpora. Based on a usage-based framework, it is hypothesised that no difference can be measured in the reaction times between forms that are attested in corpora and forms that are not attested in corpora. This holds for strong and weak forms as well as the acceptance and the rejection of forms. As the verbs are infrequent, the strong forms of the verbs are infrequent as well and thus cannot dominate the weak forms in frequency. Hence, the statistical pre-emption (Goldberg 2019: 75-84) of strong forms is impaired. Strong and weak forms can be considered variants for infrequent strong verbs. Reaction times are therefore higher as two forms with equal function exists. \n\nNote that it is also possible to expect differences in reaction time within a usage-based framework. As the weak forms are more seldom for verbs without attested variation and strong forms are in turn more frequent, a slight difference in reaction times might be observable between verbs with attested and verbs without attested variation. If weak forms occur only seldom, these forms should be rejected fast and the correspondent strong form should be accepted fast, as this is the only entrenched form. In contrast, longer reaction times are expected if weak forms occur more often as now there are two competing forms. However, this difference should be more subtle than the difference between frequent and infrequent test verbs because the strong forms of infrequent verbs cannot dominate the weak forms in frequency as much as strong forms of frequent verbs can.  \nThe design allows testing both hypotheses. The test verbs are selected by calculating the ratio of strong and weak participle forms using the corpus w-public of the archive W for written language (W-\u00f6ffentlich - alle \u00f6ffentlichen Korpora des Archivs W) which is part of the German Reference Corpus (Deutsches Referenzkorpus, Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Deutsche Sprache). The search was carried out with Cosmas 2 (Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Deutsche Sprache). A form is defined to be attested in corpora if the ratio of strong to weak forms is smaller than 100/1. If no differences in reaction times can be measured between verbs with and without attested variation, this can be taken as an indicator that variation is already measurable before it is attested in corpora. \n\n2. acceptability and consistency of answers\n\nfrequent vs. infrequent\n\nThe acceptability of weak and strong forms depends on the token frequency of strong verbs. Strong forms are accepted for frequent strong verbs, whereas weak forms are not accepted. For infrequent strong verbs, both forms are accepted. \nFor frequent verbs, a clearly distributed response behaviour is expected: predominantly rejection for weak forms and predominantly acceptance for strong forms. This is not expected for infrequent verbs: while acceptance is expected for strong forms, a mixed response behaviour is expected for weak forms. Additionally, the response behaviour of individual participants is expected to be consistent for frequent verbs (rejection of the weak form of a verb, acceptance of the strong form) but not for infrequent verbs (rejection/acceptance of both forms). \n\nvariation attested in corpora vs. not attested in corpora\n\nFor infrequent test verbs, it is hypothesized that the acceptability of weak forms is influenced by the occurrence of weak forms in corpora. Although a corpus cannot picture language use as a whole, it can nonetheless give a hint on how likely it is that a certain form has been produced by speakers and hence perceived by other speakers. If weak forms are already attested in corpora, it is more likely that participants already encountered these forms and that the forms are more entrenchend. The opposite is to be expected for forms that are not attested in corpora. Weak forms are therefore more likely to be accepted if they already have been witnessed in corpora.  \n\nNote that this hypothesis is not the only possible hypothesis from a usage-based perspective. Comparable acceptance rates can also be expected: As the frequency of the strong participles is low for verbs with attested as well as without attested variation, the verbs could be treated in the same way. Hence, it is also possible that the infrequent verbs with and without attested variation show comparable acceptance and rejection rates of the weak and strong participle forms. The study design allows testing both hypotheses."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled trials."}, "q6": {"extra": [], "value": ["For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to which they have been assigned."]}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q8": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "A within subject design is used with two factors (frequency and inflection), that have three (frequent, infrequent without variation, infrequent with variation) and two levels (weak, strong), respectively. Per level of frequency, eight test words are used.  The participants are shown test words with weak as well as strong inflection and are asked to decide whether they know the word (\"Kennen Sie dieses Wort bzw. diese Wortabfolge?\" 'Do you know this word/word sequence?'). The answer (yes/no) as well as the reaction times are used for data analysis. \nSo called weak masculine nouns with weak and strong inflection are used as fillers. They serve as test nouns for a study on the influence of schematicity on variation. Additionally,  strong genitive forms ending with -es are used as fillers. The genitive form -es is used for nouns that normally have -s as genitive ending as they do not allow -es phonotactically (*des Abendes 'the evening.GEN') (Szczepaniak 2010). \nTo test the design, reaction times elicited by long (-es) and short (-s) genitive endings of two nouns not allowing long genitive endings are contrasted (Ultimatum, Internet) as well as reaction times elicited by regular and irregular forms of the irregular verbs \"gehen\" 'to go' and \"bringen\" 'to bring'. These items will only be relevant if the statistical analysis of the test items does not hint to differences in reaction times.  The items allow to test whether the design can elicit differences in reaction times in general. The following mixed linear model will be used  if the design needs to be tested: reaction time ~ acceptance + (1+acceptance|item)+(1+acceptance|participant). Acceptance is the manipulated variable. The variabel has two levels: accepted (short ending/irregular form) and not accepted (long ending/regular form). Additionally, the response behaviour (yes/no) of the participants will be analysed with the following logistic mixed linear model (acceptance ~ form + (1+form|item)+(1+form|participant). Form is the manipulated variable. The variable has two levels (long ending/regular form vs. short ending/irregular form). \n\nPsychoPy3, version 3.1.5, (Peirce 2019) is used to implement the study.\n\nTest items\n\nSee the attached file (testverbs.csv) for an overview over the test verbs. The selection of the test verbs is based on the relative frequency of the test verbs' strong participles in the year 2018. The relative frequencies of the participles are taken from the word frequencies provided by the digital dictionary of the German language (Digitales W\u00f6rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache, Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften). Test verbs with a participle frequency of 13 and more hits per million token are considered frequent. Test verbs with a participle frequency of up to 2 hits per million token are considered infrequent. \n\nWithin the infrequent test verbs, verbs with a ratio of more than 100 strong participle forms to one weak form are considered not to vary in corpora, test verbs with a ratio of less than 100 strong participle forms to one weak form are considered to vary in corpora. The counts for the strong and weak participle forms are based on the corpus w-public of the archive W for written language (W-\u00f6ffentlich - alle \u00f6ffentlichen Korpora des Archivs W) which is part of the German Reference Corpus (Deutsches Referenzkorpus, Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Deutsche Sprache). Only the hits for the weak forms of the frequent test verbs have been searched for false positives. Note that only hits with lower case for \"gefahren\" ('driven')  were included into the search in order to avoid false positives as \"gefahren\" in upper case is homographic to the dative plural of \"Gefahr\" \u2018danger\u2019.   \n\nThe attached file (stimulus file.csv) gives an overview over all test items as well as fillers.

The original preregistration has been made before collection of data, of course this is not the case for this registration.\n\nFrequency is a well-studied factor influencing variation (Bybee 1985, 2006, 2013, Nowak 2015). Type frequency influences variation in general: Inflection classes with low type frequency lose their members to type frequent classes. Type frequency also interacts with regularity. Mostly, classes with high type frequency show a regular conjugation pattern whereas classes with low type frequency show an irregular conjugation pattern (Goldberg 2019: 66-68).\n\nWithin the classes with low type frequency, token frequency influences whether a member will stay in the class or change to the type frequent class: token frequent members stay in the type infrequent class, while token infrequent members change to the type frequent class (Bybee and Thompson 1997). This principle has been studied in several corpus studies (e.g., Nowak 2015, Sch\u00e4fer 2016). However, psycholinguistic studies on frequency and variation do not exist. \n\nIn the past, psycholinguistic studies focussed on the difference between the processing of regular and irregular morphology and on the question whether token frequency only influences the processing of irregular conjugation, but not of regular conjugation (dual mechanism model by Pinker and Prince 1991; see Bornkessel-Schlesewsky 2009: 47-68 for an overview over the studies). Token frequency influences reaction times with regard to irregular verbs in general: Clahsen et al. (2001) report that preterite forms of irregular German verbs with a low frequency of preterite forms elicit slower reaction times in a lexical decision task than preterite forms of verbs with a high frequency of preterite forms. \nHowever, it has not been studied so far whether variation caused by low frequency might affect reaction times. It would be interesting to test whether the results of Clahsen et al. (2001) also hold for regular forms of irregular verbs with differing token frequencies. Additionally, it has not been examined whether variation can be detected in reaction times before it is visible in corpora. Here, irregular verbs are of interest that do not vary in corpora yet but have similar token frequencies as verbs that already show variation. Again, not only the reaction times elicited by irregular forms but also by regular forms of the verbs are of interest.\n\nThis study aims to answer the research questions with the help of a lexical decision task. For the task, verbs are used that belong to the type infrequent irregular (strong) conjugation class in German. The verbs have differing participle frequencies and show different degrees of variation in corpora. Participants are asked to judge the participle forms of the test verbs which are presented with strong (irregular) as well as weak (regular) inflection.", "q4": "frequent vs. infrequent\n\nThe reaction times depend on the frequency of the test verbs: Reaction times are lower for frequent strong verbs (over 13 hits per million tokens), whereas reaction times are higher for infrequent strong verbs (up to 2 hits per million tokens). This can be observed for weak as well as strong forms and for the acceptance as well as the rejection of forms. The relative frequency of the test verbs is determined with the help of the word frequencies provided by the digital dictionary of the German language (Digitales W\u00f6rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache, Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften).\n\nWith the help of the design, reaction times can be interpreted as an indicator for variation. From a frequency-based view, reaction times should be shorter for frequent verbs than for infrequent verbs (Clahsen et al. 2001). The design allows to control for the general influence of frequency: Weak forms of token frequent verbs (e.g., \"gezieht\" instead of \"gezogen\" 'pulled') occur extremly seldom in language use and are thus not token frequent. A fast rejection of these forms can therefore not be traced back to the frequency of the forms. The same logic holds for weak forms of infrequent verbs (\"gefechtet\" instead of \"gefochten\" 'fenced') that are not attested in corpora yet (ratio of more than 100 strong forms to one weak form).  \nDifferences in reaction times can thus be interpreted as an indicator for variants:  entrenched forms are accepted fast and forms that are unlikely to be produced are rejected fast whereas the judgement of variants takes longer because two forms with equal function exist. Hence, the form \"gezieht\" should be rejected fast, but not \"geflechtet\": \"geflechtet\" is not attested in corpora yet, but the strong participle of \"flechten\" is similar frequent as the participles of other verbs that already show variation (e.g., \"salzen\" 'to salt'). Crucially, the hypothesised difference in reaction times cannot be traced back to differences in token frequency between the verb forms, as the token frequency of both forms (\"geflechtet\" and \"gezieht\") is equally low because both forms are nearly inexistent. \n\nattested vs. not attested\n\nThe infrequent verbs are divided into the categories variation attested in corpora and variation not attested in corpora. Based on a usage-based framework, it is hypothesised that no difference can be measured in the reaction times between forms that are attested in corpora and forms that are not attested in corpora. This holds for strong and weak forms as well as the acceptance and the rejection of forms. As the verbs are infrequent, the strong forms of the verbs are infrequent as well and thus cannot dominate the weak forms in frequency. Hence, the statistical pre-emption (Goldberg 2019: 75-84) of strong forms is impaired. Strong and weak forms can be considered variants for infrequent strong verbs. Reaction times are therefore higher as two forms with equal function exists. \n\nNote that it is also possible to expect differences in reaction time within a usage-based framework. As the weak forms are more seldom for verbs without attested variation and strong forms are in turn more frequent, a slight difference in reaction times might be observable between verbs with attested and verbs without attested variation. If weak forms occur only seldom, these forms should be rejected fast and the correspondent strong form should be accepted fast, as this is the only entrenched form. In contrast, longer reaction times are expected if weak forms occur more often as now there are two competing forms. However, this difference should be more subtle than the difference between frequent and infrequent test verbs because the strong forms of infrequent verbs cannot dominate the weak forms in frequency as much as strong forms of frequent verbs can.  \nThe design allows testing both hypotheses. The test verbs are selected by calculating the ratio of strong and weak participle forms using the corpus w-public of the archive W for written language (W-\u00f6ffentlich - alle \u00f6ffentlichen Korpora des Archivs W) which is part of the German Reference Corpus (Deutsches Referenzkorpus, Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Deutsche Sprache). The search was carried out with Cosmas 2 (Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Deutsche Sprache). A form is defined to be attested in corpora if the ratio of strong to weak forms is smaller than 100/1. If no differences in reaction times can be measured between verbs with and without attested variation, this can be taken as an indicator that variation is already measurable before it is attested in corpora. \n\n2. acceptability and consistency of answers\n\nfrequent vs. infrequent\n\nThe acceptability of weak and strong forms depends on the token frequency of strong verbs. Strong forms are accepted for frequent strong verbs, whereas weak forms are not accepted. For infrequent strong verbs, both forms are accepted. \nFor frequent verbs, a clearly distributed response behaviour is expected: predominantly rejection for weak forms and predominantly acceptance for strong forms. This is not expected for infrequent verbs: while acceptance is expected for strong forms, a mixed response behaviour is expected for weak forms. Additionally, the response behaviour of individual participants is expected to be consistent for frequent verbs (rejection of the weak form of a verb, acceptance of the strong form) but not for infrequent verbs (rejection/acceptance of both forms). \n\nvariation attested in corpora vs. not attested in corpora\n\nFor infrequent test verbs, it is hypothesized that the acceptability of weak forms is influenced by the occurrence of weak forms in corpora. Although a corpus cannot picture language use as a whole, it can nonetheless give a hint on how likely it is that a certain form has been produced by speakers and hence perceived by other speakers. If weak forms are already attested in corpora, it is more likely that participants already encountered these forms and that the forms are more entrenchend. The opposite is to be expected for forms that are not attested in corpora. Weak forms are therefore more likely to be accepted if they already have been witnessed in corpora.  \n\nNote that this hypothesis is not the only possible hypothesis from a usage-based perspective. Comparable acceptance rates can also be expected: As the frequency of the strong participles is low for verbs with attested as well as without attested variation, the verbs could be treated in the same way. Hence, it is also possible that the infrequent verbs with and without attested variation show comparable acceptance and rejection rates of the weak and strong participle forms. The study design allows testing both hypotheses.", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Prototype-driven alternations: The case of German weak nouns. In: Corpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory, 1\u201335.", "q8.question": "A within subject design is used with two factors (frequency and inflection), that have three (frequent, infrequent without variation, infrequent with variation) and two levels (weak, strong), respectively. Per level of frequency, eight test words are used.  The participants are shown test words with weak as well as strong inflection and are asked to decide whether they know the word (\"Kennen Sie dieses Wort bzw. diese Wortabfolge?\" 'Do you know this word/word sequence?'). The answer (yes/no) as well as the reaction times are used for data analysis. \nSo called weak masculine nouns with weak and strong inflection are used as fillers. They serve as test nouns for a study on the influence of schematicity on variation. Additionally,  strong genitive forms ending with -es are used as fillers. The genitive form -es is used for nouns that normally have -s as genitive ending as they do not allow -es phonotactically (*des Abendes 'the evening.GEN') (Szczepaniak 2010). \nTo test the design, reaction times elicited by long (-es) and short (-s) genitive endings of two nouns not allowing long genitive endings are contrasted (Ultimatum, Internet) as well as reaction times elicited by regular and irregular forms of the irregular verbs \"gehen\" 'to go' and \"bringen\" 'to bring'. These items will only be relevant if the statistical analysis of the test items does not hint to differences in reaction times.  The items allow to test whether the design can elicit differences in reaction times in general. The following mixed linear model will be used  if the design needs to be tested: reaction time ~ acceptance + (1+acceptance|item)+(1+acceptance|participant). Acceptance is the manipulated variable. The variabel has two levels: accepted (short ending/irregular form) and not accepted (long ending/regular form). Additionally, the response behaviour (yes/no) of the participants will be analysed with the following logistic mixed linear model (acceptance ~ form + (1+form|item)+(1+form|participant). Form is the manipulated variable. The variable has two levels (long ending/regular form vs. short ending/irregular form). \n\nPsychoPy3, version 3.1.5, (Peirce 2019) is used to implement the study.\n\nTest items\n\nSee the attached file (testverbs.csv) for an overview over the test verbs. The selection of the test verbs is based on the relative frequency of the test verbs' strong participles in the year 2018. The relative frequencies of the participles are taken from the word frequencies provided by the digital dictionary of the German language (Digitales W\u00f6rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache, Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften). Test verbs with a participle frequency of 13 and more hits per million token are considered frequent. Test verbs with a participle frequency of up to 2 hits per million token are considered infrequent. \n\nWithin the infrequent test verbs, verbs with a ratio of more than 100 strong participle forms to one weak form are considered not to vary in corpora, test verbs with a ratio of less than 100 strong participle forms to one weak form are considered to vary in corpora. The counts for the strong and weak participle forms are based on the corpus w-public of the archive W for written language (W-\u00f6ffentlich - alle \u00f6ffentlichen Korpora des Archivs W) which is part of the German Reference Corpus (Deutsches Referenzkorpus, Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Deutsche Sprache). Only the hits for the weak forms of the frequent test verbs have been searched for false positives. Note that only hits with lower case for \"gefahren\" ('driven')  were included into the search in order to avoid false positives as \"gefahren\" in upper case is homographic to the dative plural of \"Gefahr\" \u2018danger\u2019.   \n\nThe attached file (stimulus file.csv) gives an overview over all test items as well as fillers. The file contains the following columns:\n\nStimulus_Art: unique coding for each stimulus \t\nStimulus: the stimulus as presented to the participant\t\nSchema: coding for the masculine test nouns; levels: Schema, Peripherie, nichtschwach (not relevant for this study)\nFrequenz: coding for the test verbs; levels: frequent, infrequ_m, infrequ_o\nAkzeptanz: coding for the items testing the design; levels: nichtakzeptiert, akzeptiert\t\nEvaluation: \"ev\" highlights the items evaluating the concentration of the participants (if over 20 % of the items have been answered wrong, participant will be excluded)\t\nFlexion: coding for the test verbs and nouns; levels: stark/schwach\t\nItem: naming the test items in their base form (test verbs as well as masculine test nouns that are not relevant for this study)\nFormakzeptiert: (expected) acceptence/inacceptance of the forms, j (yes), n (no), b (both)\ncorrectKey: correct response key (based on Formakzeptiert); levels: f (no), j (yes, both)\nBlock: block in which the item is presented\t\nPositionimBlock: position within the block\n\nFurther explanation for the columns \"Formakzeptiert\" and \"correctKey\": Concerning the test verbs, the coding followed the hypotheses: for frequent verbs, weak forms are coded as rejected and strong forms as accepted.
