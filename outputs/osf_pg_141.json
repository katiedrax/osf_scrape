Scholars and policy makers alike have concluded that the U.S. is unlikely to join international organizations, and courts in particular, unless it can exercise significant control over them. How- ever recent public opinion polls report that awareness of the ICC among U.S. adults is steadily increasing and that this increasing awareness is coupled with increasing support of the Court, including membership. In this paper, I seek to clarify if there is a discrepancy between the public\u2019s desires and the policy positions of its leaders. Specifically, I seek to identify if the American public is truly exceptionalist\u2014that is, motivated by U.S. leadership in international human rights\u2014or, given competing issue frames, if the public is actually exemptionalist, like its leaders\u2014that is, motivated by self-interest and exclusion from the international human rights regime. I propose an experimental approach, utilizing competing exceptionalist and exemption- alist frames, to clarify this puzzle. Prior scholarship submits that framing issues in ways that resonate with core American values catalyzes costly moral action in foreign policy.

Hypothesis 3 American Exceptionalism Participants who receive an American exceptionalism cue, concerning the United States\u2019 historical support of international courts and tribunals, as well as discussion of the importance of future leadership, will be more likely to support the U.S. joining the ICC than those who receive the control treatment. Hypothesis 4 The Neutralizing Effect of Competitive Frames Participants who receive competing exemptionalist and exceptionalist cues will be neither more likely nor less likely to support the ICC than those who receive the control treatment.

Hypothesis 6 Exceptionalism > Excemptionalism Participants who receive competing exemptionalist and exceptionalist cues will be more likely to support the ICC than participants who receive a single frame or who receive the control treatment."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "To test these hypotheses, I designed a survey experiment, conducted using Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk (MTurk). I randomly assign 1,000 U.S. adult participants to five experimental conditions. To ensure that (at least) half of the participants have a shared definition and basic understanding of the ICC, I provide background information to half of the respondents before presenting the main treatment frames. Vignette 1 provides the American exemptionalism cue, by implicating an American soldier in abuses subject to investigation and prosecution by the ICC and providing a rationale for non-membership in the ICC. If participants believe the U.S. should become a member of the ICC to a lesser degree than the control group, this will be consistent with Hypothesis 2. Vignette 2 provides the American exceptionalism cue by noting the U.S.\u2019s historical role in supporting international criminal tribunals, and suggesting the U.S.\u2019s importance to the ICC and human rights and liberal values broadly conceived.5 If participants believe that the U.S. should become a member of the ICC to a greater degree than the control group, this will be consistent with Hypothesis 3. Vignette 3 provides the competing frames of American exemptionalism and American excep- tionalism (randomized ordering of Vignettes 1 and 2). If participants believe that the U.S. should become a member of the ICC to neither a greater nor lesser degree than the control group, this will be consistent with Hypothesis 4. If participants believe that the U.S. should become a member of the ICC to a greater degree than the control group but to a lesser degree than participants exposed to a single frame, this will be consistent with Hypothesis 5. Finally, if participants believe that the U.S. should become a member of the ICC to a greater degree than the control group and participants exposed to a single frame, this will be consistent with Hypothesis 6. To gauge the basis upon which each subject justifies his/her support of/opposition to U.S. ICC membership, I ask participants which factor helped them respond to the main DV (i.e., \u201cDo you believe the United States should become a member of the Court?\u201d) for cross-examination. I do this via a multiple-choice question and an open-ended item. In addition, I introduce two attitudinal indicators. The first attitudinal indicator captures participants\u2019 belief that the U.S. should (or should not) provide financial support to the ICC, regardless of membership. The second attitudinal indicator captures participants\u2019 reported likelihood of calling their U.S. Senator about whether or not the U.S. should join the ICC. Since these are only stated preferences, I further introduce two behavioral indicators to gauge participants\u2019 degree of commitment to their response. The first behavioral indicator requires participants to identify their willingness to give a portion of their MTurk earnings from this study to the ICC\u2019s Trust Fund for Victims (TFV) which provides physical, psychological, and financial support to victims of genocide, crimes of humanity and war crimes and their families. The inclusion of this indicator reveals respondents\u2019 preferences and the degree to which they are willing to engage in moral costly action. The second behavioral indicator asks respondents to send a letter to their U.S. Senator, choosing from one of two form letters, or no letter. The inclusion of this indicator serves multiple purposes. Substantively, it helps us ascertain whether individual support for or opposition to U.S. ICC membership actually has implications for policymakers. Methodologically, this and the previous behavioral indicator help address one of the most salient criticisms against survey experiments, i.e., that responses are merely \u201ccheap talk\u201d. This is especially important when one is working with a subject pool (i.e., MTurk workers) that may have \u201csatisficing\u201d tendencies. There may be non-exemptionalist reasons for which participants may oppose U.S. membership in the ICC. While people may generally support the missions of international organizations, like the United Nations, they may question or doubt the effective implemen- tation of the organizations\u2019 missions. I thus ask two supplementary questions\u2014randomly assigned to appear pre- and post-frames\u2014and use these to control for individuals with a baseline opposition to international organizations, irrespective of their purpose. I choose the United Nations, as it is a well-known international organization whose institutional mission is related to the ICC\u2019s."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "United States of America"},

Marketing medium(s)/tool(s) under review (detail the forms of marketing reviewed, even if not explicitly defined as marketing)\n14. Search terms (search terms, inclusion and exclusion criteria that describe how evidence was gathered)\n15. Tools for understanding (e.g. theory, could be a diagram)\n16. Reviewer comments\n\nThe framework is based on the research sub-questions and similar to those employed elsewhere. The framework contains categories identified a priori to assess the full review articles that are selected in stage 3. This includes standard bibliographical information (e.g. title, authors, journal, year of publication), in addition to information relating to the research aims (e.g. use of marketing terminology).  We will also chart stated funding information about the articles, in order to track the potential for funding sources to introduce bias to the literature base.\n\nAs the majority of data required will be extracts of text, the framework and charted data will be stored on NVivo (https://www.qsrinternational.com/nvivo/home), as this software is appropriate for handling qualitative data. The framework will be piloted by HF and JA, who will chart a sample of literature [5 publications that passed full-text screening] in order to ensure there are adequate categories to fully explore the research questions within the sampled literature. Proposed amendments to the framework that emerge in this data charting will be discussed until consensus is reached between HF and JA. This should ensure inter-rater reliability in the review, by ensuring data extraction is consistent with the research objective and aims. HF will then be responsible for charting the data from each included review using the final data extraction framework. JA will review HF\u2019s data charting and this will be discussed; if unresolvable discrepancies arise, another member of the study team will provide arbitration. As is common in scoping reviews, we will not make a quality assessment of the studies included as this is not pertinent to the research aims. \n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "Not applicable to this study.", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Not applicable to this study,", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=vsjcw", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "vsjcw", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "vsjcw", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/quxgb/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "quxgb", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/b67hk/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "b67hk", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/vsjcw/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vsjcw/"}}, {"id": "6au7v", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Meta-analysis", "description": "Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can progress to significant/advanced liver fibrosis, compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, or even hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), If left untreated.

Three separate types of models will be tested. The indirect effects of gratitude on increases in well-being mediated by increases in prosocial tendencies over time will be tested with the 1) total sample 2) multi-group model with two groups for low and high positive affect where all parameter estimates are free to vary across groups and 3) the same multi-group model where the mediation paths are fixed to be equal across groups. There are two prosocial tendency mediators: 1) social integration and 2) prosocial behaviors and there are eight well-being outcomes: 1) life satisfaction, 2) meaning in life, 3) hope, 4) depression, 5) negative affect, 6) positive affect, 7) happiness, 8) general well-being. This results in 3 types of models * 2 mediators * 8 outcomes = 48 different SEMs. Attached is a powerpoint file with the four different versions of the longitudinal mediation model that arise from not having all constructs measured at each timepoint.\n\nBefore any models are tested, the 2 mediators * 8 outcomes = 16 different measurement models will be created. The parcels from each construct will be used to create latent factors. Each construct * timepoint combination will have a single latent factor. For constructs measured at multiple timepoints, the parcel errors at one timepoint will be covaried with those at all other timepoints. All latent factors will be covaried with all other latent factors. At this point, the model fit of the measurement models will be evaluated. A balance will be sought between a desire for parsimonious models with a small amount of population misfit, and a desire for only small misspecifications that do not heavily bias the structural portion of the model. To quantify global model fit, the following (arbitrary) cutoffs will be used as guidelines: CFI &lt; .90; TLI &lt; .90; RMSEA &gt; .10; SRMR &gt; .10. To quantify local model fit, residual correlations will be investigated, and re-specification of the measurement models will be considered if any residual correlations are &gt; |.20|.\n\nNext, each construct measured at multiple timepoints will have its latent factors tested for measurement invariance. Only weak measurement invariance of the factor loadings will be investigated because only the covariance structure - not the mean structure - is relevant for the manuscript hypotheses. Any parcel whose standardized factor loadings differ by more than |.20| across timepoints will have its factor loadings free to vary, resulting in partial measurement invariance. Again, model fit of the measurement models will be evaluated with the same guidelines.\n\nAfter the 16 measurement models are finalized, the structural model testing longitudinal mediation will be added to each. At this point, the three types of models mentioned above will be tested. The latent factor covariances representing a mediation path will be converted to latent factor regressions and any latent factor covariances with endogenous latent factors will be converted to covariances with the latent factor\u2019s disturbance. Therefore, the structural models will be saturated as the goal is to test the significance and magnitude of the mediation paths rather than test whether certain paths are equal to 0. Similarly, we wish to capture change over time rather than test the adequacy of a first-order autoregressive structure. For the multi-group models, low and high positive affect will be determined by a median split of an unweighted average of the three T1 positive affect parcels.\n\nFor all models, the estimator will be full information maximum likelihood (FIML) to account for the missing data and standard errors will be computed via bootstrapping (including for the indirect effects). To increase the probability of meeting the missing at random (MAR) assumption behind FIML, 1-5 auxiliary variables will be added to each of the SEMs. These auxiliary variables will be those variables in the study dataset, but not already in the initial SEM, that are predictive of missingness at T3, T4, and T5 or are correlated with variables already in the initial SEM.

The number of auxiliary variables will depend on how many variables in the study dataset are incrementally associated with missingness and initial model variables.\n", "q19.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e221693675e0e00bb6b4cb6", "file_name": "Longitudinal SEM diagrams for gratitude and well-being paper_011220.pptx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/6p4ef/files/osfstorage/5e221693675e0e00bb6b4cb6", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e221693675e0e00bb6b4cb6"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "074322b318e13ba4ee72488905e1406c5bed6fc22f2c38fa58c4ba4db6cb68ae"}}]}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=6p4ef", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "6p4ef", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "6p4ef", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/2nqfa/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "2nqfa", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4f5s6/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "4f5s6", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/6p4ef/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6p4ef/"}}, {"id": "9z5ec", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "The FAST Pump, a low-cost, easy to fabricate, SLA-3D-printed peristaltic pump for multi-channel systems in any lab", "description": "This project supports the paper: Alexander J\u00f6nsson, Arianna Toppi and Martin Dufva.
