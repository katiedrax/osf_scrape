Briefly, on each trial two icons of smartphone applications are presented for 100 ms, on the left and on the right of a continuously visible central fixation cross. The icons are either a social networks icon (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and WhatsApp) or a smartphone application (Calculator, Google Maps, Weather, Internet Explorer and Camera). Immediately after the icons disappear, a target, consisting of a triangle pointing upward or downward, is presented in the location of one of the icons. On valid trials, the target appears in the same location of the social network icon, on invalid trials, the target appears at the location previously occupied by the control icon. A total of 200 trials (100 valid and 100 invalid) are presented. Participants are instructed to indicate the direction of the target as fast as possible using the corresponding keyboard arrow. At the end of the task, participants are asked to estimate for each icon, on a 10-points Likert scale, the familiarity, the frequency of usage, and their preference.  \n\nQuestionnaires:\n-\tState-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-YB; Spielberger, 1983): self-assessment questionnaire about trait of anxiety composed by 20 items.

This questionnaire is composed of 10 items on a five-point Likert-type scale: 1 = \u2018\u2018Not at all true of me\u2019\u2019, 2 = \u2018\u2018Slightly true of me\u2019\u2019, 3 = \u2018\u2018Moderately true of me\u2019\u2019, 4 = \u2018\u2018Very true of me\u2019\u2019, and 5 = \u2018\u2018Extremely true of me\u2019\u2019. Individual scores can be computed by averaging responses to all ten items and forms a reliable composite measure (\u03b1 = .87 to .90). \n-\tThe Smartphone Usage Questionnaire (Marty-Dugas, Ralph, Oakman, &amp; Smilek, 2018)): it is composed by 20 items on a 7-points scale ranging from 1 (Never) to 7 (All the time), the higher score is 140. The questionnaire is composed by two subscales: the Smartphone Use Questionnaire General (SUQ-G), and the Smartphone Use Questionnaire Absent-Minded (SUQ-A). The former allows measuring the use of the smartphone in terms of frequency (e.g., send and receive text messages, use social media). The latter assess the frequency with which individuals are engaged with their phones absent-mindedly. \n-\tSocial Networking Activity Intensity Scale (Li, Lau, Mo, Su, Wu, Tang, &amp; Qin, 2016): this questionnaire gathers the common functions and activities of online social networking use. It is composed of 14 items on a 5-points Likert-scale from 0 = \u201cnever\u201d to 4= \u201calways\u201d, the higher score is 56.\n-\tEmotional connection to social networking (Ellison, Steinfield, &amp; Lampe, 2007): it is a measure of Facebook usage, but we generalize to all the social networks.

It is composed of 6 assertions rated from 1= \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d to 5= \u201cstrongly agree\u201d, so the higher score is 30.\n\nReferences\n\nEllison, N.

Different stimuli have been shown to automatically capture attentional resources. Classically these stimuli encompass emotional laden stimuli (Fabio, 2019; Sutton and Lutz, 2018; Vuilleumier, 2005). In particular, phylogenetic relevant stimuli (e.g., threating stimuli), due to their survival value, have been reported to capture attention (\u00d6hman and al., 2001). Nevertheless, Brosch and al. (2005) reported that also ontogenetic threating stimuli (e.g. weapons) can capture attention.

Some studies reported that social networks usage can activate the brain reward system (Meshi et al., 2015).

Moreover, this effect could be modulated by the usage behavior and the affective commitment toward social networks.\nThe main hypothesis of the study is that social media icons would automatically capture attention compared to a control condition. A corollary hypothesis is that attentional facilitation would correlate with social media usage and some affective measures (anxiety, fear of missing out).\n\nReferences\n\nBrosch, T., &amp; Sharma, D.

Briefly, on each trial two icons of smartphone applications are presented for 100 ms, on the left and on the right of a continuously visible central fixation cross. The icons are either a social networks icon (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and WhatsApp) or a smartphone application (Calculator, Google Maps, Weather, Internet Explorer and Camera). Immediately after the icons disappear, a target, consisting of a triangle pointing upward or downward, is presented in the location of one of the icons. On valid trials, the target appears in the same location of the social network icon, on invalid trials, the target appears at the location previously occupied by the control icon. A total of 200 trials (100 valid and 100 invalid) are presented. Participants are instructed to indicate the direction of the target as fast as possible using the corresponding keyboard arrow.
