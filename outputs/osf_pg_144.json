Generally, the fear conditioning process comprises different experimental phases (Lonsdorf &amp; Merz, 2017). Throughout the acquisition of conditioned fear (fear learning during fear acquisition training) an innately aversive stimulus, the unconditioned stimulus (US), is paired with an initially neutral stimulus, the conditioned stimulus (CS+), producing a conditioned response (CR) to the CS+ while a second control stimulus (CS-) is never paired with the US. Hence, the CS+ gains predictive power of the appearance of a US. Within the extinction phase (extinction learning during extinction training) the CS is no longer coupled with a US and an inhibitory extinction memory is formed. When later presented with a CS (retention test) one can either observe a retention of the extinction memory indicating dominance of the extinction memory or the return of fear responding (ROF) indicating dominance of the fear over the extinction memory (Myers &amp; Davis, 2007). \n\nThroughout the past decades research mainly focused on the functional connections and alterations in cortical and subcortical structures in fear acquisition, extinction, reinstatement and return of fear (Hartley et al., 2011; LaBar et al., 1998; Lonsdorf et al., 2017; Lonsdorf &amp; Merz, 2017; Phelps et al., 2004). Thus,  the functional activation of a neural fear circuit including structures such as the amygdala for fear learning (Cacciaglia et al., 2015; LaBar et al., 1998; Pohlack et al., 2012), the hippocampus for contextual conditioning and fear memory (Bast et al., 2001; Phillips &amp; LeDoux, 1992; Sanders et al., 2003), or the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in fear inhibition (Delgado et al., 2008; Hartley et al., 2011; Phelps et al., 2004) was at the core of fear research. However, studies regarding the structural basis of fear acquisition and extinction are still scarce and present inconsistent or even contradictory results. In the following, current evidence pertaining to the association between the structural nature of the dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC), the amygdala and the medial Orbitofrontal Cortex (mOFC) - as part of the vmPFC- and fear conditioning and extinction is briefly summarized. \n\nEspecially the structural association of the dACC with conditioned fear has been discussed controversially in the literature. While some studies suggest a positive correlation of cortical thickness of the dACC with skin conductance response (SCR) to the CS+ \u2013 as a proxy of fear learning - during the acquisition of fear (Milad et al., 2007), others have not found this correlation (Hartley et al., 2011). However, Milad et al. (2007) found no correlation between the cortical thickness of the dACC and the SCR to the CS- or differential SCR. With this present study, we aim to investigate whether the cortical thickness of the dACC is associated with differential fear learning proxies (differential SCR and subjective fear ratings) of the acquisition of conditioned fear.\n\nSimilarly to the findings on the association of cortical thickness of dACC and fear learning, the association of amygdala volume with proxies of fear learning remains controversial. Whereas some studies have shown there to be no significant correlation between amygdala volume and fear learning proxy (SCR to CS+) (Hartley et al., 2011), other studies present findings specifying the association of the left (Cacciaglia et al., 2015) and right amygdala volume (Winkelmann et al., 2016) with differential SCR only in early acquisition. As it is evident, different studies regard different fear learning proxies such as differential SCRs or SCR to the CS+ as suitable and, thus, provide diverging results which have to be treated with caution.  Based on these diverging findings on the association of amygdala volume and fear learning (as measured by differential SCR and differential subjective fear ratings), the importance of a distinction between early and late acquisition shall be investigated in the present study. \n\nThe functional role of the vmPFC in fear extinction has long been established (Giustino &amp; Maren, 2015; Lissek et al., 2005; Morgan &amp; Ledoux, 1995; Phelps et al., 2004; Quirk et al., 2000) but results concerning the association of its structural qualities with the extinction of fear are still limited and controversial. Previous studies have mainly focused on extinction retention rather than extinction itself (Hartley et al., 2011; Milad et al., 2005) and reported controversial results. Whereas some studies report that extinction retention in healthy individuals (as measured by the extinction retention index which was recently criticised theoretically and empirically by Lonsdorf et al. (2019)) is positively associated with cortical thickness of the vmPFC (Milad et al., 2005), other studies were not able to replicate this finding using a slightly different extinction retention index  (Hartley et al., 2011). Although these studies provide evidence for the structural association of the vmPFC with extinction retention, this current study aims to pinpoint the structural association of the vmPFC with extinction itself. Based on previous studies (Milad et al., 2005), the mOFC as part of the vmPFC constitutes a central structure in the extinction of fear especially in extinction recall. The mOFC will be our ROI in the present study, in which we aim to investigate the structural association of the mOFC with fear learning proxies (differential SCR and subjective fear ratings) during the extinction of fear. \n\nPossible explanations for the disparate results concerning the dACC as well as the amygdala might stem from different approaches when employing a fear conditioning paradigm. First, different reinforcement rates have been employed in different studies ranging from partial reinforcement rates (25 % - 80 %) (Abend et al., 2019; Cacciaglia et al., 2015; Hartley et al., 2011; Pohlack et al., 2012; Winkelmann et al., 2016) to full reinforcement rates (100 %) (Milad et al., 2005; Milad et al., 2007; Rauch et al., 2005). The reinforcement rate quantifies the extent to which a CS is coupled with a US throughout the fear acquisition phase. The rate of reinforcement might produce ambiguous (weak) or unambiguous (strong) experimental conditions (Lonsdorf &amp; Merz, 2017), resulting in stronger (Dunsmoor et al., 2007; Milad et al., 2005; Milad et al., 2007) or weaker SCR responses (Cacciaglia et al., 2015; Hartley et al., 2011) to the CS+, which might account for different findings in functional studies. Still, studies investigating whether different structural qualities of the dACC contribute to inter-individual differences in creating ambiguous and unambiguous experimental situations are, to our knowledge, non-existent. Second, different reinforcement rates or explicit verbal instructions about reward contingencies influence the contingency awareness of a CS being associated with a US (Lonsdorf et al., 2017; Lonsdorf &amp; Merz, 2017; Mertens et al., 2016). This might again change the appraisal of the stimulus as threatening and , thus, affect fear learning within the acquisition phase (Lonsdorf &amp; Merz, 2017; Maier et al., 2012). Third, studies with large sample sizes are scarce (Abend et al., 2019, N = 351) with the majority employing extremely small sample sizes  (N = 12 (Hartley et al., 2011), N = 17 (Maier et al., 2012), N = 14 (Milad et al., 2007)). Especially the findings of these studies require further validation due to limited generalizability of the results.\n\nThe current study aims to shed light on the structural underpinnings of fear learning and extinction of fear. More precisely, we aim to investigate the association between the cortical thickness of the dACC and fear learning. Further, the association of amygdala volume and fear learning shall be investigated. Finally, the association between mOFC thickness and extinction of conditioned fear will be considered. For this purpose, brain morphology and fear conditioning data from a larger sample (N = 108) of healthy young adults with full reinforcement rate (100 %) and no explicit contingency instructions for CS and US will be analysed. \n\n\nReferences:\n\nAbend, R., Gold, A.

Based on the findings by Cacciaglia et al. (2015), we expect that amygdala volume predicts differential SCRs in the first but not the second half of acquisition.\n3.\tThirdly, we propose a positive association between amygdala volume and the fear response (as measured by the mean differential subjective fear ratings and mean differential SCR) in the extinction phase. \n4.\tFourthly, we propose a positive association between the cortical thickness of the mOFC and extinction learning (as measured by differential subjective fear ratings and differential SCR) in the extinction phase. \n\nSince we hypothesise a positive association of differential SCRs/differential subjective fear ratings with the proposed structures, we will conduct a follow-up analysis for each hypothesis to test whether the association of the according structure results from an association with the CS+ or CS-.\n\nExploratory Hypotheses:\n\nPrevious research suggests that the dACC is involved in the negative appraisal of threat (Maier et al., 2012) and, therefore, might only be associated with fear learning  in the early acquisition process. Hence, we propose that the hypothesised association between cortical thickness of the dACC and fear learning (as measured by the differential SCR and subjective fear ratings) is driven by the first half of the acquisition but not the second.\n\nFurther, prior research brings to mind that inter-individual differences in the conditioning of fear might stem from differences in contingency awareness in the acquisition phase potentially resulting from either explicit instructions about the contingencies of the US and CS or a full reinforcement rate (100 %, in the acquisition phase every CS is coupled with a US) (Hartley et al., 2011; Lonsdorf &amp; Merz, 2017). We hypothesise that the dACC thickness predicts fear learning proxies (differential SCR and differential subjective fear ratings) but is moderated by different levels of contingency awareness.\n\nOne study described a distinction between early and late extinction phase when investigating the structural association with the mOFC (Milad et al., 2005) but did not report any results from this approach. Thus, we would like to explore whether there is a structural association between the mOFC and extinction learning in the early and late extinction.\n"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

The SCRs were then scored semi-manually using the custom made program EDA view (kindly provided by Prof. M. Gamer) that is used to quantify the SCR amplitude based on the trough-to-peak method with the foot point occurring at 0.9 \u2013 3.5s after CS onset. The raw amplitudes were then normalized and range corrected by dividing each log-transformed SCR by the maximum amplitude (to any stimulus including the US) per participant per day. Processing of SCR data for this sample has been previously described and was left unchanged (Lonsdorf et al., 2019).\n\nSubjective fear ratings were measured after habituation, after acquisition, before extinction, after extinction and after reinstatement. They consisted of two questions asking about \u201chow much stress, fear and tension\u201d the participant experienced when they saw the CS+ and CS- the previous time. The questions were answered inside the MR scanner by rating the answers on a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from zero (answer: \u201cnone\u201d) to 100 (answer: \u201cmaximum\u201d). This was later transformed to a scale ranging from 0 to 25 (participants were instructed to rate from 0 to 100 on the VAS inside the MR scanner. The ratings were in steps of 5. Hence, the ratings are further analysed on a scale ranging from 0 to 25.).\n\nContingency awareness (conscious awareness of the coupling between US with CS+/CS-) was measured by conducting a structured interview with every participant after completion of Day 1. The answers were later coded into whether the participant was \u201cunaware\u201d (0), \u201caware\u201d (1) or \u201cuncertain\u201d (2) of the coupling between CS and US in the acquisition phase.

The decision to exclude the SCRs to the first CS+ and CS- trials in the acquisition phase are based on the fact that the first CS+ appears before the first US has been delivered. Hence, the SCR to the first CS+ is not a proxy of fear learning since the coupling of the CS with the US has not been established yet. If the first SCRs to the CS+ and CS- were to be included this would distort the estimation of fear learning based on the SCRs in the direction of a less effective learning of fear based on the SCR.  \nSex and intracranial volume will be included into the analyses as covariates. \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q16": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q17": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "For the main hypotheses we will perform distinct multivariate regressions in order to test whether the cortical thickness of the dACC, the mOFC and the volume of the amygdala predict differential SCRs and differential fear ratings at different stages in fear conditioning.

Generally, the fear conditioning process comprises different experimental phases (Lonsdorf &amp; Merz, 2017). Throughout the acquisition of conditioned fear (fear learning during fear acquisition training) an innately aversive stimulus, the unconditioned stimulus (US), is paired with an initially neutral stimulus, the conditioned stimulus (CS+), producing a conditioned response (CR) to the CS+ while a second control stimulus (CS-) is never paired with the US. Hence, the CS+ gains predictive power of the appearance of a US. Within the extinction phase (extinction learning during extinction training) the CS is no longer coupled with a US and an inhibitory extinction memory is formed. When later presented with a CS (retention test) one can either observe a retention of the extinction memory indicating dominance of the extinction memory or the return of fear responding (ROF) indicating dominance of the fear over the extinction memory (Myers &amp; Davis, 2007). \n\nThroughout the past decades research mainly focused on the functional connections and alterations in cortical and subcortical structures in fear acquisition, extinction, reinstatement and return of fear (Hartley et al., 2011; LaBar et al., 1998; Lonsdorf et al., 2017; Lonsdorf &amp; Merz, 2017; Phelps et al., 2004). Thus,  the functional activation of a neural fear circuit including structures such as the amygdala for fear learning (Cacciaglia et al., 2015; LaBar et al., 1998; Pohlack et al., 2012), the hippocampus for contextual conditioning and fear memory (Bast et al., 2001; Phillips &amp; LeDoux, 1992; Sanders et al., 2003), or the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in fear inhibition (Delgado et al., 2008; Hartley et al., 2011; Phelps et al., 2004) was at the core of fear research. However, studies regarding the structural basis of fear acquisition and extinction are still scarce and present inconsistent or even contradictory results. In the following, current evidence pertaining to the association between the structural nature of the dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC), the amygdala and the medial Orbitofrontal Cortex (mOFC) - as part of the vmPFC- and fear conditioning and extinction is briefly summarized. \n\nEspecially the structural association of the dACC with conditioned fear has been discussed controversially in the literature. While some studies suggest a positive correlation of cortical thickness of the dACC with skin conductance response (SCR) to the CS+ \u2013 as a proxy of fear learning - during the acquisition of fear (Milad et al., 2007), others have not found this correlation (Hartley et al., 2011). However, Milad et al. (2007) found no correlation between the cortical thickness of the dACC and the SCR to the CS- or differential SCR. With this present study, we aim to investigate whether the cortical thickness of the dACC is associated with differential fear learning proxies (differential SCR and subjective fear ratings) of the acquisition of conditioned fear.\n\nSimilarly to the findings on the association of cortical thickness of dACC and fear learning, the association of amygdala volume with proxies of fear learning remains controversial. Whereas some studies have shown there to be no significant correlation between amygdala volume and fear learning proxy (SCR to CS+) (Hartley et al., 2011), other studies present findings specifying the association of the left (Cacciaglia et al., 2015) and right amygdala volume (Winkelmann et al., 2016) with differential SCR only in early acquisition. As it is evident, different studies regard different fear learning proxies such as differential SCRs or SCR to the CS+ as suitable and, thus, provide diverging results which have to be treated with caution.  Based on these diverging findings on the association of amygdala volume and fear learning (as measured by differential SCR and differential subjective fear ratings), the importance of a distinction between early and late acquisition shall be investigated in the present study. \n\nThe functional role of the vmPFC in fear extinction has long been established (Giustino &amp; Maren, 2015; Lissek et al., 2005; Morgan &amp; Ledoux, 1995; Phelps et al., 2004; Quirk et al., 2000) but results concerning the association of its structural qualities with the extinction of fear are still limited and controversial. Previous studies have mainly focused on extinction retention rather than extinction itself (Hartley et al., 2011; Milad et al., 2005) and reported controversial results. Whereas some studies report that extinction retention in healthy individuals (as measured by the extinction retention index which was recently criticised theoretically and empirically by Lonsdorf et al. (2019)) is positively associated with cortical thickness of the vmPFC (Milad et al., 2005), other studies were not able to replicate this finding using a slightly different extinction retention index  (Hartley et al., 2011). Although these studies provide evidence for the structural association of the vmPFC with extinction retention, this current study aims to pinpoint the structural association of the vmPFC with extinction itself. Based on previous studies (Milad et al., 2005), the mOFC as part of the vmPFC constitutes a central structure in the extinction of fear especially in extinction recall. The mOFC will be our ROI in the present study, in which we aim to investigate the structural association of the mOFC with fear learning proxies (differential SCR and subjective fear ratings) during the extinction of fear. \n\nPossible explanations for the disparate results concerning the dACC as well as the amygdala might stem from different approaches when employing a fear conditioning paradigm. First, different reinforcement rates have been employed in different studies ranging from partial reinforcement rates (25 % - 80 %) (Abend et al., 2019; Cacciaglia et al., 2015; Hartley et al., 2011; Pohlack et al., 2012; Winkelmann et al., 2016) to full reinforcement rates (100 %) (Milad et al., 2005; Milad et al., 2007; Rauch et al., 2005). The reinforcement rate quantifies the extent to which a CS is coupled with a US throughout the fear acquisition phase. The rate of reinforcement might produce ambiguous (weak) or unambiguous (strong) experimental conditions (Lonsdorf &amp; Merz, 2017), resulting in stronger (Dunsmoor et al., 2007; Milad et al., 2005; Milad et al., 2007) or weaker SCR responses (Cacciaglia et al., 2015; Hartley et al., 2011) to the CS+, which might account for different findings in functional studies. Still, studies investigating whether different structural qualities of the dACC contribute to inter-individual differences in creating ambiguous and unambiguous experimental situations are, to our knowledge, non-existent. Second, different reinforcement rates or explicit verbal instructions about reward contingencies influence the contingency awareness of a CS being associated with a US (Lonsdorf et al., 2017; Lonsdorf &amp; Merz, 2017; Mertens et al., 2016). This might again change the appraisal of the stimulus as threatening and , thus, affect fear learning within the acquisition phase (Lonsdorf &amp; Merz, 2017; Maier et al., 2012). Third, studies with large sample sizes are scarce (Abend et al., 2019, N = 351) with the majority employing extremely small sample sizes  (N = 12 (Hartley et al., 2011), N = 17 (Maier et al., 2012), N = 14 (Milad et al., 2007)). Especially the findings of these studies require further validation due to limited generalizability of the results.\n\nThe current study aims to shed light on the structural underpinnings of fear learning and extinction of fear. More precisely, we aim to investigate the association between the cortical thickness of the dACC and fear learning. Further, the association of amygdala volume and fear learning shall be investigated. Finally, the association between mOFC thickness and extinction of conditioned fear will be considered. For this purpose, brain morphology and fear conditioning data from a larger sample (N = 108) of healthy young adults with full reinforcement rate (100 %) and no explicit contingency instructions for CS and US will be analysed. \n\n\nReferences:\n\nAbend, R., Gold, A.

Based on the findings by Cacciaglia et al. (2015), we expect that amygdala volume predicts differential SCRs in the first but not the second half of acquisition.\n3.\tThirdly, we propose a positive association between amygdala volume and the fear response (as measured by the mean differential subjective fear ratings and mean differential SCR) in the extinction phase. \n4.\tFourthly, we propose a positive association between the cortical thickness of the mOFC and extinction learning (as measured by differential subjective fear ratings and differential SCR) in the extinction phase. \n\nSince we hypothesise a positive association of differential SCRs/differential subjective fear ratings with the proposed structures, we will conduct a follow-up analysis for each hypothesis to test whether the association of the according structure results from an association with the CS+ or CS-.\n\nExploratory Hypotheses:\n\nPrevious research suggests that the dACC is involved in the negative appraisal of threat (Maier et al., 2012) and, therefore, might only be associated with fear learning  in the early acquisition process. Hence, we propose that the hypothesised association between cortical thickness of the dACC and fear learning (as measured by the differential SCR and subjective fear ratings) is driven by the first half of the acquisition but not the second.\n\nFurther, prior research brings to mind that inter-individual differences in the conditioning of fear might stem from differences in contingency awareness in the acquisition phase potentially resulting from either explicit instructions about the contingencies of the US and CS or a full reinforcement rate (100 %, in the acquisition phase every CS is coupled with a US) (Hartley et al., 2011; Lonsdorf &amp; Merz, 2017). We hypothesise that the dACC thickness predicts fear learning proxies (differential SCR and differential subjective fear ratings) but is moderated by different levels of contingency awareness.\n\nOne study described a distinction between early and late extinction phase when investigating the structural association with the mOFC (Milad et al., 2005) but did not report any results from this approach. Thus, we would like to explore whether there is a structural association between the mOFC and extinction learning in the early and late extinction.\n", "q3": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

The structural neuroimaging data, however, was only checked for completeness and volume and surface of (sub-) cortical areas was extracted using FreeSurfer (V.6.0.1). \nFor this study, the volume and cortical thickness of the amygdala and dACC/mOFC, respectively, as well as psychophysiological data and subjective fear ratings from Experiment Day 1 and Day 2 were extracted. To this point, no statistical models have been applied to the data and the data has not been combined yet. \n", "q11": "Based on their screening for childhood trauma, 120 participants were initially included in the study.

Physiological \u201cnon-responding\u201d (as measured by SCR) on Day 1 and Day 2 was defined as no reaction in SCR to the US on more than 9 (out of 14) occasions.

The moderator variable is contingency awareness with the levels \u201cunaware\u201d, \u201caware\u201d and \u201cuncertain\u201d. The dependent variable is the averaged differential SCR and averaged differential fear rating, whereas cortical thickness of the dACC is the independent variable. We expect that the association of the cortical thickness of the dACC and fear learning proxies is moderated by contingency awareness.\n\nRegarding the association of the cortical thickness of the mOFC with fear learning proxies (differential SCR and differential subjective fear ratings), we will test whether this association is driven by the first or the second half of extinction. For this purpose, we will again compare the model fit of the multivariate regression of the first and second half of acquisition by using an ANOVA. \n\u2003\n", "q23": "", "q6.question": "T1-weighted structural images (1 x 1 x 1 mm) were acquired with a 3 Tesla Siemens scanner using a 64-channel head coil and magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence. The data of the present study was acquired in a previous fMRI study with a longitudinal mixed design. The baseline measurement consisted of a habituation and acquisition phase (Day 1) and an extinction phase, reinstatement and reinstatement test 24 hours later (Day 2). Additionally, we measured the Skin Conductance Response (SCR) for each participant to every CS+ and CS- trial during fear acquisition and extinction, the subjective fear rating of CS+ and CS- before and after every session and a structured interview on the contingency awareness was conducted at the end completion of Day 1\nThe previous longitudinal study included 6 experimental sessions (T0 \u2013 T5), with each session being 6 months apart. The first two sessions (T0 and T1) each comprised of two scans 24 hours apart. Session T2 \u2013 T4 consisted of a questionnaire battery, and session T5 again comprised of two scans 24 hours apart and took place 2.5 years after the first session (T0). For the purpose described in this pre-registration, only data obtained at T0 will be investigated. \n", "q6.uploader": [], "q10.question": "Participants were recruited from a larger, previously conducted study that subserved the aim to provide a pool of well-characterised participants that can be invited to subsequent studies. This previous study already required participants to be healthy and aged between 18 and 50 years.  Participants were contacted given they agreed to participate in future studies and had no history of childhood trauma, as assessed by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; Wingenfeld et al., 2010), cut-offs according to Bernstein et al., 2003: emotional abuse&lt;13, physical abuse&lt;10, sexual abuse&lt;8, emotional neglect&lt;15, physical neglect&lt;10)). Further exclusion criteria included claustrophobia, cardiac pacemaker, non-MR-compatible metal implants, brain surgery, left handedness, participation in pharmacological studies, medication, internal medical disorders, chronic pain, neurological disorders, psychiatric disorders, metabolic disorders, acute infections, complications with anaesthesia in the past and pregnancy. \nIn total, the habituation phase (Day 1) consisted of 14 trials (7 CS+/7 CS-) followed by the acquisition phase (Day 1) with 28 trials (14 CS+ and 14 CS- in a randomised order) and an extinction phase (Day 2) with 28 trials (14 CS+ and 14 CS- in randomised order). For exploratory hypotheses, the acquisition and extinction phase will be divided into first and second half as based on previous studies (Cacciaglia et al., 2015; Milad et al., 2005). As described above, the first acquisition trial will not be included in the analysis. Hence, the first half of the acquisition will consist of the first 6 differential SCRs (calculated based on the first 12 acquisition trials) and the second half of the following 7 differential SCRs (calculated based on the second 14 acquisition trials). This also applies to the extinction phase. \nMonetary compensation for the participation amounted to 30 Euros per experimental session.\n", "q10.uploader": [], "q14.question": "", "q14.uploader": [], "q15.question": "The main outcome measures are cortical thickness, subcortical volume, psychophysiological measures (SCR), subjective fear ratings and contingency awareness. The SCR was acquired during fMRI data acquisition using BIOPAC equipment as previously described in detail in Kuhn et al. (2020). The SCRs were then scored semi-manually using the custom made program EDA view (kindly provided by Prof. M. Gamer) that is used to quantify the SCR amplitude based on the trough-to-peak method with the foot point occurring at 0.9 \u2013 3.5s after CS onset. The raw amplitudes were then normalized and range corrected by dividing each log-transformed SCR by the maximum amplitude (to any stimulus including the US) per participant per day. Processing of SCR data for this sample has been previously described and was left unchanged (Lonsdorf et al., 2019).\n\nSubjective fear ratings were measured after habituation, after acquisition, before extinction, after extinction and after reinstatement. They consisted of two questions asking about \u201chow much stress, fear and tension\u201d the participant experienced when they saw the CS+ and CS- the previous time. The questions were answered inside the MR scanner by rating the answers on a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from zero (answer: \u201cnone\u201d) to 100 (answer: \u201cmaximum\u201d). This was later transformed to a scale ranging from 0 to 25 (participants were instructed to rate from 0 to 100 on the VAS inside the MR scanner. The ratings were in steps of 5. Hence, the ratings are further analysed on a scale ranging from 0 to 25.).\n\nContingency awareness (conscious awareness of the coupling between US with CS+/CS-) was measured by conducting a structured interview with every participant after completion of Day 1. The answers were later coded into whether the participant was \u201cunaware\u201d (0), \u201caware\u201d (1) or \u201cuncertain\u201d (2) of the coupling between CS and US in the acquisition phase. Participants were not given any explicit instructions about the contingencies of CS+/CS- and US at any point of the study. \n\nThe first CS+ and CS- trials of the acquisition will be excluded from this present study resulting in a total of 26 trials for the acquisition phase (12 differential SCRs). The decision to exclude the SCRs to the first CS+ and CS- trials in the acquisition phase are based on the fact that the first CS+ appears before the first US has been delivered. Hence, the SCR to the first CS+ is not a proxy of fear learning since the coupling of the CS with the US has not been established yet. If the first SCRs to the CS+ and CS- were to be included this would distort the estimation of fear learning based on the SCRs in the direction of a less effective learning of fear based on the SCR.  \nSex and intracranial volume will be included into the analyses as covariates. \n", "q15.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "For the main hypotheses we will perform distinct multivariate regressions in order to test whether the cortical thickness of the dACC, the mOFC and the volume of the amygdala predict differential SCRs and differential fear ratings at different stages in fear conditioning. We will include sex and intracranial volume of participants into the analyses as covariates. As a follow-up analysis we will perform Pearson correlations for each multivariate regression to determine whether the structural association with the fear learning proxies is driven by an association with the CS+ or CS-. To do so, we will correlate the cortical thickness of the dACC, the mOFC and the volume of the amygdala with the averaged SCRs to CS+ and CS- and the averaged fear ratings for the CS+ and CS-.",

"}, "hypothesis": {"extra": [], "value": "Theories of corporate illegality (e.g., Baucus, 1994; Coleman, 1987; Finney &amp; Lesieur, 1982) assume three preconditions for illegal behavior of businesses: (1) the motivation to break the law in order to achieve goals or to ensure survival; (2) the opportunity to engage in illegal behavior; and (3) no effective controls to deter from illegal behavior. In line with the economics-of-crime paradigm (Becker, 1968), the traditional view is that illegal behavior, as - for instance - noncompliance with safety standards and regulations, should be negatively related to the level of deterrence. Accordingly, high compared to low penalty levels are expected to result in more pronounced compliance.\n\nThe aim of the present study is to investigate whether the effect of penalties on compliance is influenced by whether penalty rates are the same for different business sizes or not and if this is transparently communicated. We test whether the effectiveness of different proportional penalty rates for big and small size companies is attenuated or even undermined when such policies are transparent. In such a situation, different penalty schemes for big and small size companies could backfire due to reactance and negative reactions of disadvantaged parties, resulting in lower compliance. \n\nTo study this, we use a between-subject design with a total of eight conditions resulting from three factors with two levels each: company size (big size vs. small size company), penalty scheme (same: 50% of evaded compliance costs for both company sizes vs. different: 50% of evaded compliance costs for small size companies and 150% of evaded compliance costs for big size companies), and transparency of penalty scheme (non-transparent/only informed about own penalty rate vs. transparent/also informed about penalty rate for other company size).\n\nBreaking down our expected pattern of behavioral results, we first look at the four cells within the non-transparent factor-level. Here, we expect that safety compliance rates for big and small size companies are on the same level in the two conditions with the same penalty scheme. In the different penalty scheme conditions, we expect compliance to be higher for big size companies, which face a higher penalty rate. In contrast, for the four cells within the transparent factor-level, we expect a difference in compliance between the two conditions with the same penalty scheme, i.e. that compliance is lower for small size companies compared to big size companies. In the different penalty scheme conditions, we expect the difference between the two company types to become less pronounced, i.e. that compliance decreases for big size companies and increases for small size companies (compared to the respective pattern in the non-transparent conditions). \n\nWith regard to evaluations of severity of penalties and perceived fairness (the latter only in transparent conditions), we expect the following pattern: in non-transparent conditions we expect higher perceived severity of penalties only for big size companies in the condition where the penalty scheme is different (i.e., only big businesses who face a penalty rate of 150%). In the transparent conditions, we expect higher perceived severity of penalties for big size compared to small size businesses when the penalty schemes are different and the reverse pattern when penalty rates are the same. The same pattern should also be observed for perceived fairness, assuming a negative correlation of perceived fairness and severity of penalties.\n\nResearch Questions:\n\n1.)

Participants are informed that during the study they will take on the role of a business owner that manufactures toys. In each round of the experiment they receive turnover (income) which varies for both big and small size businesses over the rounds, but is always higher for the big size businesses in comparison to the small size businesses. They have to spend a certain amount of their income as compliance costs to adhere to safety rules. This means they get a screen that informs them about their income in the respective round and the due safety compliance costs, as well as the chance to be audited by the responsible authorities and the potential penalties for noncompliance. Business income, safety compliance costs, and audit probabilities vary over the 18 rounds of the experiment. When making the decision whether to comply with the safety regulations in each round, participants have to fill in a form. The final payoff is determined by one randomly drawn round and based on the compliance decision in this round and whether there was an audit (and a potential penalty).\n\nSeveral measures will be collected in the post experimental survey and are defined as follows: - Memory/attention checks (4 items; 3-5 options per item) \u2013 Manipulation Check (1 item; 5 options) \u2013  Risk propensity (6 items) on a 7-point Likert-type scale \u2013 Norm Following (7 items) on a 5-point Likert-type scale \u2013 Severity of fines and perceived fairness (1 or 2 items depending on transparent or non-transparent condition) on a 7-point Likert-type scale \u2013 COVID-19 related questions (3 items) on a 7-point Likert-type scale \u2013 Demographics (e.g., age, gender). ", "conditions": "The study constitutes a mixed-design. In eight different conditions, we test the influence of business size (two levels; big size company vs. small size company), penalty scheme (two levels; payback + 50% for both company sizes vs. payback + 50% for small size companies and payback + 150% for big size companies), and transparency of penalty scheme (two levels; penalty rate for other company size not transparent vs. penalty rate for other company size transparent) on compliance with safety regulations. These three independent variables are all manipulated between participants. Within-subject factors: All participants will go through 18 rounds of compliance decisions. Each round has a unique combination of the parameters income, compliance costs due, and audit probability (3x2x3 levels). Income is either 1000, 1500, or 2000 ECU (small size companies) or 1500, 2000, or 2500 ECU (big size companies). Compliance costs are either 20% or 40% of the income earned per round. The audit probability is set at 10%, 15%, or 20%, and audits will be determined based on these probabilities for each round. ", "hypothesis": "Theories of corporate illegality (e.g., Baucus, 1994; Coleman, 1987; Finney &amp; Lesieur, 1982) assume three preconditions for illegal behavior of businesses: (1) the motivation to break the law in order to achieve goals or to ensure survival; (2) the opportunity to engage in illegal behavior; and (3) no effective controls to deter from illegal behavior. In line with the economics-of-crime paradigm (Becker, 1968), the traditional view is that illegal behavior, as - for instance - noncompliance with safety standards and regulations, should be negatively related to the level of deterrence. Accordingly, high compared to low penalty levels are expected to result in more pronounced compliance.\n\nThe aim of the present study is to investigate whether the effect of penalties on compliance is influenced by whether penalty rates are the same for different business sizes or not and if this is transparently communicated. We test whether the effectiveness of different proportional penalty rates for big and small size companies is attenuated or even undermined when such policies are transparent. In such a situation, different penalty schemes for big and small size companies could backfire due to reactance and negative reactions of disadvantaged parties, resulting in lower compliance. \n\nTo study this, we use a between-subject design with a total of eight conditions resulting from three factors with two levels each: company size (big size vs. small size company), penalty scheme (same: 50% of evaded compliance costs for both company sizes vs. different: 50% of evaded compliance costs for small size companies and 150% of evaded compliance costs for big size companies), and transparency of penalty scheme (non-transparent/only informed about own penalty rate vs. transparent/also informed about penalty rate for other company size).\n\nBreaking down our expected pattern of behavioral results, we first look at the four cells within the non-transparent factor-level. Here, we expect that safety compliance rates for big and small size companies are on the same level in the two conditions with the same penalty scheme. In the different penalty scheme conditions, we expect compliance to be higher for big size companies, which face a higher penalty rate. In contrast, for the four cells within the transparent factor-level, we expect a difference in compliance between the two conditions with the same penalty scheme, i.e. that compliance is lower for small size companies compared to big size companies. In the different penalty scheme conditions, we expect the difference between the two company types to become less pronounced, i.e. that compliance decreases for big size companies and increases for small size companies (compared to the respective pattern in the non-transparent conditions). \n\nWith regard to evaluations of severity of penalties and perceived fairness (the latter only in transparent conditions), we expect the following pattern: in non-transparent conditions we expect higher perceived severity of penalties only for big size companies in the condition where the penalty scheme is different (i.e., only big businesses who face a penalty rate of 150%). In the transparent conditions, we expect higher perceived severity of penalties for big size compared to small size businesses when the penalty schemes are different and the reverse pattern when penalty rates are the same. The same pattern should also be observed for perceived fairness, assuming a negative correlation of perceived fairness and severity of penalties.\n\nResearch Questions:\n\n1.) Does a different penalty rate for big size in contrast to small size businesses have a different effect on relative compliance when it is transparent compared to when it is not transparent?\n\nAdditionally, we investigate two other research questions:\n\n2.) Do income level, relative compliance costs, and audit probability influence compliance with safety regulations?\n\n3.) Does the business size (big size vs. small size companies) in case of the same penalty rate influence compliance with safety regulations in non-transparent and transparent conditions?", "study_type":

These audits traditionally involve following up patients for self-reported nausea and vomiting, and also reviewing paper charts for antiemetic use. This can be time consuming, risks human error, and not lend itself easily to repeat audits. However, with the advent of electronic medical records it may be feasible to perform an audit using electronic data. \n\nThis study aims to demonstrate in a routine clinical audit setting how electronic data extraction may be of similar precision as the more traditional and accepted manual extraction.
