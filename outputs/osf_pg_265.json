Serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms (5-HTTLPR) and early parent-infant interaction influence adults\u2019 relationship with intimate partners. However, human conspecifics socially act towards the real and virtual world in displaying multiple and complex social interactions. Hence, the mechanisms underlying the virtual social relationship in humans remain largely unknown. We hypothesized interaction between genetic factors (three polymorphisms from the oxytocin receptor, OXTR, and the serotonin transporter, 5-HTTLPR), parental bonding patterns (PBI) and adults\u2019 interactional patterns (ASQ, ECR-R) in shaping virtual social behaviour (Instagram, Facebook). Self-reported questionnaires were used to evaluate participants\u2019 (n= 61) parental bonding patterns (Parental Bonding Instrument, formed by four subscales Maternal Care, Paternal Care, Maternal Overprotection, Paternal Overprotection), interactional patterns towards peers (Attachment Style Questionnaire formed by five subscales Confidence, Discomfort in Intimacy, Relationship as Secondary, Need for Approval, Worry about Relationship) and the quality of bond with intimate partners (Experience in Close Relationship Scale formed by two subscales Anxiety, Avoidance). Social media activities were collected applying an automatic Python algorithm through which eight indexes were extracted: Instagram number of following users, followers, posts and tags from other users\u2019 posts and Facebook number of friends, interests, published pics and given likes. Buccal mucosa cell samples were collected to assess participants\u2019 genetic predispositions, and regions OXTR/rs2254298 (G/G homozygotes vs A carriers), OXTR/rs53576 (G/G homozygotes vs A carriers) and 5-HTTLPR/rs255331 (G/G homozygotes vs A carriers) were genotyped. We hypothesize multiple gene*environment interactions on different parameters and indexes calculated on the social media variables as Instagram Followers/Following ratio (\u201cSocial Desirability Index\u201d).

Two ECR-R Dimensions were evaluated and considered: \na) ECR-R Anxiety is an integer variable which reports the ECR-R scores for the Anxiety Dimension.\nb) ECR-R Avoidance is an integer variable which reports the ECR-R scores for the Avoidance Dimension.\n2) Genetic measure: Oxytocin Receptor Gene. The regions rs2245298 and rs53576 of the Oxytocin Receptor Gene (OXTR) were a-priori considered because of their robust correlation with social behaviour, empathy, affect and adult attachment.\na) OXTR rs53576 is a categorical variable (levels: A/A, A/G, G/G). contains the genotypes for the OXTR region rs53576.\nb) OXTR 2254298 is a categorical variable (levels: A/A, G/A, G/G). includes the genotypes for the OXTR region 2254298.\n3) An ad-hoc prepared Python script extracted three a-priori elected parameters representative of the Instagram (IG) social behaviours. \nThe following two parameters represent the main measured dependent variables included in the confirmatory analyses of this study:\na) IG posts is an integer variable which contains the Instagram number of published posts.\nb) IG SDI is an integer variable which includes the estimate produced by the ratio between the number of followers and followings.\nThe following measured dependent variables are reported for exploratory analyses and unexpected effects of this study:\na) IG followings is an integer variable which includes the Instagram number of followed users.\nb) IG followers is an integer variable which includes the Instagram number of followers.", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "Every variable extracted from Instagram represents a snapshot of participants' social behaviour at a specific time point.

Statistical analysis will be conducted by R software. \nData approach and statistical techniques will follow these steps: \na) Dataset will be imported in R and NA values will be quantified for each variable.\nb) Data related to subjects with NA values higher than 2 will be discarded.\nc) Genotypes' frequencies for the regions OXTR rs53576 (A/A vs. A/G vs. G/G) and rs2254298 (A/A, G/A, G/G) will be calculated.\nd) Participants possessing at least one allele (i.e. G/G homozygotes or A/G) will be classified into a single carriers group and the obtained genotype distribution (i.e. A/A homozygotes vs. G carriers) will be compared with the Hardy\u2013Weinberg Equilibrium.\ne) The SDI will be obtained dividing the IG followers by the IG followings.  \nf) IG variables will be standardized in z-scores.\ng) Male and female participants will be checked for significant differences between the allelic groups and within each IG variable. \nh) In our sample, Cronbach's alphas will be calculated for each subscale of the ECR-R questionnaire. \ni) Prior to data analysis, the data distribution of each dependent variable will be displayed by density plots and box-plots; skew and kurtosis will be calculated to understand the related power values. \nj) To each dependent variable whose sampling will not show a Gaussian distribution, a logarithmic transformation will be applied. Therefore, a statistical parametric test will be adopted.\nk) Bartlett test will verify the preliminary assumption of equal variance across the sample for the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).\nl) For each IG variable, one ANCOVA will be performed with the IG posts number as the dependent variable, the OXTR gene genotype (OXTR rs53576 A/A homozygotes vs. G carriers) as a between-subjects factor and the ECR-R dimensions all together (anxiety, avoidance) as continuous covariates. For each IG variable one ANCOVA was also performed with the OXTr gene genotype rs224529 (G/G homozygotes vs. A carriers) as a between-subjects factor, and the other parameters unchanged.\nm) If a gender effect will be preliminarily found on an IG dependent variable, the variable \"Gender\" will be included as a between-subjects factor in the ANCOVA on the same IG variable. \nn) Correlations will be run as post hoc tests and Pearsons\u2019 r coefficients will be used to measure the strength of the effect of the covariate on the dependent variable and Cohen\u2019s d will be used to evaluate the magnitude of effects which will be found to be significant.\no) Scores in the dimensions of anxiety and avoidance are as a continuum, which will enable us to identify the ECR-R subscales 1) as covariates applied to the ANCOVA, 2) as four main groups by clustering the sample using the median splits for the post-hoc tests: low anxiety, low avoidance, high anxiety, high avoidance.\np) Main and interactive ANCOVA effects between variables will be considered, visualized by scatterplot with linear models.\nq) Effects of the interaction between adult attachment and genotype on each IG variable will be represented by barplots and further analyzed by post-hoc t-tests.", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href":

Jiga-Boy, Swansea University, Department of Psychology\nAcademic year: 2019-2020\n\nPROJECT SYNOPSIS AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS \nWith the growing climate crisis, it is important to understand how we can maximise people\u2019s pro-environmental behaviour. Students/young adults may have relatively clear beliefs about how important climate change is for them and/or about what they should do to curb climate change, but they often behave mindlessly, without reference to their personal beliefs. According to Huber, Van Boven, McGraw &amp; Johnson-Graham (2011), causes/crises arousing more immediate emotions are seen as more deserving of attention/help/donations (i.e. immediacy bias). Furthermore, Huber, Van Boven and McGraw (2010) posited that interventions to change behaviour can be external (e.g., choice architecture, incentives) or internal (e.g., encouraging people to monitor/modify their own behaviour). Internal interventions might better correspond to people\u2019s personal beliefs about how such decisions should, normatively, be made. Internally-focused interventions such as introspection are based on people\u2019s internally generated beliefs about how best to make decisions (Van Boven &amp; Huber, NSF grant, 2014). For example, reflecting on how much a policy should be evaluated based on partisanship vs. based on one\u2019s personal attitude leads to less influence of partisanship (Huber et al., 2009, unpublished). Here, we intend to translate this finding to pro- environmental behaviour. We attempt to make people mindful of how they personally believe they should make decisions before they actually make decisions, to increase the intention to behave pro-environmentally. We also attempt to make people aware of their concern for social justice and autonomy motives. We want to get people to make decisions in a manner that more closely matches their personal normative beliefs (assuming these beliefs are correct). We are currently unaware of the extent to which reflection before or after making a pro-environmental decision has on pro-environmental behaviour. Furthermore, we intend to investigate whether reflection may have a higher influence over behaviours regarding sustainable material consumption compared to energy consumption. \n\nRQ1: Does reflecting about how people personally believe they should act to protect the environment impact their intentions to engage in pro-environmental behaviour?\n\nRQ2: Do values, environmental concern, awarenss of consequences and negative emotions moderate the relationship between introspection and intentions to engage in pro-environmental behaviour?"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Research Question 1, HYPOTHESIS 1 (directional): We predict that participants who engage in introspection + priming of social justice &amp; autonomy values before choice will report more intentions to engage in pro-environmental behaviour than those who engage in introspection alone before choice, and that those who engage in introspection alone after choice.\n\nResearch Question 2, HYPOTHESIS 1 (directional): We predict that introspection regarding pro-environmental decisions would lead to more self-reported intentions to engage in pro-environmental behaviour for participants who endorse more biospheric values compared to participants who endorse more hedonic and egoistic values.\n\nResearch Question 2, HYPOTHESIS 2 (directional): We predict that introspection regarding pro-environmental decisions would lead to more self-reported intentions to engage in pro-environmental behaviour for participants who endorse the new environmental paradigm (NEP) and to less self-reported intentions to engage in pro-environmental behaviour for participants who endorse the dominant social paradigm (DSP). \n\nResearch Question 2, HYPOTHESIS 3 (directional): We predict that introspection regarding pro-environmental decisions would lead to more self-reported intentions to engage in pro-environmental behaviour for participants who score higher on awareness of consequences. \n\nResearch Question 2, HYPOTHESIS 4 (directional): We predict that introspection regarding pro-environmental decisions would lead to more self-reported intentions to engage in pro-environmental behaviour for participants who score higher on measures of negative emotions.

Jiga-Boy, Swansea University, Department of Psychology\nAcademic year: 2019-2020\n\nPROJECT SYNOPSIS AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS \nWith the growing climate crisis, it is important to understand how we can maximise people\u2019s pro-environmental behaviour. Students/young adults may have relatively clear beliefs about how important climate change is for them and/or about what they should do to curb climate change, but they often behave mindlessly, without reference to their personal beliefs. According to Huber, Van Boven, McGraw &amp; Johnson-Graham (2011), causes/crises arousing more immediate emotions are seen as more deserving of attention/help/donations (i.e. immediacy bias). Furthermore, Huber, Van Boven and McGraw (2010) posited that interventions to change behaviour can be external (e.g., choice architecture, incentives) or internal (e.g., encouraging people to monitor/modify their own behaviour). Internal interventions might better correspond to people\u2019s personal beliefs about how such decisions should, normatively, be made. Internally-focused interventions such as introspection are based on people\u2019s internally generated beliefs about how best to make decisions (Van Boven &amp; Huber, NSF grant, 2014). For example, reflecting on how much a policy should be evaluated based on partisanship vs. based on one\u2019s personal attitude leads to less influence of partisanship (Huber et al., 2009, unpublished). Here, we intend to translate this finding to pro- environmental behaviour. We attempt to make people mindful of how they personally believe they should make decisions before they actually make decisions, to increase the intention to behave pro-environmentally. We also attempt to make people aware of their concern for social justice and autonomy motives. We want to get people to make decisions in a manner that more closely matches their personal normative beliefs (assuming these beliefs are correct). We are currently unaware of the extent to which reflection before or after making a pro-environmental decision has on pro-environmental behaviour. Furthermore, we intend to investigate whether reflection may have a higher influence over behaviours regarding sustainable material consumption compared to energy consumption. \n\nRQ1: Does reflecting about how people personally believe they should act to protect the environment impact their intentions to engage in pro-environmental behaviour?\n\nRQ2: Do values, environmental concern, awarenss of consequences and negative emotions moderate the relationship between introspection and intentions to engage in pro-environmental behaviour?", "q4": "Research Question 1, HYPOTHESIS 1 (directional): We predict that participants who engage in introspection + priming of social justice &amp; autonomy values before choice will report more intentions to engage in pro-environmental behaviour than those who engage in introspection alone before choice, and that those who engage in introspection alone after choice.\n\nResearch Question 2, HYPOTHESIS 1 (directional): We predict that introspection regarding pro-environmental decisions would lead to more self-reported intentions to engage in pro-environmental behaviour for participants who endorse more biospheric values compared to participants who endorse more hedonic and egoistic values.\n\nResearch Question 2, HYPOTHESIS 2 (directional): We predict that introspection regarding pro-environmental decisions would lead to more self-reported intentions to engage in pro-environmental behaviour for participants who endorse the new environmental paradigm (NEP) and to less self-reported intentions to engage in pro-environmental behaviour for participants who endorse the dominant social paradigm (DSP). \n\nResearch Question 2, HYPOTHESIS 3 (directional): We predict that introspection regarding pro-environmental decisions would lead to more self-reported intentions to engage in pro-environmental behaviour for participants who score higher on awareness of consequences. \n\nResearch Question 2, HYPOTHESIS 4 (directional): We predict that introspection regarding pro-environmental decisions would lead to more self-reported intentions to engage in pro-environmental behaviour for participants who score higher on measures of negative emotions.
