"Tianwei V. Du, Donald Lynam"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Due to the hostility and lack of empathy that individuals with narcissism often display, narcissism is often linked to aggressive behaviors. Both proactive and reactive aggression have been associated with narcissism: proactive aggression refers to goal-oriented aggressive behaviors that are purposeful, and reactive aggression refers to aggressive behaviors that occur as a result of provocation such as verbal insult or physical attack (Fossati, Borroni, Eisenberg &amp; Maffei, 2010;  Walters, 2005; Vize et al., 2018). Although one meta-analysis has examined how narcissism associated with provoked aggression, narcissism, however, is not a homogeneous construct. Narcissism can be conceived at three levels: as a global construct, as two prototypical presentations (i.e. grandiosity and vulnerability), and as a trifurcated model with three underlying factors: interpersonal antagonism, neuroticism, and agentic extraversion (Crowe, Lynam, Campbell, &amp; Miller, 2019). Most studies on narcissism and aggression conceptualized narcissism broadly as a global factor, and these studies showed that individuals with narcissism are likely to be aggression in both provoked and unprovoked condition (Bushman &amp; Baumeister, 1998; Rasmussen, 2016; Reidy, Foster &amp; Zeichner, 2010). More recent studies have found that when breaking down narcissism into its two variants, grandiose and vulnerable narcissism differ in their associations with proactive and reactive aggression. Grandiose narcissism was found to associate strongly with both types of aggression, and vulnerable narcissism was found to associate more strongly with reactive aggression than proactive aggression (Lobbestael et al., 2014; Vize et al., 2019a). Only one study has examined how narcissism associates with aggression at the three-factor level (Vize et al., 2019a), and results from the study showed that relative to Neuroticism and Agentic Extraversion, Interpersonal Antagonism appears to be the dominant predictor of both proactive and reactive aggression. Although the three narcissism factors may not be isomorphic to Neuroticism, Agreeableness, and Extraversion in the Five Factor Model (FFM), given the strong connection between the two models, results from another meta-analysis (Vize et al., 2019b) are relevant to our study: the authors examined the associations between the FFM and different types of aggression, and they found that though neuroticism is moderately related to reactive aggression, it is only weakly related to proactive aggression. In contrast, agreeableness is moderately to strongly related to both types of aggression. \n\tRecurrent display of aggressive behaviors can seriously harm individuals\u2019 social and psychological functioning. To further understand the association between narcissism and aggression, it is important to synthesize existing literature that studied both sets of variables. One meta-analysis has examined narcissism and aggression and found a significant positive association between them (Rasmussen, 2016). However, the analysis only accounted for provoked aggression and studied narcissism as a global factor, which makes it hard to conclude whether the effect can be generalized across all dimensions of narcissism and both types of aggressive behaviors. Thus, the goal of the proposed project is to conduct a meta-analysis to comprehensively examine the relation between three levels of narcissism (i.e. global factor, the dual-variant model, and the trifurcated model) and three forms of aggression (i.e. proactive, reactive, and general aggression) by decomposing the global relation between Narcissism and Aggression into subtypes of aggression and subcomponents of Narcissism using existing literature. \nBroad Guiding Question: To what extent does narcissism across its three levels relate to different types of trait aggression?\nSub-Questions:\n1.

Following this, the first author will screen the data based on pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria (see points 13 and 14). In the first round of screening, we will screen articles based on titles, abstracts, and keywords to remove non-relevant articles. In the next step we will complete full-text searches to determine whether articles fulfill our inclusion criteria.

In addition to effect sizes (rs) between narcissism factors and trait aggression, we will code for relevant demographic data (mean age, percentage male, percentage White), sample size, sample type (student, community, clinical, forensic), source of information for narcissism and aggression (self-report, informant-report, clinician ratings, interview, official records, laboratory tasks), nature of the measured relation (concurrent vs. longitudinal), measure of narcissism (e.g., Narcissistic Personality Inventory, Pathological Narcissism Inventory), and measure of aggression (e.g., Reactive\u2013Proactive Questionnaire). The first author will extract and record all the information, and to ensure the articles are coded reliably, an independent coder will record the same information for 20% of the articles in the meta-analysis. We will compare the independent coder\u2019s results to the original coding from the first author. We will calculate intraclass correlations for effect size reliability and percent agreement for categorical moderators and sample characteristics (e.g. sample size).

When correlation coefficients were not reported, r will be calculated either by converting existing parametric statistics (e.g. F, t, and d) or directly from means and standard deviations provided in the article. We will then generate mean effect sizes as well as their 95% confidence intervals for each relation of interest between narcissism and aggression. Multiple samples reported on in the same article will be treated as independent samples and will each be included in the analysis.\n\tGiven the nonadditive nature of correlation coefficients, all effect sizes will first be transformed into z' units using the Fisher z' transformation (Lipsey &amp; Wilson, 2001) before being averaged. To derive a mean effect size across samples, each effect size (ESi) will weighted by the inverse of its variance (wi). \nSpecific approach for analyzing effects associated with the trifurcated model of narcissism\n\tAn initial, informal review of the literature showed that most studies that assessed both narcissism and aggression studied narcissism at either the global factor level or the dual-variant level. Although it may not be possible to formally meta-analyze how the trifurcated model of narcissism relate to aggression, due to the hierarchical structure across different levels of narcissism (Crowe, Lynam, Campbell, &amp; Miller, 2019), it is possible to infer the relation using known associations between the three factors and commonly used narcissism inventories. Relative weights (Tonidandel &amp; LeBreton, 2015) of Interpersonal Antagonism, Agentic Extraversion, and Neuroticism in each of the commonly used narcissism measures will be extracted from existing studies (e.g. Crowe, Lynam, Campbell, &amp; Miller, 2019), and these weights will be used to estimate how effect sizes of narcissism on aggression vary as a function of these relative weights across different measures of narcissism. We will run the moderator analysis using both raw weights and weight percentages from the relative weights analysis.\n\nEvaluating differences in strengths of effect:\n\tTo compare strengths of effect across different narcissism components or different forms of aggression, we will use  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method (Lunn et al., 2000) to directly testing the likelihood of significant difference of the effects through simulation.\n\nHeterogeneity in effect size:\n\tI2 statistics will be calculated and reported to examine overall heterogeneity that can be attributed to true between-studies variation (Higgins et al., 2003). \n\nOutlier identification:\n\tAll effect sizes will be transformed to z' units and values of z' outside the range of \u20132.5 and 2.5 standard deviations will be considered outliers. We will report results with and without the outliers.\n\nPublication Bias:\n\tWe will use funnel plots to assess publication bias for each predictor. This method allows us to detect potential bias that are caused by underrepresentation of studies with small samples. When there is evidence of publication bias, we will use the trim and fill method (Duval and Tweedie, 2000) to estimate and impute potential missing studies.\n\nStatistical software:\n\tData will be analyzed using the \u201cescalc\u201d, \u201crma\u201d, \u201cfunnel\u201d and \u201ctrimfill\u201d functions in the \u201cmetafor\u201d R package.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q21": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q23": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "References:\nBushman, B.

Du, Donald Lynam", "q3": "Due to the hostility and lack of empathy that individuals with narcissism often display, narcissism is often linked to aggressive behaviors. Both proactive and reactive aggression have been associated with narcissism: proactive aggression refers to goal-oriented aggressive behaviors that are purposeful, and reactive aggression refers to aggressive behaviors that occur as a result of provocation such as verbal insult or physical attack (Fossati, Borroni, Eisenberg &amp; Maffei, 2010;  Walters, 2005; Vize et al., 2018). Although one meta-analysis has examined how narcissism associated with provoked aggression, narcissism, however, is not a homogeneous construct. Narcissism can be conceived at three levels: as a global construct, as two prototypical presentations (i.e. grandiosity and vulnerability), and as a trifurcated model with three underlying factors: interpersonal antagonism, neuroticism, and agentic extraversion (Crowe, Lynam, Campbell, &amp; Miller, 2019). Most studies on narcissism and aggression conceptualized narcissism broadly as a global factor, and these studies showed that individuals with narcissism are likely to be aggression in both provoked and unprovoked condition (Bushman &amp; Baumeister, 1998; Rasmussen, 2016; Reidy, Foster &amp; Zeichner, 2010). More recent studies have found that when breaking down narcissism into its two variants, grandiose and vulnerable narcissism differ in their associations with proactive and reactive aggression. Grandiose narcissism was found to associate strongly with both types of aggression, and vulnerable narcissism was found to associate more strongly with reactive aggression than proactive aggression (Lobbestael et al., 2014; Vize et al., 2019a). Only one study has examined how narcissism associates with aggression at the three-factor level (Vize et al., 2019a), and results from the study showed that relative to Neuroticism and Agentic Extraversion, Interpersonal Antagonism appears to be the dominant predictor of both proactive and reactive aggression. Although the three narcissism factors may not be isomorphic to Neuroticism, Agreeableness, and Extraversion in the Five Factor Model (FFM), given the strong connection between the two models, results from another meta-analysis (Vize et al., 2019b) are relevant to our study: the authors examined the associations between the FFM and different types of aggression, and they found that though neuroticism is moderately related to reactive aggression, it is only weakly related to proactive aggression. In contrast, agreeableness is moderately to strongly related to both types of aggression. \n\tRecurrent display of aggressive behaviors can seriously harm individuals\u2019 social and psychological functioning. To further understand the association between narcissism and aggression, it is important to synthesize existing literature that studied both sets of variables. One meta-analysis has examined narcissism and aggression and found a significant positive association between them (Rasmussen, 2016). However, the analysis only accounted for provoked aggression and studied narcissism as a global factor, which makes it hard to conclude whether the effect can be generalized across all dimensions of narcissism and both types of aggressive behaviors. Thus, the goal of the proposed project is to conduct a meta-analysis to comprehensively examine the relation between three levels of narcissism (i.e. global factor, the dual-variant model, and the trifurcated model) and three forms of aggression (i.e. proactive, reactive, and general aggression) by decomposing the global relation between Narcissism and Aggression into subtypes of aggression and subcomponents of Narcissism using existing literature. \nBroad Guiding Question: To what extent does narcissism across its three levels relate to different types of trait aggression?\nSub-Questions:\n1. To what extent does general narcissism, as a global factor, correlate with proactive, reactive, and general aggression?\n2. To what extent do grandiose and vulnerable narcissism correlate with proactive, reactive, and general aggression?\n3. To what extent do Interpersonal Antagonism, Neuroticism, and Agentic Extraversion correlate with proactive, reactive, and general aggression?", "q4": "Hypothesis 1: The global factor of narcissism will associate positively with proactive, reactive, and general aggression.\nHypothesis 2: Grandiose and vulnerable narcissism will both associate positively with proactive, reactive, and general aggression. Vulnerable narcissism will associate more strongly with reactive aggression than proactive aggression.\nHypothesis 3: At the trifurcated level, Interpersonal Antagonism will associate positive with proactive, reactive, and general aggression. Neuroticism will associate positively with reactive aggression.

Following this, the first author will screen the data based on pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria (see points 13 and 14). In the first round of screening, we will screen articles based on titles, abstracts, and keywords to remove non-relevant articles. In the next step we will complete full-text searches to determine whether articles fulfill our inclusion criteria. After we identify a group of relevant studies, several variables will be extracted and formally coded. In addition to effect sizes (rs) between narcissism factors and trait aggression, we will code for relevant demographic data (mean age, percentage male, percentage White), sample size, sample type (student, community, clinical, forensic), source of information for narcissism and aggression (self-report, informant-report, clinician ratings, interview, official records, laboratory tasks), nature of the measured relation (concurrent vs. longitudinal), measure of narcissism (e.g., Narcissistic Personality Inventory, Pathological Narcissism Inventory), and measure of aggression (e.g., Reactive\u2013Proactive Questionnaire). The first author will extract and record all the information, and to ensure the articles are coded reliably, an independent coder will record the same information for 20% of the articles in the meta-analysis.

When correlation coefficients were not reported, r will be calculated either by converting existing parametric statistics (e.g. F, t, and d) or directly from means and standard deviations provided in the article. We will then generate mean effect sizes as well as their 95% confidence intervals for each relation of interest between narcissism and aggression. Multiple samples reported on in the same article will be treated as independent samples and will each be included in the analysis.\n\tGiven the nonadditive nature of correlation coefficients, all effect sizes will first be transformed into z' units using the Fisher z' transformation (Lipsey &amp; Wilson, 2001) before being averaged. To derive a mean effect size across samples, each effect size (ESi) will weighted by the inverse of its variance (wi). \nSpecific approach for analyzing effects associated with the trifurcated model of narcissism\n\tAn initial, informal review of the literature showed that most studies that assessed both narcissism and aggression studied narcissism at either the global factor level or the dual-variant level. Although it may not be possible to formally meta-analyze how the trifurcated model of narcissism relate to aggression, due to the hierarchical structure across different levels of narcissism (Crowe, Lynam, Campbell, &amp; Miller, 2019), it is possible to infer the relation using known associations between the three factors and commonly used narcissism inventories. Relative weights (Tonidandel &amp; LeBreton, 2015) of Interpersonal Antagonism, Agentic Extraversion, and Neuroticism in each of the commonly used narcissism measures will be extracted from existing studies (e.g. Crowe, Lynam, Campbell, &amp; Miller, 2019), and these weights will be used to estimate how effect sizes of narcissism on aggression vary as a function of these relative weights across different measures of narcissism. We will run the moderator analysis using both raw weights and weight percentages from the relative weights analysis.\n\nEvaluating differences in strengths of effect:\n\tTo compare strengths of effect across different narcissism components or different forms of aggression, we will use  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method (Lunn et al., 2000) to directly testing the likelihood of significant difference of the effects through simulation.\n\nHeterogeneity in effect size:\n\tI2 statistics will be calculated and reported to examine overall heterogeneity that can be attributed to true between-studies variation (Higgins et al., 2003). \n\nOutlier identification:\n\tAll effect sizes will be transformed to z' units and values of z' outside the range of \u20132.5 and 2.5 standard deviations will be considered outliers. We will report results with and without the outliers.\n\nPublication Bias:\n\tWe will use funnel plots to assess publication bias for each predictor. This method allows us to detect potential bias that are caused by underrepresentation of studies with small samples. When there is evidence of publication bias, we will use the trim and fill method (Duval and Tweedie, 2000) to estimate and impute potential missing studies.\n\nStatistical software:\n\tData will be analyzed using the \u201cescalc\u201d, \u201crma\u201d, \u201cfunnel\u201d and \u201ctrimfill\u201d functions in the \u201cmetafor\u201d R package.\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []},

A rich literature has sought to measure protest\u2019s long-run effectiveness in changing legislative outcomes (Gillion, 2012; Gause, 2016), policy (Andrews, 1997; Biggs and Andrews, 2015), and public opinion (Giugni, 1998; Huff and Kruszewska, 2016; Wasow, 2016; Enos, Kaufman and Sands, 2017). In this project, we seek to answer a shorter-term question: do protests directly change the behavior of street-level bureaucrats? Even before elected officials change laws and policies, do non-elected bureaucrats respond to protesters\u2019 demands? In this study, we focus on a particular type of street-level bureaucrats (police) and ask how their behavior changed after a particular set of protests (the Black Lives Matter protests that swept across the US in December 2014). We seek to test whether police behavior changed in the wake of local Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests. Specifically, we ask whether police became less likely to make discretionary arrests for minor crimes, which would align with protesters\u2019 demands, or whether they exhibited a \u201cbacklash\u201d response to protests and made more of these arrests. We also collect data on police killings of civilians, and on crime clearance rates, as discussed below. This research will yield a new understanding of both the impact of protest, and the behavior of street-level bureaucrats. If we find that police change their behavior to accord with protesters\u2019 concerns, this would suggest that protests can be effective in previously- unmeasured ways. If they do not react to protests, or if they instead show evidence of backlash, this would provide a cautionary tale to activists. It would also differentiate police from other unelected officials that have been shown to move with various measures of public opinion, such as judges (Giles, Blackstone and Vining, 2008) and social service workers (Weissert, 1994; Schram, College and Fording, 2007)."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "We want to know whether police departments change their behavior after Black Lives Matter protests take place, particularly in the first few months after the protest (before there has been time for legislative responses and policy change). We can imagine three different patterns of response from police departments (described in more detail in the pre-analysis plan): responsiveness, in which they make fewer discretionary arrests and possibly kill fewer civilians; backlash, in which they make more discretionary arrests and possibly kill more civilians; and work slowdown, in which they make fewer discretionary arrests and kill fewer civilians, but may also show reduced violent crime clearance. So in essence we are testing three composite hypotheses: police show a pattern of responsiveness to protest, police show a pattern of backlash in response to protest, or police show a pattern of work stoppage in response to protest. We will first run separate tests for each outcome variable (minor arrests, police killings of civilians, violent crime clearance rates) to see whether protests increase or decrease it, correcting for multiple testing.

A rich literature has sought to measure protest\u2019s long-run effectiveness in changing legislative outcomes (Gillion, 2012; Gause, 2016), policy (Andrews, 1997; Biggs and Andrews, 2015), and public opinion (Giugni, 1998; Huff and Kruszewska, 2016; Wasow, 2016; Enos, Kaufman and Sands, 2017). In this project, we seek to answer a shorter-term question: do protests directly change the behavior of street-level bureaucrats? Even before elected officials change laws and policies, do non-elected bureaucrats respond to protesters\u2019 demands? In this study, we focus on a particular type of street-level bureaucrats (police) and ask how their behavior changed after a particular set of protests (the Black Lives Matter protests that swept across the US in December 2014). We seek to test whether police behavior changed in the wake of local Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests. Specifically, we ask whether police became less likely to make discretionary arrests for minor crimes, which would align with protesters\u2019 demands, or whether they exhibited a \u201cbacklash\u201d response to protests and made more of these arrests. We also collect data on police killings of civilians, and on crime clearance rates, as discussed below. This research will yield a new understanding of both the impact of protest, and the behavior of street-level bureaucrats. If we find that police change their behavior to accord with protesters\u2019 concerns, this would suggest that protests can be effective in previously- unmeasured ways. If they do not react to protests, or if they instead show evidence of backlash, this would provide a cautionary tale to activists. It would also differentiate police from other unelected officials that have been shown to move with various measures of public opinion, such as judges (Giles, Blackstone and Vining, 2008) and social service workers (Weissert, 1994; Schram, College and Fording, 2007).", "q16": "We want to know whether police departments change their behavior after Black Lives Matter protests take place, particularly in the first few months after the protest (before there has been time for legislative responses and policy change). We can imagine three different patterns of response from police departments (described in more detail in the pre-analysis plan): responsiveness, in which they make fewer discretionary arrests and possibly kill fewer civilians; backlash, in which they make more discretionary arrests and possibly kill more civilians; and work slowdown, in which they make fewer discretionary arrests and kill fewer civilians, but may also show reduced violent crime clearance. So in essence we are testing three composite hypotheses: police show a pattern of responsiveness to protest, police show a pattern of backlash in response to protest, or police show a pattern of work stoppage in response to protest. We will first run separate tests for each outcome variable (minor arrests, police killings of civilians, violent crime clearance rates) to see whether protests increase or decrease it, correcting for multiple testing. Then we plan to use the NPC package in R (provided we're able to adapt it to our analysis) to test the composite hypotheses described in the prior paragraph.", "q17": "We will use a difference-in-differences design, comparing policing over time in cities that did and did not experience Black Lives Matter protests during December 2014 (after the non-indictment of the officer who killed Eric Garner).
