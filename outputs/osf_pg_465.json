In all of these places, clientelism\u2014the exchange of money, goods, or in-kind benefits for votes between politicians and individual voters \u2014was an important and prominent way of winning votes. Just like Americans and Britons, however, Brazilians do not vote the way they used to. Why do people who used to vote clientelistically stop voting on that basis? There is a tremendous amount of temporal and cross-sectional variation in the prevalence of clientelist voting and it largely reminds unexplained. The decline of clientelist voting is one of the more puzzling and persistent phenomena in the fields of democratization, political modernization, and political development, and it is my research question. I plan to use the Fulbright-Hays to gather qualitative data before, during, and after the 2016 mayoral and city council elections in Brazil so as to help answer this question in my dissertation. I am building a framework for analyzing and explaining the importance of clientelism as a determinant of vote choice. My primary unit of analysis is the individual voter and I use a multi-method approach with qualitative, cross-national survey, and experimental data. My argument is that increases in economic security lead to declines in clientelist voting, but only in the presence of certain systemic and individual-level factors that allow voters to easily identify non-clientelist candidates and distinguish them from one another. Most political science research on vote choice tends to be U.S.-centric and avoid even talking about clientelist voting, whereas the majority of clientelism research tends to overlook that it can coexist with other forms of voting. I take a synthetic approach, operating under the belief that clientelism needs to be treated like\u2014and measured alongside\u2014other common determinants of vote choice, such as policy, retrospective judgment, and candidate personality. Clientelist voting\u2019s importance varies by country, voter, and election; it is one explanatory variable among many. My dissertation will provide an integrated framework within which I can estimate the importance of various determinants of vote choice at once. I will use this framework to explain why clientelist voting decreases when it does. To answer this question, I will conduct a within-video-game experiment in which I embed virtual elections featuring clientelist and non-clientelist candidates within an immersive virtual world and manipulate in-game variables such as income to determine whether players experimental treatments of income\u2014impossible to do in the real world and impractical in a laboratory environment\u2014alone affect clientelist voting. I will also manipulate contextual variables such as numbers of candidates. I argue that increases in economic security are the main force behind declines in clientelist voting, not the sole determinant. Increases in economic security are not alone sufficient to cause declines in clientelist voting; they are only a necessary condition. Without sufficient economic security, voters care primarily about basic goods. For those without money, food, or access to the state, providing them can win their votes. Other concerns, such as policy or candidate personality, tend to become ancillary when confronted with needs that are so immediate. Politicians see this opportunity, and if they can offer these things in exchange for votes, they do. When these basic needs are met, however, voters begin to want other things, such as self-expression, political participation, and the ability to influence policy. Yet while I agree with extant research that a meaningful decrease in poverty is a necessary condition for a decline in clientelist voting, I deviate from it by claiming that decreases in poverty alone do not constitute a sufficient condition. This is because a decline in clientelist voting requires the presence of another factor: a viable alternative to clientelist politicians. Even if not particularly satisfied with a status quo of clientelist candidates, it is difficult for a voter to desire a non-clientelist candidate if such an option is not realistic. The demand side of the voting equation, in other words, is inextricably linked with the question of supply. Supply, in turn, depends upon a variety of factors at both the individual and the macro level. An individual voter must also the political knowledge and interest necessary to identify alternative candidates and distinguish them from one another. Some voters will have neither the willingness nor the capacity to carry out these functions even in elections with two candidates, whereas some (if not many) will be able to do so in races with thousands. The macro level also matters because it helps determine how many candidates participate in each race. If one cannot compare the ideological positions, proposals, and personal characteristics of each candidate with one another, she will not deviate from a status quo of clientelist voting. This is a tougher test than it might appear. Electoral systems, for instance, matter because voters only have the willingness and ability to absorb a certain amount of information about political candidates. There is a tangible difference between a voter\u2019s ability to understand the policy differences between two candidates and her ability to do so for a thousand.\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"H1: As an individual's income increases, her likelihood of voting clientelistically decreases.

This willingness to trade off will vary according to different issues that the representative is going to make decisions about. Specifically, majority of voters will tend to vote for the candidate who shares their view on a public good distribution, regardless of identity, when this is the only policy being considered, but they will vote for the shared-identity candidate who backs views opposite to theirs with respect to the public good policy when there is also a private good on the line. Post-survey questions will show that this is due to an expectation of in-group favoritism. The proportion of shared-identity members in a voter's constituency will affect voting along identity lines. Specifically, people will tend to vote more for shared-identity candidates--and are thus willing to make more policy trade-offs--when their identity is in the minority within the group. This should be correlated with a heightened emotional response, both in terms of higher cortisol levels and self-reports in the post-voting survey.

There will be a pre-survey just before the experiment which will establish policy preferences and covariate information, then subjects will be assigned roles as either candidates or voters and then voting will take place.", "q16": "\"Voters are willing to trade off voting for a candidate who backs their preferred public good policy in order to cast a ballot for a shared-identity candidate. This willingness will be decreasing in daily inter-ethnic interactions, education, ethnic pride (both self reported and objectively measured) and emotional response (tested as a separate outcome and also predicted to be decreasing in daily inter-ethnic interactions, education, and ethnic pride. This willingness to trade off will vary according to different issues that the representative is going to make decisions about. Specifically, majority of voters will tend to vote for the candidate who shares their view on a public good distribution, regardless of identity, when this is the only policy being considered, but they will vote for the shared-identity candidate who backs views opposite to theirs with respect to the public good policy when there is also a private good on the line. Post-survey questions will show that this is due to an expectation of in-group favoritism. The proportion of shared-identity members in a voter's constituency will affect voting along identity lines. Specifically, people will tend to vote more for shared-identity candidates--and are thus willing to make more policy trade-offs--when their identity is in the minority within the group. This should be correlated with a heightened emotional response, both in terms of higher cortisol levels and self-reports in the post-voting survey. Variation in voting decisions outlined above will be increased when candidates use campaign messages that directly reference/prime identity. Emotional arousal is heightened among voters who are faced with certain trade-offs, and positive emotional outcomes will be associated with voting for an identity-match. Certain covariates make individuals predisposed to heightened emotional responses when it comes to having to decide whether to vote along identity or policy lines (e.g. less exposed to daily inter-ethnic interactions more likely to have a heightened emotional response when faced with identity-match vs. policy-match decisions.).\"", "q17": "\"Subjects will be assigned to voting groups, such that subjects are defined by whether they have identity-match/policy-match with the two candidates presented to them before voting.

The classification of constituencies into \u201cmarginal\u201d and \u201csafe\u201d is based on the definition adopted by the British Election Study: a constituency is defined as \u201cmarginal\u201d if the winning party was 10% or less ahead of the second party in the previous (2010) general election, and is classified as \u201csafe\u201d otherwise.

To assess the contrasting influence of national, regional and local media on specific constituencies and subsets of the electorate. Previous media effects research does not account for local context. Our data on media coverage in context and over time, with linkage to Wave 4 of the British Election Study, will allow analysis of short- and medium-term effects, providing a fuller picture than hitherto both of the dynamics and, by virtue of asking more questions about media consumption, of the breadth of media effects. The experimental study is in fact part of a broader project seeking to develop a model of information flows in the campaign and post-election periods, developing a model that accounts for the amount, dynamics and interactive relationships of information provision during the campaign and post-election periods, i.e., what drives the issue attention cycle in traditional and social media during the contemporary campaign.\"", "q16": "\"1) Agenda setting and priming effects associated with the ideological orientation of different media outlets influence subjects' political attitudes and behavior, as well as their dynamics. 2) Specific media content will affect different political attitudes and behavior (i.e., likelihood of voting and vote choice, perceived legitimacy of the electoral outcome, opinions about the nature and composition of coalition governments). 3) The impact of media exposure will be contingent on the competitiveness of the local race - i.e., it will vary between \"\"safe\"\" and \"\"marginal\"\" constituencies. \"", "q17": "\"An online field experiment using a novel research design will be conducted in order to examine causal linkages between media exposure, information seeking, and attitudes in constituencies with varying contexts.

The classification of constituencies into \u201cmarginal\u201d and \u201csafe\u201d is based on the definition adopted by the British Election Study: a constituency is defined as \u201cmarginal\u201d if the winning party was 10% or less ahead of the second party in the previous (2010) general election, and is classified as \u201csafe\u201d otherwise.

face-to-face and telephone surveys can vary depending on the race or gender of the interviewer (Davis, 1997; Davis & Silver, 2003; Hatchett & Schuman, 1975; Cotter et al., 1982; Reese et al., 1986; Huddy et al., 1997). This variation means that the inferences researchers draw and the replicability of the study can depend on who runs the study. Regardless of whether the relationship between characteristics of the interviewer and the observed variation in responses is perceived to be a benefit 1 or a threat, 2 it is useful for researchers to be cognizant of the circumstances in which we might expect this relationship to be most likely to occur. For example, it is often suggested that responses in online surveys are less likely to be affected by attributes of the researcher than in other survey methods. In this paper we explore how attributes of the researcher affect responses in online surveys. In particular, we use a survey experiment that explicitly manipulates the race and gender cued by the researcher name on the informed consent page. The informed consent page is generally required by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of research universities to be displayed at the start of every internet-based survey. Manipulating the researcher name allows us to test how information conveyed about the race and gender of the researcher through the informed consent page affects survey responses. We focus on gender and race because these two factors can be clearly conveyed through names (Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2004; Milkman et al., 2012), and have been central to the existing literature on surveys and identity. The experiment is a 2x2 factorial design, where the first factor is the putative gender of the investigator (male or female) and the second is the investigator\u2019s putative race (white or black)."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1 : Assignment to an investigator name that is commonly perceived to be female/black will increase reported support for policies that provide for and protect the rights of women/blacks, and decreases responses that indicate prejudice against these groups. H2 : Attention and effort will be greatest among subjects assigned to a putatively white, male investigator."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "Study 1: For Hypothesis 1, we estimate two separate treatment effects. The first is the effect of assignment to a putatively female name on the probability that a respondent indicates that they believe that women should have an equal role in the workforce. The second is the effect of assignment to a putatively black name on the respondent\u2019s racial resentment scale. We expect that the effect for the former will be positive while the latter will be negative. For Hypothesis 2, we will estimate the effect of assignment to a putatively white and male name on the probability that a respondent correctly completes both of the attention check assignments. We expect this effect estimate to be positive. For estimation, we will fit a linear probability model of the outcome on treatment and compute standard errors via a nonparametric bootstrapping procedure. While not needed for identification, we will include respondent-level covariates (e.g. gender, income, education) in the regression model in order to increase the efficiency of our estimator. Because respondents have the option to stop taking the survey after treatment is assigned, there is concern that an analysis conditional on survey completion will be biased for the average treatment effect if treatment also affects the probability that a respondent will drop out. To obtain unbiased treatment effect estimates in this situation, we adopt an estimation strategy similar to that of Rotnitzky & Robins (1995) and weight each respondent observation in the outcome regression by its estimated probability of not dropping out of the sample. We estimate this probability via a logistic regression of completion on treatment using the entire set of respondents (those that both completed and did not complete the survey). Our rejection levels for two-sided hypothesis tests of whether the average treatment effects differ from zero are calibrated to correct for problems of multiple testing. We are willing to tolerate an overall Type I error rate of \u03b1 = .05. With three main hypothesis tests, we could obtain a conservative rejection threshold for each individual hypothesis test of .05/3 = .017 using the Bonferroni correction. This controls the Familywise Type I Error Rate and guarantees that the probability of any single erroneous rejection in the set of tests is less than or equal to .05. However, this approach sacrifices a significant amount of power. A less conservative but more powerful approach is to set a rejection threshold to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR). We use the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to set a rejection level for the hypothesis tests (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995). This entails a two-step procedure where we order the 3 p-values of the individual hypothesis tests from smallest to largest, p (1) , ..., p (3) and then set our rejection level to p (k) , where k is the largest value of i that satisfies p (i) \u2264 3 i \u03b1. This procedure controls the expected share of false hypothesis rejections out of the total number of rejections to be no greater than .05. We do not specify any ex-ante interactions of the treatment effects with baseline covari- ates. However, because the mechanism through which any treatment effects operate are of significant interest, we will conduct exploratory analyses of potential treatment effect hetero- geneity by estimating models with interactions between treatment and respondent identity variables. Among other interactions, we are interested in seeing whether any average treat- ment effect is primarily driven by behavior changes among men (in the case of the gender treatment) and white respondents (in the case of the race treatment). We will attempt to replicate any promising results from these exploratory analyses in a follow-up experiment that explicitly registers interactive hypotheses prior to the experiment. In this preregistration plan, we outline an experiment that tests whether or not investigator characteristics have an effect on subjects responses and subject effort. This design permits direct tests of these hypotheses. In addition to these primary hypothesis tests, we hope to conduct an exploratory analyses of heterogeneous treatment effects, which will serve as the basis for a second experiment to test the mechanisms that we hope to identify in the experiment laid out in this plan. The second experiment will be preregistered separately, given that its design depends on the results of the experiment outlined here. Study 2: For Hypothesis 1, we estimate two separate treatment effects. 3 The first is the effect of assignment to a putatively female name on the probability that a respondent indicates that they believe that women should have an equal role in the workforce. The second is the effect of assignment to a putatively black name on the respondent\u2019s racial resentment scale. We expect that the effect for the former will be positive while the latter will be negative. For Hypothesis 2, we will estimate the effect of assignment to a putatively white and male name on the probability that a respondent correctly completes both of the attention check assignments. We expect this effect estimate to be positive. For estimation, we will fit a linear probability model of the outcome on treatment and compute standard errors via a nonparametric bootstrapping procedure. While not needed for identification, we will include respondent-level covariates (e.g. gender, income, education) in the regression model in order to increase the efficiency of our estimator. Our rejection levels for two-sided hypothesis tests of whether the average treatment effects differ from zero are calibrated to correct for problems of multiple testing. We are willing to tolerate an overall Type I error rate of \u03b1 = .05. With three main hypothesis tests, we could obtain a conservative rejection threshold for each individual hypothesis test of .05/3 = .017 using the Bonferroni correction. This controls the Familywise Type I Error Rate and guarantees that the probability of any single erroneous rejection in the set of tests is less than or equal to .05. However, this approach sacrifices a significant amount of power. A less conservative but more powerful approach is to set a rejection threshold to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR). We use the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to set a rejection level for the hypothesis tests (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995). This entails a two-step procedure where we order the 3 p-values of the individual hypothesis tests from smallest to largest, p (1) , ..., p (3) and then set our rejection level to p (k) , where k is the largest value of i that satisfies p (i) \u2264 3 i \u03b1. This procedure controls the expected share of false hypothesis rejections out of the total number of rejections to be no greater than .05. We do not specify any ex-ante interactions of the treatment effects with baseline covariates. However, because the mechanism through which any treatment effects operate are of significant interest, we will conduct exploratory analyses of potential treatment effect heterogeneity by estimating models with interactions between treatment and respondent identity variables. Among other interactions, we are interested in seeing whether any average treat- ment effect is primarily driven by behavior changes among men (in the case of the gender treatment) and white respondents (in the case of the race treatment). We will attempt to replicate any promising results from these exploratory analyses in a follow-up experiment that explicitly registers interactive hypotheses prior to the experiment. Additionally, because respondents have the option to stop taking the survey after treat- ment is assigned but before outcomes are measured, there is concern that an analysis conditional on survey completion will be biased for the average treatment effect if treatment also affects the probability that a respondent will drop out. Although it is not possible to adjust for nonignorable drop-out in the absence of prior covariates on respondents, we will examine whether there appears to be systematic differences between treatment arms with respect to attrition and employ sensitivity analyses in the vein of Scharfstein et al.

This variation means that the inferences researchers draw and the replicability of the study can depend on who runs the study. Regardless of whether the relationship between characteristics of the interviewer and the observed variation in responses is perceived to be a benefit 1 or a threat, 2 it is useful for researchers to be cognizant of the circumstances in which we might expect this relationship to be most likely to occur. For example, it is often suggested that responses in online surveys are less likely to be affected by attributes of the researcher than in other survey methods. In this paper we explore how attributes of the researcher affect responses in online surveys. In particular, we use a survey experiment that explicitly manipulates the race and gender cued by the researcher name on the informed consent page. The informed consent page is generally required by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of research universities to be displayed at the start of every internet-based survey. Manipulating the researcher name allows us to test how information conveyed about the race and gender of the researcher through the informed consent page affects survey responses. We focus on gender and race because these two factors can be clearly conveyed through names (Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2004; Milkman et al., 2012), and have been central to the existing literature on surveys and identity. The experiment is a 2x2 factorial design, where the first factor is the putative gender of the investigator (male or female) and the second is the investigator\u2019s putative race (white or black).", "q16": "H1 : Assignment to an investigator name that is commonly perceived to be female/black will increase reported support for policies that provide for and protect the rights of women/blacks, and decreases responses that indicate prejudice against these groups. H2 : Attention and effort will be greatest among subjects assigned to a putatively white, male investigator.", "q17": "Study 1: For Hypothesis 1, we estimate two separate treatment effects. The first is the effect of assignment to a putatively female name on the probability that a respondent indicates that they believe that women should have an equal role in the workforce. The second is the effect of assignment to a putatively black name on the respondent\u2019s racial resentment scale. We expect that the effect for the former will be positive while the latter will be negative. For Hypothesis 2, we will estimate the effect of assignment to a putatively white and male name on the probability that a respondent correctly completes both of the attention check assignments. We expect this effect estimate to be positive.

Because respondents have the option to stop taking the survey after treatment is assigned, there is concern that an analysis conditional on survey completion will be biased for the average treatment effect if treatment also affects the probability that a respondent will drop out. To obtain unbiased treatment effect estimates in this situation, we adopt an estimation strategy similar to that of Rotnitzky & Robins (1995) and weight each respondent observation in the outcome regression by its estimated probability of not dropping out of the sample. We estimate this probability via a logistic regression of completion on treatment using the entire set of respondents (those that both completed and did not complete the survey). Our rejection levels for two-sided hypothesis tests of whether the average treatment effects differ from zero are calibrated to correct for problems of multiple testing. We are willing to tolerate an overall Type I error rate of \u03b1 = .05.

We do not specify any ex-ante interactions of the treatment effects with baseline covari- ates.

Among other interactions, we are interested in seeing whether any average treat- ment effect is primarily driven by behavior changes among men (in the case of the gender treatment) and white respondents (in the case of the race treatment). We will attempt to replicate any promising results from these exploratory analyses in a follow-up experiment that explicitly registers interactive hypotheses prior to the experiment. In this preregistration plan, we outline an experiment that tests whether or not investigator characteristics have an effect on subjects responses and subject effort. This design permits direct tests of these hypotheses. In addition to these primary hypothesis tests, we hope to conduct an exploratory analyses of heterogeneous treatment effects, which will serve as the basis for a second experiment to test the mechanisms that we hope to identify in the experiment laid out in this plan. The second experiment will be preregistered separately, given that its design depends on the results of the experiment outlined here. Study 2: For Hypothesis 1, we estimate two separate treatment effects. 3 The first is the effect of assignment to a putatively female name on the probability that a respondent indicates that they believe that women should have an equal role in the workforce.
