"Yes"}, "q15": {"extra": [], "value": "\"One of the most important welfare-preserving functions that government officials, international organizations, and other governance actors can perform is the provision of information about possible dangers and threats to citizens. Such information can be used by citizens to take actions to protect themselves from such dangers, and possibly to support policies that would help to mitigate the consequences of those risks. Because public officials generally cannot provide individualized assessments of risk, they are routinely faced with a fundamental choice: present information that suggests that risks are universal across all individuals in the community, or make key distinctions about the relative risks across particular groups. The latter is often a preferred strategy among public health officials in particular because it is thought to lead to more efficient targeting of prevention modalities to the subsets of the population where the problem is most prevalent. In our research, we raise the question of whether it is always a good idea to communicate risks in terms of group differences, particularly if the goal is to raise the perception of risk among the most vulnerable groups, and to get members of those groups to take actions to mitigate those dangers, and to support related public policies. Our concerns are rooted in a theoretical appreciation for the social construction of risk perception, and the powerful implications of intergroup conflict: Although many everyday dangers are well understood by local experts and policy-makers, a long line of research has demonstrated quite convincingly that how individuals perceive risks is far from straightforward: risk perception is not merely a function of cold, hard facts concerning the prevalence of certain dangers within a population. An obvious example is the extent to which many individuals fear flying because of the associated dangers, but express little fear -- presumably perceiving less intense risks of danger -- \u00acwhen it comes to driving an automobile, a far more dangerous activity. As several scholars have convincingly explained, perceptions of and responses to \u201cobjective\u201d dangers tend to deviate from economic notions of expected utility (Kahneman and Tversky 1979; Douglas 1992; Slovic 1999; Slovic et. al. 2004). And Nathanson (1996: 611) goes on to argue that, \u201cadoption and implementation of public health policies require culturally credible constructions of risk to the public\u2019s health.\u201d Along these lines, we raise the possibility that group-differentiated messages about particular dangers might actually have unintended consequences leading to risk denialism. We raise this concern based on a recognition that intergroup relations may strongly affect individual risk perceptions, particularly when a given danger carries negative social connotations -- i.e., some form of social stigma. Theoretically, we draw on a series of insights from social psychology (i.e. Tajfel 1971; Brewer, 2007; Dunham 2011), which emphasize the consequences of intergroup conflict for cognitions and behavior. Of particular relevance for our purposes is the consistent finding associated with social identity theory (SIT) that individuals will use group heuristics to interpret new information, which in turn biases how they process information, and their associated attitudes and behaviors. Moreover, individuals strive to develop and to maintain a positive self-image and they will use and protect their group identity to that end (Tajfel and Turner 1986). While usually discussed in terms of \u201cself-enhancing\u201d effects such as preferring the ingroup, the same broad motivation should also lead group members to downplay or to deny information that paints their group in a negative light, for example by impugning its reliability or simply not attending to it as fully. Specifically, if information about a given danger is presented in a group-differentiated manner, and has been framed (explicitly, or through previous socialization) as a stigmatized condition, individual members of the group identified as being at higher risk are likely to engage in efforts to distance themselves from the threatening portrayal of their group, and thereby protect themselves from the stigmatizing information. Two primary strategies are available: To distance themselves from the group itself, i.e. to disidentify, or to discredit the threatening information, i.e., to engage in denialism. In the case of salient, personally meaningful social identities such as those connected with race and ethnicity, disidentification will often not be an available strategy. Thus, we anticipate that denialism will be the more common response to this kind of identity threat. Following the same logic, we expect that members of the group identified as being at lower risk of a stigmatized condition (and particularly those individuals who strongly identify with the group), are likely to more positively assess the reliability of the framing information precisely because it deflects the stigmatized risk away from their own group. This also can be interpreted in terms of identity maintenance, in that it also corresponds to perceiving their own risks as being very low.\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"Hypotheses: Based on this theoretical set-up, our hypotheses pertain to subject populations in which three key conditions hold: there exist identifiable groups within the subject population who engage in a degree of intergroup conflict; there exists a substantial danger that is stigmatized; and there exists credible data suggesting that the danger is more prevalent in one group as compared with the other -- and we subsequently refer to those groups respectively as high-danger (HD) and low-danger (LD). Such conditions are routinely met in the real world, and as we will discuss, we take up a real-world problem, but future research could induce such conditions in an experimental context. Primarily, our research seeks to test the three-way interaction between group identity, the framing of the danger in terms of group heuristics, and the framing of the danger as a stigmatized condition, and as such, we consider 4 different treatments arms being applied to two different groups, for a total of eight treatment conditions: 1: Low Danger group, Control, Control 2: Low Danger group, Group frame, Control 3: Low Danger group, Control, Stigma frame 4: Low Danger group, Group frame, Stigma frame 5: High Danger group, Control, Control 6: High Danger group, Group frame, Control 7: High Danger group, Control, Stigma frame 8: High Danger group, Group frame, Stigma frame And we hypothesize the following under ceteris paribus conditions:\u2003 \u2022 H1: The simple Group heuristic hypothesis: Group-differentiated information will cause individuals to adjust their risk perceptions in line with group membership in the absence of stigmatization. LD's should decrease and HD's should increase their risk perception in the case of group-differentiated information. o H1a: For measures of risk perception and related measures of policy support and risk-reducing behaviors: 2 < 1 o H1b: For measures of risk perception and related measures of policy support and risk-reducing behaviors: 6 > 5. \u2022 H2: The Denialism hypothesis: When high danger groups are treated with both the stigma-frame and group-differentiated information, we expect to see various manifestations of denialism: o H2a: In the context of the stigma frame, we should see the introduction of group-differentiated information lead to a decrease in risk perception (denialism) among members of the HD group: 8 < 7. o H2b: Along these lines, we will also observe lower trust in government data: 8 < 7. o H2c: And in terms of attitudes towards people who are actually afflicted with the particular dangerous condition, we expect greater reporting of feelings of shame: 8>7 and less sympathy 8> (8 - 7) o We do not expect stigma to be particularly important as a factor that conditions the effects of race framing on risk perceptions, policy priorities, or actions among the low danger group. To be clear, we view H2 as our principle research hypotheses and H1 and H3 as auxiliary hypotheses.\""}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "\"Research Design The claims we advance here are general theoretical claims about groups, information and risk-related cognitions and behaviors. We eventually aim to test this generality with fully experimental conditions, in which we assign \"\"minimal group\"\" identities to participants, and similarly assign various types of information about (fictitious) risks, including the stigma associated with such risks. However, given the likely challenges of credibly assigning groups and risks, and the desire to interface with pressing health and policy concerns, we propose to begin our research with experimental research on risk perception of HIV and AIDS in the American context, with White and African-American subjects as the (LD) and (HD) groups as described above. Indeed, Lieberman's (2009) research and theorizing on AIDS in the developing country context is a key motivation for this study, having found that polities characterized by strong ethnic or racial boundaries were less likely to respond aggressively to the AIDS epidemic because dynamics of inter-group competition would induce HD leaders and members to deny the risk of association with the stigmatized condition, while LD counter-parts would be more likely to fully disassociate themselves from the disease. This research aims to more rigorously test the psychological micro-foundations of such propositions with experimental control. We are far from the first to suggest links between HIV risk perception and minority status. From the first decade of the AIDS epidemic, even the most casual observers would point out that individuals have tended to highlight that HIV and/or AIDS was someone \"\"else's\"\" problem. A common refrain in the United States was that AIDS was a problem for the \"\"4-H club: Haitians, Heroine users, Homosexuals, and Hemophiliacs\"\" (Sontag 1990; others). Scholars have already established that in the domain of HIV/AIDS, institutional mistrust is related to increased risk behavior and decreased likelihood of HIV testing, especially in ethnic minorities (Hoyt et al., 2012), and conspiracy beliefs related to HIV/AIDS are more pronounced in racial and ethnic minorities (Ross, Essian, & Torres, 2006). In particular, when information about the risks of a stigmatized condition are targeted towards a particular group in the context of strong intergroup competition or status disparities, impulses to preserve the moral or social status of the targeted group will lead members of that group to deny those risks. The extent of race-based health disparities in the United States is well known. Particularly with respect to HIV, disease prevalence is estimated to be several times higher among African-American adults as compared with white adults. Moreover, at least in part because of its association with various non-normative behaviors, including homosexual intercourse, sexual activity with multiple partners, and intravenous drug use, AIDS has remained a \u201cstigmatized\u201d (Parker and Aggleton 2003) condition. In the face of such disparities, various organizations have sought to target African-Americans with campaigns highlighting the disproportionate AIDS burden in their community. Our research raises the possibility that this is a counter-productive policy strategy. By emphasizing that a stigmatized problem is more prevalent among a particular group, we believe that such campaigns may exacerbate threats to group pride, stimulating a tendency towards denialism. This effect might be particularly pronounced when the group in question has been more generally stigmatized or discriminated against, such that trust of institutional messages might already be more fragile. Initially, we aim to test our theory of social identity and social risk through a web-based survey experiment, in which we treat randomly assigned sub-groups of white and African-American subjects with alternate informational frames: the group-based distribution of HIV burden; and the stigmatization of the disease. These are both informational \"\"frames\"\" because amidst the vast quantity of facts that one might know or learn about a particular problem, and specifically, the problem of the danger of becoming infected with HIV, these are two perceived realities that media-brokers may or may not choose to emphasize. (As such, they are emphasis-frames, not equivalency frames, according to Chong and Druckman.) Both frames have been commonly available in popular discourse and in the media. Crucially, our research depends on our ability to, at least temporarily, affect how individuals come to understand the dangers associated with the risk of HIV infection. If they already hold firm views about these two dimensions, which cannot be even temporarily manipulated, we will not be able to identify the hypothesized treatment effects. Experimental protocol, treatment, and measurement Recruitment: We employ a nationally representative sample of 1,000 Americans, comprised of 500 whites and 500 African Americans. Qualtrics, on our behalf, recruits subjects and compensates their participation through a proprietary points system an amount roughly equal to $.50. Set-up: Respondents are instructed that they will be completing a survey on \"\"Priorities in American Health Care.\"\" They are told the following: Health care in America is an important political issue. Citizens hold many different opinions about which health problems should receive the most attention from government. In this survey, we ask you to share your views about what government should do. We are interested in your opinions and personal views. Initially, respondents are shown a graphic about pancreatic cancer, which we use to verify that responses to AIDS were not conditioned on the reference/comparison disease condition (i.e. for a slight improvement in external validity). Measurement of baseline risk perceptions: In order to estimate treatment effects, we attempt to measure baseline perceptions of risk in such a way as to minimize respondents' awareness of our particular focus on HIV and AIDS. (We do this immediately after the start screen, before the presentation of the information on cancer, as described above.) We ask, \"\"How much of a concern do you think each of the following health and medical problems should be for the future development of the American health care system?\"\" and we offer a sliding response scale with anchors of \"\"Not a concern\"\"; \"\"Minor concern\"\"; \"\"Substantial concern\"\"; \"\"Important concern\"\"; and \"\"Critical concern.\"\" Respondents are asked to select a level of concern for each of the following: Asthma, Cancer, Poor hearing/Deafness, Diabetes, HIV and AIDS, Influenza, Obesity, Poor vision/Blindness.\"\" Based on this list, we can identify a baseline concern with HIV and AIDS, and also an average baseline concern for all health risks. Presentation of Health Risks: The next screen says: We will now provide you with information about two (2) selected health concerns. Please read this information carefully. We will then ask you a series of questions about this information, as well as how these problems are likely to affect you and what you think government should do to address them. Clicking to the next screen, they are presented with a page with the heading \"\"CANCER,\"\" and the respondent reads three paragraphs about pancreatic cancer. When the respondent is done reading, the survey presents an attention check (describe below). Treatment: At this point in the survey, all respondents are shown a page entitled HIV and AIDS, and all received the following first two paragraphs: The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which leaves individuals susceptible to opportunistic infections and tumors. Almost every 10 minutes, an American is infected with HIV. However, according to the four randomly-assigned treatment arms, the page varies in the following manner: CONTROL: NO STIGMA OR RACE FRAMES \u2022 Header Graphic on left: Hand, which says \"\"Stop AIDS in America\"\" \u2022 Header Graphic on right: Red ribbon \u2022 Additional text: None RACE FRAME ONLY \u2022 Header Graphic on left: Hand, which says \"\"Stop AIDS in Black America\"\" \u2022 Header Graphic on right: Red ribbon \u2022 Additional text: Currently, African-Americans have substantially higher rates of HIV infection than white Americans or other racial or ethnic groups in the United States. African-Americans accounted for an estimated 44% of all new HIV infections among adults and adolescents in 2010, despite representing less than 15% of the US population. STIGMA FRAME ONLY \u2022 Header Graphic on left: Hand, which says \"\"Stop AIDS in America\"\" \u2022 Header Graphic on right: Red ribbon faded with text, \"\"Treated as if AIDS was their FAULT and ... DENIED admission...\"\" \u2022 Additional text: Throughout the history of the AIDS epidemic, people with HIV or AIDS have been treated as if the disease was their fault, the result of bad behavior and bad choices. They have frequently been denied admission to schools, clubs, and foreign countries. INTERACTION: RACE AND STIGMA FRAMES \u2022 Header Graphic on left: Hand, which says \"\"Stop AIDS in Black America\"\" \u2022 Header Graphic on right: Red ribbon faded with text, \"\"Treated as if AIDS was their FAULT and ... DENIED admission...\"\" \u2022 Additional text: Throughout the history of the AIDS epidemic, people with HIV or AIDS have been treated as if the disease was their fault, the result of bad behavior and bad choices. They have frequently been denied admission to schools, clubs, and foreign countries. Currently, African-Americans have substantially higher rates of HIV infection than white Americans or other racial or ethnic groups in the United States. African-Americans accounted for an estimated 44% of all new HIV infections among adults and adolescents in 2010, despite representing less than 15% of the US population. Measurement of post-treatment risk perceptions and policy priorities: Following receipt of the treatment, respondents are asked various questions about how they perceive risks of being infected with cancer and AIDS. They are asked on two successive pages, respectively entitled CANCER and AIDS, \"\"What is the likelihood that the following will be newly afflicted with CANCER [AIDS] in the next five years? (That is, do not include individuals who already suffer from this disease.)\"\" and respondents are asked to move a slider across a scale that reports to us a quantity from 0 to 100. Respondents do not see the number reported, but rather, they see 7 evenly spaced qualitative anchors, ranging from \"\"No chance,\"\" to \"\"Extremely High.\"\" They are required to move a slider for each of the following: \"\"You personally,\"\" \"\"Any member of your family,\"\" \"\"Any close friend,\"\" \"\"Anyone you know personally\"\" Beyond specific questions about risk, we also ask respondents their views on public policy, under the assumption that answer about policy will be a linear function of risk perceptions. First, we ask, If you had a say in making up the federal budget this year, should federal spending on each kind of research be decreased, kept about the same, or increased? And for each of \"\"Cancer Research,\"\" and \"\"AIDS research,\"\" respondents are asked to provide a response to a 5-point Likert scale ranging from substantially decreased to substantially increased. Then, we attempt to cross-validate responses to this question by asking respondents to allocate the government's health budget between cancer and AIDS: \"\"Imagine you have the opportunity to discuss with your senator how he/she should allocate a portion of the health budget to just these two problems. Assuming that overall effectiveness of prevention methods and treatments are similar on a dollar for dollar basis, how should health spending be allocated? (Total must equal 100%)\"\" Finally, we attempt to capture a behavioral response to our treatment at the conclusion of the study by offering respondents the opportunity to conduct more research on their own about HIV and AIDS. The survey states, We have no more questions for you, but we would like to provide you an opportunity to learn more about cancer and AIDS. Below are some leading organizations and charities related to AIDS. If you click on any link or picture below, the link will open in a new browser tab. When you are done, please continue to the next screen by clicking the arrows below. First for cancer, and then for AIDS, we provide screenshots of three disease-related websites and links. For AIDS, we provide links to AIDS Info, Test Positive Aware Network, and the American Foundation for AIDS research. Our web survey will allow us to see if the respondent clicks on 0-3 of the links, and how much time the individual spent, presumably looking at the websites, just prior to concluding the survey. Group attachment: We ask, How strongly do you feel you identify with the following groups? And then we provide sliders for each of the following: African-Americans, Democrats, Old People, Poor People Republicans, Rich People, Whites, Young People, and the respondent must move each slider to a point on a continuum that is anchored by text, \"\"Not at all,\"\" \"\"Not very closely,\"\" \"\"Somewhat closely,\"\" and \"\"Very closely.\"\" We capture their slider position on a 0-100 scale. Respondent attention / validity: To try to correct for the possibility that some respondents may be primarily motivated by the monetary compensation for participation and might not carefully take the survey, we have taken a number of measures to ensure the validity of responses. For example, we inserted timers on the survey pages so we can track how long respondents spend on each page. This allows us the possibility to eliminate respondents who spend an unusually short time on each page, suggesting they did not read the questions but merely selected answers at random. We will also look for conflicting answers to potentially identify problematic respondents, for example, if someone indicates on the battery of personality questions that they identified as \"\"reserved, quiet\"\" and later as \"\"extroverted, enthusiastic.\"\" After the presentation of the information on the CANCER page, we ask a question, which type of cancer was discussed on the previous page, and the respondent must pick from four choices. If the answer is not correct, the respondent is returned to the original cancer page to try again. This should have the effect of ensuring that the respondent will pay greater attention to the rest of the survey, particularly to the next page, when the framing treatments are administered. Additional covariates: Apart from the conditions discussed above, at this point we do not advance any further propositions about potential heterogeneous treatment effects, and we assume that with randomization, the distribution of potentially influential traits and attitudes will be largely identical across treated and control groups. Collecting data on covariates will allow us to test this assumption of balance, and possibly to conduct exploratory data analysis should our experiment yield null findings. Of course, we will report these as ex post findings. Based on our questions above, we create several dependent variables: First, we create several \u201ccalibrated\u201d risk perception scores. That is, based on our post-treatment questions about risk perception, we calculate the differences between self-reported risk assessments for AIDS and for Cancer. We create four such variables: \u2022 Individual calibrated risk perception: responses to questions about \u201cyou\u201d \u2022 Family and friends risk perception: sum of responses to \"\"Any member of your family\"\" + \"\"Any close friend\"\" \u2022 Overall calibrated risk perception: sum of responses to questions pertaining to all of the above + \u201cAnyone you know personally.\u201d Trust in race-based information (as is) Trust in other group-based information (as is) Calibrated budget prioritization: (as is: already forces tradeoff) Calibrated expenditure prioritization: Difference between responses to expenditure questions on AIDS and Cancer Risk prevention behavior: \u2022 Time spent on AIDS websites \u2022 Number of clicks on AIDS websites Blocking: SSI maintains information about the racial identity of some, but not all, of the individuals in its panel. Moreover, in analysis of pilot data, we found that pre-treatment concern was a significant predictor of our outcome variables. Thus, we will stratify the sample in terms of the three racial categories (African-American, White, No Information) and the two categories for pre-treatment reported HIV risk (self reported scores 75.) Analyses: After verifying that randomization has generated balance on our covariates, we will compare difference-in-means across treatment groups by regressing each dependent variable on our eight treatment condition dummy variables. We will also replicate our analyses by conditioning on the covariates, which should provide more precise estimates of treatment effects. We will then proceed to test our hypotheses by generating bootstrapped estimates, with 95 percent confidence intervals, of the differences between various treatment and control conditions.\""}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q27": {"extra": [], "value": "SSI"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e3098abe71ef8008c18adc4", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/aeznm/providers/osfstorage/5e3098abe71ef8008c18adc4", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/aeznm/providers/osfstorage/5e3098abe71ef8008c18adc4", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/aeznm/providers/osfstorage/5e3098abe71ef8008c18adc4?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/aeznm/providers/osfstorage/5e3098abe71ef8008c18adc4"}, "attributes": {"etag": "c457b67457472faf16a627e2a08019b1ff2717e6369451dd1d4a8136670241f9", "kind": "file", "name": "20131211AA_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e3098abe71ef8008c18adc4", "size": 229589, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "6edcf843d53404c02d8b6fecd9c573fb", "sha256": "0254ac575e2c3610a4aac8f2595fbb47695246d5869d6a4a097ef70d302a3143"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 229589, "modified": "2020-01-28T20:25:15.703715+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "aeznm", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20131211AA_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-01-28T20:25:15+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "aeznm", "sha256": "0254ac575e2c3610a4aac8f2595fbb47695246d5869d6a4a097ef70d302a3143", "viewUrl": "/project/6tx42/files/osfstorage/5e3098b4e71ef8008c18adcf/", "selectedFileName": "20131211AA_PAP.pdf"}, {"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e3098b0af7593008fbde788", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/aeznm/providers/osfstorage/5e3098b0af7593008fbde788", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/aeznm/providers/osfstorage/5e3098b0af7593008fbde788", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/aeznm/providers/osfstorage/5e3098b0af7593008fbde788?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/aeznm/providers/osfstorage/5e3098b0af7593008fbde788"}, "attributes": {"etag": "30a16bc2319354187b233ccb73079079ca6b8af63b595c867401a4f7cfd8f20d", "kind": "file", "name": "20131211AA_PAPupdate_20140423.pdf", "path": "/5e3098b0af7593008fbde788", "size": 234519, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "395017ee31d09a924784feb8ff5c545e", "sha256": "74676544add698e5f373da71a80f1e51b03b84f5f5384a63152454bd5ea9945c"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 234519, "modified": "2020-01-28T20:25:20.774953+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "aeznm", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20131211AA_PAPupdate_20140423.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-01-28T20:25:20+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "aeznm", "sha256": "74676544add698e5f373da71a80f1e51b03b84f5f5384a63152454bd5ea9945c", "viewUrl": "/project/6tx42/files/osfstorage/5e3098b4e71ef8008c18adcd/", "selectedFileName": "20131211AA_PAPupdate_20140423.pdf"}], "value": "20131211AA_PAP.pdf, 20131211AA_PAPupdate_20140423.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": {}, "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Social Identity and Social Risk: Experimental Research on Race, Stigma, and HIV/AIDS in the United States", "q2": "Evan Lieberman | Yarrow Dunham", "q3": "20131211AA", "q4": "12/11/2013 - 17:09", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "", "q9": "", "q10": "", "q11": "", "q12": "", "q13": "", "q14": "", "q15": "\"One of the most important welfare-preserving functions that government officials, international organizations, and other governance actors can perform is the provision of information about possible dangers and threats to citizens. Such information can be used by citizens to take actions to protect themselves from such dangers, and possibly to support policies that would help to mitigate the consequences of those risks. Because public officials generally cannot provide individualized assessments of risk, they are routinely faced with a fundamental choice: present information that suggests that risks are universal across all individuals in the community, or make key distinctions about the relative risks across particular groups. The latter is often a preferred strategy among public health officials in particular because it is thought to lead to more efficient targeting of prevention modalities to the subsets of the population where the problem is most prevalent. In our research, we raise the question of whether it is always a good idea to communicate risks in terms of group differences, particularly if the goal is to raise the perception of risk among the most vulnerable groups, and to get members of those groups to take actions to mitigate those dangers, and to support related public policies. Our concerns are rooted in a theoretical appreciation for the social construction of risk perception, and the powerful implications of intergroup conflict: Although many everyday dangers are well understood by local experts and policy-makers, a long line of research has demonstrated quite convincingly that how individuals perceive risks is far from straightforward: risk perception is not merely a function of cold, hard facts concerning the prevalence of certain dangers within a population. An obvious example is the extent to which many individuals fear flying because of the associated dangers, but express little fear -- presumably perceiving less intense risks of danger -- \u00acwhen it comes to driving an automobile, a far more dangerous activity. As several scholars have convincingly explained, perceptions of and responses to \u201cobjective\u201d dangers tend to deviate from economic notions of expected utility (Kahneman and Tversky 1979; Douglas 1992; Slovic 1999; Slovic et. al. 2004). And Nathanson (1996: 611) goes on to argue that, \u201cadoption and implementation of public health policies require culturally credible constructions of risk to the public\u2019s health.\u201d Along these lines, we raise the possibility that group-differentiated messages about particular dangers might actually have unintended consequences leading to risk denialism. We raise this concern based on a recognition that intergroup relations may strongly affect individual risk perceptions, particularly when a given danger carries negative social connotations -- i.e., some form of social stigma. Theoretically, we draw on a series of insights from social psychology (i.e. Tajfel 1971; Brewer, 2007; Dunham 2011), which emphasize the consequences of intergroup conflict for cognitions and behavior. Of particular relevance for our purposes is the consistent finding associated with social identity theory (SIT) that individuals will use group heuristics to interpret new information, which in turn biases how they process information, and their associated attitudes and behaviors. Moreover, individuals strive to develop and to maintain a positive self-image and they will use and protect their group identity to that end (Tajfel and Turner 1986). While usually discussed in terms of \u201cself-enhancing\u201d effects such as preferring the ingroup, the same broad motivation should also lead group members to downplay or to deny information that paints their group in a negative light, for example by impugning its reliability or simply not attending to it as fully. Specifically, if information about a given danger is presented in a group-differentiated manner, and has been framed (explicitly, or through previous socialization) as a stigmatized condition, individual members of the group identified as being at higher risk are likely to engage in efforts to distance themselves from the threatening portrayal of their group, and thereby protect themselves from the stigmatizing information. Two primary strategies are available: To distance themselves from the group itself, i.e. to disidentify, or to discredit the threatening information, i.e., to engage in denialism. In the case of salient, personally meaningful social identities such as those connected with race and ethnicity, disidentification will often not be an available strategy. Thus, we anticipate that denialism will be the more common response to this kind of identity threat. Following the same logic, we expect that members of the group identified as being at lower risk of a stigmatized condition (and particularly those individuals who strongly identify with the group), are likely to more positively assess the reliability of the framing information precisely because it deflects the stigmatized risk away from their own group. This also can be interpreted in terms of identity maintenance, in that it also corresponds to perceiving their own risks as being very low.\"", "q16": "\"Hypotheses: Based on this theoretical set-up, our hypotheses pertain to subject populations in which three key conditions hold: there exist identifiable groups within the subject population who engage in a degree of intergroup conflict; there exists a substantial danger that is stigmatized; and there exists credible data suggesting that the danger is more prevalent in one group as compared with the other -- and we subsequently refer to those groups respectively as high-danger (HD) and low-danger (LD). Such conditions are routinely met in the real world, and as we will discuss, we take up a real-world problem, but future research could induce such conditions in an experimental context. Primarily, our research seeks to test the three-way interaction between group identity, the framing of the danger in terms of group heuristics, and the framing of the danger as a stigmatized condition, and as such, we consider 4 different treatments arms being applied to two different groups, for a total of eight treatment conditions: 1: Low Danger group, Control, Control 2: Low Danger group, Group frame, Control 3: Low Danger group, Control, Stigma frame 4: Low Danger group, Group frame, Stigma frame 5: High Danger group, Control, Control 6: High Danger group, Group frame, Control 7: High Danger group, Control, Stigma frame 8: High Danger group, Group frame, Stigma frame And we hypothesize the following under ceteris paribus conditions:\u2003 \u2022 H1: The simple Group heuristic hypothesis: Group-differentiated information will cause individuals to adjust their risk perceptions in line with group membership in the absence of stigmatization. LD's should decrease and HD's should increase their risk perception in the case of group-differentiated information. o H1a: For measures of risk perception and related measures of policy support and risk-reducing behaviors: 2 < 1 o H1b: For measures of risk perception and related measures of policy support and risk-reducing behaviors: 6 > 5. \u2022 H2: The Denialism hypothesis: When high danger groups are treated with both the stigma-frame and group-differentiated information, we expect to see various manifestations of denialism: o H2a: In the context of the stigma frame, we should see the introduction of group-differentiated information lead to a decrease in risk perception (denialism) among members of the HD group: 8 < 7. o H2b: Along these lines, we will also observe lower trust in government data: 8 < 7. o H2c: And in terms of attitudes towards people who are actually afflicted with the particular dangerous condition, we expect greater reporting of feelings of shame: 8>7 and less sympathy 8> (8 - 7) o We do not expect stigma to be particularly important as a factor that conditions the effects of race framing on risk perceptions, policy priorities, or actions among the low danger group. To be clear, we view H2 as our principle research hypotheses and H1 and H3 as auxiliary hypotheses.\"", "q17": "\"Research Design The claims we advance here are general theoretical claims about groups, information and risk-related cognitions and behaviors. We eventually aim to test this generality with fully experimental conditions, in which we assign \"\"minimal group\"\" identities to participants, and similarly assign various types of information about (fictitious) risks, including the stigma associated with such risks. However, given the likely challenges of credibly assigning groups and risks, and the desire to interface with pressing health and policy concerns, we propose to begin our research with experimental research on risk perception of HIV and AIDS in the American context, with White and African-American subjects as the (LD) and (HD) groups as described above. Indeed, Lieberman's (2009) research and theorizing on AIDS in the developing country context is a key motivation for this study, having found that polities characterized by strong ethnic or racial boundaries were less likely to respond aggressively to the AIDS epidemic because dynamics of inter-group competition would induce HD leaders and members to deny the risk of association with the stigmatized condition, while LD counter-parts would be more likely to fully disassociate themselves from the disease. This research aims to more rigorously test the psychological micro-foundations of such propositions with experimental control. We are far from the first to suggest links between HIV risk perception and minority status. From the first decade of the AIDS epidemic, even the most casual observers would point out that individuals have tended to highlight that HIV and/or AIDS was someone \"\"else's\"\" problem. A common refrain in the United States was that AIDS was a problem for the \"\"4-H club: Haitians, Heroine users, Homosexuals, and Hemophiliacs\"\" (Sontag 1990; others). Scholars have already established that in the domain of HIV/AIDS, institutional mistrust is related to increased risk behavior and decreased likelihood of HIV testing, especially in ethnic minorities (Hoyt et al., 2012), and conspiracy beliefs related to HIV/AIDS are more pronounced in racial and ethnic minorities (Ross, Essian, & Torres, 2006). In particular, when information about the risks of a stigmatized condition are targeted towards a particular group in the context of strong intergroup competition or status disparities, impulses to preserve the moral or social status of the targeted group will lead members of that group to deny those risks. The extent of race-based health disparities in the United States is well known. Particularly with respect to HIV, disease prevalence is estimated to be several times higher among African-American adults as compared with white adults. Moreover, at least in part because of its association with various non-normative behaviors, including homosexual intercourse, sexual activity with multiple partners, and intravenous drug use, AIDS has remained a \u201cstigmatized\u201d (Parker and Aggleton 2003) condition. In the face of such disparities, various organizations have sought to target African-Americans with campaigns highlighting the disproportionate AIDS burden in their community. Our research raises the possibility that this is a counter-productive policy strategy. By emphasizing that a stigmatized problem is more prevalent among a particular group, we believe that such campaigns may exacerbate threats to group pride, stimulating a tendency towards denialism. This effect might be particularly pronounced when the group in question has been more generally stigmatized or discriminated against, such that trust of institutional messages might already be more fragile. Initially, we aim to test our theory of social identity and social risk through a web-based survey experiment, in which we treat randomly assigned sub-groups of white and African-American subjects with alternate informational frames: the group-based distribution of HIV burden; and the stigmatization of the disease. These are both informational \"\"frames\"\" because amidst the vast quantity of facts that one might know or learn about a particular problem, and specifically, the problem of the danger of becoming infected with HIV, these are two perceived realities that media-brokers may or may not choose to emphasize. (As such, they are emphasis-frames, not equivalency frames, according to Chong and Druckman.) Both frames have been commonly available in popular discourse and in the media. Crucially, our research depends on our ability to, at least temporarily, affect how individuals come to understand the dangers associated with the risk of HIV infection. If they already hold firm views about these two dimensions, which cannot be even temporarily manipulated, we will not be able to identify the hypothesized treatment effects. Experimental protocol, treatment, and measurement Recruitment: We employ a nationally representative sample of 1,000 Americans, comprised of 500 whites and 500 African Americans. Qualtrics, on our behalf, recruits subjects and compensates their participation through a proprietary points system an amount roughly equal to $.50. Set-up: Respondents are instructed that they will be completing a survey on \"\"Priorities in American Health Care.\"\" They are told the following: Health care in America is an important political issue. Citizens hold many different opinions about which health problems should receive the most attention from government. In this survey, we ask you to share your views about what government should do. We are interested in your opinions and personal views. Initially, respondents are shown a graphic about pancreatic cancer, which we use to verify that responses to AIDS were not conditioned on the reference/comparison disease condition (i.e. for a slight improvement in external validity). Measurement of baseline risk perceptions: In order to estimate treatment effects, we attempt to measure baseline perceptions of risk in such a way as to minimize respondents' awareness of our particular focus on HIV and AIDS. (We do this immediately after the start screen, before the presentation of the information on cancer, as described above.) We ask, \"\"How much of a concern do you think each of the following health and medical problems should be for the future development of the American health care system?\"\" and we offer a sliding response scale with anchors of \"\"Not a concern\"\"; \"\"Minor concern\"\"; \"\"Substantial concern\"\"; \"\"Important concern\"\"; and \"\"Critical concern.\"\" Respondents are asked to select a level of concern for each of the following: Asthma, Cancer, Poor hearing/Deafness, Diabetes, HIV and AIDS, Influenza, Obesity, Poor vision/Blindness.\"\" Based on this list, we can identify a baseline concern with HIV and AIDS, and also an average baseline concern for all health risks. Presentation of Health Risks: The next screen says: We will now provide you with information about two (2) selected health concerns. Please read this information carefully. We will then ask you a series of questions about this information, as well as how these problems are likely to affect you and what you think government should do to address them. Clicking to the next screen, they are presented with a page with the heading \"\"CANCER,\"\" and the respondent reads three paragraphs about pancreatic cancer. When the respondent is done reading, the survey presents an attention check (describe below). Treatment: At this point in the survey, all respondents are shown a page entitled HIV and AIDS, and all received the following first two paragraphs: The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which leaves individuals susceptible to opportunistic infections and tumors. Almost every 10 minutes, an American is infected with HIV. However, according to the four randomly-assigned treatment arms, the page varies in the following manner: CONTROL: NO STIGMA OR RACE FRAMES \u2022 Header Graphic on left: Hand, which says \"\"Stop AIDS in America\"\" \u2022 Header Graphic on right: Red ribbon \u2022 Additional text: None RACE FRAME ONLY \u2022 Header Graphic on left: Hand, which says \"\"Stop AIDS in Black America\"\" \u2022 Header Graphic on right: Red ribbon \u2022 Additional text: Currently, African-Americans have substantially higher rates of HIV infection than white Americans or other racial or ethnic groups in the United States. African-Americans accounted for an estimated 44% of all new HIV infections among adults and adolescents in 2010, despite representing less than 15% of the US population. STIGMA FRAME ONLY \u2022 Header Graphic on left: Hand, which says \"\"Stop AIDS in America\"\" \u2022 Header Graphic on right: Red ribbon faded with text, \"\"Treated as if AIDS was their FAULT and ... DENIED admission...\"\" \u2022 Additional text: Throughout the history of the AIDS epidemic, people with HIV or AIDS have been treated as if the disease was their fault, the result of bad behavior and bad choices. They have frequently been denied admission to schools, clubs, and foreign countries. INTERACTION: RACE AND STIGMA FRAMES \u2022 Header Graphic on left: Hand, which says \"\"Stop AIDS in Black America\"\" \u2022 Header Graphic on right: Red ribbon faded with text, \"\"Treated as if AIDS was their FAULT and ... DENIED admission...\"\" \u2022 Additional text: Throughout the history of the AIDS epidemic, people with HIV or AIDS have been treated as if the disease was their fault, the result of bad behavior and bad choices. They have frequently been denied admission to schools, clubs, and foreign countries. Currently, African-Americans have substantially higher rates of HIV infection than white Americans or other racial or ethnic groups in the United States. African-Americans accounted for an estimated 44% of all new HIV infections among adults and adolescents in 2010, despite representing less than 15% of the US population. Measurement of post-treatment risk perceptions and policy priorities: Following receipt of the treatment, respondents are asked various questions about how they perceive risks of being infected with cancer and AIDS. They are asked on two successive pages, respectively entitled CANCER and AIDS, \"\"What is the likelihood that the following will be newly afflicted with CANCER [AIDS] in the next five years? (That is, do not include individuals who already suffer from this disease.)\"\" and respondents are asked to move a slider across a scale that reports to us a quantity from 0 to 100. Respondents do not see the number reported, but rather, they see 7 evenly spaced qualitative anchors, ranging from \"\"No chance,\"\" to \"\"Extremely High.\"\" They are required to move a slider for each of the following: \"\"You personally,\"\" \"\"Any member of your family,\"\" \"\"Any close friend,\"\" \"\"Anyone you know personally\"\" Beyond specific questions about risk, we also ask respondents their views on public policy, under the assumption that answer about policy will be a linear function of risk perceptions. First, we ask, If you had a say in making up the federal budget this year, should federal spending on each kind of research be decreased, kept about the same, or increased? And for each of \"\"Cancer Research,\"\" and \"\"AIDS research,\"\" respondents are asked to provide a response to a 5-point Likert scale ranging from substantially decreased to substantially increased. Then, we attempt to cross-validate responses to this question by asking respondents to allocate the government's health budget between cancer and AIDS: \"\"Imagine you have the opportunity to discuss with your senator how he/she should allocate a portion of the health budget to just these two problems. Assuming that overall effectiveness of prevention methods and treatments are similar on a dollar for dollar basis, how should health spending be allocated? (Total must equal 100%)\"\" Finally, we attempt to capture a behavioral response to our treatment at the conclusion of the study by offering respondents the opportunity to conduct more research on their own about HIV and AIDS. The survey states, We have no more questions for you, but we would like to provide you an opportunity to learn more about cancer and AIDS. Below are some leading organizations and charities related to AIDS. If you click on any link or picture below, the link will open in a new browser tab. When you are done, please continue to the next screen by clicking the arrows below. First for cancer, and then for AIDS, we provide screenshots of three disease-related websites and links. For AIDS, we provide links to AIDS Info, Test Positive Aware Network, and the American Foundation for AIDS research. Our web survey will allow us to see if the respondent clicks on 0-3 of the links, and how much time the individual spent, presumably looking at the websites, just prior to concluding the survey. Group attachment: We ask, How strongly do you feel you identify with the following groups? And then we provide sliders for each of the following: African-Americans, Democrats, Old People, Poor People Republicans, Rich People, Whites, Young People, and the respondent must move each slider to a point on a continuum that is anchored by text, \"\"Not at all,\"\" \"\"Not very closely,\"\" \"\"Somewhat closely,\"\" and \"\"Very closely.\"\" We capture their slider position on a 0-100 scale. Respondent attention / validity: To try to correct for the possibility that some respondents may be primarily motivated by the monetary compensation for participation and might not carefully take the survey, we have taken a number of measures to ensure the validity of responses. For example, we inserted timers on the survey pages so we can track how long respondents spend on each page. This allows us the possibility to eliminate respondents who spend an unusually short time on each page, suggesting they did not read the questions but merely selected answers at random. We will also look for conflicting answers to potentially identify problematic respondents, for example, if someone indicates on the battery of personality questions that they identified as \"\"reserved, quiet\"\" and later as \"\"extroverted, enthusiastic.\"\" After the presentation of the information on the CANCER page, we ask a question, which type of cancer was discussed on the previous page, and the respondent must pick from four choices. If the answer is not correct, the respondent is returned to the original cancer page to try again. This should have the effect of ensuring that the respondent will pay greater attention to the rest of the survey, particularly to the next page, when the framing treatments are administered. Additional covariates: Apart from the conditions discussed above, at this point we do not advance any further propositions about potential heterogeneous treatment effects, and we assume that with randomization, the distribution of potentially influential traits and attitudes will be largely identical across treated and control groups. Collecting data on covariates will allow us to test this assumption of balance, and possibly to conduct exploratory data analysis should our experiment yield null findings. Of course, we will report these as ex post findings. Based on our questions above, we create several dependent variables: First, we create several \u201ccalibrated\u201d risk perception scores. That is, based on our post-treatment questions about risk perception, we calculate the differences between self-reported risk assessments for AIDS and for Cancer. We create four such variables: \u2022 Individual calibrated risk perception: responses to questions about \u201cyou\u201d \u2022 Family and friends risk perception: sum of responses to \"\"Any member of your family\"\" + \"\"Any close friend\"\" \u2022 Overall calibrated risk perception: sum of responses to questions pertaining to all of the above + \u201cAnyone you know personally.\u201d Trust in race-based information (as is) Trust in other group-based information (as is) Calibrated budget prioritization: (as is: already forces tradeoff) Calibrated expenditure prioritization: Difference between responses to expenditure questions on AIDS and Cancer Risk prevention behavior: \u2022 Time spent on AIDS websites \u2022 Number of clicks on AIDS websites Blocking: SSI maintains information about the racial identity of some, but not all, of the individuals in its panel. Moreover, in analysis of pilot data, we found that pre-treatment concern was a significant predictor of our outcome variables. Thus, we will stratify the sample in terms of the three racial categories (African-American, White, No Information) and the two categories for pre-treatment reported HIV risk (self reported scores 75.) Analyses: After verifying that randomization has generated balance on our covariates, we will compare difference-in-means across treatment groups by regressing each dependent variable on our eight treatment condition dummy variables. We will also replicate our analyses by conditioning on the covariates, which should provide more precise estimates of treatment effects. We will then proceed to test our hypotheses by generating bootstrapped estimates, with 95 percent confidence intervals, of the differences between various treatment and control conditions.\"", "q18":

More information about the Supreme Court will cause respondents to say that the fact that the President nominates Justices will be an important factor in their decision for whom to vote for in 2016. This will vary according to respondent partisanship, with more extreme partisans being more likely to respond to the treatment conditions. This may also vary according to respondents' previous knowledge and according to respondents' attitudes on Court legitimacy (Gibson, Caldeira, Spence 2003) H2. Giving the respondents more information about the Supreme Court's workload will cause respondents to be more supportive of court packing plans (e.g., the expanding of the number of Justices on the Court). This will vary according to respondent partisanship, with more extreme partisans being more likely to respond to the treatment conditions. This may also vary according to respondents' previous knowledge and according to respondents' attitudes on Court legitimacy (Gibson, Caldeira, Spence 2003) H3. Certain characteristics (including party, age, religion, gender, race, educational background, and previous employment) will cause respondents to be more or less likely to support a potential Supreme Court candidate. Specifically, being female or being a racial/religious minority may be inversely related with candidate support, while being a co-partisan will be positively related with candidate support. These effects will interact with respondent race, gender, and partisanship, as well as with respondents' attitudes on the institutional legitimacy of the Supreme Court and their own previous knowledge. H4. Certain characteristics (including party, age, religion, gender, race, educational background, and previous employment) will cause respondents to be more or less likely to think that a decision reached by a Supreme Court Justice can be trusted. Specifically, a hypothetical Supreme Court Justice being female or being a racial/religious minority may be inversely related with feelings of trust, while being a co-partisan with the respondent will be positively related with feelings of trust. These effects will interact with respondent race, gender, and partisanship, as well as with respondents' attitudes on the institutional legitimacy of the Supreme Court and their own previous knowledge. These effects will be most pronounced within issue areas considered to be most political -- e.g., affirmative action, reproductive rights. H5. Respondents will support increased diversification of the courts, but only up until the point at which the courts are \"\"representative\"\" of the nation at large (e.g., the proportion of \"\"diverse\"\" judges corresponds to the actual percentage of African Americans, women, and Hispanics in the population at large). This will vary according to respondent race, gender, and partisanship, as well as with respondents' attitudes on the institutional legitimacy of the Supreme Court and their own previous knowledge. H6. More information about the current composition of the Courts will affect how important respondents think it will be to appointment a female, African American, Latino, Republican, or Democrat to the Supreme Court. Specifically, reminding respondents of the court's racial/gender composition will lead them to be more supportive of increased diversity, while reminding them of the court's partisanship composition will lead them to be more supportive of appointing someone who is more politically extreme. This will vary according to respondent race, gender, and partisanship, as well as with respondents' attitudes on the institutional legitimacy of the Supreme Court and their own previous knowledge.\""}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "\"The survey is a 15 minute long survey of 1500 U.S. adults, hosted online by Qualtrics and using a panel provided by Survey Sampling International. Different questions on the survey test different hypotheses. For all of the below, \"\"random assignment\"\" is done via the Qualtrics' randomizer. 1. H1 is tested by a survey question that randomly assigns respondents to one of several prompts manipulating the kind of information given to the respondent about what kinds of cases the Supreme Court hears. 2. H2 will be tested by a survey question that randomly exposes respondents to different kinds of information about the Supreme Court caseload, then asks them whether they would support Court packing. 3. H3 is tested by a series of six conjoint questions that present the respondent with a potential Supreme Court candidate, with the gender, race, age, previous professional experience, and partisanship randomly assigned. The respondent is then asked to rate how much they would support the candidate. 4. H4 is tested by a series of six conjoint questions that present the respondent with a potential issue area and then with a hypothetical judge with certain characteristics (gender, race, age, previous professional experience, and partisanship( randomly assigned. The respondent is then asked to rate how much they would trust the candidate to reach the correct decision. 5. H5 is tested by a series of four questions that manipulate the potential percentage of federal judges who are female, African American or Latino. After being presented with a potential percentage, then respondent is then asked if more or fewer women/blacks/Latinos should be nominated to the Courts. 6. H6 will be tested by a series of two questions that randomly assign respondents to either a prompt that informs them of the Court's current composition or a prompt that maintains silence.

More information about the Supreme Court will cause respondents to say that the fact that the President nominates Justices will be an important factor in their decision for whom to vote for in 2016. This will vary according to respondent partisanship, with more extreme partisans being more likely to respond to the treatment conditions. This may also vary according to respondents' previous knowledge and according to respondents' attitudes on Court legitimacy (Gibson, Caldeira, Spence 2003) H2. Giving the respondents more information about the Supreme Court's workload will cause respondents to be more supportive of court packing plans (e.g., the expanding of the number of Justices on the Court). This will vary according to respondent partisanship, with more extreme partisans being more likely to respond to the treatment conditions. This may also vary according to respondents' previous knowledge and according to respondents' attitudes on Court legitimacy (Gibson, Caldeira, Spence 2003) H3. Certain characteristics (including party, age, religion, gender, race, educational background, and previous employment) will cause respondents to be more or less likely to support a potential Supreme Court candidate. Specifically, being female or being a racial/religious minority may be inversely related with candidate support, while being a co-partisan will be positively related with candidate support. These effects will interact with respondent race, gender, and partisanship, as well as with respondents' attitudes on the institutional legitimacy of the Supreme Court and their own previous knowledge. H4. Certain characteristics (including party, age, religion, gender, race, educational background, and previous employment) will cause respondents to be more or less likely to think that a decision reached by a Supreme Court Justice can be trusted. Specifically, a hypothetical Supreme Court Justice being female or being a racial/religious minority may be inversely related with feelings of trust, while being a co-partisan with the respondent will be positively related with feelings of trust. These effects will interact with respondent race, gender, and partisanship, as well as with respondents' attitudes on the institutional legitimacy of the Supreme Court and their own previous knowledge. These effects will be most pronounced within issue areas considered to be most political -- e.g., affirmative action, reproductive rights. H5. Respondents will support increased diversification of the courts, but only up until the point at which the courts are \"\"representative\"\" of the nation at large (e.g., the proportion of \"\"diverse\"\" judges corresponds to the actual percentage of African Americans, women, and Hispanics in the population at large). This will vary according to respondent race, gender, and partisanship, as well as with respondents' attitudes on the institutional legitimacy of the Supreme Court and their own previous knowledge. H6. More information about the current composition of the Courts will affect how important respondents think it will be to appointment a female, African American, Latino, Republican, or Democrat to the Supreme Court. Specifically, reminding respondents of the court's racial/gender composition will lead them to be more supportive of increased diversity, while reminding them of the court's partisanship composition will lead them to be more supportive of appointing someone who is more politically extreme. This will vary according to respondent race, gender, and partisanship, as well as with respondents' attitudes on the institutional legitimacy of the Supreme Court and their own previous knowledge.\"", "q17": "\"The survey is a 15 minute long survey of 1500 U.S. adults, hosted online by Qualtrics and using a panel provided by Survey Sampling International. Different questions on the survey test different hypotheses. For all of the below, \"\"random assignment\"\" is done via the Qualtrics' randomizer. 1. H1 is tested by a survey question that randomly assigns respondents to one of several prompts manipulating the kind of information given to the respondent about what kinds of cases the Supreme Court hears. 2. H2 will be tested by a survey question that randomly exposes respondents to different kinds of information about the Supreme Court caseload, then asks them whether they would support Court packing. 3. H3 is tested by a series of six conjoint questions that present the respondent with a potential Supreme Court candidate, with the gender, race, age, previous professional experience, and partisanship randomly assigned. The respondent is then asked to rate how much they would support the candidate. 4. H4 is tested by a series of six conjoint questions that present the respondent with a potential issue area and then with a hypothetical judge with certain characteristics (gender, race, age, previous professional experience, and partisanship( randomly assigned. The respondent is then asked to rate how much they would trust the candidate to reach the correct decision. 5. H5 is tested by a series of four questions that manipulate the potential percentage of federal judges who are female, African American or Latino. After being presented with a potential percentage, then respondent is then asked if more or fewer women/blacks/Latinos should be nominated to the Courts. 6. H6 will be tested by a series of two questions that randomly assign respondents to either a prompt that informs them of the Court's current composition or a prompt that maintains silence. Respondents will then be asked questions to see what kind of Justice (female, minority, Republican, or Democrat) should be appointed next.
