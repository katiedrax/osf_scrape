Often this period of rest is during the day, and then the employees are expected to return to work that night. We know from research that day sleep is not as effective as night sleep. Some doctors will work 5 nights in a row of night shifts with only 12 hours rest in between, while pilots can do an all night duty, with only one night of rest and then be rostered on to work again the next day. This study investigates the relationship between local nights of sleep (recovery) and physical and mental fatigue. Physical fatigue will be measured through performance on prospective memory tasks, and mental fatigue is measured in  two questionnaires assessing well being.  Specifically my research question is will 3 nights of recovery (7-9 hours of  sleep in a local time zone) improve performance on PM tasks, a reaction time test and self reported ratings of well being (which may include measures such as energy levels, sleep patterns, and general feelings of well being) and return the employees back to their baseline levels (before they undertook the night of sleep deprivation - baseline is measured when an individual has been absent from a night of sleep deprivation for at least 5 nights)"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "H1a: If provided three nights rest after a night of sleep deprivation, we expect to see a quadratic (u-shaped) trend in shift workers ratings of wellbeing from pre-sleep deprivation to rest day 3: that is a decrease in wellbeing scores with fatigue followed by a recovery of scores with rest. \nH1b: We expect wellbeing scores on rest day 3 to be no different from wellbeing scores pre-sleep deprivation (baseline)\n\nH2a: If provided three nights rest after a night of sleep deprivation, we expect to see a quadratic (u-shaped) trend in shift workers performance on prospective memory (PM) tasks from pre-sleep deprivation to rest day 3: that is a decrease in PM performance with fatigue followed by a recovery of performance with rest. \n\nH2b: We expect PM performance on rest day 3 to be no different from PM performance pre-sleep deprivation (baseline)\n\nH3a:If provided three nights rest after a night of sleep deprivation, we expect to see a quadratic (u-shaped) trend in shift workers reaction time on a psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) from pre-sleep deprivation to rest day 3: that is an increase in reaction time on the PVT with fatigue followed by a decrease in reaction time with rest. \nH3b: We expect PVT reaction time on rest day 3 to be no different from PVT reaction time pre- sleep deprivation (baseline) \n\nPredicted Effect: Performance in PM, PVT and ratings of wellbeing will increase as the nights of sleep accumulated increases (to a point where sleep debt is completely recovered) - in this study we are hypothesising that this will be three local nights of full (7-9 hour) sleeps. \n\nWe expect the control group to remain the same throughout the 5 days.

All of the scenes\u2019 images depict common indoor locations and the objects images depict commonly used items. The whole stimulus set is divided into two subsets: \n\n- Episodic set: Eight different scene-object combinations will be used to generate episodic memories. The pairings were built so that the two elements (i.e., scene and object) had a minimal semantic relation (e.g., \"TV\" in a \"bathroom\").\n\n- Semantic set: Another set of eight different scene-object combinations will be used for the semantic conditions. The pairings in this subset were built so that the objects had a strong semantic relationship with the scenes (e.g., \"bathtub\" in a \"bathroom\").\n\nEvery participant will be assigned to a given combination of objects and scenes and these combinations will be counterbalanced across participants so that across the entire sample every object was seen in every possible location. \n\n### Procedure. \n#### Day 1: \n_Learning phase_: Participants will be presented with three learning blocks in which the pairs from the episodic set will be shown sequentially and repeated ten times. Participants will be instructed to memorize as many details as possible from the entire scene and to pay special attention to the target object (i.e., the object that will be placed on the bottom-right corner of the scene). At the end of each block, the acquisition of the scene-object pairings and the memory for the precise object position in the scene will be tested. \n\nAfter completing the learning blocks, participants will be given a printed version of the scenes with a white patch occluding the target area and they will be asked to draw the target objects from memory.\n\nFinally, at the end of the session, participants will perform one block of the scanner task (equivalent to one scanning run) to familiarize them with the timing and the structure of the task. The only difference between this familiarization block and the scanner blocks is that a trial-by-trial vividness rating will be performed. After every trial participants will be asked to report their subjective vividness of retrieved object on a four points scale.\n\n#### Day 2 (_24h after Day 1):\n\n_Pre-scan phase_: Participants will be shown the scenes in the semantic set. They will be asked to select among the object studied on Day 1 the one that best fits each scene (i.e., those that would typically be found in each location in the real world). If they select the wrong object, the correct answer will be provided by the experimenter.\n\n_Scanning phase_: We will use a 3 Tesla MR scanner (SIEMENS Prisma) to acquire functional and anatomical brain images. In order to avoid fatigue and prevent unwanted movements, we will distribute our scanning sequences over two sessions with a 5-10 minutes break in between; participants will be allowed to use the toilet, stretch and walk to prevent neck and shoulders stiffness. Both scanning sessions will include one T1 weighted anatomical image, 2 object retrieval runs and 1 visual mapping run. In addition, the first session will include a high resolution scan of the hippocampal area and the second session will include a sensory template run. \n\n- _Object retrieval task_: This task will consist of two types of trials: episodic and semantic. On episodic trials participants will be presented with the scenes studied during the learning phase; on semantic trials, participants will be presented with the scenes from the semantic set. In both types of trials, a white patch will occlude the bottom right corner of the image thus hiding the target object; participants will be asked to vividly retrieve either the studied object (i.e., episodic trials) or the semantically matching one (i.e., semantic trials). The different trial types will be randomly intermixed.\n- _Retinotopic mapping_: we will map our participants' visual cortex activity to on-screen visual stimulation varying either in eccentricity or in polar angle. \n- _Target mapping_: we will use contrast-reversing flashing checkerboards to functionally locate the voxels in V1 and V2 responding to our target region.\n- _Moving bars_: we will use contrast-reversing moving checkerboards bars to allow for pRFs computation. pRFs will be used to fine tune the target area extracted from the target mapping block.\n- _Sensory templates_: for all of our stimuli (scene-object combinations) we will assess stimulus-specific activation maps in V1 and V2 by presenting them sequentially in the context of a 1-back task. \n_Post-scan phase_: Participants will perform a memory test (identical to that in the learning phase) that will check for scene-object associations (both for episodic and semantic pairings).

", "q8.question": "## Study design \n### Stimuli. \nOur stimulus set consists of pairs of scenes and objects images. All of the scenes\u2019 images depict common indoor locations and the objects images depict commonly used items. The whole stimulus set is divided into two subsets: \n\n- Episodic set: Eight different scene-object combinations will be used to generate episodic memories. The pairings were built so that the two elements (i.e., scene and object) had a minimal semantic relation (e.g., \"TV\" in a \"bathroom\").\n\n- Semantic set: Another set of eight different scene-object combinations will be used for the semantic conditions. The pairings in this subset were built so that the objects had a strong semantic relationship with the scenes (e.g., \"bathtub\" in a \"bathroom\").\n\nEvery participant will be assigned to a given combination of objects and scenes and these combinations will be counterbalanced across participants so that across the entire sample every object was seen in every possible location. \n\n### Procedure. \n#### Day 1: \n_Learning phase_: Participants will be presented with three learning blocks in which the pairs from the episodic set will be shown sequentially and repeated ten times. Participants will be instructed to memorize as many details as possible from the entire scene and to pay special attention to the target object (i.e., the object that will be placed on the bottom-right corner of the scene). At the end of each block, the acquisition of the scene-object pairings and the memory for the precise object position in the scene will be tested. \n\nAfter completing the learning blocks, participants will be given a printed version of the scenes with a white patch occluding the target area and they will be asked to draw the target objects from memory.\n\nFinally, at the end of the session, participants will perform one block of the scanner task (equivalent to one scanning run) to familiarize them with the timing and the structure of the task. The only difference between this familiarization block and the scanner blocks is that a trial-by-trial vividness rating will be performed. After every trial participants will be asked to report their subjective vividness of retrieved object on a four points scale.\n\n#### Day 2 (_24h after Day 1):\n\n_Pre-scan phase_: Participants will be shown the scenes in the semantic set. They will be asked to select among the object studied on Day 1 the one that best fits each scene (i.e., those that would typically be found in each location in the real world). If they select the wrong object, the correct answer will be provided by the experimenter.\n\n_Scanning phase_: We will use a 3 Tesla MR scanner (SIEMENS Prisma) to acquire functional and anatomical brain images. In order to avoid fatigue and prevent unwanted movements, we will distribute our scanning sequences over two sessions with a 5-10 minutes break in between; participants will be allowed to use the toilet, stretch and walk to prevent neck and shoulders stiffness. Both scanning sessions will include one T1 weighted anatomical image, 2 object retrieval runs and 1 visual mapping run. In addition, the first session will include a high resolution scan of the hippocampal area and the second session will include a sensory template run. \n\n- _Object retrieval task_: This task will consist of two types of trials: episodic and semantic. On episodic trials participants will be presented with the scenes studied during the learning phase; on semantic trials, participants will be presented with the scenes from the semantic set. In both types of trials, a white patch will occlude the bottom right corner of the image thus hiding the target object; participants will be asked to vividly retrieve either the studied object (i.e., episodic trials) or the semantically matching one (i.e., semantic trials). The different trial types will be randomly intermixed.\n- _Retinotopic mapping_: we will map our participants' visual cortex activity to on-screen visual stimulation varying either in eccentricity or in polar angle. \n- _Target mapping_: we will use contrast-reversing flashing checkerboards to functionally locate the voxels in V1 and V2 responding to our target region.\n- _Moving bars_: we will use contrast-reversing moving checkerboards bars to allow for pRFs computation. pRFs will be used to fine tune the target area extracted from the target mapping block.\n- _Sensory templates_: for all of our stimuli (scene-object combinations) we will assess stimulus-specific activation maps in V1 and V2 by presenting them sequentially in the context of a 1-back task. \n_Post-scan phase_: Participants will perform a memory test (identical to that in the learning phase) that will check for scene-object associations (both for episodic and semantic pairings).

This pathway supposedly processes threat-related and emotionally relevant stimuli. However, more evidence is needed to determine the temporal dynamics of this pathway, the type of stimuli it processes, and to further support its existence. Therefore we will conduct a dot-probe experiment, measuring the response time and accuracy to targets that follow either an emotional or a neutral face.

Therapy for Active Duty Military Personnel"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Kristen P. Lindgren, Anna Jaffe, Jennifer Wachen"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "There is burgeoning interest in the role of implicit cognitive processes (i.e., cognitive processes that are fast, reflexive, and potentially less controllable) in psychopathology, particularly because these processes may predict different outcomes than do self-report and may be less vulnerable to demand effects than self-report measures. Further, theories of psychopathology, including theories of PTSD, posit that changes in implicit cognitions are crucial for the development and maintenance of psychopathology. While measures have been developed to assess implicit cognitions related to psychopathology, including PTSD, few studies have evaluated these cognitions in clinical samples and even fewer have evaluated changes in these cognitions over the course of interventions (see Teachman, Marker, &amp; Smith-Janik, 2008, JCCP, for one of the rare exceptions). The proposed study will address gaps by evaluating implicit cognitions related to PTSD (i.e., implicit associations about the self and being traumatized, which we term implicit trauma associations) in a sample of active duty military who participated in a clinical trial of variable length Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT).\n\nA measure of implicit trauma associations (the trauma self IAT) was validated in a previous study (Lindgren et al., 2013, JBTEP). Lindgren et al. found that the trauma self IAT had adequate psychometrics and predicted self-reported post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms even after controlling for trauma exposure and self-reported trauma-related cognitions among a sample recruited through the Project Implicit research website (a self-selected sample who self-reported a range of trauma exposure and PTS symptoms). Despite these promising findings with a non-clinical sample, there is a need for additional validation of a trauma-focused IAT and understanding of the role of implicit cognitions in treatment. First, we wish to understand whether individuals\u2019 baseline trauma self IAT scores predict their response to PTSD treatment (in this case, variable-length CPT). Doing so in a sample that is receiving CPT is particularly opportune because a core aim of CPT is to help clients explicitly shift trauma-related cognitions about the self to be more adaptive (i.e., flexible, balanced, realistic).  We consider this question to be exploratory. On the one hand, we could imagine that a higher IAT score at baseline might predict worse response to treatment because it signifies a more rigid trauma self-concept (which may be less responsive to treatment) and greater PTSD severity. On the other hand, we could imagine that a higher IAT score at baseline might predict greater response to treatment because CPT might be an excellent match for individuals with this particular vulnerability and these individuals have greater room for improvement. Second, it is also important to evaluate whether trauma self IAT scores change as a function of the intervention and whether changes in IAT scores predict changes in PTSD symptoms. This will help determine the malleability of the implicit trauma associations and their sensitivity to or prediction of changes in symptoms. Finally, it is unknown whether residual implicit trauma associations following treatment (i.e., IAT scores at 1-month follow up) predict return of symptoms over time (i.e., 3-month f-up), an important question to determine whether the associations serve as a vulnerability marker for potential relapse."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "RQ1a: Are baseline IAT scores correlated with baseline PTSD symptoms (PCL-5), general trauma exposure (# traumatic life events on LEC), military trauma exposure (DRRI scores) and depression (score on the PHQ-9)?\ni.\tHypothesis: IAT scores will be positively correlated with PTSD symptoms (replicating Lindgren et al., 2013) and the PHQ-9 (novel)\nii.\tHypothesis: Consistent with Lindgren et al.

Lindgren, Anna Jaffe, Jennifer Wachen", "q3": "There is burgeoning interest in the role of implicit cognitive processes (i.e., cognitive processes that are fast, reflexive, and potentially less controllable) in psychopathology, particularly because these processes may predict different outcomes than do self-report and may be less vulnerable to demand effects than self-report measures. Further, theories of psychopathology, including theories of PTSD, posit that changes in implicit cognitions are crucial for the development and maintenance of psychopathology. While measures have been developed to assess implicit cognitions related to psychopathology, including PTSD, few studies have evaluated these cognitions in clinical samples and even fewer have evaluated changes in these cognitions over the course of interventions (see Teachman, Marker, &amp; Smith-Janik, 2008, JCCP, for one of the rare exceptions). The proposed study will address gaps by evaluating implicit cognitions related to PTSD (i.e., implicit associations about the self and being traumatized, which we term implicit trauma associations) in a sample of active duty military who participated in a clinical trial of variable length Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT).\n\nA measure of implicit trauma associations (the trauma self IAT) was validated in a previous study (Lindgren et al., 2013, JBTEP). Lindgren et al. found that the trauma self IAT had adequate psychometrics and predicted self-reported post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms even after controlling for trauma exposure and self-reported trauma-related cognitions among a sample recruited through the Project Implicit research website (a self-selected sample who self-reported a range of trauma exposure and PTS symptoms). Despite these promising findings with a non-clinical sample, there is a need for additional validation of a trauma-focused IAT and understanding of the role of implicit cognitions in treatment. First, we wish to understand whether individuals\u2019 baseline trauma self IAT scores predict their response to PTSD treatment (in this case, variable-length CPT). Doing so in a sample that is receiving CPT is particularly opportune because a core aim of CPT is to help clients explicitly shift trauma-related cognitions about the self to be more adaptive (i.e., flexible, balanced, realistic).  We consider this question to be exploratory. On the one hand, we could imagine that a higher IAT score at baseline might predict worse response to treatment because it signifies a more rigid trauma self-concept (which may be less responsive to treatment) and greater PTSD severity. On the other hand, we could imagine that a higher IAT score at baseline might predict greater response to treatment because CPT might be an excellent match for individuals with this particular vulnerability and these individuals have greater room for improvement. Second, it is also important to evaluate whether trauma self IAT scores change as a function of the intervention and whether changes in IAT scores predict changes in PTSD symptoms. This will help determine the malleability of the implicit trauma associations and their sensitivity to or prediction of changes in symptoms. Finally, it is unknown whether residual implicit trauma associations following treatment (i.e., IAT scores at 1-month follow up) predict return of symptoms over time (i.e., 3-month f-up), an important question to determine whether the associations serve as a vulnerability marker for potential relapse.", "q4": "RQ1a: Are baseline IAT scores correlated with baseline PTSD symptoms (PCL-5), general trauma exposure (# traumatic life events on LEC), military trauma exposure (DRRI scores) and depression (score on the PHQ-9)?\ni.\tHypothesis: IAT scores will be positively correlated with PTSD symptoms (replicating Lindgren et al., 2013) and the PHQ-9 (novel)\nii.\tHypothesis: Consistent with Lindgren et al.

and correlations between these change scores will be evaluated.\n\nRQ3c: Do residual IAT scores (assessed at 1-month follow up) predict increased PTSD symptoms at 12 weeks?\nStrategy: Evaluate 1-month IAT scores as predictor of 3-month follow up PTSD scores (PCL-5), controlling for baseline and 1-month PTSD scores, as well as baseline IAT scores; sample will only include treatment responders\n",
