A systematic update review", "description": "Drug induced delirium is a common phenomenon especially in older patients and associated with poor outcomes such as increased rates of hospital-acquired complications, institutionalization and mortality. The evidence of possibly delirium inducing medication is mostly based on case reports and series. Even the English delirium guideline does not provide recommendations on avoiding certain medication (classes) due to a lack of high quality studies (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2010). Nevertheless, reliable data is crucial for clinical prevention measures such as medication reviews. In order to address this problem, we will conduct a systematic literature review to provide a synopsis of current evidence. The latest systematic review on delirium inducing medication retrieved shows that there is uncertainty about most medication classes commonly prescribed and high quality evidence on delirium associations is scarce (Clegg and Young, 2011).", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-02T12:42:52.903586", "date_modified": "2020-04-02T12:41:29.912578", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [""], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "6b5e74be5caece9e60dd34119c39be1de6ab3a397d2ef422cd13f978f29d39a9aea7806c8974c75a2c801a00ca9478e1597459a8ac6c28d0e409799a713eb719313c1384f742fb1b5ed5fa8984b09053db2e9a5ac522ce2ffcf94b3bbdb7d9533547913c6f4b587f7f84c01d8e4d78b3307000aa59c2e5e8895f873c2dfbee06e18cfcf3489d7bada4754711dc162616", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-02T12:42:52.886762", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Michael Reisinger, Daniela Schoberer, Johanna De Biasi, Eva Reininghaus"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "The main aim of this study is to evaluate the evidence of associations between medication and delirium with a focus on the elderly population.\n\nWe will update a previous systematic review from 2011 (Clegg and Young, 2011) on delirium inducing medication and \u2013 if possible \u2013 pool data across studies in meta-analyses according to medication classes or substances."}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": ["No blinding is involved in this study."]}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q6": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Systematic review and - if possible - meta-analysis\n\nThis study will be conducted as a systematic review following the Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al., 2009).

The questions on distrust in science and food neophobia likewise follow Wilks et al. in adapting questions from Frewer, Scholderer, and Bredahl (2003) and Pliner and Hobden (1992). The questions on preference for naturalness were also from Wilks et al. (2019).

The questions on attribution of mental capabilities to animals follow Rothgerber\u2019s (2014) adaptation of the scale used by Bastian et al. (2011). The speciesism scale was developed by Caviola, Everett, and Faber (2018). The order in which participants see the questions on these psychological scales and on demographics will be randomized, as will the order of the sub-questions within each psychological scale.

affected by several factors such as routine (Zisberg et al. 2010), natural light exposure (Wams et al. 2017), use of media devices (Carter et al. 2016), health status (Ohida et al. 2001), anxiety and depression (Alvaro et al. 2013), and post-traumatic stress disorder (Spoormaker and Montgomery 2008).\n\nCovid-19 emerged at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China - and spread globally in the first few months of 2020 - leading to 'lockdown' in different areas around the world. This situation has led to seismic changes in day-to-day life, with people having been told to 'socially distance', 'socially isolate', work from home and stay indoors. This stressful situation and this dramatic change in day-to-day life in society is likely accompanied by multiple changes that impact upon sleep - including changes to working arrangements, routine, exercise, diet, stress levels, anxiety and depression, and health as well as time spent using electronic devices and in isolation. \n\nWhile many of these factors are typically associated with reduced sleep quality - there are other changes that could also result in increased opportunity for sleep - including a reduction in commuting time, and less time spent on other activities (outdoor activities and social activities) - increasing the time available to sleep. \n\nWe started collecting cross-sectional data on sleep (in the context of a wider study focusing more generally on touch) in January and will continue collecting until the end of March. Given our large sample size, we plan to study responses received at different time points in order to examine changes in sleep over this unusual period in history.  \n\nThis study investigates sleep quality during the first 3 months of the COVID-19 outbreak. Cross sectional data regarding sleep quality and quantity and diurnal preference was collected among the population during the first 3 months of 2020. \n\nWe hypothesized that sleep quality will be worst as the pandemic progresses, whereas sleep quantity will remain stable or increase. We do not predict changes in diurnal preference.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-03-29T20:19:16.308843", "date_modified": "2020-03-29T20:03:45.923910", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "90802a67c265d0d1b22aa8e4599f42dcf77eaff6ab016072b8430b24f2f2ef5f8c899344ca0a5ab1f0e20995c63788087ce4be040676cd938ba9f72b9db17ac45d591b377a0422035049d139dba0a553b9391e7dc099b8f5cd870195481920f8423c76618eaadc820634f303e95d2830f53097ba949c252e771300a9c276b79721140690265f2f89744475c7f61bd1df", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-03-29T20:19:16.290438", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Juan J Madrid-Valero, Alice Gregory, Michael J.

The descriptive statistics may also consider differences by age, sex, and region of the UK. \n\nTo compare differences between groups on these variables we will run appropriate parametric (e.g. t-test for two groups; ANOVA for multiple groups/levels) or non-parametric comparisons (e.g. chi-square for frequency data; permutation tests) \u2013 please also see data transformation section. Alpha levels will be constrained as per our inference criteria section. \n\nWe predict the following (note, although in some cases we have directional predictions we will use two-tailed tests throughout): \n1.\tSleep quality will decrease over time (i.e.  those completing the questionnaire later will report poorer sleep quality)\n2.\tSleep quantity will remain stable or increase over time (i.e. those completing the questionnaire later will not report shorter sleep as compared to those completing the questionnaire earlier, and may report longer sleep duration)\n3.\tDiurnal preference will not show substantial changes across the study.\n\nCorrelation and Regression analyses:\nIn addition to group level comparisons we will also run correlational and regression analyses. \n\nOur main predictor variable of interest will be day/week of completion of the questionnaire (hereafter called Time of Completion). Note, we will define if we use day or week based on the final sample size that will be clear once the data has been accessed. We define day as our preferred option, but due to opportunity sampling nature of the project we may have to restrict analysis to week of completion. We will examine if Time of Completion predicts responses to the individual sleep item variables \u2013 that is to say we will run separate regressions for each sleep/diurnal preference variable of interest.

(Sleep quality)\n\u2022\tDuring the majority of the days and nights in the past month how many hours of actual sleep did you get at night? This may be different to the number of hours you spent in bed. (Sleep quantity)\n\u2022\tThinking about a typical night in the last month...How long does it take you to fall asleep? (Sleep quality)\n\u2022\tIf you then wake up during the night, how long are you awake in total (add up all the time when you are awake)?

(Sleep quality)\n\u2022\tOne hears about \"morning\" and \"evening\" types of people. Which one of these do you consider yourself to be? (Diurnal preference)\n\nWe will divide the sample and present in at least one of three ways: 1) by week of testing, 2) responses received in January, those received in February and those received in March, and 3) responses before ten cases of Covid-19 and after ten cases of Covid-19 in a given region of interest (e.g. in England \u2013 before 24/02/20 versus after 24/02/20 based on cases reported by Public Health England). The descriptive statistics may also consider differences by age, sex, and region of the UK. \n\nTo compare differences between groups on these variables we will run appropriate parametric (e.g. t-test for two groups; ANOVA for multiple groups/levels) or non-parametric comparisons (e.g. chi-square for frequency data; permutation tests) \u2013 please also see data transformation section. Alpha levels will be constrained as per our inference criteria section. \n\nWe predict the following (note, although in some cases we have directional predictions we will use two-tailed tests throughout): \n1.\tSleep quality will decrease over time (i.e.  those completing the questionnaire later will report poorer sleep quality)\n2.\tSleep quantity will remain stable or increase over time (i.e. those completing the questionnaire later will not report shorter sleep as compared to those completing the questionnaire earlier, and may report longer sleep duration)\n3.\tDiurnal preference will not show substantial changes across the study.\n\nCorrelation and Regression analyses:\nIn addition to group level comparisons we will also run correlational and regression analyses. \n\nOur main predictor variable of interest will be day/week of completion of the questionnaire (hereafter called Time of Completion). Note, we will define if we use day or week based on the final sample size that will be clear once the data has been accessed. We define day as our preferred option, but due to opportunity sampling nature of the project we may have to restrict analysis to week of completion. We will examine if Time of Completion predicts responses to the individual sleep item variables \u2013 that is to say we will run separate regressions for each sleep/diurnal preference variable of interest. We shall run additional regression analyses where we control for sex, age, ethnicity in our analyses.\n", "q17.uploader": []}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecaaaa", "text": "Medicine and

There is a positive relationship between PSM and the willingness to report ethical problems. H1b. For employees with PSM activation, the effect of PSM levels on reporting ethical problems is stronger. Since the literature on PM and willingness is divided, we propose contrasting hypotheses: H2a-1. There is a positive relationship between PM and the willingness to report ethical problems. H2a-2. There is a negative relationship between PM and the willingness to report ethical problems. H2b. For employees with PM activation, the effect of PM levels on reporting ethical problems is stronger. We also expect differences between PSM and PM. Please mind, if H2a-2 is accepted, H3 must be true too. However, if H2a-1 is true, H3 could, but does not have to, be true. H3. Employee with higher PSM levels are more willing to report ethical problems than employees with higher PM levels. The last hypothesis is additional and may not be included in the academic publication.

First data from China and the United Kingdom indicate that symptoms of anxiety and depression and perceptions of stress rise significantly as a consequence of the pandemic. There are also anecdotal reports in the general media of increased domestic violence, divorce and suicide rates. Hence, the Corona crisis is also a mental health crisis. Threats to public mental health are likely to further increase with the spread of the virus across the world and the potentially severe economic, societal and political side effects of the pandemic. In this situation, there is urgent need for knowledge about factors that can protect mental health in this world-wide crisis and that can be harnessed in the service of public mental health promotion. DynaCORE-C attempts to identify these protective factors (resilience factors) with the help of an internet-based cross-sectional questionnaire survey for adults available in multiple languages. \n\nOur dependent variable is resilience. In keeping with current conceptualizations of this construct (Bonanno et al., 2015; Kalisch et al., 2017), we define resilience as an outcome of good mental health despite exposure to adversity (outcome-based resilience) and measure it by relating mental health outcomes to experienced stressors (Kalisch et al., 2015), which we extensively sample. That is, we do not rely on resilience questionnaires to obtain our dependent variable. In defining our hypotheses about independent variables (resilience factors), we focus on modifiable factors that can be targeted by prevention measures. Specifically, we hypothesize that social support, an increase in social support during the Corona crisis, optimism, general self-efficacy, good stress recovery, positive appraisal style (primary hypothesis), positive appraisal specifically of the Corona crisis, and behavioral coping are positively associated with resilience (outcome), while neuroticism is negatively associated with resilience. We also hypothesize that the expected positive effect of social support on resilience is positively mediated by its effect on positive appraisal style, and that the expected positive effect of positive appraisal style on resilience is positively mediated by its effect on stress recovery. Open questions in the survey allow for detecting potential non-hypothesized resilience factors. \n\nAnalyses will be conducted in the whole sample. Subgroup analyses will be conducted for socio-demographic and health characteristics such as gender, country of residence, occupation, or belonging to a risk group. Further, different phases of the crisis (during official general movement or contact restrictions and after the loosening of these restrictions) will be considered. This will allow us to gain insights into which resilience factors are most effective in which groups and at what times of the crisis and how preventive interventions can be optimally targeted.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-02T07:58:39.812736", "date_modified": "2020-04-02T08:01:38.826834", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Universit\u00e4tsmedizin der Johannes Gutenberg-Universit\u00e4t Mainz"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "55bfb4a2c4bf1a637cff6d9677465018f5a7f500134914c7792fed36762a13e79e569aac0e44444bab1ede572b68a78fa98f50af65119c67dad2ad2f696c488df67052d8372aee9ca803526d0efcfd601e588f69c33e7a63f888ecbdbd978acef0bf8ffaa390e3931e95cd56613ea5233887cb78a78949c5b6f16353f9060afd3e650cc60e575ef18a26b3545bb05122", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-02T07:58:39.766117", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Open-Ended Registration", "registered_meta": {"summary": {"extra": [], "value": "The attached preregistration document \"DynaCORE-C_preregistration_nr1_final_rk20200401.pdf\" contains the sections: Title, Authors, Description, Introduction and derivation of hypotheses and outcome measures, Design Plan, Sampling Plan, Analysis Plan, References.
