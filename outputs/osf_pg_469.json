This is likely due to the high normative value assigned to increasing turnout, which does not carry over to the specifics of how one casts a ballot. However, administrators who run elections often seek to influence when and how voters cast their ballots in order to reduce costs and keep elections running smoothly. Additionally, since voting methods present different possibilities of social rewards (Arceneaux, Kousser, & Mullin 2012; Kousser & Mullin 2007; Funk 2005), messages aimed at making these social benefits salient to voters will provide some evidence on whether voters consider the visibility of voting when making their decisions on how to vote. There is evidence that people value being seen as a voter (Gerber, Huber, Doherty, & Dowling 2015; Gerber & Rogers 2009), but evidence has yet to be presented that clearly links ability to fulfill this motivation with higher voter turnout. One experiment (Herrnson, Hamner, & Koh 2015) has examined the effects of messages on the method of balloting. In the 2010 general election in Maryland, the authors sent randomized messages in mailings to active registered voters encouraging the use of the new voting reforms (no-excuse absentee, early in-person, and absentee with a downloadable ballot). While messaging about the convenience of early voting had no effect on early voting usage, a message stating that early voting was adopted in response to citizen demand yielded a 3% increase in early voting, from 14% to 17% of the registered voters. They also found that informational and convenience treatments about the downloadable ballot led to a significant increase in the use of this method. Although the Herrnson et al. (2015) study provides much useful data on the effectiveness of different messages, it did not include all of the messages that may be effective at changing voters\u2019 behavior. The literature on social benefits suggests that this is an important factor and messages emphasizing them may increase the use of in-person voting. Studies on voters in vote-by-mail systems have shown that voting confidence is a very salient issue (Stein, Menger, & Vonnahme 2015; Flaxman et al. 2015), so stating that early in-person return yields higher confidence should have an effect on both method and timing of voting. While no literature has examined messages on stopping campaign calls, anecdotal evidence suggests that many voters tire of getting constant calls from campaigns and may vote earlier to avoid future calls. Using a similar design to this study, we will test these different types of messages in addition to a purely informational message and one that emphasizes responsiveness to citizen demand in the setting of El Paso County, Colorado. Experimental Context In 2013 the state of Colorado adopted vote-by-mail elections, in which every registered voter is mailed a ballot three weeks before Election Day. Voters can return their ballots by mail or in-person at Voter Service and Processing Centers (centralized locations with election staff) or at un-manned drop-off locations. In order to avoid large rushes of ballots in the last few days of the election, county clerks would prefer voters to return their ballots as soon as possible after making their vote choices and in-person rather than by mail . The clerks expect early and in-person return of ballots to reduce the costs of processing ballots and increase the timeliness and accuracy of vote counts. We are working with the County Clerks Office for El Paso County, Colorado in order to test the effectiveness of different messages at encouraging in-person ballot return, early ballot return, or both in combination. Messages Previous research indicates voters may change their method and timing of voting in response to: opportunities to receive the social rewards of voting , stopping calls from candidates urging them to vote , assurance that their ballot will be counted by election night , and knowledge that methods were provided in direct response to their requests . We are testing the efficacy of messages aimed at these motivations that may influence when and where voters return their mailed ballots. The exact wording of the messages, including an informational control message, is below. Control Message: As you may know, the State of Colorado recently adopted a new election system in which all active registered voters are mailed a ballot for each election. Along with this notice is your mail ballot packet for the upcoming election on November 3, 2015. You may return your ballot through the postal service, or you may drop it off in person at any Voter Service and Polling Center or secure drop-off location listed on the secrecy sleeve included with your mail ballot packet. Keep in mind that ballots returned through the mail may take up to three days to be delivered. In addition to the control message the treatments include one of the following paragraphs, placed in between the two informational paragraphs of the control message: Treatment I: Voter Confidence You can help ensure that election results are reported as early as possible on Election Day by returning your ballot as soon as you have marked your choices. By returning your ballot early, you can be confident that your vote will be included when the first unofficial election results are announced. Treatment II: Stop the Calls If you are like many voters in El Paso County you may receive numerous calls, mailings, and other communications from campaigns. By returning your ballot early, campaigns will see that you have already voted and will have no reason to contact you. Help stop the calls by returning your ballot as soon as you have marked your choices! Treatment III: Social Rewards For some people, mailing off a completed ballot doesn\u2019t give them the same voting experience as casting a ballot in person with other people. However, many voters find that dropping off their completed ballot provides a similar experience of traveling to a Voter Service and Polling Center, with the added convenience of filling out their ballot at home. Treatment IV: Responsiveness An increasing number of El Paso County voters prefer to return their ballot in person rather than mailing their ballot to our office. In response to changing voter demand we have increased the number of convenient 24 hour secure ballot drop-off locations which are listed on the enclosed secrecy sleeve."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "We hypothesize that the first two treatment messages (Treatments I & II) will increase the probability that voters will return their ballots earlier in the voting period rather than closer to Election Day. We have no hypothesis about the strength of the two messages compared with each other. We also hypothesize that the last two treatment messages (Treatments III & IV) will increase the probability that voters will return their ballots in-person rather than by mail. We further expect that, due to its activation of voters\u2019 desire to be seen voting, the social rewards message (Treatment III) will have the largest positive effect on increasing in-person ballot return. We do not expect that any of the messages will have an effect on the probability of voter turnout by all methods combined."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "To test the effects of these messages, we worked with the El Paso County, CO County Clerk\u2019s office to randomly insert one of four treatment messages or the control message into each ballot packet. These ballot packets contain the official mail voting ballot, instructions on how to return the ballot and a \u201csecrecy sleeve\u201d to return it in, and our treatment message, which is provided on a blank off-white sheet of paper in plain black text. The randomization of the treatment groups was conducted at the household level to insure that voters in the same household do not receive different messages, which could cause a contagion effect across treatments or cause voter confusion. In a balanced design, approximately 82,000 voters in El Paso County received each of the five inserted messages."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "United States of America"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "410000"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q23": {"extra": [], "value": "Approved by IRB for expedited review due to unobtrusive measurements"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "794174-1"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "9/1/15"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q27": {"extra": [], "value": "El Paso County Clerk's Office, Colorado"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q30": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q32": {"extra": [], "value": "D72"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Field Experiments"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Elections"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e31e2f7f6631d000c5a315b", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/v6ndw/providers/osfstorage/5e31e2f7f6631d000c5a315b", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/v6ndw/providers/osfstorage/5e31e2f7f6631d000c5a315b", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/v6ndw/providers/osfstorage/5e31e2f7f6631d000c5a315b?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/v6ndw/providers/osfstorage/5e31e2f7f6631d000c5a315b"}, "attributes": {"etag": "8217b297b73676cef74dccdffb706b054a79414ec83ba3886ac1987d3f4e67d9", "kind": "file", "name": "20151120AB_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e31e2f7f6631d000c5a315b", "size": 29142, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "25aa473a4ef4f423eaf2be23cc29df3a", "sha256": "9fe23c94e97bc0188a2991513d069a3206a2755fcbcf0354fb0c08c5b36f02bc"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 29142, "modified": "2020-01-29T19:54:31.761226+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "v6ndw", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20151120AB_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-01-29T19:54:31+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "v6ndw", "sha256": "9fe23c94e97bc0188a2991513d069a3206a2755fcbcf0354fb0c08c5b36f02bc", "viewUrl": "/project/crn74/files/osfstorage/5e31e2fc4b2010001a20f953/", "selectedFileName": "20151120AB_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20151120AB_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": {}, "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Can Messages from Administrators Influence the Method and Timing of Voting?

Context \u2013 Pakistan Passport Office In recent years, governments in developing countries have started using technologies to monitor service delivery, improve governance and deter petty corruption. In Pakistan, such efforts have been translated into various initiatives such as the Passport Office\u2019s SMS RAABTA. In an effort to 1) strengthen active engagement with the public and collect feedback on issues faced in service delivery, 2) improve performance monitoring and 3) enhance accountability, the passport authority set up a feedback mechanism using mobile phone text messaging. Shortly after a visit to a Regional Passport Office (RPO \u2013 where h/she has shared basic information such as mobile number), the applicant receives a text message shortly asking 1) if he/she faced any problem during the visit and, 2) if he/she was asked to pay any bribe. Applicants\u2019 responses are thereafter recoded into 8 categories (\u201cAll OK\u201d, \u201cSuggestions\u201d, \u201cProcess Delays\u201d, \u201cStaff Attitude\u201d, \u201cCorruption\u201d, \u201cProcedural Difficulties\u201d, \u201cAgents\u201d, \u201cBank Delays\u201d). A follow up is made in cases where complaints about agents and corruption are received and, if relevant, further investigation can take place. The powerful deterrence created by the direct and easy communication between citizens and the government and the credible threat of punitive action is thought to improve the quality of government services and curb non-collusive corruption. There are currently 95 RPO across Pakistan which serve between 14,000 and 20,000 applicants daily. So far, based on data from the pilot phase (August 2015), 87% of the feedback received was positive. However, the response rate was fairly low: only 16% of all texted applicants replied. The effectiveness of the SMS RAABTA in identifying service quality issues and cases of corruption is intimately tied to the response rate. Improving the response rate is crucial for the following reasons. Without a representative sample, the collected data might over-represent the satisfactory accounts and prompt erroneous conclusions. In these circumstances, the head of the RPO faces limited ability to properly address service quality and corruptions issues. Consequentially, citizen satisfaction with government performance and accountability is likely to remain low. 2. Theoretical Background Why is it that some citizens decide to contribute their time and resources to provide feedback and report on their recent interaction with bureaucrats while others simply ignore the invitation from the Passport Office? Some parallels with non-response in surveys are possible here. The decision to take part in a survey is influenced by a variety of factors (e.g. individual traits, socio-economic status, etc.) and it is generally considered that the design of the survey itself (i.e. its presentation, length, wording, aesthetics, etc.) can impact a great deal on that decision (Edwards et al., 2010). As a corollary to this, the way the issues considered by the survey are framed can have varying psychological and behavioural effects (Stalans, 2012; Tourangeau & Ye, 2009; Chong & Druckman, 2007; Tversky & Kahneman, 1986; Pi\u00f1on & Gambara, 2005). In other words, two invitations to participate to a survey requesting the same action but highlighting different ideas either about the benefits or downsides of participation can prove to act as different incentives and thus prompt different behaviours. The main objective of this research is to improve the passport citizen feedback model by experimentally assessing the effectiveness of different frames implemented in text messaging invitations to participate in SMS RAABTA. Drawing on the framing effect literature, we develop three variation of participant invitations (i.e. a negative frame, a positive-individualistic frame and positive-civic duty frame) that have been demonstrated to effectively increase survey participation. For instance, it has been suggested that sensitivity to negative consequences (Stalans, 2012, 78; Tversky & Kahneman, 1986; Tversky & Kahneman, 1981) is perhaps greater in some contexts than sensitivity to positive outcomes. When considered in the context of the SMS RAABTA, a frame highlighting the negative consequences of not participating (e.g., Due to the lack of citizen feedback, corruption and poor quality of service are still an issue at some passport offices) can thus prove to be an effective way to increase response. In contrast, it has been demonstrated in other contexts that highlighting current successes (e.g., Thousands have already responded to help improve the delivery and quality of service), can be an effective way of incentivizing individuals to participate. Although in a different context (i.e. charitable giving), several field experiments have revealed that highlighting what other have already contributed (i.e. in the case of charitable giving, seed money; in the case of the SMS RAABTA, time and feedback) had a significant and constant effect to boost participation (List, 2011; Rondeau & List, 2008; List & Lucking-Riley, 2002). Finally, a variation of the positive frame will be devised to justify the participation to the SMS RAABTA on civic duty grounds by stressing a sense of obligation (e.g., As a citizen of Pakistan it is your civic duty to denounce corruption and help improve service quality). Here the potential respondent is not solicited with regards to the expected outcome of his individual participation, but rather by claiming that as a citizen he has a clear responsibility to report cases of bureaucrat misbehaviour. Similar civic duty frames have been used in studies of electoral turnout (Blais & Achen, 2010) and it has been found to increase turnout by almost 10% (Green & Gerber, 2000). Based on existing research and pilot testing in Lahore last year, we expect the `positive-civic duty\u2019 frame to have the largest response rate, followed by the `negative\u2019 and `positive-individualistic\u2019 frame. Based on the pilot phase we estimate an increase in the response rate by about 10 percentage points. Beyond the practical aim of improving the response rate of the current feedback mechanism, this research is meant to contribute substantively to the framing literature in several ways. First, it will assess framing effects in a novel context (i.e. Pakistan\u2019s Passport Office), therefore contributing to an understanding of citizen feedback mechanisms in developing countries and to the particularities of framing effects in that context. Secondly, by rigorously assessing the effects of the various frames on response rates our study will contribute to the still largely unexplored relation between framing and participation. Finally, by systematically comparing the marginal effects of the various frames to one another, our study will allow us to demonstrate the ordered importance of the various frames and thus explore the differential receptivity of information presented in different ways. In sum, our project combines the practical aim of increasing SMS RAABTA\u2019s response rate with the academic aim of experimentally evaluating the relation of framing effects on participation and to explore the psychology of survey participation."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Based on the theoretical suggestions highlighted above, we can propose the following hypotheses for the main outcome of this study (i.e. response rate): H1: Compared to the baseline script, alternate versions of invitations (i.e. `negative\u2019, `positive-individualistic\u2019 or `positive-civic duty\u2019 frames) to participate in SMS RAABTA will increase response rate. When taking into consideration the specific nature of the frames, as described above, we can propose the following hypothesis, comparing the marginal effects of the various frames: H2: We expect the `positive-individualistic\u2019 frame to have the smallest effect on response rate, followed by `negative\u2019, and the `positive-civic duty\u2019 frame. Let us note here that this hypothesis stems mainly from the theoretical literature but that we have highlighted mixed empirical support for alternative hypotheses. Secondary outcomes are also relevant for our evaluation.

As one finds contradictory findings here on this aspect we will assume that the effects of treatments will be greater amongst women (as is was reported elsewhere, in a different context, that risky frames have greater effect on women \u2013 see Pi\u00f1on & Gambara, 2005).", "q18": "Pakistan", "q19": "4,000", "q20": "Yes", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "NA", "q25": "NA", "q26": "Other (describe in text box below)", "q27": "Citizen Feedback Model (CFM) in conjuncture with the Pakistani Office for Passports & Immigration", "q28": "No", "q29": "", "q30": "Yes", "q31": "", "q32": "NA", "q33": ["Experimental Design"], "q34": ["Governance"], "q35": "Agree", "q36": "Agree", "q37": [], "q38": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=xe6tw", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "xe6tw", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "xe6tw", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/d5gfm/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "d5gfm", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y9528/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "y9528", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0f/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0f", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/xe6tw/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xe6tw/"}}, {"id": "ty5bq", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "How Can International Actors Build Interethnic Trust after Conflict?

In that experiment I found that when subjects are confronted with a corrupt candidate, support for such candidate drops as voters learn more specific details of the source of misappropriated funds and about the destination of those funds. In that experiment I used a baseline treatment condition where subjects only learn that candidate has antecedents of administrative irregularities. I used four additional treatment conditions in which I provided subjects with complementary information on the source of those funds (expenditures destined to public hospitals or expenditures in technical services to repair computers in municipal secretaries) and on the destination of those misappropriated funds (a mayor\u2019s bank account or to support party members who helped the mayor in the electoral campaign) with a 2x2 factorial design. The two alternative types of source of funds attempted to capture a continuum from expenditures that are generally more valued by voters (social services) to expenditures where the benefits for the public are less obvious . The two alternative destinations of misappropriated funds attempted to capture two alternative \u2013and frequent- ways in which officials seek a particular gain from misappropriated funds. There were six vignettes in total (the baseline treatment condition, the four information treatment conditions, and a pure control condition with a candidate with no antecedents of irregularities). Likelihood to vote for such candidate was the outcome variable.

To complement this finding I am running a new experiment where I test several competing theories on why more information on source and destination of funds increases voter rejection of corrupt candidates. The first theory is that there is a differential effect when providing details on the destination of funds (i.e. informing subjects that money is diverted to either the mayor\u2019s bank account or to support people who helped the mayor in campaigning) as compared to providing details on the source of funds. The second theory is about information itself. This theory states that punishment increases by the fact of providing more details on the accusation. I maintain two alternative hypotheses here.
