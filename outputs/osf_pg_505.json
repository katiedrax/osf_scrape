Thomas"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Prior work linking test selection to hypothesis generation has focused on single test selection in binary choice tasks (Thomas, Dougherty, &amp; Lange, 2010).   Most testing behavior, however, occurs in environments wherein multiple tests are exploited and data is accumulated over time.  To date, no study has systematically manipulated the hypothesis set cued by information available at the beginning of the hypothesis evaluation process for the purpose of investigating sequential testing behavior.  The purpose of this experiment is to investigate test preference as it relates to cued hypothesis sets and changes to beliefs over time.  \n\nInformation utility models often invoke hypotheses when computing test value (Manktelow &amp; Over, 1990; Over &amp; Evans, 1994; 1996; Oaksford &amp; Chater, 1996); however, such metrics are not suited for sequential data acquisition to evaluate more than a single hypothesis.  Probability gain, for example, conceptualizes the utility of a test as its capacity to make a hypothesis more probable.  Not only does this definition of utility lose clarity in decision environments with greater uncertainty (e.g., more than one hypothesis is considered), it presupposes that the goal of testing is to confirm a specific hypothesis or that decision-makers are aware of the correct state of the world ahead of testing.  \n\nAlternatively, the HyGene architecture assumes that preference for information manifests as a byproduct of belief.  The need to seek diagnostic information manifests when more than one hypothesis is considered as a possible account for a dataset (Thomas, Dougherty &amp; Lange, 2010).  Otherwise, pseudo-diagnostic or positive search is an adequate strategy for informing a decision-maker.  HyGene, however, makes more nuanced predictions regarding information preference as it relates to the set of contending hypotheses.  Provided that more than one hypothesis is considered by a decision-maker, preference should reflect the contents of working memory such that information depositories with a history of differentiating between contending states of the world are exploited at a higher rate.  \n\nThe purpose of this experiment is to test this prediction by measuring test preference in response to cues intended to bias participants towards maintaining differential belief distributions.  The statistical structure of the experimental environment is designed to exact control over the hypotheses most strongly considered by participants.  The general hypothesis was that presenting cue would predict test preference where patterns of testing behavior would appear markedly different depending on which presenting cue was presented.\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "We predict that testing preferences will be influenced by the presenting cue shown to participants at the onset of a trial. The information available in the task is designed such that presentation of presenting cue #1 results in a strong belief (strong prior) in disease hypothesis #1 and a moderate belief in disease hypothesis #2. That change in belief increases the diagnostic value of test #1. The same relationship exists for presenting cue #2, hypotheses #s 2 and 3, and test #2. The pattern persists for presenting cue #s 3 and 4. Thus, the predicted pattern of results is test #1 will be preferred in response to presenting cue #1, test #2 will be preferred in response to presenting cue #2, test #3 will be preferred in response to presenting cue #3, and test #4 will be preferred in response to presenting cue #4."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Most testing behavior, however, occurs in environments wherein multiple tests are exploited and data is accumulated over time.  To date, no study has systematically manipulated the hypothesis set cued by information available at the beginning of the hypothesis evaluation process for the purpose of investigating sequential testing behavior.  The purpose of this experiment is to investigate test preference as it relates to cued hypothesis sets and changes to beliefs over time.  \n\nInformation utility models often invoke hypotheses when computing test value (Manktelow &amp; Over, 1990; Over &amp; Evans, 1994; 1996; Oaksford &amp; Chater, 1996); however, such metrics are not suited for sequential data acquisition to evaluate more than a single hypothesis.  Probability gain, for example, conceptualizes the utility of a test as its capacity to make a hypothesis more probable.  Not only does this definition of utility lose clarity in decision environments with greater uncertainty (e.g., more than one hypothesis is considered), it presupposes that the goal of testing is to confirm a specific hypothesis or that decision-makers are aware of the correct state of the world ahead of testing.  \n\nAlternatively, the HyGene architecture assumes that preference for information manifests as a byproduct of belief.  The need to seek diagnostic information manifests when more than one hypothesis is considered as a possible account for a dataset (Thomas, Dougherty &amp; Lange, 2010).  Otherwise, pseudo-diagnostic or positive search is an adequate strategy for informing a decision-maker.  HyGene, however, makes more nuanced predictions regarding information preference as it relates to the set of contending hypotheses.  Provided that more than one hypothesis is considered by a decision-maker, preference should reflect the contents of working memory such that information depositories with a history of differentiating between contending states of the world are exploited at a higher rate.  \n\nThe purpose of this experiment is to test this prediction by measuring test preference in response to cues intended to bias participants towards maintaining differential belief distributions.  The statistical structure of the experimental environment is designed to exact control over the hypotheses most strongly considered by participants.  The general hypothesis was that presenting cue would predict test preference where patterns of testing behavior would appear markedly different depending on which presenting cue was presented.\n", "q4": "We predict that testing preferences will be influenced by the presenting cue shown to participants at the onset of a trial. The information available in the task is designed such that presentation of presenting cue #1 results in a strong belief (strong prior) in disease hypothesis #1 and a moderate belief in disease hypothesis #2. That change in belief increases the diagnostic value of test #1. The same relationship exists for presenting cue #2, hypotheses #s 2 and 3, and test #2. The pattern persists for presenting cue #s 3 and 4. Thus, the predicted pattern of results is test #1 will be preferred in response to presenting cue #1, test #2 will be preferred in response to presenting cue #2, test #3 will be preferred in response to presenting cue #3, and test #4 will be preferred in response to presenting cue #4.", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.
