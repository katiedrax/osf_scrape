"registration_supplement": "Open-Ended Registration", "registered_meta": {"summary": {"extra": [], "value": "Early adversity and women\u2019s sexual behavior: The role of neurobiological sensitivity to sexual reward. \n     In the United States about one-eighth of individuals in the are exposed to adversity such as sexual abuse, physical abuse, and or neglect prior to the age of 18 (Banducci, Hoffman, Lejuez &amp; Koenen, 2014). Individuals exposed to early adversity are more likely to engage in sexual behaviors that place them at risk for sexual health problems such as engaging sex at earlier ages, unprotected sex, and higher numbers of sexual partners (e.g., Hillis, Anda, Felitti &amp; Marchbanks, 2001; Senn &amp; Carey, 2010). Life history theory offers insight into this relationship, however, researcher have yet to apply LHT to the undertheorized link between early adversity and same-sex behavior. Compared to heterosexuals, sexual-minority minority individuals are disproportionately likely to report childhood experiences of adversity (e.g., Hughes et al., 2014; McLaughlin, Hatzenbuehler, Xuan &amp; Conron, 2012) as well as increased engagement in risky behaviors such as early sexual initiation, higher numbers of sexual partners and higher rates of general sexual risk-taking (e.g., Kerr, Ding, &amp; Thompson, 2013; Tornello, Riskind &amp; Patterson, 2014). \n     While there have been many mediating mechanisms offered in existing research, they have yet to fully address the wide range of sexual risks seen in women who experience early adversity. Behavioral and self-report data suggest that individuals exposed to early adversity exhibit greater impulsiveness and sensation seeking which are reward-motivated behaviors (e.g., Ansell, Gu, Tuit &amp; Sinha, 2012; Katz, Fromme &amp; D\u2019amico, 2000). Neurobiological research suggests brain activation changes in response to rewards in those who experience early adversity however the results are extremely varied (Novick et al., 2018). Considering the mixed results coupled with unique aspects of female sexual risk-taking and female same-sex behavior, I propose that heightened neurobiological sensitivity to sexual rewards may be one of the mechanisms linking early adversity to later sexual risk behavior including but not limited to same-sex behavior, and my research seeks to test this possibility in a sample of women with diverse sexual orientations.\nCurrent Study. \n     By way of this project, I aim to examine further the association between early adversity and later sexual risk-taking including same-sex behavior. I hypothesize that a key mediating mechanism may be a heightened sensitivity to sexual rewards.

First being a questionnaire phase. In this questionnaire phase, participants will consist of 192 women of diverse sexual orientations. The second phase will be an EEG assessment in this phase 50-60 women will be randomly selected from the pool of 192 women.\nSample Size Determination: Based on the funding we have available to us we are able to collect 192 women for the self-report portion of the study and up to 60 women for the self-report plus EEG portions of the study. If we are able to procure more funding we will attempt to recruit more women to increase our overall sample size. \nProcedures: \n     All women (n = 192) will report experiences of early adversity (e.g., predicted lifespan, perceived childhood unpredictability, Adverse childhood experiences/ACES, childhood SES), sexual behavior history with both male and female partners (e.g., sexual partner number, sociosexuality, safe sex behavior, sexual initiation age), and self-reported general and sexual reward sensitivity (e.g., behavioral avoidance/Inhibition scale, sensitivity to punishment and reward questionnaire). A random subset of women will partake in the EEG portion of this study. Each woman will be fitted with a 32-electrode site EEG cap. The EEG lab session will consist of two separate tasks, the doors task and a modified doors task, presented in random order. The modified doors task will assess sexual reward sensitivity using sexual stimuli (pictures of partnered and solo sexual activity) and is the primary focus of the current project. \nDesigned from procedures outlined in similar studies (van Lankveld &amp; Smulders, 2008; Prause, Steele, Staley &amp; Sabantinelli, 2015). This task will consist of 200 total trials (100 neutral images, 100 sexual images) in 4 blocks (50 trials each block) using sexual images as the stimuli. Each trial will begin with participants choosing between two doors, following their choice they are presented with a fixation cross (500 ms). Following this fixation cross will be presented with one of two images (neutral or sexual) (2000ms). I will create an average ERP waveform for both sexy and neutral conditions independently. After doing that I will subtract the average neutral wave from the average sexy wave to create a difference wave which represents RewP, (a component used to index how sensitive an individual is to rewards) (Holroyd, Krigolson &amp; Lee, 2011; Lukie, Montazer-Hojat &amp; Holroyd, 2014).  \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"summary": "Early adversity and women\u2019s sexual behavior: The role of neurobiological sensitivity to sexual reward. \n     In the United States about one-eighth of individuals in the are exposed to adversity such as sexual abuse, physical abuse, and or neglect prior to the age of 18 (Banducci, Hoffman, Lejuez &amp; Koenen, 2014). Individuals exposed to early adversity are more likely to engage in sexual behaviors that place them at risk for sexual health problems such as engaging sex at earlier ages, unprotected sex, and higher numbers of sexual partners (e.g., Hillis, Anda, Felitti &amp; Marchbanks, 2001; Senn &amp; Carey, 2010). Life history theory offers insight into this relationship, however, researcher have yet to apply LHT to the undertheorized link between early adversity and same-sex behavior. Compared to heterosexuals, sexual-minority minority individuals are disproportionately likely to report childhood experiences of adversity (e.g., Hughes et al., 2014; McLaughlin, Hatzenbuehler, Xuan &amp; Conron, 2012) as well as increased engagement in risky behaviors such as early sexual initiation, higher numbers of sexual partners and higher rates of general sexual risk-taking (e.g., Kerr, Ding, &amp; Thompson, 2013; Tornello, Riskind &amp; Patterson, 2014). \n     While there have been many mediating mechanisms offered in existing research, they have yet to fully address the wide range of sexual risks seen in women who experience early adversity. Behavioral and self-report data suggest that individuals exposed to early adversity exhibit greater impulsiveness and sensation seeking which are reward-motivated behaviors (e.g., Ansell, Gu, Tuit &amp; Sinha, 2012; Katz, Fromme &amp; D\u2019amico, 2000). Neurobiological research suggests brain activation changes in response to rewards in those who experience early adversity however the results are extremely varied (Novick et al., 2018).

al. 1974, Sablayrolles 2003, Frisson and Pickering 2007, Rodd et al. 2012). Existing studies highlight differences as to whether lexical innovation applies to form and/or meaning. It has been argued that neological intuition (i.e. the speakers\u2019 ability to evaluate lexical novelty) depends on at least two linguistic variables: the (non-)novelty of the form and the (non-)regularity of the process that produces neologisms. In this study we focus on the latter, and investigate the effect of polysemy regularity (Apresjan 1974) on the identification of novel word senses in French. Novel word senses are created for the experiment, either by metaphor or metonymy, and used alternatively in their original sense or in the new one. Furthermore, we distinguish degrees of polysemy regularity and hypothesize that they determine metalinguistic judgments about lexical novelty. The more regular a novel word sense is, the less neologically salient it is, and the more neological intuition it is likely to raise.

Existing studies highlight differences as to whether lexical innovation applies to form and/or meaning. It has been argued that neological intuition (i.e. the speakers\u2019 ability to evaluate lexical novelty) depends on at least two linguistic variables: the (non-)novelty of the form and the (non-)regularity of the process that produces neologisms. In this study we focus on the latter, and investigate the effect of polysemy regularity (Apresjan 1974) on the identification of novel word senses in French. Novel word senses are created for the experiment, either by metaphor or metonymy, and used alternatively in their original sense or in the new one. Furthermore, we distinguish degrees of polysemy regularity and hypothesize that they determine metalinguistic judgments about lexical novelty. The more regular a novel word sense is, the less neologically salient it is, and the more neological intuition it is likely to raise. We test this hypothesis by presenting target words in simple sentences to French native speakers.", "q4": "The experiment is designed to test the following hypotheses:\n1. The identification of novel senses is more important in the novel sense conditions than in the original sense conditions. This effect is more important for low regularity than for high regularity. \n2. When identified by the participants as novel, low regularity novel word senses cause shorter response times than high regularity novel word senses.\n3. Fixation times are longer in the novel sense conditions than in the original sense conditions. In particular, low regularity novel word senses cause longer fixation times than high regularity novel word senses. \n4. Backtrackings are more important in the novel sense conditions than in the original sense conditions (if enough data is collected). This effect is more important for low regularity than for high regularity.\n5.

Neological stimuli will equally frequently appear with the novel and the original sense in the overall experiment. Sentences will be presented in a random order.\nThe experiment has 2 phases. In Phase 1, participants are asked to indicate whether or not there is a word used in a novel sense in a series of 100 sentences.

This writing is motivated by the large number of students who still experience misconceptions in learning physics. For this reason, efforts need to be made to reduce misconceptions in learning physics by applying the creative problem solving model. The method used in this paper is the study of literature by studying some literature to be analyzed and made conclusions. The results of this paper indicate that the application of this creative problem solving model can be a solution in an effort to reduce misconceptions in learning physics. Because, creative problem solving models can improve students' understanding of concepts and skills, so students will better understand the concept by searching for themselves and solving problems independently but still not free from teacher guidance.
