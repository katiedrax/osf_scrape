Such relations pose challenges to present theories of reasoning, but many researchers argue that people simulate a mental timeline when they think about sequences of events. A recent theory posits that to mentally simulate durative relations, reasoners do not represent all of the time points across which an event might endure. Instead, they construct discrete tokens that stand in place of the beginnings and endings of those events. The theory predicts that when reasoners need to build multiple simulations to solve a reasoning problem, they should be more prone to error. Three experiments tested the theory by providing participants sets of premises describing durative relations; participants judged whether the sets were consistent or inconsistent. The results validated the model theory's prediction. We conclude by situating the results in recent work on the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie temporal thinking.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-01-06T18:33:56.176086", "date_modified": "2019-12-07T05:13:54.290442", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": null, "analytics_key": "c2c45e91565c4372230459f626aed748498142006e558b4d0c9ebb7305bf3bc3f9a86301acd56fe97842a92b78e9c0c30b4005e58f92de01543eb34bd8ee5ca1db502715f6d274239ecb743615f6c1ec424d4a3507f05e0033ca3f86b6ca59a0c9a369c4f75bb1a09889b0e4c70e62fe6508e03bf7b822ad39ddc277d56072dfe751a1cbc3c18820e148d0f693591d73", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-01-06T18:33:56.154237", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Open-Ended Registration", "registered_meta": {"summary": {"extra": [], "value": "DR6 - Batch 2:  We had added a relation using the formulation \"Event A lasted as long as Event B.\" to DR6 that was not in DR5.

Our lab recently completed data collection for a study that tested correlations between GN and ER (data collected between October 15-December 4, 2019; N = 291). GN was measured with the Five Factor Narcissism Inventory (FFNI) and ER was measured with the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and the Geneva Emotion Recognition Test (GERT). This study was exploratory in nature as previous research is rather unclear regarding how GN correlates with behavioral measures of ER. The results of this study suggest that GN correlates negatively with both measures of ER: RMET r(289) = -.24, p &lt; .001; GERT r(289) = -.26, p &lt; .001. \n\nThe goal of this preregistered study is to (1) replicate the negative correlations between GN and ER and (2) test a followup hypothesis that mind-reading motivation (MRM) explains the negative association between GN and ER. In this study, MRM will be measured with a recently developed measure called the Mind Reading Motivation Scale (MRMS). Specifically, we will test whether the correlation between GN and ER is significantly (p &lt; .05) confounded (non-causally mediated) by MRM. That is, whether grandiose narcissists are generally unmotivated to read the minds of others and this is why they perform poorly on tests of emotion recognition.

This hypothesis will be tested using confound analysis. Confound analysis (CA) is mathematically identical to mediation analysis (MA), however, unlike MA, CA is not causal in nature. There is no need to assume that GN causes MRM, which would be necessary to establish causal mediation. Rather, MRM is assumed to be a trait-level characteristic of GN that confounds (i.e., explains/accounts for) the association between GN and ER. In other words, individuals with high levels of GN are also hypothesized to have low levels of MRM, which is hypothesized to explain why individuals with GN perform poorly on measures of ER."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

GN was measured with the Five Factor Narcissism Inventory (FFNI) and ER was measured with the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and the Geneva Emotion Recognition Test (GERT).

(https://whatworks-csc.org.uk/).\n\nBackground\n\nSigns of Safety (S of S) is an approach to child protection that was developed in Australia in the 1990s. S of S is now widely used in children\u2019s social care in England (used in its \u2018pure\u2019 form or in \u2018some form\u2019 in least 91 local authorities), despite little to no evidence around the effects of using this model. The Department for Education (DfE) supported Munro, Turnell and Murphy (MTM) Consulting, under Wave 1 of the Education Innovation Programme, to work with 10 local authorities in England to implement S of S. The 10 pilot local authorities were evaluated by Health Social Care Workforce Research Unit - King's College London (HSCWRU). HSCWRU is currently conducting further evaluation of S of S with 8 of the same local authorities plus an additional local authority in Wave 2 of the Innovation Programme. What Works for Children\u2019s Social Care (WWCSC) is complementing the HSCWRU\u2019s evaluation in this phase through conducting a difference-in-difference analysis. The aim of this analysis is to obtain quasi-causal estimates of the effect of S of S on:\n\n\u2022\tThe duration of assessments\n\u2022\tThe likelihood of an initial child protection conference\n\u2022\tThe likelihood of cases designated as 'no further action' (NFA)to be re-referred\n\u2022\tThe likelihood of cases to be re-referred and result in a child protection plan (CPP) \n\u2022\tThe likelihood of a child or young person becoming looked after (CLA)\n\u2022\tThe share of kinship care vs non-kinship care \n\nQuasi-causal estimates are useful to get to an accurate picture of the effect of S of S and so can help decision-makers in local authorities to make decisions on whether or not to invest in S of S.

In particular, this will involve matching on the trends of the outcome measures over the last few years, rather than the levels of those outcome measures. Matches are identified on the basis of similarity (the inverse of the Euclidean distance).\n\nPrior to analysis, each local authority will be matched with two candidate control local authorities based on trends in our outcomes of interest. This matching having been completed, we will estimate the effect of the intervention on the outcomes of interest via a regression (linear for continuous dependent variables and logistic for binary dependent variables) that includes an indicator for treatment or control (LAs that are implementing Signs of Safety or not) , an indicator for before or after treatment (whether LAs implementing Signs of Safety have implemented it at time t) and an interaction term between the two. The coefficient on the interaction term is the coefficient of interest.\n\nWe control for time trends through year dummies and include individual and local authority level characteristics as controls. Standard errors are clustered at the local authority level.\n\nWe include data for t-1 and from t+e until the current year where e is the time taken to reach a steady state to allow the evaluation of the programme to start when teams understand and have become accustomed to new ways of working (the embedding period). The time taken to reach a steady state comes from triangulation of qualitative work conducted by Mary Baginsky and a survey of the pilot LAs at a SofS leadership day. For some local authorities this is a gap of up to 36 months from when SofS started until it reached a steady state. We investigate whether the estimated timing of the steady state affects the treatment effect in the sensitivity analysis.\n\nDiD involves multiple observations of the control and treatment groups over time. This can create serial correlation where errors in one period transfer to another. Serial correlation can be a particularly important issue in the DiD context because of the inclusion of fairly long time series, dependent variables which are commonly used  are typically highly positively serially correlated, and the treatment variable changes little within a local authority over time. Serial correlation underestimates the standard errors, meaning that we have too much confidence in the result, and we get a higher rate of false positives. We check for serial correlation using the Durbin-Watson test. We consider there to be serial correlation if the test statistic is outside of the range of 1.5 - 2.5. Serial correlation is partially taken care of when clustering at the local authority level. To counteract individual-level serial correlation, we also try a multilevel model with standard errors clustered at both the individual and the local authority level and consider whether the multilevel model produces a statistically different and practically different estimate of the treatment effect to the treatment effect estimated from the primary analysis  (where we take practically different to be 20% above or below). \n\nSecondary Analysis:\nAdditional subgroup analyses \nWe further investigate whether the effect of SofS is more pronounced within certain subgroups (subject to availability of the data). We investigate whether local authorities which self-report to have SofS embedded well have different treatment effects. We categorise local authorities based on a composite of their self-reported profiling scores. The score came from the  \u201cProfiling survey\u201d conducted by HSCWRU as of the beginning of Wave 2: 0-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10 where 0 is \u201cnot at all embedded\u201d and 10 is \u201cfully embedded\u201d. \nWe also categorise local authorities based on their Ofsted ratings and MTM\u2019s scoring of the quality of delivery and conduct subgroup analyses for each of these categories. We run separate regressions for each of these categories and plot the coefficient on the DiD variable against the profiling score to visually inspect whether the subgroups have different treatment effects. \n\nChannels\nWe test whether SofS influences the duration of assessments by increasing the number of same day assessments by including a dummy for same day assessment in the regression and reporting whether it is significant.\n\nPractice models\nWe recognise that there may be overlap between the SofS model and two other popular practice models, Restorative Justice and Reclaiming Social Work. If the mechanisms through which the three practice models are expected to affect outcomes are the same, comparing the pilot SofS local authorities to local authorities using Restorative Justice or Reclaiming Social Work would bias downwards any potential effect. We ask the comparator local authorities whether they use either practice model. In this analysis, the original Signs of Safety indicator becomes a three-level indicator of whether the local authority received SofS (the base category), a similar practice model (Restorative Justice and Reclaiming Social Work), or neither.\n\n\nWe will further validate our results through sensitivity analyses.

S of S is now widely used in children\u2019s social care in England (used in its \u2018pure\u2019 form or in \u2018some form\u2019 in least 91 local authorities), despite little to no evidence around the effects of using this model. The Department for Education (DfE) supported Munro, Turnell and Murphy (MTM) Consulting, under Wave 1 of the Education Innovation Programme, to work with 10 local authorities in England to implement S of S. The 10 pilot local authorities were evaluated by Health Social Care Workforce Research Unit - King's College London (HSCWRU). HSCWRU is currently conducting further evaluation of S of S with 8 of the same local authorities plus an additional local authority in Wave 2 of the Innovation Programme. What Works for Children\u2019s Social Care (WWCSC) is complementing the HSCWRU\u2019s evaluation in this phase through conducting a difference-in-difference analysis. The aim of this analysis is to obtain quasi-causal estimates of the effect of S of S on:\n\n\u2022\tThe duration of assessments\n\u2022\tThe likelihood of an initial child protection conference\n\u2022\tThe likelihood of cases designated as 'no further action' (NFA)to be re-referred\n\u2022\tThe likelihood of cases to be re-referred and result in a child protection plan (CPP) \n\u2022\tThe likelihood of a child or young person becoming looked after (CLA)\n\u2022\tThe share of kinship care vs non-kinship care \n\nQuasi-causal estimates are useful to get to an accurate picture of the effect of S of S and so can help decision-makers in local authorities to make decisions on whether or not to invest in S of S. This work builds on WWCSC\u2019s systematic review of S of S focusing on reducing entry to care.", "q4": "Although there are a range of possible outcomes that could be assessed, we focus on only two primary outcomes to avoid problems associated with multiple comparisons. These two outcome variables were selected on the basis that they have shown promise in the Wave 1 evaluation and Wave 2 interim findings, and in discussions with HSCWRU. \nOur hypotheses are as follows:\n\u2022\tS of S reduces the duration of assessments. \n\u2022\tS of S reduces the likelihood of an initial child protection conference. \nBased on discussions with MTM to better understand S of S's theory of change, in addition to hypotheses regarding the primary outcomes, we will test three secondary hypotheses, namely: \n\u2022\tS of S reduces the rate of re-referrals of cases that have previously been assessed as no further action (NFA). \n\u2022\tS of S affects the rate of re-referrals that lead to a child protection plan (CPP) or to a child becoming looked after (CLA). \n\u2022\tS of S increases the rate of kinship care and reduces the rate of non-kinship care for children who are looked after.

Here we will use placebo tests which recode comparator and treatment local authorities and we explore the effect of time-varying treatment effects on the outcomes, given that the treatment effect might be sensitive to the timing chosen for the treatment to be fully embedded and implemented.", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href":
