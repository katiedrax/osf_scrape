public believe what their leaders tell them about national security and foreign policy issues? Relative to other policy arenas, national security entails a great deal of secrecy. The public is often unable to observe the policy-making process to fully evaluate the consequences of decisions owing to the unavailability of evidence that might help determine if and when things go wrong. This generates a moral hazard problem. The president can exploit secrecy to cover up policies that are poorly thought out, morally controversial, or serve special interests. The president may even be able to conceal missions that fail because of poor execution and planning. If constituents cannot trust the president to speak honestly, accountability in national security policy is much harder. As such, the question of credibility is vital. Given this information asymmetry between leaders and publics, and the pervasiveness of secrecy, do the latter typically believe what the former tells them? We argue that denials are often persuasive because the public is willing to punish liars. When the president explicitly denies a controversial policy that is later confirmed true, the public is more outraged and bloodthirsty than if the president had come clean in the first place. Our logic builds on theory in psychology about deceit. It also builds on rational theories of credibility. If we are right, scandalous rumors present a tense choice for the president: They can admit wrong-doing and accept a lesser punishment or deny rumors and hope that the rumor is never confirmed. If the punishment for lying is large enough, only presidents that believe they are unlikely to be exposed later will deny the rumor. Under the assumption that false rumors are, on average, less likely to be confirmed true, it follows that the fear of being caught in a lie will deter the president from lying in the first place. When wrongdoers are deterred from lying by the fear of getting caught, the act of denial is more persuasive. Of course, lying is not the only thing the public punishes their leaders for. Discovering that the president has authorized an egregious program is another source of outrage. How much blood the public demands will depend on both whether the president lied and how egregious the rumor is. We expect that denials are only persuasive when the outrage that lying generates is large relative to how bad the policy is. The reason is as follows. If the president admits to an illegal or extremely egregious policy, they will face an enormous punishment with certainty. If a denial presents even a miniscule chance of avoiding this outrage, the president will take it. As a result, no matter if the rumor is true or not, the president will deny their involvement. But since all have incentives to deny it is difficult for the public to judge if the statements are credible. Unfortunately, this means that the president's denial is the least persuasive on the issues that the public really cares about. When rumors emerge about the most controversial and odious policies, nothing the president says will be persuasive. By contrast, the president will be able to lie most successfully when the public is already skeptical of rumors that emerge. In an era of fake news, this means that the president has little incentive to come clean when a rumor emerges. This makes the media's job more difficult in exposing nefarious government activity."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1a: When the public discovers that their leader authorized an unpopular national security program, they will disapprove of their leader more if the leader had previously denied his involvement in the program, than if the leader had never denied involvement.

H2a: When faced with a rumor about a national security scandal, the public will be less likely to believe the rumor is true, if the president denies the rumor than if the president relies on national security classification, or does not comment.

The public is often unable to observe the policy-making process to fully evaluate the consequences of decisions owing to the unavailability of evidence that might help determine if and when things go wrong. This generates a moral hazard problem. The president can exploit secrecy to cover up policies that are poorly thought out, morally controversial, or serve special interests. The president may even be able to conceal missions that fail because of poor execution and planning. If constituents cannot trust the president to speak honestly, accountability in national security policy is much harder. As such, the question of credibility is vital. Given this information asymmetry between leaders and publics, and the pervasiveness of secrecy, do the latter typically believe what the former tells them? We argue that denials are often persuasive because the public is willing to punish liars. When the president explicitly denies a controversial policy that is later confirmed true, the public is more outraged and bloodthirsty than if the president had come clean in the first place. Our logic builds on theory in psychology about deceit. It also builds on rational theories of credibility. If we are right, scandalous rumors present a tense choice for the president: They can admit wrong-doing and accept a lesser punishment or deny rumors and hope that the rumor is never confirmed. If the punishment for lying is large enough, only presidents that believe they are unlikely to be exposed later will deny the rumor. Under the assumption that false rumors are, on average, less likely to be confirmed true, it follows that the fear of being caught in a lie will deter the president from lying in the first place. When wrongdoers are deterred from lying by the fear of getting caught, the act of denial is more persuasive. Of course, lying is not the only thing the public punishes their leaders for. Discovering that the president has authorized an egregious program is another source of outrage. How much blood the public demands will depend on both whether the president lied and how egregious the rumor is. We expect that denials are only persuasive when the outrage that lying generates is large relative to how bad the policy is. The reason is as follows. If the president admits to an illegal or extremely egregious policy, they will face an enormous punishment with certainty. If a denial presents even a miniscule chance of avoiding this outrage, the president will take it. As a result, no matter if the rumor is true or not, the president will deny their involvement. But since all have incentives to deny it is difficult for the public to judge if the statements are credible. Unfortunately, this means that the president's denial is the least persuasive on the issues that the public really cares about. When rumors emerge about the most controversial and odious policies, nothing the president says will be persuasive. By contrast, the president will be able to lie most successfully when the public is already skeptical of rumors that emerge. In an era of fake news, this means that the president has little incentive to come clean when a rumor emerges. This makes the media's job more difficult in exposing nefarious government activity.", "q16": "H1a: When the public discovers that their leader authorized an unpopular national security program, they will disapprove of their leader more if the leader had previously denied his involvement in the program, than if the leader had never denied involvement. H1b: When the public discovers that their leader authorized an unpopular national security program, they are more likely to prioritize punishing their leader personally over preventing similar programs from happening again if the leader had previously denied his involvement, rather than if the leader had never denied involvement. H2a: When faced with a rumor about a national security scandal, the public will be less likely to believe the rumor is true, if the president denies the rumor than if the president relies on national security classification, or does not comment. H2b: The more egregious the rumor is, the less persuaded the public will be if the president denies the rumor is true.

Affected by rapid urbanization in recent decades, small urban waterways in Jiangsu province generally suffer from poor water quality. These waterways, which are encountered by urban residents as they go about their lives, are polluted by municipal sewage and garbage. There is optimism that citizen involvement in the management of pollution can help to improve environmental quality in China, since it helps local officials identify specific instances of pollution and signals the kinds of problems that are likely to cause the most discontent among the population, which both central and local governments would like to avoid. This experiment tests whether the organization of citizen monitoring of small urban waterways by a non-governmental organization will result in improved water quality through the remediation efforts of governments and decrease the amount of dumping and littering in the areas surrounding waterways. Small urban waterways are an excellent setting to test whether bottom-up, responsive environmental governance leads to better environmental quality. Teams of monitors will be trained to perform simple chemical analyses of water quality on a regular basis and that information will be disseminated in different ways according to treatment arm."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Our primary hypothesis is that the dissemination of information from citizen monitoring to government agencies, the public, or both will result in improved water quality, both in terms of chemical measurements and in terms of the amount of littering and dumping in waterways. We expect that the dissemination of information to local governments will have a greater impact on water quality when the information is also disseminated to the public, as this will increase pressure on local officials to be responsive to citizens\u2019 concerns. To the extent that water quality is improved as a function of the intervention, we hypothesize that both the market and non-market value of living near waterways will increase. We also plan to test for conditional effects along two dimensions. First, we hypothesize that richer neighborhoods will be more likely to see improvements to water quality because of their greater political clout. Second, we hypothesize that the most severely polluted rivers at baseline will be more likely to see improved water quality from government remediation. In addition to testing for these heterogeneous effects, we will conduct exploratory tests on a number of mechanisms, such as norm change among residents, officials\u2019 perceptions of citizen pressure and scrutiny, and knowledge about localized pollution among both residents and officials."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "Our core estimation strategy will be model-assisted randomization inference, taking into account a blocking strategy based on the baseline index value of water quality.

Affected by rapid urbanization in recent decades, small urban waterways in Jiangsu province generally suffer from poor water quality. These waterways, which are encountered by urban residents as they go about their lives, are polluted by municipal sewage and garbage. There is optimism that citizen involvement in the management of pollution can help to improve environmental quality in China, since it helps local officials identify specific instances of pollution and signals the kinds of problems that are likely to cause the most discontent among the population, which both central and local governments would like to avoid. This experiment tests whether the organization of citizen monitoring of small urban waterways by a non-governmental organization will result in improved water quality through the remediation efforts of governments and decrease the amount of dumping and littering in the areas surrounding waterways. Small urban waterways are an excellent setting to test whether bottom-up, responsive environmental governance leads to better environmental quality. Teams of monitors will be trained to perform simple chemical analyses of water quality on a regular basis and that information will be disseminated in different ways according to treatment arm.", "q16": "Our primary hypothesis is that the dissemination of information from citizen monitoring to government agencies, the public, or both will result in improved water quality, both in terms of chemical measurements and in terms of the amount of littering and dumping in waterways. We expect that the dissemination of information to local governments will have a greater impact on water quality when the information is also disseminated to the public, as this will increase pressure on local officials to be responsive to citizens\u2019 concerns. To the extent that water quality is improved as a function of the intervention, we hypothesize that both the market and non-market value of living near waterways will increase. We also plan to test for conditional effects along two dimensions. First, we hypothesize that richer neighborhoods will be more likely to see improvements to water quality because of their greater political clout. Second, we hypothesize that the most severely polluted rivers at baseline will be more likely to see improved water quality from government remediation. In addition to testing for these heterogeneous effects, we will conduct exploratory tests on a number of mechanisms, such as norm change among residents, officials\u2019 perceptions of citizen pressure and scrutiny, and knowledge about localized pollution among both residents and officials.", "q17": "Our core estimation strategy will be model-assisted randomization inference, taking into account a blocking strategy based on the baseline index value of water quality. To create blocks of waterways that have similar baseline conditions, we will sort waterways based on the baseline index value for water quality, forming blocks of eight for complete random

(Ostrom 1990). However, modern technologies, booming populations, and burgeoning resource demands have created new challenges for natural resource management. Critically, might natural resource governance improve if communities' capacity were enhanced to monitor resource use? Organized scrutiny by stakeholders has long been suggested as a key method of governing the commons (Ostrom 1990), yet the evidence base to delineate traits relevant to the most effective resource-monitoring systems remains limited. In some realms, such as health care, evidence from a prominent randomized trial suggests that community monitoring can have large effects (Bjorkman and Svensson 2009). In other contexts, however, community monitoring appears to have more modest results (Lassibille et al. 2011) or none at all (Olken 2007). It is possible that new technologies or novel methods of civil society organization may improve the effectiveness of stakeholder watches, but again, these programs await testing through field experiments. Broadly, there are two channels by which community monitoring and information collected by monitors might improve resource use. First, as communities learn about their own usage patterns and receive messages regarding the norms of appropriate use, individuals may self-regulate and deliberately decrease unsustainable overuse or otherwise optimize resource extraction for the longer term. This mechanism may be thought of as \u201cbottom-up\u201d regulation. Second, local governance authorities, which we refer to here as \u201cmanagement bodies,\u201d may impose restrictions or sanction the misuse of natural resources through fees, fines, control of licensing, social injunction, and other such \u201ctop-down\u201d regulation, and community monitoring may both inform management bodies' work and increase their effort. These management bodies may be local committees charged with resource regulation or may be more formalized government agencies overseeing usage through licensing and enforcement, and individual teams in the Metaketa engage a range of management bodies at different levels of organization and formality.

The messages from monitors also contain information about the state of the natural resource that may previously have been unknown and whose lack may have led users to mismanage their consumption. Awareness of resource use problems alone should thus prompt self-regulation. The effects on sustainable use caused by enhanced community monitoring should increase users' satisfaction with resource use in the community.

All studies utilize behavioral measures of outcomes, including in-person measurement of forest stocks and remote sensing of vegetation in Liberia, Peru and Uganda; standardized measurement of groundwater levels in Brazil; measurement of water pumping costs in Costa Rica; and measurement of water pollution levels in China. All studies save Costa Rica employ household surveys at endline to measure user perceptions of resource management, satisfaction with resource management, knowledge of resource use, and stewardship over the natural resources. In the Brazil study, monitors will measure and report groundwater levels with an expected effect on the change in groundwater levels from baseline to endline. In China, monitors will measure and report water pollution across an array of chemical indicators with the information expected to affect changes in pollution levels from baseline to endline. In Costa Rica, monitors will measure and report water quality and supply along with water system conditions and compliance, expecting that the information will cause a change in water pumping costs. In Liberia, researchers will engage community members in participatory valuation and will encourage monitoring of forest stocks and will also produce term sheets of resource value with an expectation of change in forest stocks from baseline to endline. In Peru, researchers will train and equip community monitors to undertake the assessment of forest encroachment, expecting changes in forest stocks from the beginning to the end of the study period.

All research teams will also aggregate the information collected by the monitors and provide it for dissemination \u2013 either by the monitors or by the researchers themselves \u2013 to both the local management body and to the targeted group of users in the community. Dissemination will occur either by the researchers or by local partners. The planned interventions are enumerated in detail in the pre-analysis plans of each of the six studies. Treatments will run for nine to 12 months. All studies utilize behavioral measures of outcomes, including in-person measurement of forest stocks and remote sensing of vegetation in Liberia, Peru and Uganda; standardized measurement of groundwater levels in Brazil; measurement of water pumping costs in Costa Rica; and measurement of water pollution levels in China. All studies save Costa Rica employ household surveys at endline to measure user perceptions of resource management, satisfaction with resource management, knowledge of resource use, and stewardship over the natural resources. In the Brazil study, monitors will measure and report groundwater levels with an expected effect on the change in groundwater levels from baseline to endline. In China, monitors will measure and report water pollution across an array of chemical indicators with the information expected to affect changes in pollution levels from baseline to endline. In Costa Rica, monitors will measure and report water quality and supply along with water system conditions and compliance, expecting that the information will cause a change in water pumping costs. In Liberia, researchers will engage community members in participatory valuation and will encourage monitoring of forest stocks and will also produce term sheets of resource value with an expectation of change in forest stocks from baseline to endline. In Peru, researchers will train and equip community monitors to undertake the assessment of forest encroachment, expecting changes in forest stocks from the beginning to the end of the study period. In Uganda, monitors will track forest stock and forest use along random forest transects with an eye to their effects on changes in both forest stocks and forest use.", "q18": "Brazil, China, Costa Rica, Liberia, Peru, Uganda", "q19": "6 studies", "q20": "Yes", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "IRB details contained in each study's registration", "q25": "Various", "q26": "Other (describe in text box below)", "q27": "Researchers, All studies save Brazil employ a third party, typically an NGO, to implement the intervention; in Brazil, researchers will implement.
