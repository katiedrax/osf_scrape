political engagement? With the spread of low-cost hand-held phones to all corners of the globe, the impact of the mobile technology revolution on politics is of great importance. Existing observational studies generally find a positive association between mobile communication and civic and political participation (Campbell and Kwak 2010; Lee et al. 2014), including on violent and non-violent mobilization (Pierskalla and Hollenbach 2013; Manacorda and Tesei 2016). There have been fewer experimental studies, however, on the effect of mobile phone ownership on political engagement. Those studies that have been undertaken focus almost exclusively on the effect of Short Message Service (SMS) texts, or text messages, on inducing voter turnout (Dale and Strauss 2009; Malhotra et al. 2011), shaping vote choice (Buntaine, Bush, Jablonski, Nielson, and Pickering 2016) and eliciting citizen feedback (Grossman et al. 2015a; Grossman et al. 2015b). As a cheap and efficient means to disseminate information in bulk, mobile messaging has been embraced by international organizations, non-governmental organizations, governments and private corporations to reach out to a large number of end-users. In the political realm, this transformation in the intensity and extensity of information exchange between citizens and their governments, especially in non-democratic states where such linkages are traditionally weak, may help to strengthen the citizen-government feedback loop that underpins political accountability (Bailur and Gigler 2014). However, existing experimental research probing the effects of mobile-based informational campaigns on political or civic engagement rarely takes into consideration the mediating effects phone ownership may have. Who holds the phone likely affects who receives information and ultimately who participates in political and civic life. This matters because critical disparities in mobile phone ownership exist both across society and within households. According to existing research, women are 14 percent less likely to own a mobile phone than men in low or middle-income countries (GSMA 2015). The gap is even starker among rural women or between literate and illiterate individuals. One broader implication of this digital divide is informational campaigns designed to empower citizens and improve political accountability may be further marginalizing the marginalized and reinforcing or even worsening social inequality. This study represents the first field experiment to examine the effect of heterogeneous phone ownership on the efficacy of a mobile technology-based informational campaign on inducing civic engagement. It piggy-backs on an existing large-scale field experiment supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that examined the impact of mobile phone ownership on the uptake and usage of digital financial services (Roessler, Myamba, Carroll, and Nielson 2017). It represents a unique opportunity to better understand how mobile phone ownership affects civic engagement through the mechanism of women\u2019s empowerment. We test the impact of mobile phone ownership on civic engagement in the context of a land rights training workshop held by the Tanzanian non-governmental organization, HAKIARDHI. A training workshop on land rights and land tenure makes a good test of direct mobile communication on female civic engagement as prevailing patriarchal norms and interests may affect women\u2019s ability to learn about such opportunities. While formally women\u2019s right to own and inherit land is safeguarded by the 1999 Tanzanian Land Act, in many communities customary practices based on patrilineal principles continue to prevail. Thus, in the case of divorce or death of their husbands women are often denied from inheriting land (Duncan 2015). As a land rights advocacy organization, HAKIARDHI holds a number of training workshops, including those for women to educate them about their legal protections and how to act on their rights. Based on our past work in Tanzania, there is a demand among women for this type of information. Among a similar sample of Tanzanian women, more than 80% of respondents viewed lack of equal rights to own and inherit land as an important issue women in Tanzania face and nearly 90% of the participants said they would be interested in attending a workshop to learn more about land and inheritance rights for women (Roessler, Myamba, Carroll and Nielson 2016)."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Our primary hypothesis is that mobile phone ownership increases civic engagement. Specifically, we hypothesize that those who have owned their for over a year will be more likely to attend the workshop than those who have recently received their phones. We also hypothesize that subjects who received a smart phone will be more likely to attend than those who (1) had a basic phone at the start of study (Experiment 2 control) or (2) received a basic phone at the start of the study (Experiment 1 basic phone group). As phone ownership may also increase economic and income-generating opportunities, phone owners may also face higher opportunity costs to participate in the workshops. But given the salience of this issue among women (based on self-reported information from our participants on important issues facing women), we expect the efficacy mechanism to trump the opportunity cost mechanism. Our secondary hypothesis is that those who receive the economic and gender equality encouragement messages will be more likely to attend the training than those who receive an encouragement absent of these topic specific encouragements. We also expect interaction effects between phone treatments and the messages given the increased economic well-being and empowerment that comes from phone ownership, which we expect to be activated by the messages. In addition to testing the effect of personal phone ownership on civic engagement, in this study we are also able to probe the mechanisms of such an effect. Mobile phone ownership can affect civic engagement through two channels: an information mechanism and an empowerment mechanism. As everyone will have a mobile phone and receive the same information, this study will allow us to eliminate the information mechanism and focus on the empowerment mechanism. Empowerment is broadly defined as \u201cthe expansion in people\u2019s ability to make strategic life choices in a context where this ability was previously denied to them,\u201d and attributes this to increased access to resources and agency. We expect that mobile phone ownership over the previous year engenders higher levels of agency and individual efficacy and these attributes will result in higher turnout to the workshop among the phone group recipients."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "This study represents the first-of-its-kind to experimentally test how owning a mobile phone affects civic engagement. Piggybacking on an existing Gates-funded field experiment on mobile technology and use of digital financial services that we are running among 2,000 women in Tanzania, we plan to leverage random variation in mobile phone ownership to test its effect on women's attendance in a workshop on women as drivers of economic development. The original study had two experiments in one: Experiment 1 included 1350 female non-phone owners with the following study groups: A. Basic Phone: 385 women received basic handsets B.

Smartphone: 280 women received basic handsets B. $60 Cash Transfer: 105 women received a small cash grant D. Control Group: 265 women were in the control group\u2014and promised to receive a smartphone at endline This civic engagement study will come on the heels of the completion of the mobile phone study. At the end of the mobile phone study, all of the women in the control groups will receive mobile phones. For the civic engagement study, after distributing the basic phones and smartphones to the control group, we will invite all women to a workshop on land rights. All women will be invited via SMS. Thus everyone should be informed about the land rights workshop since at the time of the study everyone should have a phone. We will message participants through the following channels: 1.) the SIM card we gave them for the mobile phone experiment;2.) the best contact number to reach them, which we asked about at end of mobile phone experiment; 3.) the alternative contact persons through which participants said we could reach them. We will message through all of these channels to ensure that word gets out about the workshops to all participants, whether in treatment groups or control groups. The effect of sending messages of encouragement to promote some behavior has been well studied in other contexts (for full review see DellaVigna and Gentzkow 2010). In addition to our main source of exogenous variation in this study from the random assignment of phone ownership, we will also randomly vary the content of the invitation messages sent to study participants, contributing to this body of work on encouragement messaging. In a full factorial design, we will test whether messages that encourage participation, through either the priming of personal economic benefits or community-level wellbeing, increases interest in and attendance at workshops on a civic topic (compared to a control message without such priming). Our primary outcome measure is meeting attendance, which will be recorded by our field team during the workshops. We will also conduct a phone survey will all invitees following the workshops."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Tanzania"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "2000"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value":

political engagement? With the spread of low-cost hand-held phones to all corners of the globe, the impact of the mobile technology revolution on politics is of great importance. Existing observational studies generally find a positive association between mobile communication and civic and political participation (Campbell and Kwak 2010; Lee et al. 2014), including on violent and non-violent mobilization (Pierskalla and Hollenbach 2013; Manacorda and Tesei 2016). There have been fewer experimental studies, however, on the effect of mobile phone ownership on political engagement. Those studies that have been undertaken focus almost exclusively on the effect of Short Message Service (SMS) texts, or text messages, on inducing voter turnout (Dale and Strauss 2009; Malhotra et al. 2011), shaping vote choice (Buntaine, Bush, Jablonski, Nielson, and Pickering 2016) and eliciting citizen feedback (Grossman et al. 2015a; Grossman et al. 2015b). As a cheap and efficient means to disseminate information in bulk, mobile messaging has been embraced by international organizations, non-governmental organizations, governments and private corporations to reach out to a large number of end-users. In the political realm, this transformation in the intensity and extensity of information exchange between citizens and their governments, especially in non-democratic states where such linkages are traditionally weak, may help to strengthen the citizen-government feedback loop that underpins political accountability (Bailur and Gigler 2014). However, existing experimental research probing the effects of mobile-based informational campaigns on political or civic engagement rarely takes into consideration the mediating effects phone ownership may have. Who holds the phone likely affects who receives information and ultimately who participates in political and civic life. This matters because critical disparities in mobile phone ownership exist both across society and within households. According to existing research, women are 14 percent less likely to own a mobile phone than men in low or middle-income countries (GSMA 2015). The gap is even starker among rural women or between literate and illiterate individuals. One broader implication of this digital divide is informational campaigns designed to empower citizens and improve political accountability may be further marginalizing the marginalized and reinforcing or even worsening social inequality. This study represents the first field experiment to examine the effect of heterogeneous phone ownership on the efficacy of a mobile technology-based informational campaign on inducing civic engagement. It piggy-backs on an existing large-scale field experiment supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that examined the impact of mobile phone ownership on the uptake and usage of digital financial services (Roessler, Myamba, Carroll, and Nielson 2017). It represents a unique opportunity to better understand how mobile phone ownership affects civic engagement through the mechanism of women\u2019s empowerment. We test the impact of mobile phone ownership on civic engagement in the context of a land rights training workshop held by the Tanzanian non-governmental organization, HAKIARDHI. A training workshop on land rights and land tenure makes a good test of direct mobile communication on female civic engagement as prevailing patriarchal norms and interests may affect women\u2019s ability to learn about such opportunities. While formally women\u2019s right to own and inherit land is safeguarded by the 1999 Tanzanian Land Act, in many communities customary practices based on patrilineal principles continue to prevail. Thus, in the case of divorce or death of their husbands women are often denied from inheriting land (Duncan 2015). As a land rights advocacy organization, HAKIARDHI holds a number of training workshops, including those for women to educate them about their legal protections and how to act on their rights. Based on our past work in Tanzania, there is a demand among women for this type of information. Among a similar sample of Tanzanian women, more than 80% of respondents viewed lack of equal rights to own and inherit land as an important issue women in Tanzania face and nearly 90% of the participants said they would be interested in attending a workshop to learn more about land and inheritance rights for women (Roessler, Myamba, Carroll and Nielson 2016).", "q16": "Our primary hypothesis is that mobile phone ownership increases civic engagement. Specifically, we hypothesize that those who have owned their for over a year will be more likely to attend the workshop than those who have recently received their phones. We also hypothesize that subjects who received a smart phone will be more likely to attend than those who (1) had a basic phone at the start of study (Experiment 2 control) or (2) received a basic phone at the start of the study (Experiment 1 basic phone group). As phone ownership may also increase economic and income-generating opportunities, phone owners may also face higher opportunity costs to participate in the workshops. But given the salience of this issue among women (based on self-reported information from our participants on important issues facing women), we expect the efficacy mechanism to trump the opportunity cost mechanism. Our secondary hypothesis is that those who receive the economic and gender equality encouragement messages will be more likely to attend the training than those who receive an encouragement absent of these topic specific encouragements. We also expect interaction effects between phone treatments and the messages given the increased economic well-being and empowerment that comes from phone ownership, which we expect to be activated by the messages. In addition to testing the effect of personal phone ownership on civic engagement, in this study we are also able to probe the mechanisms of such an effect. Mobile phone ownership can affect civic engagement through two channels: an information mechanism and an empowerment mechanism. As everyone will have a mobile phone and receive the same information, this study will allow us to eliminate the information mechanism and focus on the empowerment mechanism. Empowerment is broadly defined as \u201cthe expansion in people\u2019s ability to make strategic life choices in a context where this ability was previously denied to them,\u201d and attributes this to increased access to resources and agency. We expect that mobile phone ownership over the previous year engenders higher levels of agency and individual efficacy and these attributes will result in higher turnout to the workshop among the phone group recipients.", "q17": "This study represents the first-of-its-kind to experimentally test how owning a mobile phone affects civic engagement. Piggybacking on an existing Gates-funded field experiment on mobile technology and use of digital financial services that we are running among 2,000 women in Tanzania, we plan to leverage random variation in mobile phone ownership to test its effect on women's attendance in a workshop on women as drivers of economic development. The original study had two experiments in one: Experiment 1 included 1350 female non-phone owners with the following study groups: A. Basic Phone: 385 women received basic handsets B. Smartphone: 385 women received smartphones C. $20 Cash Transfer: 175 women received a small cash grant D. Control Group: 405 women were in the control group\u2014and promised to receive a basic handset at endline Experiment 2 included 650 female phone owners with the following study groups: A.

Individuals with weak prior attitudes exposed to a counterframes will report more diffuse, less coherent associations with drilling. These individuals will also report greater issue confusion and attitude uncertainty than those exposed to a single frame. Motivated Reasoner Predictions Individuals with strong priors exposed to an attitudinally congruent frame will elaborate upon the concepts from the frame. Individual with strong priors exposed to an attitudinally incongruent frame will think of concepts that help them resist the incongruent frame.
