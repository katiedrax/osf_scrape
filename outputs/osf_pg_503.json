We will start with a model that includes all of the factors we have predictions about (that is, \u2018Authoritarianism\u2019, \u2018SDO\u2019, \u2018Authoritarianism family\u2019, \u2018Authoritarianism nation\u2019, \u2018SDO family\u2019, \u2018SDO nation\u2019, \u2018pro-trait wording\u2019, \u2018con-trait wording\u2019).

We will examine whether the predictive strength of family-level Authoritarianism and SDO is each retained when accounting for the other. We will examine whether the effect of family-level Authoritarianism and SDO on the nation-level latent variables is dependent on whether the participant said that national-level government was important for their life (as expected from Stellmacher &amp; Petzel, 2005).

We will then run versions of this model while controlling for other variables: whether data collection was rural or peri-urban (i.e. if it was in Mele), participant age, sex, and schooling year. We will then run similar analyses but where the predictor variable will be binary: whether data collection was in peri-urban Mele or a rural community. Again we will run a model with this predictor\u2019s effects on family- and nation-level SDO and on family- and nation-level Authoritarianism, and after, the same model but controlling for the other variables both separately and together (these variables being: whether the participant had employment, participant age, sex, and education level)."}, "outliers": {"extra": [], "value": "Two cases will be excluded from the dataset to give the 162-strong sample size.

If individuals have stable dispositions for each axis, then there should be a predictive relationship between their answers at the family level and nation level. 3) Is increased dependence on wage labour associated with increased SDO and reduced Authoritarianism scores? If exposure to competitive and unequal environments leads to higher SDO, increased dependence on wage labour should be associated with higher SDO, and if dependence on a social group leads to Authoritarianism then increased dependence on wage labour should be associated with lower Authoritarianism.

After answering these predictions, we will check to see if the resulting model\u2019s effects are robust to controls for several supplementary variables. These supplementary variables will be: participant age, sex, education level, whether they have employment (yes/no), and site of data collection (Mele village on Efate, southeast Tanna, south Pentecost, and Vetuboso on Vanua Lava). We will run models controlling for each independently and then a model controlling for all together.\nFor question 3 we will first estimate the effects of an individual-level variable for employment on SDO (family and nation) and Authoritarianism (family and nation) scores using structural equation modelling. While, as explained above, we do not have predictions for the effect of economic integration on family-level SDO, we will include the family level in the model for the purpose of exploratory analysis. We will then run versions of this model while controlling for other variables: whether data collection was rural or peri-urban (i.e. if it was in Mele), participant age, sex, and schooling year. We will then run similar analyses but where the predictor variable will be binary: whether data collection was in peri-urban Mele or a rural community. Again we will run a model with this predictor\u2019s effects on family- and nation-level SDO and on family- and nation-level Authoritarianism, and after, the same model but controlling for the other variables both separately and together (these variables being: whether the participant had employment, participant age, sex, and education level).", "outliers": "Two cases will be excluded from the dataset to give the 162-strong sample size. One case will be excluded because it was a trial run after which the interview technique was altered. Another will be excluded because a wife began answering the survey and then her husband started answering for her. Aside from these two cases, outliers will not be excluded from analyses. Only if we become unable to impute missing data in our analyses will we have to remove cases with missing data.", "dependent": "The dependent variables will be Likert scale responses of agreement or disagreement, where 1 is strong disagreement and 6 strong agreement. Four Social Dominance Orientation questions were adapted from Ho et al.'s (2015) scale and six Authoritarianism questions were adapted from Stellmacher and Petzel's (2005) scale. The same SDO and Authoritarianism questions were adapted to two levels of social organisation: family and nation, so participants were asked eight SDO questions twelve Authoritarianism questions in total. Half of the questions were worded pro-trait such that agreement with the question implied a high score in the trait, while half of the questions were worded con-trait such that agreement with the question implied a low score for the trait. Interviews were conducted in Bislama.", "conditions": "There are no separate conditions which participants were assigned to. Each participant was asked the same questions.", "hypothesis": "The study has three questions. 1) Among ni-Vanuatu participants, do questions from the SDO and Authoritarianism questionnaires, respectively, correlate with each other more than they do with questions from the other questionnaires? If SDO and Authoritarianism represent independent axes of political ideology, we should find that participants answers are more consistent within the same questionnaire than between the SDO and Authoritarianism questionnaires. 2) Do participants\u2019 SDO and Authoritarianism scores with respect to the family unit of social organisation predict SDO and Authoritarianism scores with respect to the nation unit of social organisation? If individuals have stable dispositions for each axis, then there should be a predictive relationship between their answers at the family level and nation level. 3) Is increased dependence on wage labour associated with increased SDO and reduced Authoritarianism scores? If exposure to competitive and unequal environments leads to higher SDO, increased dependence on wage labour should be associated with higher SDO, and if dependence on a social group leads to Authoritarianism then increased dependence on wage labour should be associated with lower Authoritarianism. We do not, however, make predictions about changes in family-level SDO as we lack specific literature about the effects of economic integration on hierarchies within the family.", "study_type":

Moreover, believing in mobility is a factor that has been shown to maintain the motivation of first generation students at University (Browman, Destin, Carswelld, &amp; Svobodab, 2017).\n--&gt;This theoretical approach leads to the prediction that BSM should protect self-esteem in the event of failure. Thus, an increase in BSM should reduce the effect of performance condition (success vs. difficulties) on self-esteem and disengagement. \n\nOn the other hand, other research has shown that in meritocratic environments, performance is perceived as a reliable indicator of ability (Trautwein, L\u00fcdtke, K\u00f6ller, &amp; Baumert, 2006), individuals develop self-perceptions that are consistent with the place their group occupies in the hierarchy (McCoy &amp; Major, 2007; Fraser &amp; Kick, 2000; Jost, 2001), which may widen the SES achievement gap (Darnon, Wiederkehr, Dompnier &amp; Martinot, 2017). \n--&gt;This theoretical approach leads to the prediction that BSM should make individuals particularly vulnerable to failure. Thus, an increase in BSM should increase the effect of performance condition (success vs. difficulties) on self-esteem and disengagement. \n\nThe two theoretical approaches lead to predicting a 2-way interaction between performance and BSM but in opposite directions. The goal of the present research is to test these two alternative hypotheses.
