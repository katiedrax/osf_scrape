The details of the design of the survey have been published previously. Briefly, the survey employed a cross-sectional household design that targeted adults above the age of 18 years. \nParticipants were selected in three stages from the fifth national sample surveys and evaluation programme (NASSEP V) master sample frame generated from the 2009 census data. Stage one involved the selection of Primary Sampling Units (PSUs), urban and rural clusters, using probability proportional to size (PPS) method. The second stage involved the selection of households, and finally, in the last stage, one adult was randomly selected using the Kish sampling method from the selected households. A total of 4500 eligible individuals were successfully interviewed in the survey. \nData were collected via a modified eSTEPS tool (questionnaire). This tool collected data on four components; the demographic details of the participants, their behavioural risk factors, physical measurements, and biochemical risk factors for NCDs. Data collection was standardized and validated, and risk factor measurement clearly defined as per the WHO STEPS Surveillance Manual.

This prediction model includes gender, age, SBP, total blood cholesterol, smoking status and the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2). \nTo estimate this model on our dataset, we will start by deriving the Basic Risk Score equation (BRSe) used in the risk prediction model above and then calculating the risk probabilities for CHD/MI, Stroke and CVD. Lastly, the risk probability for CVD will be multiplied by 100 to get the 10-year CVD risk score in percentage.

Beyond food or shelter, conspecifics can be also essential targets not only as reproductive resources, as they also provide social interactions. This seems particularly true for social insects because interindividual contact is the base of key tasks such as foraging, defense or care for the offspring. Specifically for eusocial insects such as termites, contact with nestmates improves the survival of the individuals [5], even when poisoned [6] or infected with entomopathogenic fungi [7]. In order to locate this valuable resource, termite workers search for their nestmates using a foraging strategy which optimizes the location of sparse and scarce targets: the L\u00e9vy walks [8].  \n\nThe success of L\u00e9vy walks lies on the fact that individuals move about combining many steps of short lengths with a few large ones.

Cornitermes cumulans builds nests with both an epigeal and subterranean part, being naturally distributed in Brazil (Central and Southern regions), Paraguay and Argentina [15]. The epigeal part of the nest of C. cumulans can reach 1.60 m of high and 0.95 m of circumference  [16], some even bigger nests being sometimes recorded.  The nest has two distinctive sections: (i) an internal mass -- typically black -- composed by chambers and galleries of thin walls (0.5 to 1 mm thick) built with a mix of fecal-material and plant remains [16]; and (ii) the external section -- surrounding the central mass -- composed of chambers and galleries of thick walls (5 to 9 cm thick) built with clay [16]. The constructions of Cornitermes cumulans harbor a large amount of arthropods including other species of termites [17,18] by which C. cumulans is considered a keystone species [17]. \n\nStudy area:\nTermite soldiers and workers were sampled from 13 nests of  C. cumulans with no sign of damage in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome, on pastureland in the municipality of Vi\u00e7osa (S20\u00b045', W42\u00b052'), Minas Gerais State, Southeastern Brazil. The sampling was made in two periods, the first from 23rd July 2014 to 26th September 2014; the second from 3rd February 2015 to 3rd June 2015. In K\u00f6ppen system, the study area corresponds to Cfb climate (subtropical climate, without dry season and temperate summer) [19]. The maximum and minimum temperature registered for the 2014 period was 16.9\u00b0C - 20.1\u00b0C, and for the 2015 period was 18.3\u00b0C - 23.1\u00b0C; the precipitation during the two study periods, ranged from 0.0 mm to 12.2 mm and from 0.0 mm to 110.4mm, respectively [20]. \n\nMovement recordings:  Walking experiment\nControlled walking bioassays were performed with groups (75) composed by a different number of soldiers and workers in three distinct global densities (see Table 1). Assays consisted of continuously tracking the movement of one focal worker confined in an experimental arena with no obstacle, food or water, along up to 6 hours. Arenas consisted of a glass Petri dish (\u2300 =53 mm) placed upside down over a sand-blasted flat glass (Fig. 1). \nTo allow the optimal contrast for detection by the tracking equipment, the focal worker was painted with a nontoxic mixture composed of white glue + dye as described by [21].\n\nTrajectories of the focal individuals were systematically collected at a sample rate of one Cartesian position every 0.5 s over 6 h, with the video-tracking software EthovisionXT (Version 8.5.614, Noldus Information Technology) coupled with a video camera (Panasonic WV-BP334) hence producing series of 43 thousand Cartesian points. A total of 22 experimental combinations of termite soldiers and workers were conducted. Each combination was composed of a given number of soldiers and workers comprising a particular global density (see table 1). These combinations resulted in a total of 14 different densities of termite workers."}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "figure01.pdf"}, "nodeId": "x2cf3", "sha256": "e80e42f37fa592136c637f4ff81659b7ae6dd8bf468af3fb383fd9861da5ca71", "viewUrl": "/project/r5vaq/files/osfstorage/5e2e44a1c19c5d01bbee0b7b/", "selectedFileName": "figure01.pdf"}, {"data": {"name": "table01.pdf"}, "nodeId": "x2cf3", "sha256": "5040aeb5884f85181dacb803381d73f77f6290e53f9ee4f3730783f72f656a52", "viewUrl": "/project/r5vaq/files/osfstorage/5e2e44a1c19c5d01bbee0b79/", "selectedFileName": "table01.pdf"}, {"data": {"name": "references.pdf"}, "nodeId": "x2cf3", "sha256": "93f40c3de309f3ba671e3795a9de03c0ebb0bd60959ed1a1cec8fc1aa99108ef", "viewUrl": "/project/r5vaq/files/osfstorage/5e2e44a1c19c5d01bbee0b77/", "selectedFileName": "references.pdf"}], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "In all, the dataset is composed of 2,272,426 Cartesian points obtained from the recordings of the trajectory of 75 focal termite workers of Cornitermes cumulans."}, "q14": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q15": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q16": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "We manipulated the density of termites at two scales:\n1.

Cornitermes cumulans builds nests with both an epigeal and subterranean part, being naturally distributed in Brazil (Central and Southern regions), Paraguay and Argentina [15]. The epigeal part of the nest of C. cumulans can reach 1.60 m of high and 0.95 m of circumference  [16], some even bigger nests being sometimes recorded.  The nest has two distinctive sections: (i) an internal mass -- typically black -- composed by chambers and galleries of thin walls (0.5 to 1 mm thick) built with a mix of fecal-material and plant remains [16]; and (ii) the external section -- surrounding the central mass -- composed of chambers and galleries of thick walls (5 to 9 cm thick) built with clay [16]. The constructions of Cornitermes cumulans harbor a large amount of arthropods including other species of termites [17,18] by which C. cumulans is considered a keystone species [17]. \n\nStudy area:\nTermite soldiers and workers were sampled from 13 nests of  C. cumulans with no sign of damage in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome, on pastureland in the municipality of Vi\u00e7osa (S20\u00b045', W42\u00b052'), Minas Gerais State, Southeastern Brazil. The sampling was made in two periods, the first from 23rd July 2014 to 26th September 2014; the second from 3rd February 2015 to 3rd June 2015. In K\u00f6ppen system, the study area corresponds to Cfb climate (subtropical climate, without dry season and temperate summer) [19]. The maximum and minimum temperature registered for the 2014 period was 16.9\u00b0C - 20.1\u00b0C, and for the 2015 period was 18.3\u00b0C - 23.1\u00b0C; the precipitation during the two study periods, ranged from 0.0 mm to 12.2 mm and from 0.0 mm to 110.4mm, respectively [20]. \n\nMovement recordings:  Walking experiment\nControlled walking bioassays were performed with groups (75) composed by a different number of soldiers and workers in three distinct global densities (see Table 1). Assays consisted of continuously tracking the movement of one focal worker confined in an experimental arena with no obstacle, food or water, along up to 6 hours. Arenas consisted of a glass Petri dish (\u2300 =53 mm) placed upside down over a sand-blasted flat glass (Fig. 1). \nTo allow the optimal contrast for detection by the tracking equipment, the focal worker was painted with a nontoxic mixture composed of white glue + dye as described by [21].\n\nTrajectories of the focal individuals were systematically collected at a sample rate of one Cartesian position every 0.5 s over 6 h, with the video-tracking software EthovisionXT (Version 8.5.614, Noldus Information Technology) coupled with a video camera (Panasonic WV-BP334) hence producing series of 43 thousand Cartesian points. A total of 22 experimental combinations of termite soldiers and workers were conducted. Each combination was composed of a given number of soldiers and workers comprising a particular global density (see table 1). These combinations resulted in a total of 14 different densities of termite workers.", "q12.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e2e44a1c19c5d01bbee0b7b", "file_name": "figure01.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/r5vaq/files/osfstorage/5e2e44a1c19c5d01bbee0b7b", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e2e44a1c19c5d01bbee0b7b"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "e80e42f37fa592136c637f4ff81659b7ae6dd8bf468af3fb383fd9861da5ca71"}}, {"file_id": "5e2e44a1c19c5d01bbee0b79", "file_name": "table01.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/r5vaq/files/osfstorage/5e2e44a1c19c5d01bbee0b79", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e2e44a1c19c5d01bbee0b79"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "5040aeb5884f85181dacb803381d73f77f6290e53f9ee4f3730783f72f656a52"}}, {"file_id": "5e2e44a1c19c5d01bbee0b77", "file_name": "references.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/r5vaq/files/osfstorage/5e2e44a1c19c5d01bbee0b77", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e2e44a1c19c5d01bbee0b77"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "93f40c3de309f3ba671e3795a9de03c0ebb0bd60959ed1a1cec8fc1aa99108ef"}}], "q16.question": "We manipulated the density of termites at two scales:\n1.
