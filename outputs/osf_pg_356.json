The purpose of these transfers is to ensure all Canadians enjoy similar levels of services at similar levels of taxation. But the distribution of transfers is not always fair or efficient. One possible way to address this problem \u2013 and one that appears to work well in Australia \u2013 is to establish an independent fiscal council capable of assessing the performance of Canada\u2019s federal-provincial transfers.

Accordingly, we will randomly assign eligible Quebec voters to one of two groups: one in which a proposal to improve equalization for other provinces is proposed by the federal government and another in which it is proposed by a hypothetical independent council. The vignette appears below. The control and treatment vignettes are identical with the following exceptions: only the treatment group will see the text in bold and only the control group will see the text in square brackets. Vignette: Every year, the federal government makes equalization payments to provinces with below-average capacity to raise revenues. The purpose of these payments is to ensure that all Canadians enjoy comparable levels of public services at comparable levels of taxation. One criticism of the program is that payments only reflect the ability of provinces to raise revenues, not the different amounts provinces have to pay to provide similar public services. To address this problem, the newly created Canadian Equalization Commission [\u201cthe federal government\u201d] recently developed a proposal to adjust equalization payments. The proposal, if implemented, would increase payments for Ontario and Newfoundland and Labrador, two provinces with exceptionally high service costs. It would have no effect on the remaining provinces. Manitoba, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island would continue to receive the same amounts. British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan would continue to receive no payments. The Canadian Equalization Commission is an independent body designed to assess the fairness of Canada\u2019s equalization system. It consists of 10 experts \u2013 one from each province \u2013 and operates independently of the federal and provincial governments. After exposing respondents to the vignette, we will ask them whether they support the proposal. The answers will serve as our dependent variable. We will randomize the order of response options. The question: Do you support the new proposal to adjust provinces\u2019 equalization payments? \u2022 I strongly oppose the proposal \u2022 I somewhat oppose the proposal \u2022 I neither support nor oppose the proposal \u2022 I somewhat support the proposal \u2022 I strongly support the proposal If the council is persuasive, the treatment group will, on average, be more likely to say they support the proposal. The literature suggests reasons to be both optimistic and pessimistic about the council\u2019s effect. Thus, we do not have any expectations about the size and direction of the overall effect. We do, however, expect effects to vary across different groups, which we discuss next. Heterogeneous treatment effects Federal partisan identification: We expect a proposal originating from the council to have the biggest positive effect on respondents who identify with the federal New Democratic Party. Left-right ideology: We expect the effect of a council relative to a government proposal to increase with leftist ideology. Views on state and individual responsibility: We expect the effect of a council relative to a government proposal to increase with favourable attitudes towards a state role in providing for Canadians. Identity: We expect individuals with strong Canadian identities to be more receptive to the council than the federal government. We don\u2019t have any expectations for individuals who identify equally with Canada and their province. Political Knowledge: We expect high-knowledge individuals to be less affected by the council than low-knowledge individuals. General effects Federal partisanship: We expect support for the proposal to be highest, in general, among those who identify with the federal Liberal party. Left-right ideology: We expect support for the proposal to increase with leftist ideology. Views on government and individual responsibility: We expect support for the proposal to increase with favourable attitudes towards a state role in providing for Canadians. Identity: We expect individuals with strong Canadian identities to be more likely to support the proposal. We expect individuals with strong provincial identities to be less likely to support the proposal. Employment status: We expect individuals to be less supportive of the proposal if they or a member of their household has been unemployed at any point within the last 12 months.

A second theorized inhibitor is that police misconduct breeds resentment and inhibits cooperation. Contrary to this view, however, citizens prize security over suspect treatment. Thus, they likely do not incorporate suspect mistreatment into their cooperation decisions and may even increase information provision when exposed to misconduct. Expected Outcome (Suspect Mistreatment): Citizens exposed to police mistreatment of suspects are no less likely, or perhaps more likely, to provide information to the police. A third potential inhibitor are police forces that do not reflect the demographic make-up of communities and these differing demographic characteristics make citizens less apt to cooperate. Accordingly, co-ethnicity between a citizen and police officer may increase the citizen\u2019s propensity to cooperate, especially from historically marginalized groups (e.g., Igbo in the context of Nigeria).
