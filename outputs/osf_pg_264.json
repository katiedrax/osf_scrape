sociology, and economics. Since at least the 1960s, researchers have worked to define trust in government, to develop survey instruments that measure it, to pin down its determinants, and to understand its consequences, which include political and economic behaviors as fundamental as voting, obeying the law, or even buying goods. This large literature has produced robust findings. But most studies focus on trust in an abstract government or in national institutions like Congress; less is known about the causes or consequences of trust in specific, local government agents. Levi and Stoker (2000) argue that this type of trust\u2014trust in particular authorities\u2014is essential to understanding \u201ceveryday political behavior,\u201d and they therefore \u201curge scholars to expand their inquiries beyond the traditional focus on citizens\u2019 trust in \u2018government\u2019 in general\u201d (p. 495\u2013496).

In our study we test the impact of community monitoring on the management of groundwater by community-based water management organizations (CBWMOs), which are the most important suppliers of water in rural areas of low and middle-income countries globally. To achieve this goal, we run a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with CBWMOs where we conduct public workshops to present the monitoring system and to recruit and train monitors.

Changes in these primary mechanisms are hypothesized to affect other secondary mechanisms: better maintenance of infrastructure (repair leaks, hire a half-time or plumber availability), better management procedures (better pricing, better financial management, more transparency) and fewer violations of household water use restrictions (informal connections, water used as input in businesses). The better management procedures could directly affect water consumption by increasing prices to maximum permissible increasing-block levels, or it could increase resources by improving financial management, which could lead to more investment in maintenance and infrastructure. Better maintenance of infrastructure could improve water quality and reduce water waste, which could reduce water pumping, and improve cost-effectiveness of CBWMO efforts to deliver water. Fewer violations of water use restrictions could improve water quality, reduce water consumption and increase CBWMO income, which in turn could increase investment in the water system.

We also measure seven moderators: (1) number of CBWMO water connections; (2) the average tenure (in years) of the management committee members (question 18); (3) the gender composition of the management committee (question 18); (4) age of the management committee members (question 18) (5) CBWMO\u2019s belief about the severity of water scarcity; (6) the participation in the 2015 CBWMO Management Training RCT, and (7) the power-off system of the pumps.", "q17": "We conducted an RCT with 161 CBWMOs: 80 in the treated group and 81 in the control group. We conduct workshops in the 80 treated CBWMOs to present the monitoring system and train monitors. Monitors are also incentivized to send weekly reports through the app and CBWMOs committee members are reminded to read the weekly reports. We collect baseline and endline surveys at the CBWMO level for almost all the variables, except for the electricity data that is provided by the energy companies and some process variables that are measured through the cellphone application. For the estimation of the main outcome variable electricity expenditures, we estimate a random effects model. See the description of all the other models in Section 5 in the Costa Rican Pre-Analysis Plan.", "q18": "Costa Rica", "q19": "161", "q20": "Yes", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24":

investigating participants\u2019 spontaneous production of generic statements. Study 1 and 2 demonstrated that participants do not evaluate generic statements in a monolithic way but rather in a context-specific way. That is, generics referencing structural factors like discrimination are evaluated differently from generics referencing stereotyped traits, values, and preferences. This raises questions about what kinds of generic statements White and Black participants spontaneously use in their descriptions of the world. Do White and Black participants ever use generic statements? If so, what kind, and when? Additionally, individual variation in racist beliefs and attitudes strongly predicted evaluations of generic statements \u2013 do they predict production of generic statements? \nUnlike Studies 1 and 2 which were very explicit in their connection to race, the experimental portion of this study was designed to reduce the salience of race. Specifically, the experiment portion will include no generic statements about race nor category labels and will include filler trials that are not race related. \nHypotheses. \n1.\tWe predict that generic statements referencing structural factors will outnumber generic statements referencing stereotypes traits, values, and preferences.   \n\n2.\tWe predict that racism will predict fewer structural generics and more stereotyped generics (if they are produced often enough to measure this relationship).\n\n3.\t We expected Black participants to produce more generics referencing structural factors than White participants. Based on Study 2 though, we did not expect Black and White participants to differ in their production of generics referencing stereotypes (especially since we focused on stories evoking \u2018positive\u2019 stereotypes here). \nSample size. \nWe selected the same sample size as Study 1 based on the same rationale: 100 participants per condition (generics about structural properties, generics about stereotypes) per race (Black, White), to give us 95% power to detect medium effect sizes (d = .50). \nDesign and Procedure.\nParticipants will read 4 short descriptions of individuals (2 experimental, 2 filler) that either invoke structural factors (Structural condition) or stereotyped traits (Stereotype condition) \u2013 between-subject. Participants will be asked to write 3-4 sentences in response to the descriptions. We can then code the statements for genericity and their content. Participants then answered a battery of questions assessing racial bias: Symbolic racism, White-Black social dominance, and feeling thermometers. \nOf the four descriptions, 2 were experimental and 2 were filler. The experimental trials involved a Black individual experiencing discrimination (Structural condition) or exhibiting a stereotyped trait (Stereotype condition), and thus provided the opportunity for participants to use race-related generic language. The other 2 trials included broadly similar content but involved non-Black individuals involved in events that did not evoke race-related structural factors or stereotypes. \nDescriptions.\nStructural (experimental). \n\n\u2026\nThis man's name is Peter. \n\n \n\nPeter received a text from his boss saying that his natural hair was unprofessional. He confronted his employer, who apologized. The following week he took a sick day; his boss called and told him he was being let go due to his poor work ethic. \n\u2026\n\nThis woman's name is Nadya.\n\n \n\nNadya went to an expensive clothing store. The clerk followed her and assumed she did not belong. The clerk kept asking if she needed help and kept closely watching her when she said no. \nStructural (filler: stories involve characters being treated badly in a non-structural non-race-related way).\n\n\u2026\n\nThis woman's name is Erica.\n\n \n \nErica went to the grocery store last week. While she was trying to pick out spinach, an older woman walked in front of her and started looking for spinach herself. Erica ended up not being able to find spinach because the older woman blocked her completely. \n\n\u2026\n\nThis man's name is Nathan.\n\n \n\nLast night Nathan was at a night club. When he asked a woman at the club to dance, she laughed in his face and said \"Obviously I wouldn't dance with you?\" The experience made him feel embarrassed so he left earlier than anticipated. \n\n\n\u2003\nStereotypes (experimental; stereotypes: athleticism and musicality/singing ability). \nThis man's name is Peter. \n\n \n\nPeter recently tried out for his college track team. He had never run competitively before but he performed better than some of the men already on the team. The coach said he was a natural. He even went to the state tournament that season and placed in the top three.\n\n\u2026\nThis woman's name is Nadya.\n\n \n\n \nNadya started college last semester and started going to a cappella groups. She had been singing for years in church groups in her neighborhood. Due to her training and passion for singing, she had a powerful voice. She became one of the lead singers in the group and was often asked to perform solos.\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural (filler: stories involve characters being good at something they started at college).\n\nThis man's name is Nathan.\n\n \n\nNathan always had friends who skateboarded but he never tried himself. This past semester he started skateboarding with them. He had trouble at first but quickly became proficient. Now it's his favorite hobby and posts videos on YouTube where he teaches other people how to do advanced tricks.\n\n\u2026\n\nThis woman's name is Erica.\n\n \n \nErica is in her second year of college. She switched majors to study Classics. She has been doing a lot better in school now because she feels passionate about the material. Now she's learning Ancient Greek so she can read ancient texts in their original language.\n\n\u2026\n\u2003\nPrompt:\nPlease write 3-4 sentences about the individual and event mentioned above in your own words. [This prompt was given after each story; participants had a text box provided to write in].\nCoding scheme.\n\nA statement is defined as an independent clause whether embedded in a larger complex sentence or not: e.g., \u201cI drink green tea, but they drink coffee\u201d would count as two statements. We will only code and analyze statements produced in response to the 2 experimental trials. \n\n1.\tThe DV of interest is categorical generic statements produced about Black people. Our first pass in coding is whether a generic reference racial category. We will code whether the statements reference Black people (\u201cBlack people\u201d, \u201cBlacks\u201d, \u201cBlack men\u201d, \u201cBlack women\u201d, \u201cAfrican-Americans\u201d, etc.) or White people (\u201cWhite people\u201d, \u201cWhites\u201d, \u201cWhite men\u201d, \u201cWhite women\u201d, \u201cEuropean-Americans\u201d, \u201cCaucasians\u201d, etc.). Given the stimuli, it is unlikely there will be generics about other racial categories. \n\n2.\tSecond, we will code whether the categorical statements are generic or some other form: \n\nA.\tCategorical generics.\n\nGeneric statements were identified by two principles: First, the statement assigned a property to the entire category by taking the form of a base plural (\u201cBlack people\u201d), plural pronoun (\u201cthey\u201d), definite plural (\u201cthe Blacks\u201d), or indefinite singular (\u201ca Black person\u201d). Second, the property expresses a permanent / stable / habitual / indefinite state rather than an impermanent / transient / temporary / definite state. \u201cShe drinks green tea\u201d expresses an indefinite state, whereas \u201cShe is drinking green tea\u201d expressed a transient state. \n\n\nB.\tBelief statements about the category. \n\nWe suspected participants might write in statements like \u201cShe thought the Black woman was robbing the store.\u201d We counted these separately since the category-relevant statement is attributed to someone\u2019s beliefs. In the case of a statement like \u201cWhite people think Black people are criminals,\u201d we would count it as both a generic (\u201cWhite people think\u2026\u201d and a belief statement. Presumably we will count these statements primarily as structural. For example, \u201cBlack people are treated with suspicion\u201d is the complement of \u201cPeople think Black people are suspicious.\u201d \n\nC.\tCategory-based explanations.\n\nAnother common statement type might be statements like \u201cShe was treated suspiciously because she\u2019s Black\u201d or \u201cHe\u2019s good at running because he\u2019s Black.\u201d Explanations that contained generics will be counted as generics too: \u201cShe sings well because Black people are good at singing.\u201d \n\nD.\tQuantified generalizations. \n\n\u201cMost White people\u2026\u201d \u201cMany Black people\u2026\u201d \u201cSome African Americans\u2026\u201d\n\nE.\tSpecifics with category labels. \n\n\u201cThis Black woman\u2026\u201d \u201cAn African American man joined the track team\u201d\n\nF.\tOther\n\n3.\tFinally, we will code whether the category-related statements reference:\n\nA.\tStructural factors:  e.g., Black people face workplace discrimination; White people treat Black people with suspicion; Black people have less power than White people).\n\nB.\tStereotyped values, traits, and preferences: e.g., \u201cBlack people are athletic\u201d, \u201cBlack people don\u2019t value hard work\u201d\n\nC.\tOther: \u201cWhite people have straight hair.\u201d\n\n\nQuestions about participants attitudes\n1.\tSymbolic racism scale, brief. \na.\tQ1. Irish, Italian, Jewish, and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Black people should do the same. Black people are demanding too much from the rest of society.\nb.\tQ2. Black people are demanding too much from the rest of society.\nc.\tQ3. Discrimination against Black people is no longer a problem in the United States.\n2.\tSocial dominance orientation about White/Black \na.\tIf Black people stayed in their place, we would have fewer problems.\nb.\tIt is okay if White people have more of a chance in today\u2019s society than Black people.\nc.\tBlack people are simply inferior to White people.\nd.\tPeople should be given an equal chance in life regardless of whether they are Black or White. (Reverse-coded)\ne.\tWe should do what we can to equalize conditions between Black and White people. (Reverse-coded)\nf.\tIt would be good if Black and White people could be equal. (Reverse-coded)\nDemographics\n1.\tPolitical orientation: Very Conservative. Conservative. Moderate. Liberal. Very Liberal.\n2.\tGender: Man. Woman. Genderqueer. Other. Prefer not to answer.\n3.\tRace: White, Black, Other (we are specifically recruiting White and Black participants from Turk Prime panels, so all participants should be White or Black). \n\nAnalyses. \nThe primary dependent variables of interest are how many stereotype-referencing generics participants produced about Black people and how many structural-referencing generics participants produced about Black people. Both of these variables are non-negative integers. They will likely be rare (we expect maybe ~15% of statements to be generic). To analyze this data, we will use Poisson multi-level regressions. \nThese models also provide the possibility of modelling the data as a rate adding an offset term. We will add an offset term for the total number of statements participants produced, as each additional statement provides more opportunities for a statement to be generic or not. \nBetween subject, participants are assigned either to a condition with excerpts that prompt structural issues or a condition with excerpts that prompt stereotyped traits. Each of these conditions should have their own effect, such that structural generics are more likely when structural issues are prompted. However, the idea is that (1) participants should be more likely to describe structural issues in generic terms than stereotyped traits, (2) participants\u2019 racism should moderate their propensity to produce generic statements in the face of those prompts (up-regulating generics about stereotyped properties and down-regulating generics about structural issues). Therefore, the analysis will still primarily be within-subject looking at the type of generics participants produce.  \nPrimary analyses.\nAnalysis 1: \nFirst, we will look at which type of generics are produced more often. We will use a multi-level model on the number of generics by type (structural vs. stereotyped) with an offset term for total statements produced. We hypothesize that structural statements will be produced more often that stereotyped statements. \n1.\tglmer(Generics ~ Type+ offset(LogTotal) +(1|Par), family=\"poisson\", data=data.frame)\nAnalysis 2:\nSecond, we will report whether the conditions effect the type of generics participants produce. We expected structural generics to be especially likely in the structural condition. \n2.\tglmer(Generics ~ Type * Condition + offset(LogTotal) +(1|Par), \u2026\nAnalysis 3: \nThird, we will report a model examining the effect of racism. We expected a significant interaction. Racism should lead to higher incidence of stereotyped generics and a lower incidence of structural generics. \n3.\tglmer(Generics ~ Type * Racism + offset(LogTotal) +(1|Par), \u2026\nAnalysis 4: \nFourth, we will report a model examining participant race. We expected Black participants to produce more structural generics than White participants. \n4.\tglmer(Generics ~ Type * Participant_Race + offset(LogTotal) +(1|Par), \u2026\nAdditional Considerations\n1.\tIt will be worth reporting how often generic statements are produced about White people. We made no specific predictions about generics about White people. In general, generic statements about White people may blur the lines: \u201cWhite people treat Black people with suspicion\u201d, \u201cWhite people are racist,\u201d \u201cWhite people dislike Black people,\u201d and \u201cWhite people are evil\u201d vary from mostly structural to mostly stereotypical but it is unclear exactly what the boundary is between the two. And presumably generic statements about White people will not show the same relationships participant race and anti-Black racism as generic statements about Black people. However, collapsing across the type of generic statements produced, it is still worth asking:\na.\tDo Black participants produce generic statements about White people more often than White people?\nb.\tDo participants in general produce more or less generic statements about White people than Black people?\nc.\tDoes (anti-Black) racism predict less generics about White people? \n\n2.\tIt will be worth analyzing other types of category-related statements.

Study 1 and 2 demonstrated that participants do not evaluate generic statements in a monolithic way but rather in a context-specific way. That is, generics referencing structural factors like discrimination are evaluated differently from generics referencing stereotyped traits, values, and preferences. This raises questions about what kinds of generic statements White and Black participants spontaneously use in their descriptions of the world. Do White and Black participants ever use generic statements? If so, what kind, and when? Additionally, individual variation in racist beliefs and attitudes strongly predicted evaluations of generic statements \u2013 do they predict production of generic statements? \nUnlike Studies 1 and 2 which were very explicit in their connection to race, the experimental portion of this study was designed to reduce the salience of race. Specifically, the experiment portion will include no generic statements about race nor category labels and will include filler trials that are not race related. \nHypotheses. \n1.\tWe predict that generic statements referencing structural factors will outnumber generic statements referencing stereotypes traits, values, and preferences.   \n\n2.\tWe predict that racism will predict fewer structural generics and more stereotyped generics (if they are produced often enough to measure this relationship).\n\n3.\t We expected Black participants to produce more generics referencing structural factors than White participants. Based on Study 2 though, we did not expect Black and White participants to differ in their production of generics referencing stereotypes (especially since we focused on stories evoking \u2018positive\u2019 stereotypes here). \nSample size. \nWe selected the same sample size as Study 1 based on the same rationale: 100 participants per condition (generics about structural properties, generics about stereotypes) per race (Black, White), to give us 95% power to detect medium effect sizes (d = .50). \nDesign and Procedure.\nParticipants will read 4 short descriptions of individuals (2 experimental, 2 filler) that either invoke structural factors (Structural condition) or stereotyped traits (Stereotype condition) \u2013 between-subject. Participants will be asked to write 3-4 sentences in response to the descriptions. We can then code the statements for genericity and their content. Participants then answered a battery of questions assessing racial bias: Symbolic racism, White-Black social dominance, and feeling thermometers. \nOf the four descriptions, 2 were experimental and 2 were filler. The experimental trials involved a Black individual experiencing discrimination (Structural condition) or exhibiting a stereotyped trait (Stereotype condition), and thus provided the opportunity for participants to use race-related generic language. The other 2 trials included broadly similar content but involved non-Black individuals involved in events that did not evoke race-related structural factors or stereotypes. \nDescriptions.\nStructural (experimental). \n\n\u2026\nThis man's name is Peter. \n\n \n\nPeter received a text from his boss saying that his natural hair was unprofessional. He confronted his employer, who apologized. The following week he took a sick day; his boss called and told him he was being let go due to his poor work ethic. \n\u2026\n\nThis woman's name is Nadya.\n\n \n\nNadya went to an expensive clothing store. The clerk followed her and assumed she did not belong. The clerk kept asking if she needed help and kept closely watching her when she said no. \nStructural (filler: stories involve characters being treated badly in a non-structural non-race-related way).\n\n\u2026\n\nThis woman's name is Erica.\n\n \n \nErica went to the grocery store last week. While she was trying to pick out spinach, an older woman walked in front of her and started looking for spinach herself. Erica ended up not being able to find spinach because the older woman blocked her completely. \n\n\u2026\n\nThis man's name is Nathan.\n\n \n\nLast night Nathan was at a night club. When he asked a woman at the club to dance, she laughed in his face and said \"Obviously I wouldn't dance with you?\" The experience made him feel embarrassed so he left earlier than anticipated. \n\n\n\u2003\nStereotypes (experimental; stereotypes: athleticism and musicality/singing ability). \nThis man's name is Peter. \n\n \n\nPeter recently tried out for his college track team. He had never run competitively before but he performed better than some of the men already on the team. The coach said he was a natural. He even went to the state tournament that season and placed in the top three.\n\n\u2026\nThis woman's name is Nadya.\n\n \n\n \nNadya started college last semester and started going to a cappella groups. She had been singing for years in church groups in her neighborhood. Due to her training and passion for singing, she had a powerful voice. She became one of the lead singers in the group and was often asked to perform solos.\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural (filler: stories involve characters being good at something they started at college).\n\nThis man's name is Nathan.\n\n \n\nNathan always had friends who skateboarded but he never tried himself. This past semester he started skateboarding with them. He had trouble at first but quickly became proficient. Now it's his favorite hobby and posts videos on YouTube where he teaches other people how to do advanced tricks.\n\n\u2026\n\nThis woman's name is Erica.\n\n \n \nErica is in her second year of college. She switched majors to study Classics. She has been doing a lot better in school now because she feels passionate about the material. Now she's learning Ancient Greek so she can read ancient texts in their original language.\n\n\u2026\n\u2003\nPrompt:\nPlease write 3-4 sentences about the individual and event mentioned above in your own words. [This prompt was given after each story; participants had a text box provided to write in].\nCoding scheme.\n\nA statement is defined as an independent clause whether embedded in a larger complex sentence or not: e.g., \u201cI drink green tea, but they drink coffee\u201d would count as two statements. We will only code and analyze statements produced in response to the 2 experimental trials. \n\n1.\tThe DV of interest is categorical generic statements produced about Black people. Our first pass in coding is whether a generic reference racial category. We will code whether the statements reference Black people (\u201cBlack people\u201d, \u201cBlacks\u201d, \u201cBlack men\u201d, \u201cBlack women\u201d, \u201cAfrican-Americans\u201d, etc.) or White people (\u201cWhite people\u201d, \u201cWhites\u201d, \u201cWhite men\u201d, \u201cWhite women\u201d, \u201cEuropean-Americans\u201d, \u201cCaucasians\u201d, etc.). Given the stimuli, it is unlikely there will be generics about other racial categories. \n\n2.\tSecond, we will code whether the categorical statements are generic or some other form: \n\nA.\tCategorical generics.\n\nGeneric statements were identified by two principles: First, the statement assigned a property to the entire category by taking the form of a base plural (\u201cBlack people\u201d), plural pronoun (\u201cthey\u201d), definite plural (\u201cthe Blacks\u201d), or indefinite singular (\u201ca Black person\u201d). Second, the property expresses a permanent / stable / habitual / indefinite state rather than an impermanent / transient / temporary / definite state. \u201cShe drinks green tea\u201d expresses an indefinite state, whereas \u201cShe is drinking green tea\u201d expressed a transient state. \n\n\nB.\tBelief statements about the category. \n\nWe suspected participants might write in statements like \u201cShe thought the Black woman was robbing the store.\u201d We counted these separately since the category-relevant statement is attributed to someone\u2019s beliefs. In the case of a statement like \u201cWhite people think Black people are criminals,\u201d we would count it as both a generic (\u201cWhite people think\u2026\u201d and a belief statement. Presumably we will count these statements primarily as structural. For example, \u201cBlack people are treated with suspicion\u201d is the complement of \u201cPeople think Black people are suspicious.\u201d \n\nC.\tCategory-based explanations.\n\nAnother common statement type might be statements like \u201cShe was treated suspiciously because she\u2019s Black\u201d or \u201cHe\u2019s good at running because he\u2019s Black.\u201d Explanations that contained generics will be counted as generics too: \u201cShe sings well because Black people are good at singing.\u201d \n\nD.\tQuantified generalizations. \n\n\u201cMost White people\u2026\u201d \u201cMany Black people\u2026\u201d \u201cSome African Americans\u2026\u201d\n\nE.\tSpecifics with category labels. \n\n\u201cThis Black woman\u2026\u201d \u201cAn African American man joined the track team\u201d\n\nF.\tOther\n\n3.\tFinally, we will code whether the category-related statements reference:\n\nA.\tStructural factors:  e.g., Black people face workplace discrimination; White people treat Black people with suspicion; Black people have less power than White people).\n\nB.\tStereotyped values, traits, and preferences: e.g., \u201cBlack people are athletic\u201d, \u201cBlack people don\u2019t value hard work\u201d\n\nC.\tOther: \u201cWhite people have straight hair.\u201d\n\n\nQuestions about participants attitudes\n1.\tSymbolic racism scale, brief. \na.\tQ1. Irish, Italian, Jewish, and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Black people should do the same. Black people are demanding too much from the rest of society.\nb.\tQ2. Black people are demanding too much from the rest of society.\nc.\tQ3. Discrimination against Black people is no longer a problem in the United States.\n2.\tSocial dominance orientation about White/Black \na.\tIf Black people stayed in their place, we would have fewer problems.\nb.\tIt is okay if White people have more of a chance in today\u2019s society than Black people.\nc.\tBlack people are simply inferior to White people.\nd.\tPeople should be given an equal chance in life regardless of whether they are Black or White. (Reverse-coded)\ne.\tWe should do what we can to equalize conditions between Black and White people. (Reverse-coded)\nf.\tIt would be good if Black and White people could be equal. (Reverse-coded)\nDemographics\n1.\tPolitical orientation: Very Conservative. Conservative. Moderate. Liberal. Very Liberal.\n2.\tGender: Man. Woman. Genderqueer. Other. Prefer not to answer.\n3.\tRace: White, Black, Other (we are specifically recruiting White and Black participants from Turk Prime panels, so all participants should be White or Black). \n\nAnalyses. \nThe primary dependent variables of interest are how many stereotype-referencing generics participants produced about Black people and how many structural-referencing generics participants produced about Black people. Both of these variables are non-negative integers. They will likely be rare (we expect maybe ~15% of statements to be generic). To analyze this data, we will use Poisson multi-level regressions. \nThese models also provide the possibility of modelling the data as a rate adding an offset term. We will add an offset term for the total number of statements participants produced, as each additional statement provides more opportunities for a statement to be generic or not. \nBetween subject, participants are assigned either to a condition with excerpts that prompt structural issues or a condition with excerpts that prompt stereotyped traits. Each of these conditions should have their own effect, such that structural generics are more likely when structural issues are prompted. However, the idea is that (1) participants should be more likely to describe structural issues in generic terms than stereotyped traits, (2) participants\u2019 racism should moderate their propensity to produce generic statements in the face of those prompts (up-regulating generics about stereotyped properties and down-regulating generics about structural issues). Therefore, the analysis will still primarily be within-subject looking at the type of generics participants produce.  \nPrimary analyses.\nAnalysis 1: \nFirst, we will look at which type of generics are produced more often. We will use a multi-level model on the number of generics by type (structural vs. stereotyped) with an offset term for total statements produced. We hypothesize that structural statements will be produced more often that stereotyped statements. \n1.\tglmer(Generics ~ Type+ offset(LogTotal) +(1|Par), family=\"poisson\", data=data.frame)\nAnalysis 2:\nSecond, we will report whether the conditions effect the type of generics participants produce. We expected structural generics to be especially likely in the structural condition. \n2.\tglmer(Generics ~ Type * Condition + offset(LogTotal) +(1|Par), \u2026\nAnalysis 3: \nThird, we will report a model examining the effect of racism. We expected a significant interaction. Racism should lead to higher incidence of stereotyped generics and a lower incidence of structural generics. \n3.\tglmer(Generics ~ Type * Racism + offset(LogTotal) +(1|Par), \u2026\nAnalysis 4: \nFourth, we will report a model examining participant race. We expected Black participants to produce more structural generics than White participants. \n4.\tglmer(Generics ~ Type * Participant_Race + offset(LogTotal) +(1|Par), \u2026\nAdditional Considerations\n1.\tIt will be worth reporting how often generic statements are produced about White people. We made no specific predictions about generics about White people. In general, generic statements about White people may blur the lines: \u201cWhite people treat Black people with suspicion\u201d, \u201cWhite people are racist,\u201d \u201cWhite people dislike Black people,\u201d and \u201cWhite people are evil\u201d vary from mostly structural to mostly stereotypical but it is unclear exactly what the boundary is between the two. And presumably generic statements about White people will not show the same relationships participant race and anti-Black racism as generic statements about Black people. However, collapsing across the type of generic statements produced, it is still worth asking:\na.\tDo Black participants produce generic statements about White people more often than White people?\nb.\tDo participants in general produce more or less generic statements about White people than Black people?\nc.\tDoes (anti-Black) racism predict less generics about White people? \n\n2.\tIt will be worth analyzing other types of category-related statements. In particular, we suspected that category-based explanations might be produced frequently: e.g., \u201cShe was followed because she\u2019s Black.\u201d Do category-related statements show the same pattern as generic statements? Theoretically, category-based explanations and generics should be cognitively inter-related. Thus, we predict that category-based explanations will show the same pattern of results as generic statements. \n", "uploader": [{"file_id": "5e55748235d22d02585f6ac7", "file_name":

In this study, we test whether people spontaneously produce non-causal, temporal explanations when provided with an inconsistent set of premises. Temporal explanations are explanations that appeal to events and their relations to one another in time.

This registration was written before the data was finished being collected and analyzed but languished as a draft until now.\n\n", "uploader": [{"file_id": "5e5571c535d22d02645f27e3", "file_name": "TX1-Code.zip", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/65cfb/files/osfstorage/5e5571c535d22d02645f27e3", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e5571c535d22d02645f27e3"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "8d2647fd7cb6619a87410eb3ab1510d932e03609dd71252f292a15ed73834d57"}}]}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=65cfb", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "65cfb", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "65cfb", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/w56tc/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "w56tc", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/atyv8/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "atyv8", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/65cfb/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/65cfb/"}}], "links": {"first": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json", "last": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "prev": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=263", "next": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=265", "meta": {"total": 5469, "per_page": 10}}}
