Traditional methods of measuring biodiversity involve field studies and visual surveys, which are both resource intensive and limited in their spatial and temporal resolution. The synthesis of remotely sensed earth observation data with local climatic and topographical conditions, presents itself as a potential cost-effective and standardized technique to monitor biodiversity on an ecosystem wide scale. While high-resolution spectral data are becoming increasingly available at multiple scales, there is little known about the drivers of spectral diversity when transitioning from species to community-specific spectral data, particularly in tundra biomes. \nMy goal is to evaluate the capabilities of using plot scale and remotely sensed spectral data to assess ecological traits.

Spectral variance will have a larger correspondence with vegetation type (H1c).  When ordinated, spectral signatures will discriminate among vegetation types (H1d) and year of measurement (corresponds with change in sensor type) (H1e).\n\nH1o: Arctic vegetation types do not differ based on the mean or variance of their spectral signatures, and do not discriminate when ordinated. \n\nPredicted results \n\nI predict that both the mean and variance of spectral signatures can be used to identify Arctic vegetation types. The diversity of a spectral signature correlates with the chemical, anatomical, and morphological traits of communities (Schweiger et al., 2017).   Given the compositional difference between communities, this should translate into observable differences in spectral signatures. \n\nI predict that spectral variance will have higher correspondence with vegetation types, as it captures the spectral complexity within each vegetation type (Wang et al., 2018). If spectral variance has a higher correspondence with vegetation types, this  means that the vegetation types discriminate based on overall spectral diversity, which is variable at all spectral regions and is influenced by compositional differences, such as biological, functional, and phylogenetic diversity. \n\nIf the mean of spectral signatures has greater correspondence with vegetation type, this indicates that the spectral complexity of a vegetation type is less important than between-type differences in spectral signatures. These differences would relate to course optical differences at specific spectral regions, resultant from a limited number of structural or chemical differences. The correspondence between spectral mean and vegetation type is likely to be limited by spectral differences not being concentrated a one region of the spectrum. Spectral differences occurring at both low and high wavelengths, overall result in an in-between spectral mean that is similar and does not account for internal spectral complexity. \n\nWhen ordinated, spectral signatures will discriminate by year, due to the potential difference of reflectance measurements made by the different sensor types used between 2018 &amp; 2019, as well variation in flowering phenology and community compositions between the two years.  \n\n2: How does spectral diversity relate to species richness, evenness, and soil-background?\n\nH2: Vegetation type will significantly affect spectral diversity (H2a). Higher spectral diversity will correspond with both increases in species richness (H2b) and species evenness (H2c), with evenness having the stronger relationship (H2d). Soil-background cover will have the strongest positive influence on spectral diversity (H2e). \n\nH2o: Species richness, evenness, and soil-background have no effect on spectral diversity, with no visible relationship observed. \n\nPredicted results \n\nBoth increases in richness and evenness correlate with higher observed spectral diversity, across an array of different grassland/prairie habitats (Cavender\u2010Bares et al., 2017; Schweiger et al., 2017, 2018; Wang, Gamon, Cavender-Bares, et al., 2018a; Wang and Gamon, 2019). I predict evenness will have a larger correspondence with spectral diversity, as more even representations of species are likely to increase the detection of the variable chemical and physical structures that ultimately influence spectral diversity. If richness has larger correspondence to spectral diversity, this indicates that 1) sensor resolution is sensitive enough for the detect additional species, (potentially even when at low relative abundances) and 2) this presence of additional species sufficient to significantly increase spectral diversity. \n\nI predict that soil-background is the strongest predictor of spectral diversity, as soil has distinctly different reflectance than vegetation (Gholizadeh et al., 2018). Furthermore, soils reflectance is variable depending on local microclimatic conditions such as moisture and roughness. This potential for plot level variability can therefore alter spectral signatures in more complex ways, resulting in soil having the largest correspondence with spectral diversity. \n\n\n3: Does band selection influence correspondence between spectral diversity and vegetation types \n\nH3. Both band selection via using a subset spectral region, as well as spectral zone unmixing will result in greater correspondence between spectral diversity and vegetation type (H3a). spectral zone unmixing will result in the selection of a small but spectrally diversity subset of bands (H3a), with overall regions in the visible part of the spectrum (400-700nm) having higher correspondence with vegetation type than bands in the near infrared range (700-100nm) (H3b). \n\nH3o: Band selection does not visible influence the correspondence between spectral diversity and vegetation type. There are no specific spectral regions that are best suited to discriminate vegetation types. \n\nPredicted results \n\nSelecting a subset of bands will result in better discrimination of vegetation types, as reducing spectral dimensionality excludes variable and noisy regions of the spectrum. Spectral mixture analysis using spectral zone unmixing will result in finding what zones of the spectrum are best suited to differentia vegetation types. This is achieved  by isolating bands that explain maximum between community variability, while exhibiting the minimum within community variability. \n \nIf spectral zone unmixing (SZU) results in the selection of a small subsets of bands, this indicates that specific structural or chemical differences explain most of the spectral variation between the two vegetation types. Due to shared life histories, the two vegetation types would have traits that are similar, aside from key divergent adaptations. These specific divergent traits would be most relevant for spectral discrimination. Furthermore, when collecting and disseminating spectral data, as well as running spectral analysis, high resolution measurement spectral bands/regions are more important for vegetation identification than coarsely capturing reflectance across the full spectrum. \n\nIf SZU results in the selection of a large sub-set of bands, this indicates that the differences between the two vegetation types are complex, with many regions of the spectrum (aka structural and chemical traits) being relevant and important for vegetation type discrimination. Furthermore, if SZU results in the selection of bands that correspond with and/or are not visually better than an informal literature derived selection of spectral bands, this indicates that structural and chemical differences may be relatively convergent between different Arctic vegetation types. This implies that trends between biological traits and spectral diversity may be generalizable, and that future research can aim to work at greater scales of observation, rather than synthesizing the findings at small sites. Furthermore, this is promising for the development of future satellites, as potentially selection of spectral regions may be sufficient to discriminate vegetation types. \n\nIf spectral regions in the visible spectrum (~400-700 nm) are found to best discriminate vegetation types, then chemical traits are primarily responsible for the key spectral differences between vegetation types. This spectral region corresponds with wavelengths carotenoid absorption (502-511 &amp; 533 nm) green light reflectance (~550 nm), and chlorophyll absorption (644, 653, 672 nm). If spectral regions in the red-edge transition and near infra-red plateau (700-1000 nm) are found to best discriminate vegetation types, then physical structures are primarily responsible for the key spectral differences between vegetation types. \n\n\n\n\n4: Are closer measurements more similar than more distant measurements? \n\nH4: When tested for spatial autocorrelation, closer measurements will be more similar than more distant measurements (H4a), with no visible autocorrelation occurring across vegetation type areas (H4a). \n\nH4o: There is no visible level of autocorrelation between measurements at any distance.\n\nPredicted results \n\nSpatial autocorrelation of measurements will be present but weak between proximal plots and negligible at a regional scale, due to the between plot variability of both species composition and environmental factors such as wetness and roughness. \n\n\n5: Do plot and airborne spectra differ from each other?  Does plot or airborne spectra show more variation among vegetation types?\n\nH5: Plot and airborne spectra do visually differ from each other (H5a), with plot spectra showing more variation both within vegetation types (H5b), and between vegetation types (H5c).\n\nH5o: There is no visible difference between plot and airborne spectra, with neither accounting more variation among vegetation types.   \n\n\nPredicted results \n\nI predict that plot spectra show more variance within vegetation types, as they measure a smaller spatial area, resulting in only subsets of the full variation present in a vegetation type to be observed. This higher sensor resolution captures more small-scale compositional variation in each individual measurement. If plot spectra show more variance between vegetation types, then these captured small-scale compositional differences are important factors for discriminating vegetation types. It also indicates that future work that aims to use remotely-sensed spectral data for biodiversity assessment should aim to have a pixel size smaller than individual plants and structures, ensuring that each measurement is of a single or small subset of species.\n\nAirborne spectra how lower spatial resolution, with each pixel potentially including multiple species resulting in the combined spectral signatures to be measured by the sensor. I predict that this will homogenize spectral diversity, with less variation being observed between individual measurements within a vegetation type. Furthermore, reduced spatial resolution will increase the likelihood of capturing external environmental factors, such as exposed soil or canopy structure which are likely to add noise to measurements.  This will result in less vegetation specific spectral information being captured, reducing the differentiation between types.\n If airborne spectra do show more variance between vegetation types, then course optical differences and capturing the full potential compositional variation in each measurement are more important for discriminating vegetation types. Alternatively, there might be a correlation between vegetation type and environmental factors that alters the airborne spectral signatures, resulting in greater spectral variation among the vegetation types. \n\n\n6: Can airborne remotely-sensed spectral diversity be used to identify vegetation types at the island scale?\n\nH6: Airborne remotely-sensed spectral diversity can be used to identify vegetation types at an island scale (H6a), and when visually compared, will correspond with an existent mapping vegetation type (H6b).  \n\nH6o: Airborne remotely-sensed spectral diversity cannot be used to identify vegetation types at an island scale, and when visually compared does not correspond with an existent mapping of vegetation types. \n\nPredictions \n\nAirborne remotely-sensed spectra diversity should be able to identify vegetation types, based on categorical spectral classifications. Through isolating the most discriminative areas of the spectrum, when mapped new spatial classified vegetation types should visually correspond with an existent vegetation classification on Qikiqtaruk (Obu et al., 2017). \n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

The hyperspectral signature of an individual or community is the unique expression of electromagnetic radiation interacting with physical plant structures (Schweiger et al., 2018). Different vegetation types have dissimilar chemical, anatomical, and morphological traits, which alter the absorbance and scattering of light, resulting in the distinct patterns reflectance that compose a spectral signature (Cavender\u2010Bares et al., 2017). It will be aimed to identify Herschel and Komakuk vegetation types based on the mean and variance in spectral signatures. This will use spectral data gathered from a regional field survey on the two vegetation types.  Detailed data obtained from long-term plot monitoring, will be used to build a linear model that predicts how species richness, evenness, and soil-background influence spectral diversity.

Spectral differences occurring at both low and high wavelengths, overall result in an in-between spectral mean that is similar and does not account for internal spectral complexity. \n\nWhen ordinated, spectral signatures will discriminate by year, due to the potential difference of reflectance measurements made by the different sensor types used between 2018 &amp; 2019, as well variation in flowering phenology and community compositions between the two years.  \n\n2: How does spectral diversity relate to species richness, evenness, and soil-background?\n\nH2: Vegetation type will significantly affect spectral diversity (H2a). Higher spectral diversity will correspond with both increases in species richness (H2b) and species evenness (H2c), with evenness having the stronger relationship (H2d). Soil-background cover will have the strongest positive influence on spectral diversity (H2e). \n\nH2o: Species richness, evenness, and soil-background have no effect on spectral diversity, with no visible relationship observed. \n\nPredicted results \n\nBoth increases in richness and evenness correlate with higher observed spectral diversity, across an array of different grassland/prairie habitats (Cavender\u2010Bares et al., 2017; Schweiger et al., 2017, 2018; Wang, Gamon, Cavender-Bares, et al., 2018a; Wang and Gamon, 2019). I predict evenness will have a larger correspondence with spectral diversity, as more even representations of species are likely to increase the detection of the variable chemical and physical structures that ultimately influence spectral diversity. If richness has larger correspondence to spectral diversity, this indicates that 1) sensor resolution is sensitive enough for the detect additional species, (potentially even when at low relative abundances) and 2) this presence of additional species sufficient to significantly increase spectral diversity. \n\nI predict that soil-background is the strongest predictor of spectral diversity, as soil has distinctly different reflectance than vegetation (Gholizadeh et al., 2018). Furthermore, soils reflectance is variable depending on local microclimatic conditions such as moisture and roughness. This potential for plot level variability can therefore alter spectral signatures in more complex ways, resulting in soil having the largest correspondence with spectral diversity. \n\n\n3: Does band selection influence correspondence between spectral diversity and vegetation types \n\nH3. Both band selection via using a subset spectral region, as well as spectral zone unmixing will result in greater correspondence between spectral diversity and vegetation type (H3a). spectral zone unmixing will result in the selection of a small but spectrally diversity subset of bands (H3a), with overall regions in the visible part of the spectrum (400-700nm) having higher correspondence with vegetation type than bands in the near infrared range (700-100nm) (H3b). \n\nH3o: Band selection does not visible influence the correspondence between spectral diversity and vegetation type. There are no specific spectral regions that are best suited to discriminate vegetation types. \n\nPredicted results \n\nSelecting a subset of bands will result in better discrimination of vegetation types, as reducing spectral dimensionality excludes variable and noisy regions of the spectrum. Spectral mixture analysis using spectral zone unmixing will result in finding what zones of the spectrum are best suited to differentia vegetation types. This is achieved  by isolating bands that explain maximum between community variability, while exhibiting the minimum within community variability. \n \nIf spectral zone unmixing (SZU) results in the selection of a small subsets of bands, this indicates that specific structural or chemical differences explain most of the spectral variation between the two vegetation types. Due to shared life histories, the two vegetation types would have traits that are similar, aside from key divergent adaptations. These specific divergent traits would be most relevant for spectral discrimination. Furthermore, when collecting and disseminating spectral data, as well as running spectral analysis, high resolution measurement spectral bands/regions are more important for vegetation identification than coarsely capturing reflectance across the full spectrum. \n\nIf SZU results in the selection of a large sub-set of bands, this indicates that the differences between the two vegetation types are complex, with many regions of the spectrum (aka structural and chemical traits) being relevant and important for vegetation type discrimination. Furthermore, if SZU results in the selection of bands that correspond with and/or are not visually better than an informal literature derived selection of spectral bands, this indicates that structural and chemical differences may be relatively convergent between different Arctic vegetation types. This implies that trends between biological traits and spectral diversity may be generalizable, and that future research can aim to work at greater scales of observation, rather than synthesizing the findings at small sites. Furthermore, this is promising for the development of future satellites, as potentially selection of spectral regions may be sufficient to discriminate vegetation types. \n\nIf spectral regions in the visible spectrum (~400-700 nm) are found to best discriminate vegetation types, then chemical traits are primarily responsible for the key spectral differences between vegetation types. This spectral region corresponds with wavelengths carotenoid absorption (502-511 &amp; 533 nm) green light reflectance (~550 nm), and chlorophyll absorption (644, 653, 672 nm). If spectral regions in the red-edge transition and near infra-red plateau (700-1000 nm) are found to best discriminate vegetation types, then physical structures are primarily responsible for the key spectral differences between vegetation types. \n\n\n\n\n4: Are closer measurements more similar than more distant measurements? \n\nH4: When tested for spatial autocorrelation, closer measurements will be more similar than more distant measurements (H4a), with no visible autocorrelation occurring across vegetation type areas (H4a). \n\nH4o: There is no visible level of autocorrelation between measurements at any distance.\n\nPredicted results \n\nSpatial autocorrelation of measurements will be present but weak between proximal plots and negligible at a regional scale, due to the between plot variability of both species composition and environmental factors such as wetness and roughness. \n\n\n5: Do plot and airborne spectra differ from each other?  Does plot or airborne spectra show more variation among vegetation types?\n\nH5: Plot and airborne spectra do visually differ from each other (H5a), with plot spectra showing more variation both within vegetation types (H5b), and between vegetation types (H5c).\n\nH5o: There is no visible difference between plot and airborne spectra, with neither accounting more variation among vegetation types.   \n\n\nPredicted results \n\nI predict that plot spectra show more variance within vegetation types, as they measure a smaller spatial area, resulting in only subsets of the full variation present in a vegetation type to be observed. This higher sensor resolution captures more small-scale compositional variation in each individual measurement. If plot spectra show more variance between vegetation types, then these captured small-scale compositional differences are important factors for discriminating vegetation types. It also indicates that future work that aims to use remotely-sensed spectral data for biodiversity assessment should aim to have a pixel size smaller than individual plants and structures, ensuring that each measurement is of a single or small subset of species.\n\nAirborne spectra how lower spatial resolution, with each pixel potentially including multiple species resulting in the combined spectral signatures to be measured by the sensor. I predict that this will homogenize spectral diversity, with less variation being observed between individual measurements within a vegetation type. Furthermore, reduced spatial resolution will increase the likelihood of capturing external environmental factors, such as exposed soil or canopy structure which are likely to add noise to measurements.  This will result in less vegetation specific spectral information being captured, reducing the differentiation between types.\n If airborne spectra do show more variance between vegetation types, then course optical differences and capturing the full potential compositional variation in each measurement are more important for discriminating vegetation types. Alternatively, there might be a correlation between vegetation type and environmental factors that alters the airborne spectral signatures, resulting in greater spectral variation among the vegetation types. \n\n\n6: Can airborne remotely-sensed spectral diversity be used to identify vegetation types at the island scale?\n\nH6: Airborne remotely-sensed spectral diversity can be used to identify vegetation types at an island scale (H6a), and when visually compared, will correspond with an existent mapping vegetation type (H6b).  \n\nH6o: Airborne remotely-sensed spectral diversity cannot be used to identify vegetation types at an island scale, and when visually compared does not correspond with an existent mapping of vegetation types. \n\nPredictions \n\nAirborne remotely-sensed spectra diversity should be able to identify vegetation types, based on categorical spectral classifications. Through isolating the most discriminative areas of the spectrum, when mapped new spatial classified vegetation types should visually correspond with an existent vegetation classification on Qikiqtaruk (Obu et al., 2017). \n", "q5": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

The hyperspectral signature of an individual or community is the unique expression of electromagnetic radiation interacting with physical plant structures (Schweiger et al., 2018). Different vegetation types have dissimilar chemical, anatomical, and morphological traits, which alter the absorbance and scattering of light, resulting in the distinct patterns reflectance that compose a spectral signature (Cavender\u2010Bares et al., 2017). It will be aimed to identify Herschel and Komakuk vegetation types based on the mean and variance in spectral signatures. This will use spectral data gathered from a regional field survey on the two vegetation types.  Detailed data obtained from long-term plot monitoring, will be used to build a linear model that predicts how species richness, evenness, and soil-background influence spectral diversity. What spectral regions are most relevant at discriminating vegetation types will be investigated, by sub-setting the full spectrum into regions of bands. Band selection will occur through 1) informal literature derived selection of spectral bands and 2) performing spectral band unmixing for optimal band selection. Spectral measurements will be tested for spatial autocorrelation using a variogram. Plot spectral data will be compared to airborne hyperspectral data measured at a plane scale.

As regarded Oxytocin Receptor Gene (OXTR), the polymorphism rs2245298 and the quality in the early parental bonding moderated users' sociability in terms of posts' number and Social Desirability Index (SDI). Although we uncovered a potential influence of the individual development on Instagram social behaviour, the impact of quality in the relationship with adult peers has not yet been explored under a gene-environment perspective. This project deals with this lack by probing how the interaction between genetic factors (OXTR/rs2254298, OXTR/rs53576) and adult bonding with peers (Confidence, Discomfort with Closeness, Relationships as Secondary, Need for Approval, Preoccupation with Relationships) shapes virtual social behaviour on Instagram (number of published posts, followers, followings and the SDI, an index calculated by the ratio between the number of followers and the number of followings). Given that human behaviours are the result of combined interactions between genes and individual experiences, the question is if online social behaviour (Instagram) of vulnerable genetic carriers can be modulated by the offline relationship with friends or peers.\nFor each Instagram dependent variable, we hypothesize an interaction between genetic factors and peer attachment scores. Independently from gender, we predict that 1) adult Instagram users with genetic risk factor (OXTR rs224529 A carriers, OXTR rs53576 G carriers) and a positive and friendly relationship with peers (High Confidence, Low Discomfort with Closeness, Low Relationships as Secondary, Low Need for Approval, Low Preoccupation with Relationships) will show a higher number of posts and SDI compared to less vulnerable genetic carriers (OXTR rs224529 G/G homozygotes, OXTR rs53576 A/A homozygotes). Oppositely, 2) adult users with genetic risk factor and a negative and conflicting relationship with peers (Low Confidence, High Discomfort with Closeness, High Relationships as Secondary, High Need for Approval, High Preoccupation with Relationships) will show a lower number of posts and a lower SDI compared to less vulnerable genetic carriers.\nWe provide three analytical and theoretical justifications which lead us to test our hypothesis limited to Instagram number of posts and SDI. Firstly, the selection of two main dependent variables allows maintaining a conservative approach to data, avoiding extreme corrections due to multiple tests comparison. Secondly, the number of posts specifies the quantity of published content among the following people. We consider it an objective measure of the personal inclination to broadcast information among users. Moreover, the SDI provides a value of the balance between the number of followers and followings for each user's account. In previous research (Bonassi et al., 2019), we estimated this index to test a reliable parameter of general sociability, explained in terms of lower or higher asymmetry of the individual social network.

The regions rs2245298 and rs53576 of the Oxytocin Receptor Gene (OXTR) are a-priori considered because of their robust association with social behaviour, empathy, affect and adult attachment.\na) OXTR rs53576 is a categorical variable (levels: A/A, A/G, G/G) which contains the genotypes for the OXTR region rs53576.\nb) OXTR rs2254298 is a categorical variable (levels: A/A, G/A, G/G) which includes the genotypes for the OXTR region rs2254298.\n3) An ad-hoc prepared Python script extracted three a-priori elected parameters representative of the Instagram (IG) social behaviours. \nThe following two parameters represent the main measured dependent variables included in the confirmatory analyses of this study:\na) IG posts is an integer variable which contains the Instagram number of published posts.\nb) IG SDI is an integer variable which includes the estimate produced by the ratio between the number of followers and followings.\nThe following measured dependent variables are reported for exploratory analyses and unexpected effects of this study:\na) IG followings is an integer variable which includes the Instagram number of followed users.\nb) IG followers is an integer variable which includes the Instagram number of followers."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q16": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Every variable extracted from Instagram represents a snapshot of participants' social behaviour at a specific time point.

As regarded Oxytocin Receptor Gene (OXTR), the polymorphism rs2245298 and the quality in the early parental bonding moderated users' sociability in terms of posts' number and Social Desirability Index (SDI). Although we uncovered a potential influence of the individual development on Instagram social behaviour, the impact of quality in the relationship with adult peers has not yet been explored under a gene-environment perspective. This project deals with this lack by probing how the interaction between genetic factors (OXTR/rs2254298, OXTR/rs53576) and adult bonding with peers (Confidence, Discomfort with Closeness, Relationships as Secondary, Need for Approval, Preoccupation with Relationships) shapes virtual social behaviour on Instagram (number of published posts, followers, followings and the SDI, an index calculated by the ratio between the number of followers and the number of followings). Given that human behaviours are the result of combined interactions between genes and individual experiences, the question is if online social behaviour (Instagram) of vulnerable genetic carriers can be modulated by the offline relationship with friends or peers.\nFor each Instagram dependent variable, we hypothesize an interaction between genetic factors and peer attachment scores. Independently from gender, we predict that 1) adult Instagram users with genetic risk factor (OXTR rs224529 A carriers, OXTR rs53576 G carriers) and a positive and friendly relationship with peers (High Confidence, Low Discomfort with Closeness, Low Relationships as Secondary, Low Need for Approval, Low Preoccupation with Relationships) will show a higher number of posts and SDI compared to less vulnerable genetic carriers (OXTR rs224529 G/G homozygotes, OXTR rs53576 A/A homozygotes). Oppositely, 2) adult users with genetic risk factor and a negative and conflicting relationship with peers (Low Confidence, High Discomfort with Closeness, High Relationships as Secondary, High Need for Approval, High Preoccupation with Relationships) will show a lower number of posts and a lower SDI compared to less vulnerable genetic carriers.\nWe provide three analytical and theoretical justifications which lead us to test our hypothesis limited to Instagram number of posts and SDI. Firstly, the selection of two main dependent variables allows maintaining a conservative approach to data, avoiding extreme corrections due to multiple tests comparison. Secondly, the number of posts specifies the quantity of published content among the following people. We consider it an objective measure of the personal inclination to broadcast information among users. Moreover, the SDI provides a value of the balance between the number of followers and followings for each user's account. In previous research (Bonassi et al., 2019), we estimated this index to test a reliable parameter of general sociability, explained in terms of lower or higher asymmetry of the individual social network.

Four participants were not included due to failure in a) questionnaires' online compilation or b) Instagram data extraction. In the end, our sample consisted of 58 Singaporean adults (16 males). The Ethical Committee of Nanyang Technological University approved the research (IRB-2015-08-020-01), which was conducted in line with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Input parameters corrected the alpha at 0.025 and set Power at 0.90, total sample size at 58, numerator degrees of freedom at 1, number of groups at 2, number of covariates at 5. After the calculation, the output parameters showed a large effect size (0.47). This parameter is in line with previous studies which found a statistical power equal between 0.90 and 0.99 given a large effect size (for example, see Truzzi et al., 2018; Bonassi et al., 2020). Moreover, interaction effects between peer attachment and genotype will also be analyzed by two Student's t-test. Given that the researcher has not yet permitted to access the dataset, it is not possible to estimate the sample size of the two comparing groups required for a sensitivity analysis (corrected alpha at 0.025, expected Power at 0.80).
