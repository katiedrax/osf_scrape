It allows an individual to quickly and flexibly adapt to new demands, problems or rules. The preschool years are a crucial period in the development of EFs. As EFs are crucial for regulating other cognitive abilities such as reading and writing and are predictive of school readiness, professional success later in life, and health behaviours, assessing EF abilities in preschool years has gained significant research interest. \nHowever, to date, there is still a shortage of tasks assessing attentional set shifting in pre-schoolers. The most prominent task is the Dimensional Change Card Sort Test (DCCCS). However, this task has been criticized for posing a substantial language demand on children; in addition, cross-cultural research has shown that the task also requires experience with culture-specific arbitrary symbol-response mappings.\nTherefore, based on existing \u201ctwo-choice complex stimulus discrimination\u201d set shifting tasks (such as the Intradimensional/Extradimensional (ID/ED) task of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated Test Battery (CANTAB), we have created a new, non-verbal set shifting task (Shifting Tray task) without the need for prior experience with abstract, symbolic print materials.

In contrast, younger children, who lack that experience, would need a comparable number of trials to reach the learning criterion for cup and substrate, respectively. However, one could also assume the opposite relationship, in that the effect of the relevant dimension in preswitch is only found in young children: This line of thinking would assume that both older and younger children have substantial experience with cups as containers and thus would be biased in assuming that one of the cups is predictive of the reward.

In each trial, children will be presented with two transparent square plastic trays (20.3 x 20.3 x 5.1 cm) placed next to each other. The trays differ on two dimensions: each tray is filled with a different substrate, and each tray has a different cup placed upside down on top of the substrate in the middle of the tray (see Fig. 1 for an example). Over the course of the trials (see below), each combination of materials and location of the trays (left/right) is counterbalanced.\nThere are 2 sets of materials:\n-\tSet 1: \n        Cups: yellow, purple \n        Substrates: red paper, green sand\n-\tSet 2:\n        Cups: orange, pink\n        Substrates: yellow Easter basket filling material, blue cotton wool\n\nChildren will be asked to look for a sticker. In each trial, they can only choose one tray to search (forced choice paradigm). Out of children\u2019s sight (i.e., behind an occluder), the experimenter hides a sticker on one of the trays, underneath one of the cups. Depending on the condition (see below), it is either one of the cups or one of the substrates which is predictive of the reward. The same stimulus will be predictive of the reward until the end of the preswitch phase is reached (i.e., when the learning criterion or the maximum number of trials is reached). If, and only if, a child reaches the learning criterion, they proceed to the postswitch phase. In the postswitch phase, all materials change (total change paradigm; from set 1 to set 2 or vice versa). Depending on the condition, the dimension predictive of the stimulus will either be the same as in the preswitch phase (Intradimensional (ID) switch) or the dimension that was irrelevant in the preswitch phase (Extradimensional (ED) switch).\n\nWe have a between-subjects 3 x 2 x 2 multifactorial design (age: 3 years, 4 years, 5 years; switch type: ID/ED; start dimension: cup/substrate) design with random allocation to condition within each age group, resulting in four conditions per age group (ID-cup, ID-substrate, ED-cup, ED-substrate), see Table 1.\n\nThe maximum number of trials in both the preswitch and postswitch phases is 36, respectively. Trials are grouped into 3 blocks of 12 in order to facilitate counterbalancing. \nCounterbalancing is used according to material positions and combinations and location of the sticker. As a result, in each block of 12 trials, each stimulus and stimulus combination will occur equally often on both the left and the right tray (e.g., the red paper will occur 6 times on the left tray (3 times with the yellow container, 3 times with the purple tumbler) and 6 times on the right tray (again 3 times with the yellow container, 3 times with the purple tumbler). In addition, we use the rule that the same stimulus cannot appear more than three times in a row on the same location.\n\nGender will also be counterbalanced throughout study implementation. \n\nParticipants first take part in the preswitch phase. This ends when the participant has reached the learning criterion (6 trials in a row correct in block 1 or \u2013 if children do not reach this criterion and move on to the next block, any 9 out of 12 trials in either block 2 or 3 correct) or when the maximum number of 36 trials is reached.\nIf, and only if, the learning criterion is met, children proceed to the postswitch phase. Here, all materials will be exchanged (total change paradigm). Depending on the condition, children then experience either an ID switch (from cup to cup or from substrate to substrate) or an ED switch (from cup to substrate or from substrate to cup). This switch is not being announced to the child. The postswitch phase ends when the learning criterion is met (same as in preswitch) or the maximum number of trials (36) is reached.\n\nFor a more exploratory analysis, participants will be asked after completion of the task to articulate how they found the sticker in the postswitch phase. \n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Fig. 1.JPG"}, "nodeId": "pcs8b", "sha256": "0f73795b83fc79e5535238cecc597824da24e8c577a15d0a19ebad410fcb941d", "viewUrl": "/project/esbqg/files/osfstorage/5e2c2681c19c5d0148ee20a2/", "selectedFileName": "Fig. 1.JPG"}, {"data": {"name": "Table 1.docx"}, "nodeId": "pcs8b", "sha256": "bc2d9b99d388b41752054b2221ae93a06bf1dd588839f1d35ce72a07607d87c9", "viewUrl": "/project/esbqg/files/osfstorage/5e2c2681c19c5d0148ee20a4/", "selectedFileName": "Table 1.docx"}], "value": ""}}}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": "We use a blocked randomisation, where each participant will first be assigned to one of three age blocks (3, 4, 5 years).

Depending on the condition (see below), it is either one of the cups or one of the substrates which is predictive of the reward. The same stimulus will be predictive of the reward until the end of the preswitch phase is reached (i.e., when the learning criterion or the maximum number of trials is reached). If, and only if, a child reaches the learning criterion, they proceed to the postswitch phase. In the postswitch phase, all materials change (total change paradigm; from set 1 to set 2 or vice versa). Depending on the condition, the dimension predictive of the stimulus will either be the same as in the preswitch phase (Intradimensional (ID) switch) or the dimension that was irrelevant in the preswitch phase (Extradimensional (ED) switch).\n\nWe have a between-subjects 3 x 2 x 2 multifactorial design (age: 3 years, 4 years, 5 years; switch type: ID/ED; start dimension: cup/substrate) design with random allocation to condition within each age group, resulting in four conditions per age group (ID-cup, ID-substrate, ED-cup, ED-substrate), see Table 1.\n\nThe maximum number of trials in both the preswitch and postswitch phases is 36, respectively. Trials are grouped into 3 blocks of 12 in order to facilitate counterbalancing. \nCounterbalancing is used according to material positions and combinations and location of the sticker. As a result, in each block of 12 trials, each stimulus and stimulus combination will occur equally often on both the left and the right tray (e.g., the red paper will occur 6 times on the left tray (3 times with the yellow container, 3 times with the purple tumbler) and 6 times on the right tray (again 3 times with the yellow container, 3 times with the purple tumbler). In addition, we use the rule that the same stimulus cannot appear more than three times in a row on the same location.\n\nGender will also be counterbalanced throughout study implementation. \n\nParticipants first take part in the preswitch phase. This ends when the participant has reached the learning criterion (6 trials in a row correct in block 1 or \u2013 if children do not reach this criterion and move on to the next block, any 9 out of 12 trials in either block 2 or 3 correct) or when the maximum number of 36 trials is reached.\nIf, and only if, the learning criterion is met, children proceed to the postswitch phase. Here, all materials will be exchanged (total change paradigm). Depending on the condition, children then experience either an ID switch (from cup to cup or from substrate to substrate) or an ED switch (from cup to substrate or from substrate to cup). This switch is not being announced to the child. The postswitch phase ends when the learning criterion is met (same as in preswitch) or the maximum number of trials (36) is reached.\n\nFor a more exploratory analysis, participants will be asked after completion of the task to articulate how they found the sticker in the postswitch phase. \n\n", "q8.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e2c2681c19c5d0148ee20a2", "file_name": "Fig. 1.JPG", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/esbqg/files/osfstorage/5e2c2681c19c5d0148ee20a2", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e2c2681c19c5d0148ee20a2"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "0f73795b83fc79e5535238cecc597824da24e8c577a15d0a19ebad410fcb941d"}}, {"file_id": "5e2c2681c19c5d0148ee20a4", "file_name": "Table 1.docx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/esbqg/files/osfstorage/5e2c2681c19c5d0148ee20a4", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e2c2681c19c5d0148ee20a4"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "bc2d9b99d388b41752054b2221ae93a06bf1dd588839f1d35ce72a07607d87c9"}}], "q12.question": "Data will be collected at the Science Centre in Dundee through voluntary sampling.

The asymmetry was evaluated using a funnel plot in those analyses formed by at least five studies, which indicates the possible risk of publication of small studies with negative results. Studies were analyzed using the Review Manager 5.3 statistical software\n\nInterventions were categorized in groups according to the follow up. We realized subgroups depending on the follow up: short, med and long-term.

This search strategy aims to identify all publications that explicitly refer to EBQI. The search strategy for the database PubMed is documented in the appendix.\nRegarding KQ2, a broader search strategy will identify quality improvement intervention (QII) evaluations. The search strategy assumes that there is little consensus on terminology. Some EBQI publications will not describe their work as EBQI even when authors have explicitly used an evidence-based strategy for quality improvement. In addition, although authors may describe an EBQI approach in the full text article of the study, the title, abstract, or keyword of the publication may not reference EBQI, i.e., the elements that are searchable in research databases such as PubMed will not mention EBQI. For this reason, we are using two independent search strategies to identify relevant publications for KQ1 and KQ2. To answer KQ2, we will sample the QII literature to identify evaluations of initiatives that meet basic eligibility criteria. The search will be limited to three years in order to allow the use of an unselected sample of studies within the given resources of the project. The preliminary search strategy for one database is documented in the appendix. \nRegarding KQ3, we will conduct a search for fidelity measures that may have been published in the scientific literature or that are available in the public domain. The draft search strategy is documented in the appendix.\nRegarding KQ4, we will use EBQI studies meeting inclusion criteria for KQ1 and we will augment the sample with KQ2 studies that two independent literature reviewers deem compatible with EBQI.\n\nSources\nWe will search research databases and grey literature for the scoping review. To identify publications relevant to KQ1, KQ2, or KQ3, we will search the research databases PubMed (biomedical literature), CINAHL (nursing and allied health profession literature), and SCOPUS (social sciences). In addition, we will mine the references of included publications and confer with content experts. To identify fidelity measures, we will also search https://dissemination-implementation.org/, an interactive webtool for implementation and dissemination models and tools. KQ4 will use evaluation studies meeting inclusion criteria for KQ1 and KQ2.\n\nEligibility criteria\nThe eligibility criteria are organized in a SPIOS (study design, participants, intervention, outcome, setting) framework where applicable.\nKQ1: EBQI sample\n\u2022\tCitations using the term \u201cevidence-based quality improvement\u201d or \u201cevidence based quality improvement\u201d in the title, abstract, and keyword of the publication will be eligible for inclusion regardless of the study design and publication year, participants, intervention, outcome, or setting. We will accept the authors\u2019 definition of EBQI.\nKQ2: Additional QI sample\n\u2022\tStudy design and publication type\no\tEligible publications have to report on the results of an intervention and have to have been published in the last three years, i.e., when the term EBQI has been used more frequently in publications.2-5,8,10-15,17,18,20,22,25-27,34,36,42 Empirical studies may use concurrent (e.g., randomized controlled trials, clinical trials) or historic comparators (pre-post studies, organizational case series, time series). \no\tWe will retain relevant systematic reviews for reference-mining.\n\u2022\tParticipants\no\tPublications have to address healthcare professionals working on quality improvement in healthcare delivery organizations to be eligible.\n\u2022\tIntervention \no\tPublications addressing quality improvement in healthcare delivery organizations and learning health systems will be eligible. Quality improvement is defined as a structural change in how healthcare is delivered. Studies need to refer to a literature or evidence review in the development of the QII by the healthcare delivery organization (evidence can be defined as published research evidence as well as locally generated data). In addition, studies need to report on continued use of evidence during the initiative after selecting the intervention or implementation strategy, e.g., using data to evaluate the effects of the QII (Plan-Do-Study-Act [PDSA] cycles, statistical process control).\n\u2022\tOutcome\no\tEmpirical studies reporting on the effect of a QII will be eligible. Studies may report on structural measures (e.g., organizational changes, costs), process measures (e.g., performance measures such as number of tests ordered; utilization, unintended consequences), and outcomes (e.g., health outcomes, patient satisfaction, adverse events)\n\u2022\tSetting\no\tStudies in primary care will be eligible. Studies in secondary care facilities, hospitals, nursing homes, dentist facilities, and laboratories, or other facilities without direct contact to patients will be excluded. In addition, we will exclude studies in developing countries.\nKQ3: Fidelity measures\n\u2022\tTools assessing fidelity will be eligible for inclusion. These tools need to assess the fidelity with which an intervention or implementation strategy was executed as intended. Tools may be designed to assess overall fidelity or fidelity to specific intervention or implementation strategy components. Existing tools will be included regardless of the format (e.g., website), study design and publication type and year, or clinical area. Tools are not limited to EBQI or quality improvement.\nKQ4: Effectiveness sample\nAll studies reporting effectiveness results for evaluation of an EBQI initiative will be eligible for inclusion. In addition, two independent literature reviewers will assess studies included in KQ2 for compatibility with EBQI. \n\u2022\tStudy design and publication type\no\tKQ1 or KQ2 publications have to report on the results of an intervention to be eligible for KQ4. Empirical studies may use concurrent (e.g., randomized controlled trials, clinical trials) or historic comparators (pre-post studies, organizational case series, time series). \n\u2022\tParticipants\no\tKQ1 or KQ2 publications have to address healthcare professionals working on quality improvement in healthcare delivery organizations to be eligible.\n\u2022\tIntervention \no\tKQ1 and KQ2 QII publications in healthcare delivery organizations and learning health systems will be eligible. Studies need to describe their approach as EBQI or refer to a literature or evidence review as part of the development as well as the evaluation of the initiative. \n\u2022\tOutcome\no\tKQ1 and KQ2 empirical QII studies reporting on patient outcomes will be eligible.\n\u2022\tSetting\no\tKQ1 and KQ2 empirical evaluations of QI interventions in primary care will be eligible; studies in developing countries will be excluded.\nData abstraction\nFor all EBQI citations (KQ1) we will abstract the following:\n\u2022\tAuthor, publication year, unique study identifier\n\u2022\tDefinition of EBQI or the first sentence where EBQI is mentioned\n\u2022\tOther relevant concept associated with EBQI\n\u2022\tFunded by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)\n\u2022\tReference to Lisa Rubenstein\u2019s group (known EBQI researchers) \n\u2022\tReference to any other EBQI publication in lieu of defining EBQI \nIn addition, we will abstract EBQI components (KQ1a, KQ2). The data abstraction will use the draft components listed here together with the current working definition of the components:\n\u2022\tUsing evidence (data) to identify the target of the QI intervention\no\tCiting a literature review as part of the process of identifying an issue or problem, or a description of local data demonstrating the issue\n\u2022\tIterative, interactive process for selecting the intervention and identifying evidence\no\tEvidence of a back-and-forth discussion within the organization, interactive selection of the intervention\n\u2022\tReaching out to stakeholders in the organization, collaborative process\no\tEngaging diverse organizational stakeholders; top-down/bottom-up approach\n\u2022\tEvidence to identify effective interventions\no\tDescribes a literature review to identify effective interventions in the research literature (or find authoritative source that recommends specific interventions)\n\u2022\tQI facilitation\no\tMay refer to an external facilitator, internal coordinator or learning collaborative; coaching and mentoring for quality improvement processes\n\u2022\tLeadership / management involvement\no\tMedical director, nurse leadership, primary care leadership, chief medical officer, nurse manager; some evidence of ongoing involvement, more than one-time approval or briefing at the end\n\u2022\tFrontline personnel engagement \no\tClinicians (physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistants), allied clinical staff (nurses, licensed vocational nurses, medical assistants), administrative staff (e.g., front desk, scheduling); engagement needs to start at selecting intervention, not just when change is decided\n\u2022\tUse of evidence to determine success\no\tEvaluation data of the intervention (feasibility, intervention adherence, effectiveness, performance measures; quantitative or qualitative data); this may include an iterative approach, PDSA cycles or collaborative learning sessions\n\u2022\tAnalytic support\no\tDedicated statistician, additional analyst beyond the clinical team; statistical support to analyze results of the intervention, analysis of multiple data sources, analysis of performance feedback, formative feedback analysis\n\u2022\tOther (specify)\no\tE.g., champion, VA demonstration site leader (manager of clinic), practice manager, regional experts, academic experts (e.g., homelessness content expert), adverse events, unintended consequences monitored?\n\u2022\tContext\no\tFor context, we will also abstract study ID, topic area, type of outcome, definition of evidence, engagement (who is part of the initiative), named QI and implementation strategy\nWe expect that the descriptions will be further refined to allow reliable study characterization. The working definitions will be informed by the current empirical evidence, i.e., the included studies. Areas difficult to operationalize will be documented in detail to ensure transparency such as classifying the role of a project manager, the differentiation between administrative and clinical leadership, how ongoing involvement should be defined, whether use of evidence was iterative, and whether access to data may be more critical than analytic support. \nKQ2\nFor KQ2, we will abstract from the EBQI intervention evaluations and the broader QI sample how \u201cevidence\u201d was used according to the study authors. In addition, we will extract from the studies how \u201cevidence\u201d was defined (KQ2a). We will also abstract additional information for context:\n\u2022\tStudy ID\n\u2022\tTopic area\n\u2022\tType of outcome\n\u2022\tDefinition of evidence\n\u2022\tEngagement (who is part of the initiative)\n\u2022\tNamed QI and implementation strategy\nKQ3\nFor KQ3 we will abstract for each included tool (e.g., https://www.pbis.org/resource/tips-fidelity-checklist):\n\u2022\tTool name\n\u2022\tDevelopers\n\u2022\tPublication year\n\u2022\tAim, purpose, and scope\n\u2022\tUnderlying model \n\u2022\tDescription (e.g., number of items, answer mode)\n\u2022\tReliability information (e.g., rater agreement)\n\u2022\tValidity information (e.g., evidence that the fidelity scale measures fidelity)\n\u2022\tLink to tool (where available) or citation of publication about the tool\nKQ4\nFor studies meeting inclusion criteria for KQ4 we will abstract the following variables:\n\u2022\tStudy ID\n\u2022\tStudy design\n\u2022\tSetting\n\u2022\tParticipants\n\u2022\tEBQI / implementation strategy\n\u2022\tIntervention (clinical area, type, description)\n\u2022\tOutcome and results (number of participants in the intervention group, number of participants in the control group, outcome type, exact measure, follow-up relative to the start of the intervention rollout, results in comparison to the control group [point estimate and measure of dispersion])"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "This is not known yet."}, "q14": {"extra": [], "value": "We will document the presence and absence of information."}, "q15": {"extra": [], "value": "N/A"}, "q16": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "N/A"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q17": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "To answer KQ1 (How is EBQI defined?), all identified EBQI definitions will be documented. This collation of definitions will be based on publications explicitly using the term \u201cEBQI\u201d in the title or abstract of the publication. \nTo answer KQ1a (What are the components of EBQI?), we will employ a 2-step process. First, we will document the components described in the EBQI sample, i.e., evaluations explicitly referencing EBQI. The evidence table will include a grid of components that will allow a clear overview of the relative frequency of components. The synthesis will follow the structure of the table. The component table will serve as an overarching EBQI framework. In a second step, the component analysis will be applied to a wider QII sample. The results of applying the component analysis to this sample will be documented in an evidence table and narrative synthesis.

This search strategy aims to identify all publications that explicitly refer to EBQI. The search strategy for the database PubMed is documented in the appendix.\nRegarding KQ2, a broader search strategy will identify quality improvement intervention (QII) evaluations. The search strategy assumes that there is little consensus on terminology. Some EBQI publications will not describe their work as EBQI even when authors have explicitly used an evidence-based strategy for quality improvement. In addition, although authors may describe an EBQI approach in the full text article of the study, the title, abstract, or keyword of the publication may not reference EBQI, i.e., the elements that are searchable in research databases such as PubMed will not mention EBQI. For this reason, we are using two independent search strategies to identify relevant publications for KQ1 and KQ2. To answer KQ2, we will sample the QII literature to identify evaluations of initiatives that meet basic eligibility criteria. The search will be limited to three years in order to allow the use of an unselected sample of studies within the given resources of the project. The preliminary search strategy for one database is documented in the appendix. \nRegarding KQ3, we will conduct a search for fidelity measures that may have been published in the scientific literature or that are available in the public domain. The draft search strategy is documented in the appendix.\nRegarding KQ4, we will use EBQI studies meeting inclusion criteria for KQ1 and we will augment the sample with KQ2 studies that two independent literature reviewers deem compatible with EBQI.\n\nSources\nWe will search research databases and grey literature for the scoping review. To identify publications relevant to KQ1, KQ2, or KQ3, we will search the research databases PubMed (biomedical literature), CINAHL (nursing and allied health profession literature), and SCOPUS (social sciences). In addition, we will mine the references of included publications and confer with content experts. To identify fidelity measures, we will also search https://dissemination-implementation.org/, an interactive webtool for implementation and dissemination models and tools. KQ4 will use evaluation studies meeting inclusion criteria for KQ1 and KQ2.\n\nEligibility criteria\nThe eligibility criteria are organized in a SPIOS (study design, participants, intervention, outcome, setting) framework where applicable.\nKQ1: EBQI sample\n\u2022\tCitations using the term \u201cevidence-based quality improvement\u201d or \u201cevidence based quality improvement\u201d in the title, abstract, and keyword of the publication will be eligible for inclusion regardless of the study design and publication year, participants, intervention, outcome, or setting. We will accept the authors\u2019 definition of EBQI.\nKQ2: Additional QI sample\n\u2022\tStudy design and publication type\no\tEligible publications have to report on the results of an intervention and have to have been published in the last three years, i.e., when the term EBQI has been used more frequently in publications.2-5,8,10-15,17,18,20,22,25-27,34,36,42 Empirical studies may use concurrent (e.g., randomized controlled trials, clinical trials) or historic comparators (pre-post studies, organizational case series, time series). \no\tWe will retain relevant systematic reviews for reference-mining.\n\u2022\tParticipants\no\tPublications have to address healthcare professionals working on quality improvement in healthcare delivery organizations to be eligible.\n\u2022\tIntervention \no\tPublications addressing quality improvement in healthcare delivery organizations and learning health systems will be eligible. Quality improvement is defined as a structural change in how healthcare is delivered. Studies need to refer to a literature or evidence review in the development of the QII by the healthcare delivery organization (evidence can be defined as published research evidence as well as locally generated data). In addition, studies need to report on continued use of evidence during the initiative after selecting the intervention or implementation strategy, e.g., using data to evaluate the effects of the QII (Plan-Do-Study-Act [PDSA] cycles, statistical process control).\n\u2022\tOutcome\no\tEmpirical studies reporting on the effect of a QII will be eligible. Studies may report on structural measures (e.g., organizational changes, costs), process measures (e.g., performance measures such as number of tests ordered; utilization, unintended consequences), and outcomes (e.g., health outcomes, patient satisfaction, adverse events)\n\u2022\tSetting\no\tStudies in primary care will be eligible. Studies in secondary care facilities, hospitals, nursing homes, dentist facilities, and laboratories, or other facilities without direct contact to patients will be excluded. In addition, we will exclude studies in developing countries.\nKQ3: Fidelity measures\n\u2022\tTools assessing fidelity will be eligible for inclusion. These tools need to assess the fidelity with which an intervention or implementation strategy was executed as intended. Tools may be designed to assess overall fidelity or fidelity to specific intervention or implementation strategy components. Existing tools will be included regardless of the format (e.g., website), study design and publication type and year, or clinical area. Tools are not limited to EBQI or quality improvement.\nKQ4: Effectiveness sample\nAll studies reporting effectiveness results for evaluation of an EBQI initiative will be eligible for inclusion. In addition, two independent literature reviewers will assess studies included in KQ2 for compatibility with EBQI. \n\u2022\tStudy design and publication type\no\tKQ1 or KQ2 publications have to report on the results of an intervention to be eligible for KQ4. Empirical studies may use concurrent (e.g., randomized controlled trials, clinical trials) or historic comparators (pre-post studies, organizational case series, time series). \n\u2022\tParticipants\no\tKQ1 or KQ2 publications have to address healthcare professionals working on quality improvement in healthcare delivery organizations to be eligible.\n\u2022\tIntervention \no\tKQ1 and KQ2 QII publications in healthcare delivery organizations and learning health systems will be eligible. Studies need to describe their approach as EBQI or refer to a literature or evidence review as part of the development as well as the evaluation of the initiative. \n\u2022\tOutcome\no\tKQ1 and KQ2 empirical QII studies reporting on patient outcomes will be eligible.\n\u2022\tSetting\no\tKQ1 and KQ2 empirical evaluations of QI interventions in primary care will be eligible; studies in developing countries will be excluded.\nData abstraction\nFor all EBQI citations (KQ1) we will abstract the following:\n\u2022\tAuthor, publication year, unique study identifier\n\u2022\tDefinition of EBQI or the first sentence where EBQI is mentioned\n\u2022\tOther relevant concept associated with EBQI\n\u2022\tFunded by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)\n\u2022\tReference to Lisa Rubenstein\u2019s group (known EBQI researchers) \n\u2022\tReference to any other EBQI publication in lieu of defining EBQI \nIn addition, we will abstract EBQI components (KQ1a, KQ2). The data abstraction will use the draft components listed here together with the current working definition of the components:\n\u2022\tUsing evidence (data) to identify the target of the QI intervention\no\tCiting a literature review as part of the process of identifying an issue or problem, or a description of local data demonstrating the issue\n\u2022\tIterative, interactive process for selecting the intervention and identifying evidence\no\tEvidence of a back-and-forth discussion within the organization, interactive selection of the intervention\n\u2022\tReaching out to stakeholders in the organization, collaborative process\no\tEngaging diverse organizational stakeholders; top-down/bottom-up approach\n\u2022\tEvidence to identify effective interventions\no\tDescribes a literature review to identify effective interventions in the research literature (or find authoritative source that recommends specific interventions)\n\u2022\tQI facilitation\no\tMay refer to an external facilitator, internal coordinator or learning collaborative; coaching and mentoring for quality improvement processes\n\u2022\tLeadership / management involvement\no\tMedical director, nurse leadership, primary care leadership, chief medical officer, nurse manager; some evidence of ongoing involvement, more than one-time approval or briefing at the end\n\u2022\tFrontline personnel engagement \no\tClinicians (physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistants), allied clinical staff (nurses, licensed vocational nurses, medical assistants), administrative staff (e.g., front desk, scheduling); engagement needs to start at selecting intervention, not just when change is decided\n\u2022\tUse of evidence to determine success\no\tEvaluation data of the intervention (feasibility, intervention adherence, effectiveness, performance measures; quantitative or qualitative data); this may include an iterative approach, PDSA cycles or collaborative learning sessions\n\u2022\tAnalytic support\no\tDedicated statistician, additional analyst beyond the clinical team; statistical support to analyze results of the intervention, analysis of multiple data sources, analysis of performance feedback, formative feedback analysis\n\u2022\tOther (specify)\no\tE.g., champion, VA demonstration site leader (manager of clinic), practice manager, regional experts, academic experts (e.g., homelessness content expert), adverse events, unintended consequences monitored?\n\u2022\tContext\no\tFor context, we will also abstract study ID, topic area, type of outcome, definition of evidence, engagement (who is part of the initiative), named QI and implementation strategy\nWe expect that the descriptions will be further refined to allow reliable study characterization. The working definitions will be informed by the current empirical evidence, i.e., the included studies. Areas difficult to operationalize will be documented in detail to ensure transparency such as classifying the role of a project manager, the differentiation between administrative and clinical leadership, how ongoing involvement should be defined, whether use of evidence was iterative, and whether access to data may be more critical than analytic support. \nKQ2\nFor KQ2, we will abstract from the EBQI intervention evaluations and the broader QI sample how \u201cevidence\u201d was used according to the study authors. In addition, we will extract from the studies how \u201cevidence\u201d was defined (KQ2a).
