Helping (i.e., responding to an instrumental need, such as picking up a dropped object) often appears earlier in development than comforting (i.e., responding to emotional distress, such as by soothing someone who is injured; Dunfield &amp; Kuhlmeier, 2013; Svetlova, Nichols, &amp; Brownell, 2010). \n\nChildren's prosociality is also influenced by personal factors. Shyness is sometimes found to be a barrier to young children's prosocial behaviour, though its impact varies greatly by the context in which that behaviour is measured (e.g., Karasewich, Kuhlmeier, Beier, &amp; Dunfield, 2019; Schuhmacher, Collard, &amp; K\u00e4rtner, 2017).  \n\nThe purpose of the present study is to examine different factors that would make comforting a more difficult task than helping for young children, in particular those who are shy.  To do this, we have compared preschool children's performance on four prosocial tasks that varied, in a 2 x 2 design, by type (i.e., helping vs. comforting) and the focus of the prosocial problem (i.e., object vs. social). Changing the focus of the prosocial problem allowed us to vary the level of social engagement required to be prosocial: object-focused tasks allowed children to respond in a less engaged way, by presenting them with an object upon which they could act, while social-focused tasks encouraged children to engage with the person in need more directly. \n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Original Hypotheses:\n\n1) We expected more children to provide help, overall, than comfort and to be more spontaneous when helping than comforting (i.e., to need fewer cues to act from the experimenter). \n\n2) We also expected, however, for children be more prosocial and more spontaneously prosocial in object-focused tasks than social-focused tasks. Thus, we expected to find an interaction in performance between the type of prosocial task (helping; comforting) and focus of the prosocial problem (object; social).\n\n3) We expected children who are securely attached to their mothers to be more prosocial, overall, than children who are insecurely attached.  \n\nNew Hypotheses:\n\nBecause we have already run analyses on the original hypotheses (see explanation in Existing Data) and we found little variance in performance on the helping tasks, the next, unanalyzed, hypotheses are based only on comforting behaviour.\n\n4) We expect children\u2019s prosocial behaviour in the social-focused comforting task (i.e., Hurt Knee) to correlate negatively with their level of shyness (i.e., highly shy children will be less likely to be prosocial in social-focused tasks). In contrast, we do not expect children\u2019s level of shyness and prosocial behaviour in the object-focused comforting task (i.e., Broken Toy) to be related. \n\n5) When children provide comfort and do so in a verbal manner, we expect shyer children to be \u2018object-oriented\u2019 (e.g., suggesting ways the experimenter could fix her broken toy) rather than 'social-oriented' (e.g., telling the experimenter not to cry when she realizes her toy is broken), even when the focus of the prosocial problem is social (i.e., in both the Broken Toy and Hurt Knee tasks). \n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

The prosocial tasks varied, in a 2x2 design, by type (i.e., helping; comforting) and focus of the prosocial problem (i.e., object; social). In helping tasks, the experimenter had a problem in the form of an instrumental need, while in comforting tasks she had a problem in the form of emotional distress. In object-focused prosocial tasks, the child could respond to the helping/comforting problem while focusing on a particular object(s) in the environment, while in the social-focused prosocial tasks, the child would likely have to focus on the experimenter herself when responding to the problem. The four tasks are described in detail below, in the Procedure Outline.\n\nIn each prosocial task the child was given up to three cues to respond prosocially, spaced approximately 5 seconds apart for a total of 15 seconds. Cues were given until the child had performed the highest level of a prosocial act for that task (i.e., approaching the experimenter to provide physical comfort in the comforting tasks; physically picking up the target objects in the helping tasks). The order of the prosocial tasks was counterbalanced, such that half of the children received a helping task first (i.e., the Lego task) and half received a comforting task first (i.e., the Hurt Knee task).\n\nProcedure Outline (Order A):\n\n1) Delay Game: Puzzle\n\nAt the start of the study, the experimenter and child played the first delay game together - completing a puzzle (of the characters from the TV show \"Paw Patrol\").\n\n2) Prosocial Task: Hurt Knee (Social-Comforting)\n\nThe child was then given the first prosocial task, the Hurt Knee task, in which the experimenter went into an adjoining room to get more toys and then banged her knee on the doorframe while coming back. She said \"Ouch,\" and rubbed her knee while sitting down and then told the child, \"Oh, my knee! I banged my knee!\" This served as the first of three cues for the child to act. After 5 seconds, a second cue could be given: \"Ouch, that really hurts!\" The final cue, after 5 more seconds, was, \"Is there something you can do?\" If the child did not comfort after 15 seconds total, the experimenter solved her own problem: \"Oh, I am all better now! I just had to rub it.\"\n\n3) Delay Game: Tower\n\nNext, the experimenter and child built a tall tower out of Lego Duplo bricks. When the tower was complete, the experimenter put the bricks into a bucket to put them away.\n\n4) Prosocial Task: Lego (Object-Helping)\n\nWhile walking to the door of the adjacent room to put the Lego bricks away, the experimenter 'accidentally' spilled them onto the floor. She said, \"Whoops, I spilled the bricks!\" as the first cue for the child to act. After 5 seconds, if the child had not yet responded, the experimenter bent down and picked up two of the bricks then put her arm out to reach for bricks further away, saying \"I can't reach them all!\" The final cue, after 5 more seconds, was, \"Is there something you can do?\" If the child did not help after 15 seconds, the experimenter picked up all of the bricks herself, saying \"It's okay, I got them.\" If the child did start to help within those 15 seconds, the experimenter said \"Thank you. I should put this [the puzzle] away too!\" and left the child to finish picking up the bricks. \n\n5) Delay Game: Memory\n\nThe experimenter then brought out the game Memory to play with the child and explained the rules (\"For every card here there is another one that looks the exact same. Every time it's your turn, you can turn around two cards and if they are the same you can keep them!\"). The cards that they played with had cartoon animals on their faces, with 10 pairs in total. \n\n6) Prosocial Task: Broken Toy (Object-Comforting)\n\nAt the start of the next prosocial task, the experimenter brought out a toy dog to show the child, which she described as her favourite toy. She played with the toy a bit while telling the child why she liked it (e.g., \"I like his floppy ears!\"), then stopped when she 'noticed' a rip in the dog's paw. She gasped and said, \"Oh no! My dog! I ripped my doggy!\" as the first cue for the child to act. She immediately put the toy down on the table (within reach of the child) and covered her face with her hands. She did not touch or interact with the toy again until the task ended. After 5 seconds, she could give the second cue, \u201cOh no, I'm really sad!\" and the final cue, \"Is there something you can do?\" was given 5 seconds after that. If 15 seconds passed without the child making a prosocial response, or if the child did respond prosocially in a way that would not immediately solve the experimenter's problem (e.g., suggesting that they ask the child's mother to sew the rip), the experimenter 'realized', \"Oh, we can just push the stuffing back inside! See, it's all better now!\"\n\n7) Delay Game: Tic-Tac-Toe\n\nThe experimenter then brought out a magnetic tic-tac-toe game to play with the child and explained the rules (\"It goes like this: each player tries to put his 3 symbols in a row, either from top to bottom, side to side, or across\"). They played 2-3 rounds of tic-tac-toe. \n \n8) Prosocial Task: Sticker (Social-Helping)\n\nAt the start of the final prosocial task, the experimenter went to get a jacket from the adjacent room because, \"[she was] a little chilly.\" She put the jacket, which had a square post-it note sticker stuck to the back (in between the shoulder blades), on in the adjacent room before coming back to the testing room. The experimenter then went to reach for a pen behind the table when she 'realized', \"Whoops, I think I have something on my back!\" This line, and the experimenter trying to reach for the sticker, served as the first cue for the child to act. If the child had not taken the sticker off within 5 seconds, the experimenter said \"I can't reach it!\" After 5 more seconds, she could give the final cue, \"Is there something you can do?\" If the child did not respond within 15 seconds, the experimenter said, \"It's okay, I got it!\", pulled the jacket to bring the sticker within reach, and took it off.  \n\n9) Free Play\n\nThe experimenter and the child then played with toys in the adjacent room until the research assistant indicated that the child's mother had completed the Q-Sort, by knocking on the testing room door. The child was then encouraged to pick out a small prize from a toy box to thank them for participating.  \n\nThe counterbalanced Order B followed the same procedure described above, but in the following order:\n\n1 (Puzzle -- Delay) \n3 (Tower -- Delay)\n4 (Lego -- Object-Helping)\n5 (Memory -- Delay)\n2 (Hurt Knee -- Social-Comforting)\n7 (Tic-Tac-Toe -- Delay)\n8 (Sticker -- Social-Helping)\n6 (Broken Toy -- Object-Comforting)\n9 (Free Play)\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": "N/A"}, "q10": {"extra": [], "value": "Registration following analysis of the data"}, "q11": {"extra": [], "value": "Data was originally collected and analyzed for an honour's thesis project (with Nina Buchenrieder as Principal Investigator) in the fall of 2015 and winter of 2016. Since then, we have become interested in the impact that shyness has on young children's prosocial behaviour and have decided to add shyness coding and analysis to this project.\n\nThe main research questions of the original thesis study were:\n\n1) Are children more likely to help than to comfort? Will children help more spontaneously than they comfort (i.e., respond with fewer cues)?\n\n2) Are children more likely to be prosocial and to act more spontaneously when the prosocial problem is object-focused rather than social-focused? \n\n3) Are children who show secure attachment to their mothers more likely to be prosocial than children with insecure attachment?\n\nThese questions have already been analyzed, in completion of the honour's thesis:\n\n1) We have calculated the frequency of children's helping/comforting behaviour in the four tasks, the type of response made, and the number of cues required for each child to act.\n\n2) We have compared the number of cues needed for a prosocial response across the four tasks (using repeated-measures ANOVA and Bonferroni corrected post-hoc analysis) \n\n3) We have computed security of attachment scores for each child in the sample and found a restricted range with a skewed distribution (i.e., most of the sample was securely attached to their mothers). Because of this restricted range, we will not be analyzing attachment security any further in the project.  \n\nIn planning the next analyses for this project (i.e., incorporating shyness), we have also taken the following steps:\n\n1) Two trained coders have rated each child's 'social engagement' on a three-point scale (very engaged/not shy = 2; moderately engaged/shy = 1; not engaged/very shy = 0) during two 'delay' games (i.e., puzzle and tic-tac-toe) as one possible measure of shyness. Because interrater agreement for this measure was moderate, though somewhat low (e.g., Cohen\u2019s Kappa = .64 for the puzzle game) and we felt that a continuous measure would provide more information about children's level of shyness than a 3-point categorization, we decided to drop this measure from the analyses. \n\n2) We have created a shyness subscale from the attachment Q-sort, by identifying items that describe shy behaviours, checking internal consistency of the scale, and removing two items that had only moderate correlation with the others. We have already analyzed how shyness as reported by parents relates to the measures of prosocial performance that were calculated for the original thesis (i.e., did they help/comfort; what type of response did they make; how many cues did they need to act). \n\n3) We have had research assistants transcribe the experimenter's and children's speech during the first delay game (puzzle) in order to code their speech behaviour as an additional measure of shyness.  We have not performed any major analyses using these data, but we have checked interrater agreement and found it to be moderately good (Cohen\u2019s Kappa = 0.705). Because this measure was added post-hoc and we had two individuals act as the experimenter for approximately half of the sample (23 and 19, respectively), we also checked whether they were equal in how much they spoke to each child, on average. Thus, we calculated the number of utterances made by the experimenter during the puzzle game for each child, divided that number by the time (in seconds) that they spent playing the game, and conducted an independent t-test comparing the speech behaviour of the two experimenters. Although the difference we found in the experimenters\u2019 speech was not statistically significant (t(40) = 1.784, p = .082), we feel that it is large enough to merit caution in interpreting this, post-hoc, measure. We will thus be considering children\u2019s speech behaviour as an exploratory measure of shyness, only.\n\n4) We have also had research assistants transcribe the experimenter's and children's speech during the two comforting tasks (Hurt Knee; Broken Toy). Two trained research assistants coded the type of verbal comforting children provided to the experimenter (i.e., object vs. social) during both comforting tasks. We have not performed any analyses using these data.\n"}, "q12": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Participating families were recruited at community events in a small city in Ontario, Canada.

Physical help would involve picking up any of the bricks and handing them to the experimenter, moving the bricks closer to her, or putting bricks in the bucket. \n\n- Sticker (Social-Helping)\n\nA child could be prosocial in the Sticker task by physically or verbally helping the experimenter. Physical help would involve taking the sticker off of the experimenter\u2019s back, while verbal help would involve telling the experimenter where the sticker was on her back so that she could find it and take it off herself.\n\n- Broken Toy (Object-Comforting)\n\nA child could be prosocial in the Broken Toy task by physically or verbally comforting the experimenter. Physical comfort would involve hugging the experimenter or attempting to fix the broken toy. Verbal comfort would involve saying something to try to soothe her distress (e.g., telling her \u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t cry\u201d), offering physical comfort (e.g., \u201cDo you want a hug?\u201d), or suggesting a solution to the broken toy (e.g., telling her how to fix/cover up the rip or suggesting she get a new toy). \n\n- Hurt Knee (Social-Comforting)\n\nA child could be prosocial in the Hurt Knee task by physically or verbally comforting the experimenter. Physical comfort would involve hugging the experimenter or kissing/rubbing her injured knee. Verbal comfort would involve saying something to try to soothe her distress (e.g., telling her \u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t cry\u201d), offering physical comfort (e.g., \u201cDo you want a hug?\u201d), or suggesting a way to heal her injury (e.g., suggesting they get a band-aid or ice). \n\n\nOther Responses:\n\nWe have categorized non-prosocial responses as either \u2018no response\u2019 or an \u2018empty verbal response'. \n\n- No Response\n\nA child was recorded as making \u2018no response\u2019 if they said nothing during the task and did not make any physical attempt to be prosocial.\n\n- Empty Verbal Response \n\nA child was recorded as making an \u2018empty verbal response\u2019 if they spoke during the task, but did not try to address the experimenter\u2019s prosocial problem (e.g., if the child ignored the situation: \u201cCan we play another game?\u201d). \n\n\nb) Verbal Comforting Orientation\n\nWe have had two trained coders assess children\u2019s verbal comforting in the Broken Toy and Hurt Knee tasks to determine whether each response was object-oriented or social-oriented. \n\nAlthough children could make multiple comforting statements, of either or both types, during a single period, we are most interested in whether shyness interferes with children\u2019s use of \u2018social-oriented\u2019 comforting strategies. Thus, we will be categorizing participants\u2019 verbal comforting as \u2018social-oriented\u2019 if they provide any verbal comforting response that is social in nature and \u2018object-oriented\u2019 if they provide only verbal comforting responses that involve an object. That is, if a child provides a single social-oriented verbal comforting response they will be categorized as \u2018social-oriented\u2019 even if they have provided multiple other comforting responses that were \u2018object-oriented\u2019, because the social response takes priority in our scoring. \n\n- Object-Oriented \n\nVerbal comforting is considered \u2018object-oriented\u2019 when it is focused on an object relevant to the situation. For example, the child may suggest ways that the experimenter could fix her broken toy dog (focused on the toy itself) or offer to get a band-aid for her hurt knee (focused on a band-aid). \n\n- Social-Oriented \n\nVerbal comforting is considered \u2018social-oriented\u2019 when it is focused on the experimenter\u2019s feelings. For example, the child may try to soothe her, in either comforting task, by saying \u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t cry\u201d or by offering physical comfort (e.g., \u201cDo you want a hug?\u201d).  \n\n\nc) Spontaneity of Prosocial Response\n\nWe have recorded how spontaneously children acted in each of the four prosocial tasks as the number of cues (1-3) needed for the child to make their first prosocial response (if they made one). \n\nIn all four prosocial tasks the first cue was a basic statement of the experimenter\u2019s problem, the second cue was a more specific statement of the problem, and the third cue asked the child directly whether they could intervene. Thus, when a child was \u2018most spontaneous\u2019 in being prosocial, this means that they required only a basic statement to intervene, while a child who was \u2018least spontaneous\u2019 required a more direct request. \n\nList of Cues:\n\nLego (OH)\n1. \u201cWhoops, I spilled the bricks!\u201d\n2. \u201cI can\u2019t reach them all!\u201d\n3. \u201cIs there something you can do?\u201d\n\nSticker (SH)\n1. \u201cWhoops, I think I have something on my back!\u201d\n2. \u201cI can\u2019t reach it!\u201d\n3. \u201cIs there something you can do?\u201d\n\nBroken Toy (OC)\n1. \u201cOh no!

We then checked the internal consistency of this subscale and the correlations between each item using the already completed responses from the mothers in our sample. \n\nTwo items were removed from the subscale for being only moderately related to the other items:\n\n1. Child becomes shy or loses interest when an activity looks like it might be difficult\n2. When given a choice child would rather play with toys than with adults\n\nThe final subscale has 12 items:\n\n1. When he is upset or injured, child will accept comforting from adults other than mother (R)\n2. Child is more interested in people than in things (R)\n3. Child laughs and smiles easily with a lot of different people (R)\n4. Child quickly gets used to people or things that initially made him shy or frightened him (R)\n5. Child is willing to talk to new people, show them toys, or show them what he can do, if mother asks him to (R)\n6. Child readily lets new adults hold or share things he has, if they ask to (R)\n7. Child runs to mother with a shy smile when new people visit the home\n8. Child\u2019s initial reaction when people visit the home is to ignore or avoid them, even if he eventually warms up to them\n9. Child largely ignores adults who visit the home. Finds his own activities more interesting\n10. Child easily grows fond of adults who visit his home and are friendly to him (R)\n11. When the family has visitors, child wants them to pay a lot of attention to him (R)\n12. Child enjoys being hugged or held by people other than his parents and/or grandparents (R) \n\nScores on the final 12 items will be summed (with the identified items (R) reverse-coded) to obtain a mother-reported shyness score for each child.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "N/A"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q19": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Original Hypotheses (already analyzed):\n\n1-2) Children in our sample would help more than comfort and would be more prosocial in object-focused tasks than in social-focused tasks\n\na) Did children act?

Karasewich, Sylvia Pinheiro, Nina Buchenrieder, Kristen Dunfield, Valerie A. Kuhlmeier", "q3": "Past research on prosocial behaviour (i.e., acting to benefit another person) has found that young children do not respond to all types of need with the same readiness. Helping (i.e., responding to an instrumental need, such as picking up a dropped object) often appears earlier in development than comforting (i.e., responding to emotional distress, such as by soothing someone who is injured; Dunfield &amp; Kuhlmeier, 2013; Svetlova, Nichols, &amp; Brownell, 2010). \n\nChildren's prosociality is also influenced by personal factors. Shyness is sometimes found to be a barrier to young children's prosocial behaviour, though its impact varies greatly by the context in which that behaviour is measured (e.g., Karasewich, Kuhlmeier, Beier, &amp; Dunfield, 2019; Schuhmacher, Collard, &amp; K\u00e4rtner, 2017).  \n\nThe purpose of the present study is to examine different factors that would make comforting a more difficult task than helping for young children, in particular those who are shy.  To do this, we have compared preschool children's performance on four prosocial tasks that varied, in a 2 x 2 design, by type (i.e., helping vs. comforting) and the focus of the prosocial problem (i.e., object vs. social). Changing the focus of the prosocial problem allowed us to vary the level of social engagement required to be prosocial: object-focused tasks allowed children to respond in a less engaged way, by presenting them with an object upon which they could act, while social-focused tasks encouraged children to engage with the person in need more directly. \n", "q4": "Original Hypotheses:\n\n1) We expected more children to provide help, overall, than comfort and to be more spontaneous when helping than comforting (i.e., to need fewer cues to act from the experimenter). \n\n2) We also expected, however, for children be more prosocial and more spontaneously prosocial in object-focused tasks than social-focused tasks. Thus, we expected to find an interaction in performance between the type of prosocial task (helping; comforting) and focus of the prosocial problem (object; social).\n\n3) We expected children who are securely attached to their mothers to be more prosocial, overall, than children who are insecurely attached.  \n\nNew Hypotheses:\n\nBecause we have already run analyses on the original hypotheses (see explanation in Existing Data) and we found little variance in performance on the helping tasks, the next, unanalyzed, hypotheses are based only on comforting behaviour.\n\n4) We expect children\u2019s prosocial behaviour in the social-focused comforting task (i.e., Hurt Knee) to correlate negatively with their level of shyness (i.e., highly shy children will be less likely to be prosocial in social-focused tasks). In contrast, we do not expect children\u2019s level of shyness and prosocial behaviour in the object-focused comforting task (i.e., Broken Toy) to be related. \n\n5) When children provide comfort and do so in a verbal manner, we expect shyer children to be \u2018object-oriented\u2019 (e.g., suggesting ways the experimenter could fix her broken toy) rather than 'social-oriented' (e.g., telling the experimenter not to cry when she realizes her toy is broken), even when the focus of the prosocial problem is social (i.e., in both the Broken Toy and Hurt Knee tasks). \n", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Since then, we have become interested in the impact that shyness has on young children's prosocial behaviour and have decided to add shyness coding and analysis to this project.\n\nThe main research questions of the original thesis study were:\n\n1) Are children more likely to help than to comfort? Will children help more spontaneously than they comfort (i.e., respond with fewer cues)?\n\n2) Are children more likely to be prosocial and to act more spontaneously when the prosocial problem is object-focused rather than social-focused? \n\n3) Are children who show secure attachment to their mothers more likely to be prosocial than children with insecure attachment?\n\nThese questions have already been analyzed, in completion of the honour's thesis:\n\n1) We have calculated the frequency of children's helping/comforting behaviour in the four tasks, the type of response made, and the number of cues required for each child to act.\n\n2) We have compared the number of cues needed for a prosocial response across the four tasks (using repeated-measures ANOVA and Bonferroni corrected post-hoc analysis) \n\n3) We have computed security of attachment scores for each child in the sample and found a restricted range with a skewed distribution (i.e., most of the sample was securely attached to their mothers). Because of this restricted range, we will not be analyzing attachment security any further in the project.  \n\nIn planning the next analyses for this project (i.e., incorporating shyness), we have also taken the following steps:\n\n1) Two trained coders have rated each child's 'social engagement' on a three-point scale (very engaged/not shy = 2; moderately engaged/shy = 1; not engaged/very shy = 0) during two 'delay' games (i.e., puzzle and tic-tac-toe) as one possible measure of shyness. Because interrater agreement for this measure was moderate, though somewhat low (e.g., Cohen\u2019s Kappa = .64 for the puzzle game) and we felt that a continuous measure would provide more information about children's level of shyness than a 3-point categorization, we decided to drop this measure from the analyses. \n\n2) We have created a shyness subscale from the attachment Q-sort, by identifying items that describe shy behaviours, checking internal consistency of the scale, and removing two items that had only moderate correlation with the others. We have already analyzed how shyness as reported by parents relates to the measures of prosocial performance that were calculated for the original thesis (i.e., did they help/comfort; what type of response did they make; how many cues did they need to act). \n\n3) We have had research assistants transcribe the experimenter's and children's speech during the first delay game (puzzle) in order to code their speech behaviour as an additional measure of shyness.  We have not performed any major analyses using these data, but we have checked interrater agreement and found it to be moderately good (Cohen\u2019s Kappa = 0.705). Because this measure was added post-hoc and we had two individuals act as the experimenter for approximately half of the sample (23 and 19, respectively), we also checked whether they were equal in how much they spoke to each child, on average. Thus, we calculated the number of utterances made by the experimenter during the puzzle game for each child, divided that number by the time (in seconds) that they spent playing the game, and conducted an independent t-test comparing the speech behaviour of the two experimenters. Although the difference we found in the experimenters\u2019 speech was not statistically significant (t(40) = 1.784, p = .082), we feel that it is large enough to merit caution in interpreting this, post-hoc, measure. We will thus be considering children\u2019s speech behaviour as an exploratory measure of shyness, only.\n\n4) We have also had research assistants transcribe the experimenter's and children's speech during the two comforting tasks (Hurt Knee; Broken Toy).

The four tasks are described in detail below, in the Procedure Outline.\n\nIn each prosocial task the child was given up to three cues to respond prosocially, spaced approximately 5 seconds apart for a total of 15 seconds. Cues were given until the child had performed the highest level of a prosocial act for that task (i.e., approaching the experimenter to provide physical comfort in the comforting tasks; physically picking up the target objects in the helping tasks). The order of the prosocial tasks was counterbalanced, such that half of the children received a helping task first (i.e., the Lego task) and half received a comforting task first (i.e., the Hurt Knee task).\n\nProcedure Outline (Order A):\n\n1) Delay Game: Puzzle\n\nAt the start of the study, the experimenter and child played the first delay game together - completing a puzzle (of the characters from the TV show \"Paw Patrol\").\n\n2) Prosocial Task: Hurt Knee (Social-Comforting)\n\nThe child was then given the first prosocial task, the Hurt Knee task, in which the experimenter went into an adjoining room to get more toys and then banged her knee on the doorframe while coming back. She said \"Ouch,\" and rubbed her knee while sitting down and then told the child, \"Oh, my knee! I banged my knee!\" This served as the first of three cues for the child to act. After 5 seconds, a second cue could be given: \"Ouch, that really hurts!\" The final cue, after 5 more seconds, was, \"Is there something you can do?\" If the child did not comfort after 15 seconds total, the experimenter solved her own problem: \"Oh, I am all better now! I just had to rub it.\"\n\n3) Delay Game: Tower\n\nNext, the experimenter and child built a tall tower out of Lego Duplo bricks. When the tower was complete, the experimenter put the bricks into a bucket to put them away.\n\n4) Prosocial Task: Lego (Object-Helping)\n\nWhile walking to the door of the adjacent room to put the Lego bricks away, the experimenter 'accidentally' spilled them onto the floor. She said, \"Whoops, I spilled the bricks!\" as the first cue for the child to act. After 5 seconds, if the child had not yet responded, the experimenter bent down and picked up two of the bricks then put her arm out to reach for bricks further away, saying \"I can't reach them all!\" The final cue, after 5 more seconds, was, \"Is there something you can do?\" If the child did not help after 15 seconds, the experimenter picked up all of the bricks herself, saying \"It's okay, I got them.\" If the child did start to help within those 15 seconds, the experimenter said \"Thank you. I should put this [the puzzle] away too!\" and left the child to finish picking up the bricks. \n\n5) Delay Game: Memory\n\nThe experimenter then brought out the game Memory to play with the child and explained the rules (\"For every card here there is another one that looks the exact same. Every time it's your turn, you can turn around two cards and if they are the same you can keep them!\"). The cards that they played with had cartoon animals on their faces, with 10 pairs in total. \n\n6) Prosocial Task: Broken Toy (Object-Comforting)\n\nAt the start of the next prosocial task, the experimenter brought out a toy dog to show the child, which she described as her favourite toy. She played with the toy a bit while telling the child why she liked it (e.g., \"I like his floppy ears!\"), then stopped when she 'noticed' a rip in the dog's paw. She gasped and said, \"Oh no! My dog! I ripped my doggy!\" as the first cue for the child to act. She immediately put the toy down on the table (within reach of the child) and covered her face with her hands. She did not touch or interact with the toy again until the task ended. After 5 seconds, she could give the second cue, \u201cOh no, I'm really sad!\" and the final cue, \"Is there something you can do?\" was given 5 seconds after that. If 15 seconds passed without the child making a prosocial response, or if the child did respond prosocially in a way that would not immediately solve the experimenter's problem (e.g., suggesting that they ask the child's mother to sew the rip), the experimenter 'realized', \"Oh, we can just push the stuffing back inside! See, it's all better now!\"\n\n7) Delay Game: Tic-Tac-Toe\n\nThe experimenter then brought out a magnetic tic-tac-toe game to play with the child and explained the rules (\"It goes like this: each player tries to put his 3 symbols in a row, either from top to bottom, side to side, or across\"). They played 2-3 rounds of tic-tac-toe. \n \n8) Prosocial Task: Sticker (Social-Helping)\n\nAt the start of the final prosocial task, the experimenter went to get a jacket from the adjacent room because, \"[she was] a little chilly.\" She put the jacket, which had a square post-it note sticker stuck to the back (in between the shoulder blades), on in the adjacent room before coming back to the testing room. The experimenter then went to reach for a pen behind the table when she 'realized', \"Whoops, I think I have something on my back!\" This line, and the experimenter trying to reach for the sticker, served as the first cue for the child to act. If the child had not taken the sticker off within 5 seconds, the experimenter said \"I can't reach it!\" After 5 more seconds, she could give the final cue, \"Is there something you can do?\" If the child did not respond within 15 seconds, the experimenter said, \"It's okay, I got it!\", pulled the jacket to bring the sticker within reach, and took it off.  \n\n9) Free Play\n\nThe experimenter and the child then played with toys in the adjacent room until the research assistant indicated that the child's mother had completed the Q-Sort, by knocking on the testing room door. The child was then encouraged to pick out a small prize from a toy box to thank them for participating.  \n\nThe counterbalanced Order B followed the same procedure described above, but in the following order:\n\n1 (Puzzle -- Delay) \n3 (Tower -- Delay)\n4 (Lego -- Object-Helping)\n5 (Memory -- Delay)\n2 (Hurt Knee -- Social-Comforting)\n7 (Tic-Tac-Toe -- Delay)\n8 (Sticker -- Social-Helping)\n6 (Broken Toy -- Object-Comforting)\n9 (Free Play)\n", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Participating families were recruited at community events in a small city in Ontario, Canada. Children were given a small toy to thank them for participating. Children were considered eligible for the study if they were between the ages of 3.5 to 4.5 years old at the test date. Mothers completed the Attachment Q-Sort for their children. Data was collected in the fall of 2015 and winter of 2016.", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "N/A", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "1) Performance on the prosocial tasks\n\na) Type of Response\n\nWe have recorded whether children acted prosocially in each of the four tasks and what type of response they made.\n\n\nProsocial Responses:\n\n- Lego (Object-Helping)\n\nA child could be prosocial in the Lego task by physically helping the experimenter. Physical help would involve picking up any of the bricks and handing them to the experimenter, moving the bricks closer to her, or putting bricks in the bucket. \n\n- Sticker (Social-Helping)\n\nA child could be prosocial in the Sticker task by physically or verbally helping the experimenter. Physical help would involve taking the sticker off of the experimenter\u2019s back, while verbal help would involve telling the experimenter where the sticker was on her back so that she could find it and take it off herself.\n\n- Broken Toy (Object-Comforting)\n\nA child could be prosocial in the Broken Toy task by physically or verbally comforting the experimenter. Physical comfort would involve hugging the experimenter or attempting to fix the broken toy. Verbal comfort would involve saying something to try to soothe her distress (e.g., telling her \u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t cry\u201d), offering physical comfort (e.g., \u201cDo you want a hug?\u201d), or suggesting a solution to the broken toy (e.g., telling her how to fix/cover up the rip or suggesting she get a new toy). \n\n- Hurt Knee (Social-Comforting)\n\nA child could be prosocial in the Hurt Knee task by physically or verbally comforting the experimenter. Physical comfort would involve hugging the experimenter or kissing/rubbing her injured knee. Verbal comfort would involve saying something to try to soothe her distress (e.g., telling her \u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t cry\u201d), offering physical comfort (e.g., \u201cDo you want a hug?\u201d), or suggesting a way to heal her injury (e.g., suggesting they get a band-aid or ice). \n\n\nOther Responses:\n\nWe have categorized non-prosocial responses as either \u2018no response\u2019 or an \u2018empty verbal response'. \n\n- No Response\n\nA child was recorded as making \u2018no response\u2019 if they said nothing during the task and did not make any physical attempt to be prosocial.\n\n- Empty Verbal Response \n\nA child was recorded as making an \u2018empty verbal response\u2019 if they spoke during the task, but did not try to address the experimenter\u2019s prosocial problem (e.g., if the child ignored the situation: \u201cCan we play another game?\u201d). \n\n\nb) Verbal Comforting Orientation\n\nWe have had two trained coders assess children\u2019s verbal comforting in the Broken Toy and Hurt Knee tasks to determine whether each response was object-oriented or social-oriented. \n\nAlthough children could make multiple comforting statements, of either or both types, during a single period, we are most interested in whether shyness interferes with children\u2019s use of \u2018social-oriented\u2019 comforting strategies. Thus, we will be categorizing participants\u2019 verbal comforting as \u2018social-oriented\u2019 if they provide any verbal comforting response that is social in nature and \u2018object-oriented\u2019 if they provide only verbal comforting responses that involve an object. That is, if a child provides a single social-oriented verbal comforting response they will be categorized as \u2018social-oriented\u2019 even if they have provided multiple other comforting responses that were \u2018object-oriented\u2019, because the social response takes priority in our scoring. \n\n- Object-Oriented \n\nVerbal comforting is considered \u2018object-oriented\u2019 when it is focused on an object relevant to the situation. For example, the child may suggest ways that the experimenter could fix her broken toy dog (focused on the toy itself) or offer to get a band-aid for her hurt knee (focused on a band-aid). \n\n- Social-Oriented \n\nVerbal comforting is considered \u2018social-oriented\u2019 when it is focused on the experimenter\u2019s feelings. For example, the child may try to soothe her, in either comforting task, by saying \u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t cry\u201d or by offering physical comfort (e.g., \u201cDo you want a hug?\u201d).  \n\n\nc) Spontaneity of Prosocial Response\n\nWe have recorded how spontaneously children acted in each of the four prosocial tasks as the number of cues (1-3) needed for the child to make their first prosocial response (if they made one). \n\nIn all four prosocial tasks the first cue was a basic statement of the experimenter\u2019s problem, the second cue was a more specific statement of the problem, and the third cue asked the child directly whether they could intervene. Thus, when a child was \u2018most spontaneous\u2019 in being prosocial, this means that they required only a basic statement to intervene, while a child who was \u2018least spontaneous\u2019 required a more direct request. \n\nList of Cues:\n\nLego (OH)\n1. \u201cWhoops, I spilled the bricks!\u201d\n2. \u201cI can\u2019t reach them all!\u201d\n3. \u201cIs there something you can do?\u201d\n\nSticker (SH)\n1. \u201cWhoops, I think I have something on my back!\u201d\n2. \u201cI can\u2019t reach it!\u201d\n3. \u201cIs there something you can do?\u201d\n\nBroken Toy (OC)\n1. \u201cOh no! My dog! I ripped my doggy!\u201d\n2. \u201cOh no, I\u2019m really sad!\u201d\n3. \u201cIs there something you can do?\u201d\n\nHurt Knee (SC)\n1. \u201cOh, my knee! I banged my knee!\u201d\n2. \u201cOuch, that really hurts!\u201d\n3. \u201cIs there something you can do?\u201d\n\n\n2) Shyness\n\nWe have created a shyness subscale from the Attachment Q-Sort (computerized version 2.1.2, which uses the same items as the paper version 3), which was completed by the children\u2019s mothers, by following the procedure described by Waters at this webpage: http://www.psychology.sunysb.edu/attachment/measures/content/aqs_method.html\n\nWe began by identifying items that we felt described shy behaviours \u2013 14 in total from the original 90 items. We then checked the internal consistency of this subscale and the correlations between each item using the already completed responses from the mothers in our sample. \n\nTwo items were removed from the subscale for being only moderately related to the other items:\n\n1. Child becomes shy or loses interest when an activity looks like it might be difficult\n2. When given a choice child would rather play with toys than with adults\n\nThe final subscale has 12 items:\n\n1. When he is upset or injured, child will accept comforting from adults other than mother (R)\n2. Child is more interested in people than in things (R)\n3. Child laughs and smiles easily with a lot of different people (R)\n4. Child quickly gets used to people or things that initially made him shy or frightened him (R)\n5. Child is willing to talk to new people, show them toys, or show them what he can do, if mother asks him to (R)\n6. Child readily lets new adults hold or share things he has, if they ask to (R)\n7. Child runs to mother with a shy smile when new people visit the home\n8. Child\u2019s initial reaction when people visit the home is to ignore or avoid them, even if he eventually warms up to them\n9. Child largely ignores adults who visit the home. Finds his own activities more interesting\n10. Child easily grows fond of adults who visit his home and are friendly to him (R)\n11. When the family has visitors, child wants them to pay a lot of attention to him (R)\n12. Child enjoys being hugged or held by people other than his parents and/or grandparents (R) \n\nScores on the final 12 items will be summed (with the identified items (R) reverse-coded) to obtain a mother-reported shyness score for each child.\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "N/A", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Original Hypotheses (already analyzed):\n\n1-2) Children in our sample would help more than comfort and would be more prosocial in object-focused tasks than in social-focused tasks\n\na) Did children act? (Frequency) \n\n- Lego (OH): 42/42 helped \n\n- Sticker (SH): 40/42 helped\n\n- Broken Toy (OC): 31/42 comforted \n\n- Hurt Knee (SC): 18/42 comforted \n\n\nb) What types of responses did they make? (Frequency) \n\n- Lego (OH): 42 helped physically \n\n- Sticker (SH): 39 helped physically, 1 helped verbally, and 2 gave an empty verbal response\n\n- Broken Toy (OC): Of the 31 children who comforted, 6 only comforted physically by trying to fix the toy, 22 only comforted verbally, and 3 did both. Of the children who did not comfort, 8 gave an empty verbal response and 3 made no response. \n\n- Hurt Knee (SC): 6 comforted physically by approaching the experimenter (e.g., kissing her knee), 12 comforted verbally, 12 gave an empty verbal response, and 12 made no response.\n\n\nc) How spontaneously was their prosocial behaviour? (Frequency and ANOVA)\n\n- Lego (OH): 26 helped after the 1st cue, 15 helped after the 2nd, and 1 helped after the 3rd\n\n- Sticker (SH): 21 helped after the 1st cue, 14 helped after the 2nd, 5 helped after the 3rd, and 2 did not help\n\n- Broken Toy (OC): 18 comforted after the 1st cue, 7 comforted after the 2nd, 6 comforted after the 3rd, and 11 did not comfort\n\n- Hurt Knee (SC): 7 comforted after the 1st cue, 2 comforted after the 2nd, 9 comforted after the 3rd, and 24 did not comfort\n\nTo compare the spontaneity of prosocial behaviour across the four tasks, we\u2019ve conducted a one-way repeated measures ANOVA including only those children who were prosocial in all four tasks (n = 17). A significant difference in spontaneity was found: F(2.291, 36.658) = 6.570, p = .003 (Greenhouse-Geisser method). Pairwise comparisons using the Bonferroni correction found significant differences in spontaneity between the Sticker (SH) and Hurt Knee (SC) tasks (p = .018) and between the Lego (OH) and Hurt Knee (SC) tasks (p = .010). \n\n\n3) Securely attached children would be more prosocial\n\nAttachment scores in our sample ranged from .20 to .66, with a mean of .47 and standard deviation of .11. This is a very restricted range of scores, given that scores on the Q-Sort can range from -1 (most insecurely attached) to +1 (most securely attached). Thus, our sample primarily consisted of securely attached children and we do not feel that we can make meaningful inferences about the role that attachment plays in young children\u2019s prosociality from our data. \n\n\nNew Hypotheses (partially analyzed):\n\n4) Children\u2019s level of shyness will relate negatively to their comforting in the Hurt Knee (social-focused) task, but will not relate to their comforting in the Broken Toy (object-focused) task\n\na) Does shyness predict which children comforted in each task? (Logistic regressions)\n\nWe have run two analyses examining whether children\u2019s scores on the Q-Sort shyness subscale (IV) predicted whether or not they comforted (DV) in the Broken Toy (OC) and Hurt Knee (SC) tasks, respectively. Neither analysis was significant. \n\nb) Does shyness predict whether children approached the experimenter when comforting? (Logistic Regression)\n\nWe have run one analysis examining whether children\u2019s scores on the Q-Sort shyness subscale (IV) predict whether or not they approached the experimenter when comforting (DV) in the Hurt Knee (SC) task. (No child approached the experimenter in the Broken Toy task). This analysis was not significant.\n\nc) Does shyness relate to how spontaneously children comforted? (Correlations)\n\nWe have run two analyses to examine whether children\u2019s scores on the Q-Sort shyness subscale related to the number of cues required for them to respond in the Broken Toy (OC) and Hurt Knee (SC) tasks, respectively. We found no relation in the Hurt Knee task (r = -.218, p = .385) and only a marginal negative relation in the Broken Toy task (r = -.341, p = .060), suggesting that shyer children tended to require more cues to comfort the experimenter after she broke her toy.\n\n5) Shyer children will be less likely to be 'social-oriented\u2019 (as opposed to \u2018object-oriented\u2019) when providing verbal comfort (in either task)\n\na) Does shyness predict whether children were social-oriented when providing verbal comfort? (Logistic Regressions)\n\nWe will conduct two analyses to examine whether children\u2019s scores on the Q-Sort shyness subscale (IV) predict whether or not they provided social-oriented verbal comforting (DV) in the Broken Toy (OC) and Hurt Knee (SC) tasks, respectively.\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href":

While most social science research has focused on the consequences of individual and interpersonal forms of stigma for the stigmatized, over the past decade a new line of research has emerged illustrating that structural forms of stigma, defined as \u201csocietal-level conditions, cultural norms, and institutional policies and practices that constrain the opportunities, resources, and wellbeing of the stigmatized\u201d (Hatzenbuehler &amp; Link, 2014, p. 2), also adversely shape the lives of the stigmatized. The deleterious consequences of structural stigma have been established across a range of: (a) health outcomes, including psychiatric morbidity, suicide attempts, health behaviors, and all-cause mortality; (b) measures of structural stigma, such as state-level policies and aggregated community norms; (c) stigmatized groups, including sexual minorities, African Americans, and immigrants; and (d) methodological approaches, including observational, quasi-experimental, and laboratory designs (see Hatzenbuehler, 2016; 2017 for reviews). \n\nWhile this literature has established that structural stigma is a risk indicator for poor health, the mechanisms underlying this association have received less empirical attention. One set of mechanisms that researchers have begun to evaluate involve stress pathways\u2014encompassing perceptions of stress and the regulation of neurobiological systems that govern stress responses. Preliminary evidence for a stress-related pathway comes from both indirect and direct tests. In terms of indirect tests, in one quasi-experimental study researchers obtained data from medical billing records in a community-based health clinic in Massachusetts to examine associations between the passage of the state\u2019s same-sex marriage law and health care use and costs among sexual minority men. Substantial reductions in several stress-related disorders\u2014including a 14% reduction in depression and an 18% reduction in hypertension\u2014were observed in the 12 months after the legalization of same-sex marriage compared to the 12 months before, providing suggestive evidence for a stress pathway (Hatzenbuehler, O'Cleirigh, et al., 2012). In another quasi-experimental study, Lauderdale (2006) used birth certificate data to compare birth rates in the 6 months after September 11th, 2001 with the same 6 calendar months one year before September 11th. The relative risk of poor birth outcomes, including low birth weight, was statistically significantly elevated in the 6 months after September 11th for Arabic-named women but not for White, Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or Native American women. Given the large literature linking stress to pre-term birth (for a discussion, see Lauderdale, 2006), this study provides additional indirect evidence for a stress pathway linking structural stigma to health.   \n\nIn terms of direct tests, research has suggested that structural stigma may be associated with physiological stress responses. For instance, in a lab-based study, researchers recruited 74 LGB young adults who were raised in 24 states as adolescents. These states differed substantially in terms of the level of structural stigma, which was coded based on a composite measure that included state policies and social attitudes. All respondents, who were currently living in New York (a low structural stigma state), completed a well-validated laboratory stressor, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Neuroendocrine measures were collected before, during, and after the TSST. LGB young adults who grew up in high structural stigma states (compared to low structural stigma states) evidenced a blunted cortisol response following the TSST (Hatzenbuehler &amp; McLaughlin, 2014). This same pattern of hypocortisolism has been documented in other samples exposed to chronic life stressors, such as among youth experiencing childhood maltreatment (Gunnar, Frenn, Wewerka, &amp; Van Ryzin, 2009). \n\nThese results provide preliminary evidence for a stress-related pathway linking structural stigma and health.  Here, we extend this work to examine whether structural stigma leads to changes in the structure and function of brain regions that are influenced by experiences of stress and play a central role in regulation stress responses; specifically, the amygdala and hippocampus. The current study addresses this question by using recently-released data from the ABCD study. Specifically, drawing on prior literature, we will develop state-level indicators of structural stigma/discrimination related to sexual orientation (Hatzenbuehler, 2016), race (Lukachko, Hatzenbuehler, &amp; Keyes, 2013), gender (Homan, 2019), and Hispanic ethnicity (Hatzenbuehler, Prins, Flake, Philbin, Frazer, Hagen, &amp; Hirsch, 2017). We will then link these indicators to the ABCD dataset via the FIPS code of the state where the ABCD study site is located to determine their association with two neural measures that are associated with exposure to psychosocial stressors: hippocampal volume (Hanson et al., 2015; McLaughlin et al., 2016; McLaughlin, Weissman, &amp; Bitr\u00e1n, 2019; Saxbe et al., 2018) and amygdala reactivity to threat (Hein &amp; Monk, 2017; McCrory et al., 2011; McLaughlin, Peverill, Gold, Alves, &amp; Sheridan, 2015). In addition, we will examine associations between individual forms of stigma (i.e., perceived discrimination) and these same two neural outcomes. This will be the first study, to our knowledge, to use a multi-level approach to the study of stigma and neurobiological development. Collectively, this research has the potential not only to advance our understanding of mechanisms linking structural stigma to adverse outcomes, but also to build an evidence base for an emerging subfield of environmental neuroscience (Berman, Stier, &amp; Akcelik, 2019). \n\nStudy Hypotheses    \n\nOur study hypotheses described below are informed by developmental research on identity awareness, formation, and responsivity to identity-based stressors. This research indicates that our four groups develop their identities at different ages, and thus are likely to be aware of, and respond to, structural forms of stigma at different points across development. Below, we briefly review evidence for these developmental differences across the four groups included in our study. \n\nSexual orientation. A population-based survey of 1,154 LGBT adults were asked the following three questions about developmental milestones for sexual minority identities (Pew Research Center, 2013): 1) How old were you when you first thought you were something other than straight or heterosexual? 2) How old were you when you knew for sure you were LGBT? 3) How old were you when you first told a close friend or family member that you were LGBT? The median age at which respondents first thought they were something other than straight or heterosexual was 12; it was 17 when they first knew for sure that they were LGBT and 20 when they first told a close friend or family member that they were LGBT. \n\nSex/Gender. The literature on gender identity development shows that gender learning occurs early and is a gradual process throughout childhood and adolescence (Steensma et al., 2013). While children develop an awareness of their gender by age three (Collier et al., 2013; La Freniere et al., 1984), gender constancy\u2014the understanding that gender is a fixed personal attribute with distinct expectations for boys and girls\u2014develops later, around age six to seven (Grusec, 2011). By this age (age 6-7), girls have already internalized the societal attitude that girls/women are inferior in intelligence and capability (Brown &amp; Stone, 2016). For example, in their review of 4 studies (N = 400 children), Bian and colleagues (2017) found that by age 6 and 7, girls are less likely than boys to believe that members of their gender are \u201creally, really smart.\u201d By the end of childhood (age 11-12), girls report being less content with their gender than boys (Egan &amp; Perry, 2001; Steensma et al., 2013). By the time young women finish high school, they report experiencing both subtle and overt discrimination, which can lead to lower confidence and motivation (Brown &amp; Stone, 2016). \n\nLatinx ethnicity. Latinx ethnic identity development emerges during early childhood (Bernal, Knight, Garza, Ocampo, &amp; Cota, 1990; Serrano-Villar &amp; Calzada, 2016) and continues through adolescence (Uma\u00f1a\u2010Taylor, Gonzales\u2010Backen, &amp; Guimond, 2009).  Serrano-Villar and Clazada (2016) explored ethnic identity formation during early childhood among a sample of Mexican American and Dominican American children enrolled in Pre-K or Kindergarten (N=674 families; Mage = 58 months, SD=6.92) living in the United States.  Participants answered questions related to ethnic self-identification (i.e., \u201cAre you a Mexican/Dominican boy/girl or Chinese boy/girl?\u201d), constancy of identity (i.e., \u201cWhen you grow up, will you be a Mexican/Dominican man/woman or a Chinese man/woman?\u201d), and ethnic knowledge (i.e., \u201cWhat does it mean to be Mexican/Dominican?\u201d). Results showed that 75% of children self-identified as Mexican or Dominican, 56.8% demonstrated an understanding of constancy in identity, and 21.8% demonstrated knowledge about their ethnic identity.  In a comparatively older sample of Mexican-American children, 6 to 10 years old, Bernal and colleagues (1990) found that 85.7% of children 6 to 8 years of age, and 95.8% of children 8 to 10 years of age, correctly identified his or her ethnicity.  Further, a majority of the 8-to-10-year-old children were able to provide clear and accurate reasons as to why they identified as Mexican and, compared to the 6-to-8-year-old children, demonstrated a greater and nearly complete understanding of identity permanence.  According to Bernal and colleagues (1990), \u201c\u2026it appears that the ability to label the ethnic group to which they belong reaches asymptote sometime before 7 or 8 years of age\u201d (p.20). Given that ethnic identity development emerges during childhood, it is perhaps expected that during this same time period Latino youth will begin to perceive/experience ethnic-based discrimination.  Among a Mexican-origin Latino sample of 1,374 5th grade students (9 to 13 years of age; 96% 10 to 11 years of age) living in Phoenix, Arizona, 59% perceived some ethnic discrimination (Kulis, Marsigilia, &amp; Nieri, 2009). The Health and Growth of Puerto Rican Children Study found lower rates of perceived discrimination among a sample of Puerto Rican children living in the greater Boston area in grades 1 to 3 (Mage= 8.37).  Among this sample, 13% reported being treated badly because of being Puerto Rican (Szalacha, Erkut, Coll, Alarcon, Fields, &amp; Ceder, 2003).  However, in a second study, the Puerto Rican Adolescent Study, the same authors found that among 248 Puerto Rican adolescents ages 13-14 years of age, 49% reported experiencing ethnic discrimination in at least one of nine possible situations (e.g., \u201cwhen you were with classmates\u201d; Szalacha, Erkut, Coll, Alarcon, Fields, &amp; Ceder, 2003).  Collectively, these studies suggest that among Latino youth, perceptions of discrimination begin during early childhood (e.g., 7-9 years of age) and increase with age.\n\nRace. Much like ethnicity, the development of racial identity emerges during early childhood and continues through adolescence. Children are able to correctly identify their racial identity between ages 3-6; however, children also demonstrate \u201can awareness of the value attached to whiteness\u201d during this time (Fishbein 2002). For instance, studies consistently find that some racial minority preschoolers and elementary students misidentify themselves as white up until around age seven (Boocock and Scott 2005; DeCuir-Gunby 2009). By age 7-8, children can comprehend both social and physical dimensions of race and recognize some flexibility in racial categorization (e.g., multiracial status) (Alejandro-Wright, 1985). By age 10-12, children understand racial constancy and demonstrate a more \u201cadult-like\u201d understanding of the social construction of race (Alejandro-Wright 1985; Byrd 2012; DeCuir-Gunby 2009). In a review of 70 studies on racial/ethnic identity, Phinney (1990) points out that although children understand race as a concept, an \u201cachieved\u201d racial identity is not complete until late adolescence or early adulthood when individuals move from an unexamined ethnic/racial identity through a period of exploration to an achieved or committed identity. \n\tImportantly, during childhood and adolescence individuals begin moving beyond their immediate family environments, encountering societal institutions that are often covertly and overtly racist (Sellers et al 2006). In their study of 277 urban children and adolescents (age 8-16), Pachter and colleagues (2010) found that 88% of participants reported one or more experiences with racial discrimination. Rates of discriminatory treatment are particularly high among African American children and adolescents. In a 5-year study of 714 Black children (ages 10-12), for instance, 92% reported experiencing racial discrimination in the past year (Brody et. al 2006). A growing body of research also shows that membership in a racial minority group is a central reason for bullying and other forms of peer victimization in school settings (Seaton et al 2013). Overall, these findings suggest that similar to ethnicity, self-reported experiences of racial discrimination begin in childhood and increase with age.\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypothesis #1 (baseline). We predict that greater exposure to structural forms of stigma of one\u2019s identity (measured at the state level) will be associated with smaller hippocampal volume and elevated amygdala reactivity to threat cues among members of each of our stigmatized groups defined by sex, sexual orientation, race, and ethnicity, controlling for demographic characteristics and family SES. \n\nWe further hypothesize that some of these associations will be present at baseline, whereas others will not be present until follow-up waves, given the developmental literature on identity development reviewed above. Specifically, we hypothesize that structural stigma will be associated with smaller hippocampal volume and greater amygdala reactivity to threat at baseline among girls, Latino youth, and African American youth. We do not expect an association among the sexual minority youth until later in adolescence when this identity when more youth begin to identify as lesbian, gay, and bisexual (even if they have not disclosed this identity to others).  \n\nAdditionally, we hypothesize that structural forms of stigma will be correlated with individual forms of stigma (i.e., perceived discrimination); that is, respondents will perceive more discrimination based on their sex, race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation in states with relatively high (vs low) levels of structural stigma. In turn, perceived discrimination will be associated with smaller hippocampal volume and elevated amygdala reactivity to threat cues among members of each of our stigmatized groups defined by sex, sexual orientation, race, and ethnicity, controlling for demographic characteristics and family SES. \n\nHypothesis #2 (longitudinal). We expect that structural stigma regarding sexual orientation will be associated with smaller hippocampal volume and heightened amygdala reactivity to threat cues among sexual minorities at future time points in ABCD data collection (around age 12-13 years). In addition, identities continue to form during adolescence and structural stigma experiences accumulate during this developmental period. Consequently, we expect the association between structural stigma, smaller hippocampal volume, and greater amygdala reactivity to threat to become stronger over time for all four groups (i.e., the effect size will increase in the longitudinal assessments).   \n\nHypothesis #3. Structural forms of stigma will not be related to hippocampal volume or amygdala reactivity to threat, either at baseline or longitudinally, among the non-stigmatized comparison groups: boys, heterosexuals, and non-Hispanic Whites.

These are sexual minorities, girls, Latinx, and Black participants. Each of these exposures was compiled from previously-validated sources and then modeled as indicators in a factor analysis, with the final factor score determining the structural stigma score for each state for each domain of stigma. Variable selection and model specification are described here. With the exception of anti-immigrant sentiment (which had a limited inventory of possible indicators), we restricted all indicators to those that had measures for all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The rationale for including all 50 states was to contextualize the factor scores relative to national climate; after models were run using all 50 states, only the states containing ABCD sites will be selected from the larger exposure dataset. See Table 1 for description of final variables. \nStructural Stigma Related to Sex/Gender\nVariable selection from General Social Survey \nWe selected from eight questions in the General Social Survey (GSS) that had been previously validated as measures of state-level sexism and had been shown to be relatively stable over time (Charles, Guryan, &amp; Pan, 2009; Homan, 2019). These asked about attitudes towards women\u2019s and women\u2019s stereotypical gender roles. Of these, four had been routinely assessed in recent years and were considered for inclusion in the final model.\n\nVariable selection from ANES\nWe selected from four items in the American National Elections Studies (ANES) Time-Series Survey that assessed attitudes towards stereotypical gender roles and efforts to address women\u2019s rights, gender equality, and gender discrimination.  \n\nVariable selection from Project Implicit\nWe selected from 16 items included across two Project Implicit Modules assessing sexism within the contexts of careers and science.  The two modules included: 1) The Gender-Career IAT Module; and 2) The Gender-Science IAT Module.  We selected 3 items from The Gender-Career IAT module. These items included an Implicit Association Test assessing the implicit link between gender and a career vs family focus, and two explicit attitude items which assessed gender norms in relation to family and career.  We selected 12 items from the Gender-Science IAT module.  These 12 items included one Implicit Association Test assessing the implicit link between gender and a science vs liberal arts educational focus, and 11 explicit items measuring attitudes, beliefs, and expectations about gendered participation in science, reasons for gender disparities among faculty members in higher education, and gendered performance in STEM fields.\nFinally, we examined a series of other state-level measures of sexism based off two seminal papers on structural sexism. These included economic (i.e. labor force participation; earnings; living below poverty line); political (representation; voting rates); autonomy (educational attainment; business ownership; health access; living in poverty); and reproductive (legal and policy protections) indicators. All of these indicators were taken from the McLaughlin et al 2011 and Homan 2019 papers. We used the same sources as those articles to find these state-level data.\nStructural racism\n\nVariable selection from GSS\nWe selected from questions in the General Social Survey that were associated with the subject matter \u201cBlacks\u201d or \u201crace.\u201d Among these, 11 measures were assessed in recent years and queried by respondents in all 50 states plus D.C. \n\nVariable selection from ANES\nWe selected from four items included in the American National Elections Studies (ANES) Time-Series Survey that assessed general attitudes towards African Americans, the impact of discrimination on the lives of African Americans, challenges overcoming prejudice, and endorsement of stereotypes.  \n\nVariable selection from Project Implicit\nWe selected from twenty-five items included in the Project Implicit Race IAT module.  These items included an Implicit Association Test that assessed the implicit positive preference for white versus black faces and twenty-four items that assessed explicit attitudes towards African Americans and endorsement of stereotypes.\n\nWe additionally considered the following Black-White disparities as measures of structural racism: Black-White disparities in voter registration, voter turnout, state elected officials, the civilian labor force, employment, employment in executive/managerial positions, professional specialty, college attainment, incarceration, political disenfranchisement, and death sentencing. These have been implicated with racial disparities in cardiovascular outcomes.  We ultimately did not include any of these in our final model as data were unavailable for all 50 states.\n\nStructural stigma related to sexual orientation \nWe selected eight variables reflective of sexual minority structural stigma: 1) An index of state laws and policies related to sexual orientation legislated as of 2017. Data were obtained from the Movement Advancement Project; 2) Explicit attitudes held towards homosexuality and the legality of same-sex marriage. Data were obtained from a Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press Polls conducted in 2017; 3) Explicit policy-specific support towards laws and policies that impact the rights of LGB people and same-sex couples. Data were obtained from Lax and Phillips (2009), who aggregated results from 41 randomly sampled national public opinion polls, consisting of approximately 80,000 respondents, and conducted from 1999 through 2008 by various organizations (e.g., Gallup, Pew); 4) Implicit attitudes held towards sexual minorities, which were obtained from Project Implicit through which participants voluntarily completed the sexuality version of the Implicit Association Test; 5) A weighted proportion of openly LGBTQ elected government officials. Data were obtained from the Victory Institute\u2019s Out for America interactive map; 6) The proportion of public high schools with Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs).  Data on GSAs were obtained from the 2016 CDC School Health Profiles; 7) Estimated percentage of LGBT adults living in each state and 8) the estimated density of same-sex couples living in each state.  These data were obtained from the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law.\n\n\nStructural stigma related to Latinx ethnicity\nFor this domain, very few measures were available for all 50 states plus Washington, D.C., so we excluded Washington, D.C., from the factor analysis. We chose from measures that included explicit attitudinal questions regarding Latinx populations as well as measures related to immigration. As mentioned above, we used measures related to immigration attitudes based on previous findings that immigration policies and attitudes affect the mental health of Latinx respondents regardless of nativity status (e.g., Hatzenbuehler et al., 2017) because of a) the conflation of immigration with Latinx ethnicity in the US, b) the mixed status nature of many Latinx households, and c) the concealability of immigration status, which makes people targets regardless of whether they are a citizen.\n\nVariable selection from GSS\nFrom the General Social Survey, all measures related to the subject \u201cHispanic\u201d or that appeared using a search for \u201cimmigrant\u201d or \u201cimmigration\u201d were considered. This consisted of 23 variables; ultimately, only a single one was queried in recent years and had data available for all 50 states. \n\nVariable selection from ANES\nWe selected from three items included in the American National Elections Studies (ANES) Times-Series Survey that assessed general attitudes towards Hispanics, attitudes towards illegal immigrants, and endorsement of stereotypes. \n\nA series of state-level anti-immigrant measures were considered: these were made available by Wake Forest University School of Medicine and provided directly by the project lead, Scott Rhodes. These included state-level policies that were protective or discriminatory towards immigrants; the variable ultimately considered for inclusion from these measures was a sum score for each state representing how supportive or discriminatory the overall laws were, ranging from a score of -6 to +5. These were reverse-coded so that more discriminatory laws had a higher value.\n\nData cleaning\nAll measures were coded such that higher levels corresponded to higher values of structural stigma. Measures were standardized to their average response value for all respondents, regardless of state of residence, and aggregated to the state level so that every state\u2019s measure was the mean of the standardized individual response for respondents residing in that state. The exception was state-level variables, which were already measured at the state level and thus were not aggregated or standardized further. Measures met inclusion criteria for model selection if residents of every state and Washington, D.C., were represented in the data. The exception is anti-immigrant sentiment, which heavily relied on measures of state policies; thus, data from Washington, D.C., was not non-existent and so was not included in the models. \nWhile the indicators often represented different survey years (e.g., General Social Survey questions ranged from the 1970\u2019s to present day), we aggregated all responses to the state level regardless of year queried. Averaging the responses in this way allowed for all states to have a sizable number of representative respondents, regardless of sampling variation from year to year. Structural sexism and structural racism in particular have been shown to decline nationally over time, but the relative stigma levels of individual states (i.e., rankings relative to other states) have remained stable despite national declines overall, so aggregating across multiple years is a commonly accepted technique for assessing structural stigma (Charles et al., 2009; Homan, 2019; McKetta et al., 2017).\n\nIndicator selection into final model\nWe then created a factor score for each state for each measure by using exploratory factor analysis with a factor loading cut off of 0.40; we reran the factor analysis iteratively and excluded variables until all items in the factor analysis met the 0.40 threshold (n=18 for structural stigma related to sex/gender, n=29 for structural stigma related to race, n=8 for structural stigma related to sexual orientation, and n=4 for structural stigma related to Latinx ethnicity). We performed this analysis using PROC FACTOR in SAS 9.4, with the prior communality estimate fixed at squared multiple correlations with all other variables and oblimin rotation. We considered both a 1-factor and 2-factor solution but chose the 1-factor solution after deeming the 2-factor solution uninterpretable. The variables selected for the final analysis based on the 0.40 loading threshold are included in the attached table. \n\nPerceived discrimination will be operationalized in two ways: dichotomously and continuously.  \n\nDichotomous outcomes will be defined as follows:  \nYes on dim_yesno_q1 for race\nYes on dim_yesno_q1 OR dim_yesno_q2 for Latinx ethnicity\nYes on dim_yesno_q3 for sexual orientation\n\nContinuous outcomes will be defined as follows:\nThe average of dim_matrix_q1 to dim_matrix_q7 for Latinx ethnicity\nThe average of dim_matrix_q5 to dim_matrix_q7 for race, gender, and sexual orientation\n\nDependent Variables:\nbilateral hippocampal volume, calculated by taking the mean volume across the right and left hemispheres (smri_vol_scs_hpuslh, smri_vol_scs_hpusrh), \namygdala activation to negative vs. neutral faces, separately for right and left amygdala (tfmri_nback_all_224, tfmri_nback_all_238)\n\nCovariates:\nage, sex at birth, marital status of household, household income, race, and ethnicity, total intracranial volume\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q19": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Analyses will be conducted using generalized mixed-effects models.

Because of its pervasiveness, its disruption of multiple life domains, and its corrosive impact on the health of populations, researchers have argued that stigma represents a \u201cfundamental cause\u201d of population health inequalities (Hatzenbuehler, Phelan, &amp; Link, 2013). \n\nOne of the central ideas to emerge from this literature is that stigma exists at multiple levels of analysis (Link &amp; Phelan, 2001; Major, Link, &amp; Dovidio, 2017)\u2014ranging from individual responses (e.g., self-stigma) and interpersonal events (e.g., discriminatory treatment) to structural factors (e.g., social policies, institutional practices). While most social science research has focused on the consequences of individual and interpersonal forms of stigma for the stigmatized, over the past decade a new line of research has emerged illustrating that structural forms of stigma, defined as \u201csocietal-level conditions, cultural norms, and institutional policies and practices that constrain the opportunities, resources, and wellbeing of the stigmatized\u201d (Hatzenbuehler &amp; Link, 2014, p. 2), also adversely shape the lives of the stigmatized. The deleterious consequences of structural stigma have been established across a range of: (a) health outcomes, including psychiatric morbidity, suicide attempts, health behaviors, and all-cause mortality; (b) measures of structural stigma, such as state-level policies and aggregated community norms; (c) stigmatized groups, including sexual minorities, African Americans, and immigrants; and (d) methodological approaches, including observational, quasi-experimental, and laboratory designs (see Hatzenbuehler, 2016; 2017 for reviews). \n\nWhile this literature has established that structural stigma is a risk indicator for poor health, the mechanisms underlying this association have received less empirical attention. One set of mechanisms that researchers have begun to evaluate involve stress pathways\u2014encompassing perceptions of stress and the regulation of neurobiological systems that govern stress responses. Preliminary evidence for a stress-related pathway comes from both indirect and direct tests. In terms of indirect tests, in one quasi-experimental study researchers obtained data from medical billing records in a community-based health clinic in Massachusetts to examine associations between the passage of the state\u2019s same-sex marriage law and health care use and costs among sexual minority men. Substantial reductions in several stress-related disorders\u2014including a 14% reduction in depression and an 18% reduction in hypertension\u2014were observed in the 12 months after the legalization of same-sex marriage compared to the 12 months before, providing suggestive evidence for a stress pathway (Hatzenbuehler, O'Cleirigh, et al., 2012). In another quasi-experimental study, Lauderdale (2006) used birth certificate data to compare birth rates in the 6 months after September 11th, 2001 with the same 6 calendar months one year before September 11th. The relative risk of poor birth outcomes, including low birth weight, was statistically significantly elevated in the 6 months after September 11th for Arabic-named women but not for White, Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or Native American women. Given the large literature linking stress to pre-term birth (for a discussion, see Lauderdale, 2006), this study provides additional indirect evidence for a stress pathway linking structural stigma to health.   \n\nIn terms of direct tests, research has suggested that structural stigma may be associated with physiological stress responses. For instance, in a lab-based study, researchers recruited 74 LGB young adults who were raised in 24 states as adolescents. These states differed substantially in terms of the level of structural stigma, which was coded based on a composite measure that included state policies and social attitudes. All respondents, who were currently living in New York (a low structural stigma state), completed a well-validated laboratory stressor, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Neuroendocrine measures were collected before, during, and after the TSST. LGB young adults who grew up in high structural stigma states (compared to low structural stigma states) evidenced a blunted cortisol response following the TSST (Hatzenbuehler &amp; McLaughlin, 2014). This same pattern of hypocortisolism has been documented in other samples exposed to chronic life stressors, such as among youth experiencing childhood maltreatment (Gunnar, Frenn, Wewerka, &amp; Van Ryzin, 2009). \n\nThese results provide preliminary evidence for a stress-related pathway linking structural stigma and health.  Here, we extend this work to examine whether structural stigma leads to changes in the structure and function of brain regions that are influenced by experiences of stress and play a central role in regulation stress responses; specifically, the amygdala and hippocampus. The current study addresses this question by using recently-released data from the ABCD study. Specifically, drawing on prior literature, we will develop state-level indicators of structural stigma/discrimination related to sexual orientation (Hatzenbuehler, 2016), race (Lukachko, Hatzenbuehler, &amp; Keyes, 2013), gender (Homan, 2019), and Hispanic ethnicity (Hatzenbuehler, Prins, Flake, Philbin, Frazer, Hagen, &amp; Hirsch, 2017). We will then link these indicators to the ABCD dataset via the FIPS code of the state where the ABCD study site is located to determine their association with two neural measures that are associated with exposure to psychosocial stressors: hippocampal volume (Hanson et al., 2015; McLaughlin et al., 2016; McLaughlin, Weissman, &amp; Bitr\u00e1n, 2019; Saxbe et al., 2018) and amygdala reactivity to threat (Hein &amp; Monk, 2017; McCrory et al., 2011; McLaughlin, Peverill, Gold, Alves, &amp; Sheridan, 2015). In addition, we will examine associations between individual forms of stigma (i.e., perceived discrimination) and these same two neural outcomes. This will be the first study, to our knowledge, to use a multi-level approach to the study of stigma and neurobiological development. Collectively, this research has the potential not only to advance our understanding of mechanisms linking structural stigma to adverse outcomes, but also to build an evidence base for an emerging subfield of environmental neuroscience (Berman, Stier, &amp; Akcelik, 2019). \n\nStudy Hypotheses    \n\nOur study hypotheses described below are informed by developmental research on identity awareness, formation, and responsivity to identity-based stressors. This research indicates that our four groups develop their identities at different ages, and thus are likely to be aware of, and respond to, structural forms of stigma at different points across development. Below, we briefly review evidence for these developmental differences across the four groups included in our study. \n\nSexual orientation. A population-based survey of 1,154 LGBT adults were asked the following three questions about developmental milestones for sexual minority identities (Pew Research Center, 2013): 1) How old were you when you first thought you were something other than straight or heterosexual? 2) How old were you when you knew for sure you were LGBT? 3) How old were you when you first told a close friend or family member that you were LGBT? The median age at which respondents first thought they were something other than straight or heterosexual was 12; it was 17 when they first knew for sure that they were LGBT and 20 when they first told a close friend or family member that they were LGBT. \n\nSex/Gender. The literature on gender identity development shows that gender learning occurs early and is a gradual process throughout childhood and adolescence (Steensma et al., 2013). While children develop an awareness of their gender by age three (Collier et al., 2013; La Freniere et al., 1984), gender constancy\u2014the understanding that gender is a fixed personal attribute with distinct expectations for boys and girls\u2014develops later, around age six to seven (Grusec, 2011). By this age (age 6-7), girls have already internalized the societal attitude that girls/women are inferior in intelligence and capability (Brown &amp; Stone, 2016). For example, in their review of 4 studies (N = 400 children), Bian and colleagues (2017) found that by age 6 and 7, girls are less likely than boys to believe that members of their gender are \u201creally, really smart.\u201d By the end of childhood (age 11-12), girls report being less content with their gender than boys (Egan &amp; Perry, 2001; Steensma et al., 2013). By the time young women finish high school, they report experiencing both subtle and overt discrimination, which can lead to lower confidence and motivation (Brown &amp; Stone, 2016). \n\nLatinx ethnicity. Latinx ethnic identity development emerges during early childhood (Bernal, Knight, Garza, Ocampo, &amp; Cota, 1990; Serrano-Villar &amp; Calzada, 2016) and continues through adolescence (Uma\u00f1a\u2010Taylor, Gonzales\u2010Backen, &amp; Guimond, 2009).  Serrano-Villar and Clazada (2016) explored ethnic identity formation during early childhood among a sample of Mexican American and Dominican American children enrolled in Pre-K or Kindergarten (N=674 families; Mage = 58 months, SD=6.92) living in the United States.  Participants answered questions related to ethnic self-identification (i.e., \u201cAre you a Mexican/Dominican boy/girl or Chinese boy/girl?\u201d), constancy of identity (i.e., \u201cWhen you grow up, will you be a Mexican/Dominican man/woman or a Chinese man/woman?\u201d), and ethnic knowledge (i.e., \u201cWhat does it mean to be Mexican/Dominican?\u201d). Results showed that 75% of children self-identified as Mexican or Dominican, 56.8% demonstrated an understanding of constancy in identity, and 21.8% demonstrated knowledge about their ethnic identity.  In a comparatively older sample of Mexican-American children, 6 to 10 years old, Bernal and colleagues (1990) found that 85.7% of children 6 to 8 years of age, and 95.8% of children 8 to 10 years of age, correctly identified his or her ethnicity.  Further, a majority of the 8-to-10-year-old children were able to provide clear and accurate reasons as to why they identified as Mexican and, compared to the 6-to-8-year-old children, demonstrated a greater and nearly complete understanding of identity permanence.  According to Bernal and colleagues (1990), \u201c\u2026it appears that the ability to label the ethnic group to which they belong reaches asymptote sometime before 7 or 8 years of age\u201d (p.20). Given that ethnic identity development emerges during childhood, it is perhaps expected that during this same time period Latino youth will begin to perceive/experience ethnic-based discrimination.  Among a Mexican-origin Latino sample of 1,374 5th grade students (9 to 13 years of age; 96% 10 to 11 years of age) living in Phoenix, Arizona, 59% perceived some ethnic discrimination (Kulis, Marsigilia, &amp; Nieri, 2009). The Health and Growth of Puerto Rican Children Study found lower rates of perceived discrimination among a sample of Puerto Rican children living in the greater Boston area in grades 1 to 3 (Mage= 8.37).  Among this sample, 13% reported being treated badly because of being Puerto Rican (Szalacha, Erkut, Coll, Alarcon, Fields, &amp; Ceder, 2003).  However, in a second study, the Puerto Rican Adolescent Study, the same authors found that among 248 Puerto Rican adolescents ages 13-14 years of age, 49% reported experiencing ethnic discrimination in at least one of nine possible situations (e.g., \u201cwhen you were with classmates\u201d; Szalacha, Erkut, Coll, Alarcon, Fields, &amp; Ceder, 2003).  Collectively, these studies suggest that among Latino youth, perceptions of discrimination begin during early childhood (e.g., 7-9 years of age) and increase with age.\n\nRace. Much like ethnicity, the development of racial identity emerges during early childhood and continues through adolescence. Children are able to correctly identify their racial identity between ages 3-6; however, children also demonstrate \u201can awareness of the value attached to whiteness\u201d during this time (Fishbein 2002). For instance, studies consistently find that some racial minority preschoolers and elementary students misidentify themselves as white up until around age seven (Boocock and Scott 2005; DeCuir-Gunby 2009). By age 7-8, children can comprehend both social and physical dimensions of race and recognize some flexibility in racial categorization (e.g., multiracial status) (Alejandro-Wright, 1985). By age 10-12, children understand racial constancy and demonstrate a more \u201cadult-like\u201d understanding of the social construction of race (Alejandro-Wright 1985; Byrd 2012; DeCuir-Gunby 2009). In a review of 70 studies on racial/ethnic identity, Phinney (1990) points out that although children understand race as a concept, an \u201cachieved\u201d racial identity is not complete until late adolescence or early adulthood when individuals move from an unexamined ethnic/racial identity through a period of exploration to an achieved or committed identity. \n\tImportantly, during childhood and adolescence individuals begin moving beyond their immediate family environments, encountering societal institutions that are often covertly and overtly racist (Sellers et al 2006). In their study of 277 urban children and adolescents (age 8-16), Pachter and colleagues (2010) found that 88% of participants reported one or more experiences with racial discrimination. Rates of discriminatory treatment are particularly high among African American children and adolescents. In a 5-year study of 714 Black children (ages 10-12), for instance, 92% reported experiencing racial discrimination in the past year (Brody et. al 2006). A growing body of research also shows that membership in a racial minority group is a central reason for bullying and other forms of peer victimization in school settings (Seaton et al 2013). Overall, these findings suggest that similar to ethnicity, self-reported experiences of racial discrimination begin in childhood and increase with age.\n", "q4": "Hypothesis #1 (baseline). We predict that greater exposure to structural forms of stigma of one\u2019s identity (measured at the state level) will be associated with smaller hippocampal volume and elevated amygdala reactivity to threat cues among members of each of our stigmatized groups defined by sex, sexual orientation, race, and ethnicity, controlling for demographic characteristics and family SES. \n\nWe further hypothesize that some of these associations will be present at baseline, whereas others will not be present until follow-up waves, given the developmental literature on identity development reviewed above. Specifically, we hypothesize that structural stigma will be associated with smaller hippocampal volume and greater amygdala reactivity to threat at baseline among girls, Latino youth, and African American youth. We do not expect an association among the sexual minority youth until later in adolescence when this identity when more youth begin to identify as lesbian, gay, and bisexual (even if they have not disclosed this identity to others).  \n\nAdditionally, we hypothesize that structural forms of stigma will be correlated with individual forms of stigma (i.e., perceived discrimination); that is, respondents will perceive more discrimination based on their sex, race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation in states with relatively high (vs low) levels of structural stigma. In turn, perceived discrimination will be associated with smaller hippocampal volume and elevated amygdala reactivity to threat cues among members of each of our stigmatized groups defined by sex, sexual orientation, race, and ethnicity, controlling for demographic characteristics and family SES. \n\nHypothesis #2 (longitudinal). We expect that structural stigma regarding sexual orientation will be associated with smaller hippocampal volume and heightened amygdala reactivity to threat cues among sexual minorities at future time points in ABCD data collection (around age 12-13 years). In addition, identities continue to form during adolescence and structural stigma experiences accumulate during this developmental period. Consequently, we expect the association between structural stigma, smaller hippocampal volume, and greater amygdala reactivity to threat to become stronger over time for all four groups (i.e., the effect size will increase in the longitudinal assessments).   \n\nHypothesis #3. Structural forms of stigma will not be related to hippocampal volume or amygdala reactivity to threat, either at baseline or longitudinally, among the non-stigmatized comparison groups: boys, heterosexuals, and non-Hispanic Whites. This analysis will serve as a negative control approach (Lipsitch, Tchetgen, &amp; Cohen, 2010), in that we test whether there is an association among groups where we would not theoretically expect it.", "q5": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

The rationale for including all 50 states was to contextualize the factor scores relative to national climate; after models were run using all 50 states, only the states containing ABCD sites will be selected from the larger exposure dataset. See Table 1 for description of final variables. \nStructural Stigma Related to Sex/Gender\nVariable selection from General Social Survey \nWe selected from eight questions in the General Social Survey (GSS) that had been previously validated as measures of state-level sexism and had been shown to be relatively stable over time (Charles, Guryan, &amp; Pan, 2009; Homan, 2019). These asked about attitudes towards women\u2019s and women\u2019s stereotypical gender roles. Of these, four had been routinely assessed in recent years and were considered for inclusion in the final model.\n\nVariable selection from ANES\nWe selected from four items in the American National Elections Studies (ANES) Time-Series Survey that assessed attitudes towards stereotypical gender roles and efforts to address women\u2019s rights, gender equality, and gender discrimination.  \n\nVariable selection from Project Implicit\nWe selected from 16 items included across two Project Implicit Modules assessing sexism within the contexts of careers and science.  The two modules included: 1) The Gender-Career IAT Module; and 2) The Gender-Science IAT Module.  We selected 3 items from The Gender-Career IAT module. These items included an Implicit Association Test assessing the implicit link between gender and a career vs family focus, and two explicit attitude items which assessed gender norms in relation to family and career.  We selected 12 items from the Gender-Science IAT module.  These 12 items included one Implicit Association Test assessing the implicit link between gender and a science vs liberal arts educational focus, and 11 explicit items measuring attitudes, beliefs, and expectations about gendered participation in science, reasons for gender disparities among faculty members in higher education, and gendered performance in STEM fields.\nFinally, we examined a series of other state-level measures of sexism based off two seminal papers on structural sexism. These included economic (i.e. labor force participation; earnings; living below poverty line); political (representation; voting rates); autonomy (educational attainment; business ownership; health access; living in poverty); and reproductive (legal and policy protections) indicators. All of these indicators were taken from the McLaughlin et al 2011 and Homan 2019 papers. We used the same sources as those articles to find these state-level data.\nStructural racism\n\nVariable selection from GSS\nWe selected from questions in the General Social Survey that were associated with the subject matter \u201cBlacks\u201d or \u201crace.\u201d Among these, 11 measures were assessed in recent years and queried by respondents in all 50 states plus D.C. \n\nVariable selection from ANES\nWe selected from four items included in the American National Elections Studies (ANES) Time-Series Survey that assessed general attitudes towards African Americans, the impact of discrimination on the lives of African Americans, challenges overcoming prejudice, and endorsement of stereotypes.  \n\nVariable selection from Project Implicit\nWe selected from twenty-five items included in the Project Implicit Race IAT module.  These items included an Implicit Association Test that assessed the implicit positive preference for white versus black faces and twenty-four items that assessed explicit attitudes towards African Americans and endorsement of stereotypes.\n\nWe additionally considered the following Black-White disparities as measures of structural racism: Black-White disparities in voter registration, voter turnout, state elected officials, the civilian labor force, employment, employment in executive/managerial positions, professional specialty, college attainment, incarceration, political disenfranchisement, and death sentencing. These have been implicated with racial disparities in cardiovascular outcomes.  We ultimately did not include any of these in our final model as data were unavailable for all 50 states.\n\nStructural stigma related to sexual orientation \nWe selected eight variables reflective of sexual minority structural stigma: 1) An index of state laws and policies related to sexual orientation legislated as of 2017. Data were obtained from the Movement Advancement Project; 2) Explicit attitudes held towards homosexuality and the legality of same-sex marriage. Data were obtained from a Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press Polls conducted in 2017; 3) Explicit policy-specific support towards laws and policies that impact the rights of LGB people and same-sex couples. Data were obtained from Lax and Phillips (2009), who aggregated results from 41 randomly sampled national public opinion polls, consisting of approximately 80,000 respondents, and conducted from 1999 through 2008 by various organizations (e.g., Gallup, Pew); 4) Implicit attitudes held towards sexual minorities, which were obtained from Project Implicit through which participants voluntarily completed the sexuality version of the Implicit Association Test; 5) A weighted proportion of openly LGBTQ elected government officials. Data were obtained from the Victory Institute\u2019s Out for America interactive map; 6) The proportion of public high schools with Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs).  Data on GSAs were obtained from the 2016 CDC School Health Profiles; 7) Estimated percentage of LGBT adults living in each state and 8) the estimated density of same-sex couples living in each state.  These data were obtained from the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law.\n\n\nStructural stigma related to Latinx ethnicity\nFor this domain, very few measures were available for all 50 states plus Washington, D.C., so we excluded Washington, D.C., from the factor analysis. We chose from measures that included explicit attitudinal questions regarding Latinx populations as well as measures related to immigration. As mentioned above, we used measures related to immigration attitudes based on previous findings that immigration policies and attitudes affect the mental health of Latinx respondents regardless of nativity status (e.g., Hatzenbuehler et al., 2017) because of a) the conflation of immigration with Latinx ethnicity in the US, b) the mixed status nature of many Latinx households, and c) the concealability of immigration status, which makes people targets regardless of whether they are a citizen.\n\nVariable selection from GSS\nFrom the General Social Survey, all measures related to the subject \u201cHispanic\u201d or that appeared using a search for \u201cimmigrant\u201d or \u201cimmigration\u201d were considered. This consisted of 23 variables; ultimately, only a single one was queried in recent years and had data available for all 50 states. \n\nVariable selection from ANES\nWe selected from three items included in the American National Elections Studies (ANES) Times-Series Survey that assessed general attitudes towards Hispanics, attitudes towards illegal immigrants, and endorsement of stereotypes. \n\nA series of state-level anti-immigrant measures were considered: these were made available by Wake Forest University School of Medicine and provided directly by the project lead, Scott Rhodes. These included state-level policies that were protective or discriminatory towards immigrants; the variable ultimately considered for inclusion from these measures was a sum score for each state representing how supportive or discriminatory the overall laws were, ranging from a score of -6 to +5. These were reverse-coded so that more discriminatory laws had a higher value.\n\nData cleaning\nAll measures were coded such that higher levels corresponded to higher values of structural stigma. Measures were standardized to their average response value for all respondents, regardless of state of residence, and aggregated to the state level so that every state\u2019s measure was the mean of the standardized individual response for respondents residing in that state. The exception was state-level variables, which were already measured at the state level and thus were not aggregated or standardized further. Measures met inclusion criteria for model selection if residents of every state and Washington, D.C., were represented in the data. The exception is anti-immigrant sentiment, which heavily relied on measures of state policies; thus, data from Washington, D.C., was not non-existent and so was not included in the models. \nWhile the indicators often represented different survey years (e.g., General Social Survey questions ranged from the 1970\u2019s to present day), we aggregated all responses to the state level regardless of year queried. Averaging the responses in this way allowed for all states to have a sizable number of representative respondents, regardless of sampling variation from year to year. Structural sexism and structural racism in particular have been shown to decline nationally over time, but the relative stigma levels of individual states (i.e., rankings relative to other states) have remained stable despite national declines overall, so aggregating across multiple years is a commonly accepted technique for assessing structural stigma (Charles et al., 2009; Homan, 2019; McKetta et al., 2017).\n\nIndicator selection into final model\nWe then created a factor score for each state for each measure by using exploratory factor analysis with a factor loading cut off of 0.40; we reran the factor analysis iteratively and excluded variables until all items in the factor analysis met the 0.40 threshold (n=18 for structural stigma related to sex/gender, n=29 for structural stigma related to race, n=8 for structural stigma related to sexual orientation, and n=4 for structural stigma related to Latinx ethnicity). We performed this analysis using PROC FACTOR in SAS 9.4, with the prior communality estimate fixed at squared multiple correlations with all other variables and oblimin rotation. We considered both a 1-factor and 2-factor solution but chose the 1-factor solution after deeming the 2-factor solution uninterpretable. The variables selected for the final analysis based on the 0.40 loading threshold are included in the attached table. \n\nPerceived discrimination will be operationalized in two ways: dichotomously and continuously.  \n\nDichotomous outcomes will be defined as follows:  \nYes on dim_yesno_q1 for race\nYes on dim_yesno_q1 OR dim_yesno_q2 for Latinx ethnicity\nYes on dim_yesno_q3 for sexual orientation\n\nContinuous outcomes will be defined as follows:\nThe average of dim_matrix_q1 to dim_matrix_q7 for Latinx ethnicity\nThe average of dim_matrix_q5 to dim_matrix_q7 for race, gender, and sexual orientation\n\nDependent Variables:\nbilateral hippocampal volume, calculated by taking the mean volume across the right and left hemispheres (smri_vol_scs_hpuslh, smri_vol_scs_hpusrh), \namygdala activation to negative vs. neutral faces, separately for right and left amygdala (tfmri_nback_all_224, tfmri_nback_all_238)\n\nCovariates:\nage, sex at birth, marital status of household, household income, race, and ethnicity, total intracranial volume\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Analyses will be conducted using generalized mixed-effects models.

issue affecting nations worldwide and an important topic of interest in the social sciences.\n\nRecent experimental research showed that high social mobility beliefs promote acceptance and tolerance for inequality, and exposure to low mobility beliefs reduces willingness to defend the status quo inequality (Shariff et al., 2016; Day &amp; Fiske, 2017). Driven by this evidence, we wanted to further explore tolerance for inequality and understand what makes people more or less open to supporting or opposing economic equality.\n\nThis study was designed to find out whether tolerance for income and wealth inequality is associated with psychological orientations, emotions, and behavioral tendencies suggested by the non-empirical theories of Jean Jacques Rousseau in the Discourse on the Origins and Basis of Inequality Among Men (1755). With his main argument being that humans have evolved away from compassion and towards \u2018self-love' (translated from \u201camour-propre\u201d), Rousseau claimed that inequality in society stems from individuals\u2019 self-interest, egoism, envy, vanity, contempt, pride, desire for accumulation, and need to compare and compete with others.\n\nThus, in this research study we will look at Rousseau\u2019s theories from an empirical viewpoint and test whether certain motivations, personality traits, social behaviors, and emotional dispositions are associated with greater or lesser concern about inequality. In addition to investigating individuals\u2019 attitudes towards economic inequality in a Canadian population sample, this study adds to existing literature by providing a novel perspective on the behaviors, emotions and motivations at play in the tolerance and maintenance of economic inequality. \n\nCorrelational evidence related to our predictions may open avenues for further research using experimental designs in a controlled environment.\n\nReferences: \n\nDay, M.

Driven by this evidence, we wanted to further explore tolerance for inequality and understand what makes people more or less open to supporting or opposing economic equality.\n\nThis study was designed to find out whether tolerance for income and wealth inequality is associated with psychological orientations, emotions, and behavioral tendencies suggested by the non-empirical theories of Jean Jacques Rousseau in the Discourse on the Origins and Basis of Inequality Among Men (1755). With his main argument being that humans have evolved away from compassion and towards \u2018self-love' (translated from \u201camour-propre\u201d), Rousseau claimed that inequality in society stems from individuals\u2019 self-interest, egoism, envy, vanity, contempt, pride, desire for accumulation, and need to compare and compete with others.\n\nThus, in this research study we will look at Rousseau\u2019s theories from an empirical viewpoint and test whether certain motivations, personality traits, social behaviors, and emotional dispositions are associated with greater or lesser concern about inequality. In addition to investigating individuals\u2019 attitudes towards economic inequality in a Canadian population sample, this study adds to existing literature by providing a novel perspective on the behaviors, emotions and motivations at play in the tolerance and maintenance of economic inequality. \n\nCorrelational evidence related to our predictions may open avenues for further research using experimental designs in a controlled environment.\n\nReferences: \n\nDay, M.

Isoni, Ashley Luckman, Timothy L Mullett"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "This project aims to examine the psychological process behind the so-called \"attraction effect\" in behavioural science by exploring the reason structure of decision makers. The attraction effect refers to the observed change in preferences between two options which depends on the attribute values of an asymmetrically dominated third option (Huber, Payne, and Puto, 1982). In particular preferences usually shift towards the dominating option.\n\nThe main motivation for considering a reason-based account for this effect comes from Query Theory (Johnson, H\u00e4ubl, and Keinan, 2007). Query Theory suggests that individuals make decisions by generating reasons, with reasons favouring the chosen option generated both earlier in the decision-making process and in greater quantity. Despite its simplicity and the ability to explain a range of behavioural phenomena such as the default effect (Dinner, Johnson, Goldstein, and Liu, 2011), attribute framing (Hardisty, Johnson, and Weber, 2010), and asymmetric discounting in intertemporal choices (Weber et al., 2007), Query Theory has not yet been tested beyond simple binary choices, such as the three-alternative choice structure needed to demonstrate the attraction effect. In their standard forms, its two key measures (the order and quantity scores) cannot be applied directly to multi-alternative choices.\n\nThe project aims to extend this reason-based process model and investigate the extent to which its mechanisms can explain the attraction effect."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Consider a ternary choice (e.g. A vs B vs C) with two attributes (e.g. 1 and 2). Assume that option A has a high value on attribute 1 and a low value on attribute 2, option B has a low value on attribute 1 and a high value on attribute 2, while option C is similar to option A but both of its attribute values are slightly lower than those of option A.\n\nHere, option A is the dominating option and is usually termed the \"target\", option B is the non-dominated option and is termed the \"competitor\", while option C is asymmetrically dominated by option A and is termed the \"decoy\".\n\nThe above example is an illustration of the attraction effect. In our experiment the attribute values of the decoy option C change between conditions, such that either option A or option B will become the target.\n\nThe key hypotheses are as follow.\n\nH1: The choice share of an option will be higher when it is the target than when it is not \n\nAs the decoy is inferior to the target on all attributes, we expect that:\n\nH2: The decoy option will not be chosen\n\nQuery Theory suggests that:\n\nH3: Reasons in favour of the chosen option will be generated in greater quantity\n\nH4: Reasons in favour of the chosen option will be generated earlier\n\nFrom H1, H3, and H4, we further predict:\n\nH5: Reasons in favour of an option will be generated in greater quantity when it is the target than when it is not \n\nH6: Reasons in favour of an option will be generated earlier when it is the target than when it is not \n\nLastly, based on previous studies (e.g. Adjerid et al., 2016), we predict that the order of the experimental procedures does not change choices, the quantity of reasons supporting each option, or the order of reasons supporting each option, therefore scenario (Reason First vs Choice First) will have no effects.

If they are, they will be informed that the experiment will not run appropriately on a mobile device. Participants will then be shown the consent form and the instruction page.\n\nMain stages: Choice, Aspect Listing, Aspect Coding, Reason Weighting, and Confidence.\n\nThe order of the first two stages (i.e. Choice and Aspect Listing) are randomised. See below for the experimental manipulation \"Scenario\".\n\n- Choice: Participants will be asked to make one consumer choice with three options. \n\n- Aspect Listing: Participants will be asked to think of reasons which come to their minds as they are considering the options, and input these reasons one at a time. They will be required to input at least one reason, and the reason listing procedure will be terminated when they decide that they have already inputted all reasons which allow them to make the choice, or when they have inputted 10 reasons, whichever comes first. \n\n- Aspect Coding: Participants will be asked to code each of their reasons. In this stage, participants will be asked to indicate which of the three options a reason supports. In other words, only positive coding is allowed.\n\n- Reason Weighting: Participants will be asked to weight the importance of each reason. \n\n- Confidence: Participants will be asked to rate how confident they are in their choice.\n\nLastly, one attention check question is included at the end of the experiment, and participants will be asked a multiple-choice question about the type of products their choice was about.\n\nThe key experimental manipulations involve a 2 (Target: Option A vs Option B) x 2 (Scenario: Reason First vs Choice First) between-subject design.\n\nThe two Target conditions are to check whether the attraction effect exists and whether preference can be reversed when the target changes. The two Scenario conditions are included to check whether that the order of the experimental procedures changes decision outcomes, the number of reasons, or the order of reasons.

The attraction effect refers to the observed change in preferences between two options which depends on the attribute values of an asymmetrically dominated third option (Huber, Payne, and Puto, 1982). In particular preferences usually shift towards the dominating option.\n\nThe main motivation for considering a reason-based account for this effect comes from Query Theory (Johnson, H\u00e4ubl, and Keinan, 2007). Query Theory suggests that individuals make decisions by generating reasons, with reasons favouring the chosen option generated both earlier in the decision-making process and in greater quantity. Despite its simplicity and the ability to explain a range of behavioural phenomena such as the default effect (Dinner, Johnson, Goldstein, and Liu, 2011), attribute framing (Hardisty, Johnson, and Weber, 2010), and asymmetric discounting in intertemporal choices (Weber et al., 2007), Query Theory has not yet been tested beyond simple binary choices, such as the three-alternative choice structure needed to demonstrate the attraction effect. In their standard forms, its two key measures (the order and quantity scores) cannot be applied directly to multi-alternative choices.\n\nThe project aims to extend this reason-based process model and investigate the extent to which its mechanisms can explain the attraction effect.", "q4": "Consider a ternary choice (e.g. A vs B vs C) with two attributes (e.g. 1 and 2). Assume that option A has a high value on attribute 1 and a low value on attribute 2, option B has a low value on attribute 1 and a high value on attribute 2, while option C is similar to option A but both of its attribute values are slightly lower than those of option A.\n\nHere, option A is the dominating option and is usually termed the \"target\", option B is the non-dominated option and is termed the \"competitor\", while option C is asymmetrically dominated by option A and is termed the \"decoy\".\n\nThe above example is an illustration of the attraction effect. In our experiment the attribute values of the decoy option C change between conditions, such that either option A or option B will become the target.\n\nThe key hypotheses are as follow.\n\nH1: The choice share of an option will be higher when it is the target than when it is not \n\nAs the decoy is inferior to the target on all attributes, we expect that:\n\nH2: The decoy option will not be chosen\n\nQuery Theory suggests that:\n\nH3: Reasons in favour of the chosen option will be generated in greater quantity\n\nH4: Reasons in favour of the chosen option will be generated earlier\n\nFrom H1, H3, and H4, we further predict:\n\nH5: Reasons in favour of an option will be generated in greater quantity when it is the target than when it is not \n\nH6: Reasons in favour of an option will be generated earlier when it is the target than when it is not \n\nLastly, based on previous studies (e.g. Adjerid et al., 2016), we predict that the order of the experimental procedures does not change choices, the quantity of reasons supporting each option, or the order of reasons supporting each option, therefore scenario (Reason First vs Choice First) will have no effects.

See the \"Exploratory analysis\" section.\n\nFor H3 and H4, since we have decided to compute separate Order and Content scores for each option (see the \"Indices\" section), we will run the following logistic regression models using the two types of metrics:\n\nChoice (A vs B) ~ (Content_A - Content_B) + Scenario (Reason First vs Choice First) + (Content_A - Content_B) x Scenario\nChoice (A vs B) ~ (Order_A - Order_B) + Scenario (Reason First vs Choice First) + (Order_A - Order_B) x Scenario\n\nFor H5 and H6, we will run the following logistic regression models:\n\nChoice (Target vs Non-target) ~ Content_Target + Content_Decoy + Target (A vs B) + Scenario (Reason First vs Choice First) + Content_Target x Target + Content_Decoy x Target \nChoice (Target vs Non-target) ~ Order_Target + Order_Decoy + Target (A vs B) + Scenario (Reason First vs Choice First) + Order_Target x Target + Order_Decoy x Target ", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=b9pz8", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "b9pz8", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "b9pz8", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/vbj7z/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "vbj7z", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k9uas/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "k9uas", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/b9pz8/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b9pz8/"}}, {"id": "sprqj", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "What's in a Frame?
