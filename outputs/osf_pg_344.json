The share of youth out of school and out of work was estimated at 13 percent in 2009, a rate that compares favorably to other countries in the region, and the youth unemployment rate was estimated at a relatively low 6.1 percent in 2011. Nonetheless, there remain significant disparities across regions and income levels in youth employment opportunities. In addition, youth in Kazakhstan face significant challenges beyond obtaining employment, demonstrating high rates of disconnectedness from social institutions and high prevalence of risky behaviors. Males between 25 and 34 are at highest risk for suicide, and Kazakhstan ranks fifth in the world for its rates of deaths in this category. Primarily qualitative evidence suggests other types of risk-taking (alcoholism, sexual violence and crime) are rising in frequency, and disaffection around social and political institutions is also common. Less than a tenth of young people report they are engaged in solving a community problem, and corruption and abuse are commonly cited as significant challenges (as enumerated in the national report on Youth in Kazakhstan 2011). Against this backdrop, the Government of Kazakhstan (GoK), with financing from the World Bank, has carried out the Youth Corps Project (YCP), which aims to promote civic and community engagement and labor force engagement of targeted young people through community-based grants and non-cognitive skills training throughout the country. The project is being implemented by the Coordinating Agency (CA), under the oversight of the Ministry of Education and Sciences. The pilot phase of the project was carried out in 2017 and targeted about 4000 youth across 4 regions/oblast (Almaty, Pavlodar, South Kazakhstan and Karaganda)."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "The hypothesis motivating this project is that low levels of labor market and civic engagement by young people in Kazakhstan are related to contextual factors that can be influenced by the proposed interventions. Overall, the panorama of economic opportunities available to Kazakh youth is relatively strong, particularly when compared to labor market conditions in other countries in the region. However, this project is motivated by the hypothesis that weak non-cognitive skills, weak social connections, and low levels of civic engagement pose meaningful challenges for youth, limiting their labor market participation and increasing the probability that they engage in risky or socially undesirable behaviors. The interventions to be evaluated seek to target these challenges and thus enhance youth labor market and socioeconomic outcomes. The specific research questions and related hypotheses are outlined below. Evaluation Question A: Do community service grants enhance youth outcomes? Hypothesis A1: Access to grants and stipends through a community service initiative will improve non-cognitive skills and employment outcomes. Evaluation Question B: Does a non-cognitive skills training program that seeks to develop critical thinking, community skills, goal-setting, collaboration, team-building, creativity and innovation enhance youth outcomes? Hypothesis B1: Access to mentoring and training programs will improve non-cognitive skills and employment outcomes. Evaluation Question C: Does life-skills training reinforce the impact of community service grants, enhancing their impact on youth outcomes? Hypothesis C1: Access to mentoring and training programs, when combined with access to grants and stipends through a community service initiative, improve non-cognitive skills and employment outcomes more than receiving only one of the two interventions."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "The first intervention is a community service grant, in which a group of three to five young people receive up to $3000 to design and implement a community service project for six months.

The share of youth out of school and out of work was estimated at 13 percent in 2009, a rate that compares favorably to other countries in the region, and the youth unemployment rate was estimated at a relatively low 6.1 percent in 2011. Nonetheless, there remain significant disparities across regions and income levels in youth employment opportunities. In addition, youth in Kazakhstan face significant challenges beyond obtaining employment, demonstrating high rates of disconnectedness from social institutions and high prevalence of risky behaviors. Males between 25 and 34 are at highest risk for suicide, and Kazakhstan ranks fifth in the world for its rates of deaths in this category. Primarily qualitative evidence suggests other types of risk-taking (alcoholism, sexual violence and crime) are rising in frequency, and disaffection around social and political institutions is also common. Less than a tenth of young people report they are engaged in solving a community problem, and corruption and abuse are commonly cited as significant challenges (as enumerated in the national report on Youth in Kazakhstan 2011). Against this backdrop, the Government of Kazakhstan (GoK), with financing from the World Bank, has carried out the Youth Corps Project (YCP), which aims to promote civic and community engagement and labor force engagement of targeted young people through community-based grants and non-cognitive skills training throughout the country. The project is being implemented by the Coordinating Agency (CA), under the oversight of the Ministry of Education and Sciences.

The mere mention of the word density may cause residents and planners to shake, shudder or foam at the mouth. Battles over changes in density are the most heated and contested in urban planning today. City leaders are under pressure to increase residential densities in order to provide affordable housing, reduce energy use and carbon emissions, ensure the viability of public transportation, and to create vibrant and complete communities. Yet despite the well-known advantages of urban density, communities throughout North America persistently oppose new developments and housing projects (Monkkonen & Manville, 2018). This opposition is one expression of the Not in My Backyard (NIMBY) phenomenon aimed at new housing projects or re-zoning plans. The push-back from residents and voters remains a persistent and vexing challenge for urban planners. Indeed, organized NIMBY-residents mobilized against new housing projects have been compared to cartels, aimed at keeping others out for private gains (Monkkonen & Manville, 2018). Many concerns from opponents of new residential development are well founded. Increased urban densities may increase traffic, reduce parking availability or generate more noise and nuisance (Bonnes, Bonaiuto, & Ercolani, 1991). But there are also benefits associated with new developments and re-zoning projects such as new amenities, new services or new commercial areas that will benefit new and old residents alike. Greater densities and increased pedestrian traffic also provide \u201ceyes on the street\u201d in public space, that may increase the sense of safety and community (Jacobs, 1961). There are also consequences of higher density that have ambiguous impacts on residents. One such ambiguous result of higher density is the increasing the number of users of public space. On the one hand, many of us enjoy people watching, and feel enlivened by vibrant and well-used public parks or public plazas. However other users prefer quiet residential areas and are bothered by noise, the presence of youth, or the absence of calm and privacy. It is also true that our preferences for lively or calmed areas may depend on the particular context, surroundings or urban design. In this research we focus on how changes in the number of users of public space may modify perceptions, satisfaction and behaviour. Our intervention increases pedestrian, and well as staying activity, in a residential corridor near a university. It is unclear if users will prefer, dislike, or be indifferent to the additional public life in this particular public space. We expect different users to have different preferences. In particular, we anticipate differences by user types, especially between residents and non-residents, who are likely to have different tolerance levels for additional public users. Those most familiar with a space might be most sensitive to changes we introduce. We are curious to learn if increasing public vitality is perceived negatively, or welcomed. While existing residents may be reluctant to accept changes in their community, in practice, some features of urban life may be attractive. Might residents who claim to be against increases in urban density in fact, appreciate or enjoy the feel of vibrant and lively public spaces? And if the perceptions toward more vibrant spaces are indeed negative, can we quantify the associated drop in satisfaction, or approximate thresholds at which perceptions begin to change? Being able to quantify the positive or negative changes in satisfaction may help inform debates about the benefits or costs of one key aspect of increasing urban densities."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Our general hypothesis is that an increased level of pedestrian flow and staying activities will change people\u2019s perceptions about the quality of the public space and increase the probability that more people stay in the public space."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "We hypothesize that our intervention will make the space feel more welcoming for most survey respondents, with the possible exception of residents of Hawthorne Place. We hypothesize that our intervention will make the space feel more vibrant. We hypothesize that our intervention will make the place feel less peaceful, especially for residents of Hawthorne Place. We hypothesize that our intervention will make the place feel more interesting. We hypothesize that our intervention will make the place feel noisier. We hypothesize that our intervention will make the place feel more crowded. We are uncertain how our intervention might influence a respondents\u2019 perception that this place is a place to relax. In our control conditions, the place is quiet and calming. We are uncertain if this sense will be lost due to the pedestrian movement. On the other hand, the presence of others sitting or socializing on the grass, may make some see this as a good staying place. But on the other hand, it will be noisier. We hypothesize that our intervention will make this a place more attractive for watching others. We are uncertain if our intervention will make this a more attractive place for them to stay. On the one hand, there will be more activity, perhaps lending some to want to stay, while for others, the additional activity may be a disincentive to stay. We are uncertain if our intervention will improve perceptions on the overall quality of the public space. As mentioned above, there could be reasons for movement in either direction. We hypothesize that a more lively public space will improve people\u2019s mood. We are uncertain how our intervention may influence their sense of being stressed. The control conditions are very calming, and so we might see lower stress levels under control conditions (or no effect). We also hypothesize that stress levels may be good at predicting outcomes and therefore included as a covariate in our regression models. We hypothesize that our intervention may make people more likely to want to spend more time with their neighbours. We anticipate that the presence of more individuals staying in the area (treatment conditions) will encourage others to also stay in the area."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Canada"}, "q20":

planning than debates around urban density (Whittemore & Bendor, 2018). The mere mention of the word density may cause residents and planners to shake, shudder or foam at the mouth. Battles over changes in density are the most heated and contested in urban planning today. City leaders are under pressure to increase residential densities in order to provide affordable housing, reduce energy use and carbon emissions, ensure the viability of public transportation, and to create vibrant and complete communities. Yet despite the well-known advantages of urban density, communities throughout North America persistently oppose new developments and housing projects (Monkkonen & Manville, 2018). This opposition is one expression of the Not in My Backyard (NIMBY) phenomenon aimed at new housing projects or re-zoning plans. The push-back from residents and voters remains a persistent and vexing challenge for urban planners. Indeed, organized NIMBY-residents mobilized against new housing projects have been compared to cartels, aimed at keeping others out for private gains (Monkkonen & Manville, 2018). Many concerns from opponents of new residential development are well founded. Increased urban densities may increase traffic, reduce parking availability or generate more noise and nuisance (Bonnes, Bonaiuto, & Ercolani, 1991). But there are also benefits associated with new developments and re-zoning projects such as new amenities, new services or new commercial areas that will benefit new and old residents alike. Greater densities and increased pedestrian traffic also provide \u201ceyes on the street\u201d in public space, that may increase the sense of safety and community (Jacobs, 1961). There are also consequences of higher density that have ambiguous impacts on residents. One such ambiguous result of higher density is the increasing the number of users of public space. On the one hand, many of us enjoy people watching, and feel enlivened by vibrant and well-used public parks or public plazas. However other users prefer quiet residential areas and are bothered by noise, the presence of youth, or the absence of calm and privacy. It is also true that our preferences for lively or calmed areas may depend on the particular context, surroundings or urban design. In this research we focus on how changes in the number of users of public space may modify perceptions, satisfaction and behaviour. Our intervention increases pedestrian, and well as staying activity, in a residential corridor near a university. It is unclear if users will prefer, dislike, or be indifferent to the additional public life in this particular public space. We expect different users to have different preferences. In particular, we anticipate differences by user types, especially between residents and non-residents, who are likely to have different tolerance levels for additional public users. Those most familiar with a space might be most sensitive to changes we introduce. We are curious to learn if increasing public vitality is perceived negatively, or welcomed. While existing residents may be reluctant to accept changes in their community, in practice, some features of urban life may be attractive. Might residents who claim to be against increases in urban density in fact, appreciate or enjoy the feel of vibrant and lively public spaces? And if the perceptions toward more vibrant spaces are indeed negative, can we quantify the associated drop in satisfaction, or approximate thresholds at which perceptions begin to change? Being able to quantify the positive or negative changes in satisfaction may help inform debates about the benefits or costs of one key aspect of increasing urban densities.", "q16": "Our general hypothesis is that an increased level of pedestrian flow and staying activities will change people\u2019s perceptions about the quality of the public space and increase the probability that more people stay in the public space.", "q17": "We hypothesize that our intervention will make the space feel more welcoming for most survey respondents, with the possible exception of residents of Hawthorne Place. We hypothesize that our intervention will make the space feel more vibrant. We hypothesize that our intervention will make the place feel less peaceful, especially for residents of Hawthorne Place. We hypothesize that our intervention will make the place feel more interesting. We hypothesize that our intervention will make the place feel noisier. We hypothesize that our intervention will make the place feel more crowded. We are uncertain how our intervention might influence a respondents\u2019 perception that this place is a place to relax. In our control conditions, the place is quiet and calming. We are uncertain if this sense will be lost due to the pedestrian movement. On the other hand, the presence of others sitting or socializing on the grass, may make some see this as a good staying place. But on the other hand, it will be noisier. We hypothesize that our intervention will make this a place more attractive for watching others. We are uncertain if our intervention will make this a more attractive place for them to stay. On the one hand, there will be more activity, perhaps lending some to want to stay, while for others, the additional activity may be a disincentive to stay. We are uncertain if our intervention will improve perceptions on the overall quality of the public space. As mentioned above, there could be reasons for movement in either direction. We hypothesize that a more lively public space will improve people\u2019s mood. We are uncertain how our intervention may influence their sense of being stressed. The control conditions are very calming, and so we might see lower stress levels under control conditions (or no effect). We also hypothesize that stress levels may be good at predicting outcomes and therefore included as a covariate in our regression models. We hypothesize that our intervention may make people more likely to want to spend more time with their neighbours. We anticipate that the presence of more individuals staying in the area (treatment conditions) will encourage others to also stay in the area.", "q18": "Canada", "q19": "", "q20": "Yes", "q21": "",

Does policy leadership such as joining (or not joining) international cooperation affect public attitudes? Is this leadership effect conditioned by partisanship? A second focus is national \u201cexperience\u201d as encapsulated in shared perceptions historical experience. Do important lessons of history affect public attitudes? A third focus is on the role of \u201cexclusionary\u201d nationalism in particular.

For each country, there will be three randomized treatment groups: control, cooperative message only, policy choice message only, cooperative message + policy choice message. The cooperative message treatment is a text to be read by respondents arguing that climate change should be addressed through international cooperation. The policy leadership treatment is a text explaining that their country is (Germany, India, Japan), or is not (USA) \u201ca full participant\u201d in the Paris climate accords. H2a&b will be tested using one randomized treatment group. These respondents receive the \u201clessons of history\u201d but do not receive any of the policy leadership treatments.

You may list any event of recent or past history.\u201d There are three open-ended response lines. The second asks \u201cRecalling the three important lessons of history you just listed, which is the single most important historical event that you think should provide a lesson for ${e://Field/country} today, the first, second, or third that you listed?\u201d They are given tick options of 1, 2, or 3. The third question asks \u201cIn one or two sentences, please say what in your opinion the major lesson of the historical event you selected in the previous question is for ${e://Field/country}?\u201d Respondents answer in a text-box. Only the fact of being asked about lessons or not can be considered a randomized treatment. Respondents self-select into the specific lessons they nominate, so we will not make claims about treatment effects based on the specific lessons. There is also a control group of respondents who receive neither treatment and jump right to the outcome variable questions.

Afghanistan. For general background on the ALSE project, refer to previous reports, available at www.alseproject.com. ALSE Phase II tests a strategy for sustaining access and learning gains from community-based education (CBE) classes after the withdrawal of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) who were responsible for setting up the classes. CBE classes are often started by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and in Afghanistan most CBE classes are administered by NGOs. However, NGOs operate on program cycles that are dictated, largely, by funding cycles. As such, it is a near inevitability that NGO administration of a CBE class will have to come to an end at some point. When that happens, the question arises as to how one might sustain access to education for the children attending CBE classes. Typically, the NGO \u201chands over\u201d this responsibility to the national government\u2019s Ministry of Education (MOE), which has a mandate to make access to primary education universal. Past research shows, however, that such handover can be problematic. In a 2014 field survey, the ALSE team examined data from 224 villages in Ghor and Herat provinces (Burde, Middleton, and Samii 2015). All of these villages had been part of a cycle of NGO-administered CBE through to 2011. As of 2014, 3 years after handover, in only 42 of those villages did the MOE sustain the CBE class, while in 18 others a new cycle of NGO-administered CBE had begun. The vast majority of cases have reverted to a situation of no within-village schooling. In about half of the cases where village classes were not sustained, the MOE or NGOs indicated that security issues prevented continuation of the classes in the villages. Also, the MOE and NGOs indicated that in some cases, children who had access to the CBE classes previously could now attend MOE administered \u201chub schools\u201d that were, ostensibly, nearby. However, previous research undertaken by Burde and Linden (2013) showed that attendance drops even at relatively short distances, particularly for girls. And consistent with those results, the ALSE team\u2019s data collection in 114 villages that were deemed free of any security problems indicated very clearly that when CBE classes ceased to function within the village, attendance dropped too. These results indicate serious sustainability problems for CBE. This study examines a strategy for addressing this sustainability challenge. Intervention The ALSE team worked with the MOE, other government actors, and implementing NGOs to develop a \u201csustainability model\u201d that may increase the chances that NGO-initiated CBE classes could continue to function within the village under overall MOE administration and co-management of village-level community institutions after the departure of NGOs. This sustainability model is the intervention tested in ALSE Phase II. The sustainability model takes advantage of the decentralized community governance structure created as part of Afghanistan\u2019s National Solidarity Program (NSP), evaluated by Beath, Christia, and Enikolopov (2013). The NSP organized village-level community development councils, consisting of a small number of appointed and elected villagers. Under NSP, the community development councils were tasked with devising village development plans that would be used to guide the application of village block grants. These community development councils have remained active through to the present (see the ALSE Phase II Baseline report for relevant findings). The ALSE \u201csustainability model\u201d charges an education-focused subcommittee of the village community development councils to assume administrative responsibility of the CBE class after the NGO\u2019s departure. This administrative responsibility included recruiting, paying, and monitoring the teacher, facilitation of acquisition of space, school supplies, and other material needs, and attending to other problems that arose in relation to the class. ALSE provided management capacity training to the community development councils and subcommittee to take on these tasks. With the village-level community development councils members capacitated to manage the CBE class, all that is needed will be a line of financing to the community development councils to cover teacher salaries and material costs, as well as occasional central oversight. ALSE provided financial support, which included teacher salary and classroom supplies. The distribution of teacher salaries and central oversight were conducted jointly by ALSE and district MOE offices. If successful, the model is intended to be taken up fully by the MOE. The model accords with the Citizen\u2019s Charter Initiative, undertaken at the level of the Afghan Presidency, and which proposes to use the NSP institutional infrastructure to improve basic service delivery. The primary goal for our analysis is to assess whether the sustainability model might be deemed successful in making it highly likely that classes will continue (sustainability effects), while achieving attendance and learning outcomes at a level that meets a benchmark set by NGOs (access and learning effects). This assessment will be based primarily on sustainability, access, and learning effects. It will also explore gender- and social institution-related (e.g., ethnicity-related) moderator effects. Finally, assessments will be drawn on whether or/and to what extent this sustainability model exudes \u201cadded value\u201d in terms of effects on local and national government legitimacy (governance effects). A secondary motivation for the analysis is to assess mechanisms that contribute to effects that we observe. In addition to being assigned to the community management (that is, village-level institutions\u2019 management) versus extended NGO management treatment conditions, communities have also been randomly assigned to receive two types of enhancements to the ways in which the CBE program was implemented during Phase I. This included a \u201cteacher recruitment\u201d enhancement. For this enhancement, the treatment condition was that teachers were recruited using a MOE requirement of education credentials for teachers. The control condition was the standard recruitment practice of the implementing NGOs, which did not require teachers to possess the MOE-required educational credentials. The rationale for this enhancement was to see if hiring such \u201cqualified\u201d teachers would help sustainability by making it easier for the MoE to take over management responsibility for the school. An assessment of the effects of this teacher recruitment treatment on Phase I attendance and learning outcomes is given in Burde, Middleton, and Samii (2016). That study found that requiring teachers to meet the MOE\u2019s education credentials had a modestly positive effect on attendance (0.050 percentage points, p = 0.072) and learning (0.097sd, p = 0.058). That said, the main interest with this variation was to improve sustainability, which is the focus of the current study. The second enhancement was a \u201ccommunity engagement\u201d enhancement. In the treatment condition, communities were given placards with Qur\u2019anic messages about education and an adult reading program was established. Both of these programs were intended to increase parents\u2019 enthusiasm for education generally and also to contribute to their motivation and capacity to help their children learn. The control condition was the NGOs\u2019 default programming, which did not include such extensive efforts to engage parents. The rationale for this enhancement was that it could improve children\u2019s learning by creating a more supportive environment. It could also contribute to communities\u2019 willingness to make efforts needed to promote sustainability. Burde, Middleton, and Samii (2016) found that this variation had negligible effects on attendance (0.002, p = 0.475) and learning (-0.060sd, p = 0.862). The current study will assess whether this variation contributes to sustainability."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Research Questions We aim to inform a discussion of the merits of a sustainability model that involves local governance and community institutions as a way to sustain gains from NGO-initiated CBE. We do not propose to establish standards at this time by which we will definitely declare the model a \u201csuccess\u201d or \u201cfailure.\u201d Rather, we propose that the evidence be used in a more deliberative process to determine whether the sustainability model offers a reasonable solution to challenges in maintaining access and learning in communities that have hosted NGO-initiated CBE. Primary Research Questions We have four primary research questions, as follows: 1. Do access or learning suffer from switching to the sustainability model rather than continuing NGO administration? We are interested to know whether switching from NGO administration to the sustainability model results in any substantial losses in terms of access and learning. Some degree of loss may be tolerable, to the extent that there are other compensating benefits in terms of institutionalizing access to primary education for the long term, reducing costs, or helping to boost government legitimacy. 2. Does the sustainability model substantially improve stakeholders\u2019 confidence in institutionalizing access to primary education into the future? As discussed above, while the access and learning may suffer to some degree from switching to the sustainability model, this would be acceptable if the sustainability model helps to institutionalize access to primary education into the future. Thus, we want to measure the extent to which the sustainability model promotes a sense that the schools will be sustained into the future as compared to expectations formed under NGO administration. Indeed, the precariousness of NGO-initiated CBE classes under status quo arrangements, as discovered by Burde, Middleton, and Samii (2015), was the primary motivation for this study. 3. Does the sustainability model promote local or national government legitimacy relative to the legitimacy effects under NGO administration? In previous work, Burde, Middleton, and Samii (2018) document that NGO administered CBE has the effect of increasing trust of participating communities in NGOs, community institutions, and national government. The latter two points are of special interest here. Burde, Middleton, and Samii (2016) documented that the strongest effect was for trust of NGOs, reflecting, it would seem, people\u2019s appreciation of the NGOs role in significantly improving access to primary education. Here, we are interested to see if the sustainability model induces: i) an even higher level of trust in community institutions and national government as compared to NGO administered CBE and ii) a transfer of such sentiments of trust to the national government, given that under the sustainability model the national government is jointly responsible for the oversight of the CBE system. Of course, these effects likely depend on whether the quality of access and learning meets the standards set by NGOs. 4. Can the sustainability model operate at costs that are substantially less than NGO administration? Finally, the MOE and Citizen\u2019s Charter Initiative have indicated that they cannot sustain the gains from NGO-administered CBE if doing so requires spending the same amount that NGOs spend per child. Burde, Middleton, and Samii (2016) estimated the annual operating cost under NGO administration to be approximately $150 per eligible child. (Note that from Phase I we estimated that about 50% of eligible children took up the opportunity to attend CBE, with another 30% attending other government schools and 20% not attending either. Then, $150 per eligible child implies about $150/0.50 = $300 per child attending CBE. Estimating costs per eligible child is generally preferable, because it keeps the denominator fixed. See Dhaliwal, Duflo, Glennerster, and Tulloch, 2012, for a relevant discussion.) In this study, we assess costs under the sustainability model to compare. Secondary Research Questions We also have secondary research questions that pertain to moderator effects and causal mechanisms. 1. Does the sustainability model generate effects that are biased against girls or particular ethnic groups relative to the NGO benchmark? Even if we were to find that the sustainability model performed well by the standards set under the primary research questions, it would be important to know whether effects differ by important social categories. For reasons of vulnerability, under-representation, and political sensitivity, we focus on whether effects are moderated by gender or ethnicity. 2. Do the access/learning, sustainability, or legitimacy effects depend on the ways that community institutions are activated under the sustainability model relative to NGO administration? The sustainability model is based on a principle of joint responsibility between the community and national government institutions. As part of the implementation, communities assigned to operate through the sustainability model received management capacity training. The question is whether this training was adequate and whether the transfer of authority to community institutions inspired greater community engagement in the administration of the schools. We will look at whether indicators of management quality and community engagement plausibly mediate the access/learning, sustainability, or legitimacy effects. These indicators include whether sustainability model communities differ from NGO administration communities in the amount and manner of funding for classes, levels of community satisfaction and engagement, or teacher motivation and performance. We will also conduct an analysis that examines how performance under the sustainability model varies with levels of pre-training administrative capacity. We assessed such administrative capacity prior to the launching the training for the sustainability model intervention. A descriptive analysis of the results of the administrative capacity assessment is given in Burde, Middleton, and Samii (2017). For the current study, if the training were adequate, we should find that our measure of pre-existing administrative capacity does not have a substantial moderating effect. We will also examine whether the \u201ccommunity engagement\u201d treatment variation introduced in Phase I moderates the effectiveness of the sustainability model relative to the NGO benchmark. 3. Does sustainability improve under enhanced variations of the NGO-administered CBE class, in particular, enhancements focusing on teacher recruitment and community engagement? During the Phase I period, communities were randomly assigned to receive enhancements focused on teacher recruitment and community engagement. The teacher recruitment enhancement constrained the NGO to recruit teachers who had educational qualifications that would allow them to be hired into the MOE system. The status quo was that NGOs would recruit teachers who had requisite literacy and numeracy and that were well integrated in the village, but otherwise may not have had adequate formal education to qualify for being hired by the MOE. The community engagement enhancement used Qur\u2019anic messaging, adult reading groups, and a community library to try to increase parents\u2019 engagement with their children\u2019s learning. Communities were randomly assigned to received either one or both of these enhancements. Our interest is to see whether these enhancements then translate into better sustainability outcomes."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "Research Design Treatment Assignment The design of ALSE Phase II analysis builds on the randomization done prior to ALSE Phase I. In 2014, candidate villages were randomly assigned to treatment conditions using a restricted randomization, whereby a treatment assignment profile was randomly selected from the set of treatment assignment profiles that satisfied a covariate balance criterion. The details of this assignment procedure are given in the technical appendix of the ALSE Phase I endline report (Burde, Middleton, and Samii 2016). At that time, communities were randomly assigned to one of two different intervention conditions that would not be implemented until Phase II. The conditions were either the \u201csustainability model\u201d treatment condition that involved handing over the village school management responsibility to community institutions at the start of Phase II, or a control condition that involved continued NGO management through the duration of Phase II. The teacher recruitment and community engagement enhancements were similarly randomly assigned, and these were done in a way that perfectly cross-cut each other and the sustainability model assignment. As such, the overall design is a three-way full factorial design. Table 1 (see attached pre-analysis plan) shows the distribution of communities over the treatment conditions. Data Collection Our outcome data come from face-to-face surveys of village heads and samples of household heads in the study villages as well as literacy and numeracy learning assessments conducted with children from the sampled households. Sample sizes with respect to villages, households, and children appear in Table 1. The surveys were conducted between October and December 2017 toward the end or just after the conclusion of an academic year during which either the sustainability model or extended NGO administration were in effect. D3 Systems/ACSOR managed the enumeration teams that conducted the face-to-face interviews. They were trained on our data collection instruments and procedures. Their work was subject to independent monitoring and audits in randomly selected villages by teams of ALSE project associates. The respondent sampling procedure was developed to account for the fact that written registers of households were not available, and so household enumeration and selection had to occur in the field. To select respondents, first village heads were identified in each village and the enumeration teams obtained permission to conduct the survey. The village heads were also interviewed. Then, households were enumerated by having enumeration team members start at the central mosque or equivalent and radiate outward, enumerating and listing domiciles until they enumerated 70 households. Then, every other household on the list was selected for interview for a target of 35 households. Multiple attempts were made to contact households if no one was present at the first attempt. If a selected household refused or had no one present after these multiple attempts, this would be documented and the next household on the list would be selected as a replacement. Heads of household or the most senior person available was chosen for an interview in the selected household. In addition, the survey team collected data on rosters of other household members and all children. Children aged 6-13 were also given the verbal and mathematical learning assessments. Finally, the survey team interviewed the teacher in each of the village schools. The household response rate for the survey (using the AAPOR Response Rate 3 criterion) was 95.1%; for children on the learning assessments it was 78.4%; for community leaders it was 98.3%; for teachers it was 98.6%. For more details and discussion of deviations from sampling protocol, see Frank (2018). Outcome Variables The survey gathered data on outcome variables that we classify into 12 themes. The first five themes are our main outcomes of interest: (i) access and attendance (ii) learning, (iii) sustainability, (iv) civic engagement and village institution legitimacy (v) national government legitimacy The next seven themes track \u201cmechanism\u201d outcomes that we intend to use to understand any differences between the treatments: (vi) barriers to school access (vii) the amount spent per eligible student (viii) ways that funds are applied in communities (ix) community engagement with managing education (x) community satisfaction with education services (xi) teacher motivation, and (xii) teacher performance. Table 2, panels 1-12 (see attached pre-analysis plan), display the indicators measured for each of these themes, the data source, the type of variable created, and then the nature of the hypotheses to be tested on each. (Our strategies for hypothesis testing are described below.) Moderator Variables We also have data on a set of moderator variables that we plan to use in assessing conditions that contribute to the functioning of the sustainability model. In some cases what interests us are moderator effects for the attendance (Table 2 - Panel 1) and learning outcomes (that is, verbal learning assessments, math learning assessments, and school attendance, as shown in Table 2 - Panels 1 and 2), and in other cases for sustainability outcomes (as shown in Table 2 - Panel 3). The relevant moderator variables and effects of interest include the following: (i) Capacity of the administrating organizations\u2019 (NGO vs community institutions) moderator effect on attendance, learning, and sustainability, (ii) Teacher qualifications effect on attendance, learning, and sustainability, (iii) Levels of community engagement moderator effect on attendance, learning, and sustainability, (iv) The quality of NGO services prior to handover moderator effect on attendance, learning, and sustainability, (v) Various barriers to accessing school among households moderator effect on attendance, learning, and sustainability, (vi) Village population size moderator effect on attendance, learning and sustainability; (vii) HH economic conditions, which define both status and also incentives for educational attainment, moderator effect on attendance, learning and sustainability, (viii) Gender moderator effect on attendance and learning, (ix) Children\u2019s ages moderator effect on attendance and learning, and (x) Social institutions and ethnicity moderator effect on attendance, learning, and sustainability. Table 3 (see attached pre-analysis plan) lists the indicators associated with these moderators along with details on how they will be used. The equivalency hypotheses are motivated by a desire to check whether the sustainability model operates in a way that unintentionally disadvantages certain types of households relative to NGO administration. For example, for gender, we want to be sure that under the community administration of the sustainability model that there is no disadvantage for girls. Another example is community management capacity: here, we want to ensure that the training that was done prior to handover to community institutions was adequate so as to ensure that all communities were equally ready to take on the school management responsibilities. (Of course, had there been no such training, we would pose a non-equivalency hypothesis, because one would presume that community\u2019s ability to manage the school would be affected by such capacities.) The non-equivalency hypotheses are based on factors that one would expect to contribute to the performance of community institutions---for example, the intervention that sought to ensure teachers with relevant qualifications were hired so as to facilitate the sustainabilty of the class. \u2003 Estimation and Inference In the following section we discuss estimation and inference for both the equivalency and non-equivalency hypothesis that are indicated in Table 2, adjustments for multiple comparisons, and estimation and inference for moderator effects. For discussion of estimating average treatment effects, inference for average treatment effects, multiple comparisions for average treatment effects, and moderator effects, please refer to the attched pre-analysis plan. Application of methods to research questions Primary Research Questions 1. Do access or learning suffer from switching to the sustainability model rather than continuing NGO administration? This will be assessed through the non-inferiority analysis of access/attendance and learning assessment outcomes. Reasons for differences or similarities in access/attendance or learning will be examined through non-inferiority and treatment effects analysis (as indicated in Table 2) for the community engagement in managing education, parental involvement, community satisfaction with education services, teacher motivation, and teacher performance outcomes. 2. Does the sustainability model substantially improve stakeholders\u2019 confidence in institutionalizing access to primary education into the future? This will be assessed through our estimates and inference for treatment effects on the sustainability outcomes. 3. Does the sustainability model promote local or national government legitimacy relative to the legitimacy effects under NGO administration? This will be assessed through our estimates and inference for treatment effects on the civic engagement and village institution legitimacy and the national government legitimacy outcomes. 4. Can the sustainability model operate at costs that are substantially less than NGO administration? This will be assessed through the costing exercise listed as the \u201camount spent per student\u201d outcome theme (Table 1 - Panel 7) as well as treatment effects for the ways that funds are applied in communities outcome theme. Secondary Research Questions 1. Does the sustainability model generate effects that are biased against girls or particular ethnic groups relative to the NGO benchmark? This will be assessed through our moderator effects analysis with the gender and social institutions moderator themes. 2. Do the access/learning, sustainability, or legitimacy effects depend on the ways that community institutions are activated under the sustainability model relative to NGO administration? This will be assessed through the moderator effects analysis with the administering organization capacity, community engagement, and the quality of services under NGO administration moderator themes. 3. Does sustainability improve under enhanced variations of the NGO-administered CBE class, in particular, enhancements focusing on teacher recruitment and community engagement? This will be assessed through the moderator effects analysis with both the moderator effect estimated from the first indicator in the community engagement moderator theme as well as the teacher qualifications moderator theme. 4. Does access/learning, sustainability, or legitimacy depend on other incentives or constraints that communities face for education? This will be assessed through moderator effects analysis with barriers to education, village demographics, access to economic opportunities, and age of children moderator themes."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Afghanistan"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "4620 households in 102 clusters of villages"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "NYU IRB-FY2016-733"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "5/10/16"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q27": {"extra": [], "value": "There are two arms, one is an arm that involves the \u201csustainability model\u201d, and this is implemented jointly by the research team and the Afghan Ministry of Education, and other other \u201cNGO administration\u201d is administered by the NGOs CARE and CRS."}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q32": {"extra": [], "value": "O22, I25"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design", "Field Experiments", "Mixed Method", "Statistics"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Conflict and Violence", "Development"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e385fa9fa39b7017b1dc012", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/sa5b7/providers/osfstorage/5e385fa9fa39b7017b1dc012", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/sa5b7/providers/osfstorage/5e385fa9fa39b7017b1dc012", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/sa5b7/providers/osfstorage/5e385fa9fa39b7017b1dc012?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/sa5b7/providers/osfstorage/5e385fa9fa39b7017b1dc012"}, "attributes": {"etag": "206415af54af9e4965ce892a03609ecb0fec05161669d6f10c0ead8d33030be3", "kind": "file", "name": "20180817AA_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e385fa9fa39b7017b1dc012", "size": 2706578, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "acfa4fa12427dfaa7ebbd8ba66d75fb7", "sha256": "50c29c07d442a095f507ece8cef51f445cc380ea659c4e8fe9704de39909b34a"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 2706578, "modified": "2020-02-03T18:00:09.191778+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "sa5b7", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20180817AA_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T18:00:09+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "sa5b7", "sha256": "50c29c07d442a095f507ece8cef51f445cc380ea659c4e8fe9704de39909b34a", "viewUrl": "/project/2h8x9/files/osfstorage/5e385fad57427b01630c5851/", "selectedFileName": "20180817AA_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20180817AA_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Letting Communities Take Charge: A Randomized Controlled Trial on Sustaining Schools in Afghanistan", "q2": "Dana Burde | Joel Middleton | Cyrus Samii", "q3": "20180817AA", "q4": "08/17/2018 - 21:45", "q5": "Research Assistance: Matthew Lisiecki, Otgonjargal Okhidoi, Mohammad Amin Saddiqi, Neila Sage", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to researcher analysis of outcome data", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "12/1/16", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "This pre-analysis plan lays out the objectives for the analysis of Phase II Endline data from the Assessment of Learning and Social Effects of Community Based Education (ALSE) study in Afghanistan. For general background on the ALSE project, refer to previous reports, available at www.alseproject.com. ALSE Phase II tests a strategy for sustaining access and learning gains from community-based education (CBE) classes after the withdrawal of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) who were responsible for setting up the classes. CBE classes are often started by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and in Afghanistan most CBE classes are administered by NGOs. However, NGOs operate on program cycles that are dictated, largely, by funding cycles. As such, it is a near inevitability that NGO administration of a CBE class will have to come to an end at some point. When that happens, the question arises as to how one might sustain access to education for the children attending CBE classes. Typically, the NGO \u201chands over\u201d this responsibility to the national government\u2019s Ministry of Education (MOE), which has a mandate to make access to primary education universal. Past research shows, however, that such handover can be problematic. In a 2014 field survey, the ALSE team examined data from 224 villages in Ghor and Herat provinces (Burde, Middleton, and Samii 2015). All of these villages had been part of a cycle of NGO-administered CBE through to 2011. As of 2014, 3 years after handover, in only 42 of those villages did the MOE sustain the CBE class, while in 18 others a new cycle of NGO-administered CBE had begun. The vast majority of cases have reverted to a situation of no within-village schooling. In about half of the cases where village classes were not sustained, the MOE or NGOs indicated that security issues prevented continuation of the classes in the villages. Also, the MOE and NGOs indicated that in some cases, children who had access to the CBE classes previously could now attend MOE administered \u201chub schools\u201d that were, ostensibly, nearby. However, previous research undertaken by Burde and Linden (2013) showed that attendance drops even at relatively short distances, particularly for girls. And consistent with those results, the ALSE team\u2019s data collection in 114 villages that were deemed free of any security problems indicated very clearly that when CBE classes ceased to function within the village, attendance dropped too. These results indicate serious sustainability problems for CBE. This study examines a strategy for addressing this sustainability challenge. Intervention The ALSE team worked with the MOE, other government actors, and implementing NGOs to develop a \u201csustainability model\u201d that may increase the chances that NGO-initiated CBE classes could continue to function within the village under overall MOE administration and co-management of village-level community institutions after the departure of NGOs. This sustainability model is the intervention tested in ALSE Phase II. The sustainability model takes advantage of the decentralized community governance structure created as part of Afghanistan\u2019s National Solidarity Program (NSP), evaluated by Beath, Christia, and Enikolopov (2013). The NSP organized village-level community development councils, consisting of a small number of appointed and elected villagers. Under NSP, the community development councils were tasked with devising village development plans that would be used to guide the application of village block grants. These community development councils have remained active through to the present (see the ALSE Phase II Baseline report for relevant findings). The ALSE \u201csustainability model\u201d charges an education-focused subcommittee of the village community development councils to assume administrative responsibility of the CBE class after the NGO\u2019s departure. This administrative responsibility included recruiting, paying, and monitoring the teacher, facilitation of acquisition of space, school supplies, and other material needs, and attending to other problems that arose in relation to the class. ALSE provided management capacity training to the community development councils and subcommittee to take on these tasks. With the village-level community development councils members capacitated to manage the CBE class, all that is needed will be a line of financing to the community development councils to cover teacher salaries and material costs, as well as occasional central oversight. ALSE provided financial support, which included teacher salary and classroom supplies. The distribution of teacher salaries and central oversight were conducted jointly by ALSE and district MOE offices. If successful, the model is intended to be taken up fully by the MOE. The model accords with the Citizen\u2019s Charter Initiative, undertaken at the level of the Afghan Presidency, and which proposes to use the NSP institutional infrastructure to improve basic service delivery. The primary goal for our analysis is to assess whether the sustainability model might be deemed successful in making it highly likely that classes will continue (sustainability effects), while achieving attendance and learning outcomes at a level that meets a benchmark set by NGOs (access and learning effects). This assessment will be based primarily on sustainability, access, and learning effects. It will also explore gender- and social institution-related (e.g., ethnicity-related) moderator effects. Finally, assessments will be drawn on whether or/and to what extent this sustainability model exudes \u201cadded value\u201d in terms of effects on local and national government legitimacy (governance effects). A secondary motivation for the analysis is to assess mechanisms that contribute to effects that we observe. In addition to being assigned to the community management (that is, village-level institutions\u2019 management) versus extended NGO management treatment conditions, communities have also been randomly assigned to receive two types of enhancements to the ways in which the CBE program was implemented during Phase I. This included a \u201cteacher recruitment\u201d enhancement. For this enhancement, the treatment condition was that teachers were recruited using a MOE requirement of education credentials for teachers. The control condition was the standard recruitment practice of the implementing NGOs, which did not require teachers to possess the MOE-required educational credentials. The rationale for this enhancement was to see if hiring such \u201cqualified\u201d teachers would help sustainability by making it easier for the MoE to take over management responsibility for the school. An assessment of the effects of this teacher recruitment treatment on Phase I attendance and learning outcomes is given in Burde, Middleton, and Samii (2016). That study found that requiring teachers to meet the MOE\u2019s education credentials had a modestly positive effect on attendance (0.050 percentage points, p = 0.072) and learning (0.097sd, p = 0.058). That said, the main interest with this variation was to improve sustainability, which is the focus of the current study. The second enhancement was a \u201ccommunity engagement\u201d enhancement. In the treatment condition, communities were given placards with Qur\u2019anic messages about education and an adult reading program was established. Both of these programs were intended to increase parents\u2019 enthusiasm for education generally and also to contribute to their motivation and capacity to help their children learn. The control condition was the NGOs\u2019 default programming, which did not include such extensive efforts to engage parents. The rationale for this enhancement was that it could improve children\u2019s learning by creating a more supportive environment. It could also contribute to communities\u2019 willingness to make efforts needed to promote sustainability. Burde, Middleton, and Samii (2016) found that this variation had negligible effects on attendance (0.002, p = 0.475) and learning (-0.060sd, p = 0.862). The current study will assess whether this variation contributes to sustainability.", "q16": "Research Questions We aim to inform a discussion of the merits of a sustainability model that involves local governance and community institutions as a way to sustain gains from NGO-initiated CBE. We do not propose to establish standards at this time by which we will definitely declare the model a \u201csuccess\u201d or \u201cfailure.\u201d Rather, we propose that the evidence be used in a more deliberative process to determine whether the sustainability model offers a reasonable solution to challenges in maintaining access and learning in communities that have hosted NGO-initiated CBE. Primary Research Questions We have four primary research questions, as follows: 1. Do access or learning suffer from switching to the sustainability model rather than continuing NGO administration? We are interested to know whether switching from NGO administration to the sustainability model results in any substantial losses in terms of access and learning. Some degree of loss may be tolerable, to the extent that there are other compensating benefits in terms of institutionalizing access to primary education for the long term, reducing costs, or helping to boost government legitimacy. 2. Does the sustainability model substantially improve stakeholders\u2019 confidence in institutionalizing access to primary education into the future? As discussed above, while the access and learning may suffer to some degree from switching to the sustainability model, this would be acceptable if the sustainability model helps to institutionalize access to primary education into the future. Thus, we want to measure the extent to which the sustainability model promotes a sense that the schools will be sustained into the future as compared to expectations formed under NGO administration. Indeed, the precariousness of NGO-initiated CBE classes under status quo arrangements, as discovered by Burde, Middleton, and Samii (2015), was the primary motivation for this study. 3. Does the sustainability model promote local or national government legitimacy relative to the legitimacy effects under NGO administration? In previous work, Burde, Middleton, and Samii (2018) document that NGO administered CBE has the effect of increasing trust of participating communities in NGOs, community institutions, and national government. The latter two points are of special interest here. Burde, Middleton, and Samii (2016) documented that the strongest effect was for trust of NGOs, reflecting, it would seem, people\u2019s appreciation of the NGOs role in significantly improving access to primary education. Here, we are interested to see if the sustainability model induces: i) an even higher level of trust in community institutions and national government as compared to NGO administered CBE and ii) a transfer of such sentiments of trust to the national government, given that under the sustainability model the national government is jointly responsible for the oversight of the CBE system. Of course, these effects likely depend on whether the quality of access and learning meets the standards set by NGOs. 4. Can the sustainability model operate at costs that are substantially less than NGO administration? Finally, the MOE and Citizen\u2019s Charter Initiative have indicated that they cannot sustain the gains from NGO-administered CBE if doing so requires spending the same amount that NGOs spend per child. Burde, Middleton, and Samii (2016) estimated the annual operating cost under NGO administration to be approximately $150 per eligible child. (Note that from Phase I we estimated that about 50% of eligible children took up the opportunity to attend CBE, with another 30% attending other government schools and 20% not attending either. Then, $150 per eligible child implies about $150/0.50 = $300 per child attending CBE. Estimating costs per eligible child is generally preferable, because it keeps the denominator fixed. See Dhaliwal, Duflo, Glennerster, and Tulloch, 2012, for a relevant discussion.) In this study, we assess costs under the sustainability model to compare. Secondary Research Questions We also have secondary research questions that pertain to moderator effects and causal mechanisms. 1. Does the sustainability model generate effects that are biased against girls or particular ethnic groups relative to the NGO benchmark? Even if we were to find that the sustainability model performed well by the standards set under the primary research questions, it would be important to know whether effects differ by important social categories. For reasons of vulnerability, under-representation, and political sensitivity, we focus on whether effects are moderated by gender or ethnicity. 2. Do the access/learning, sustainability, or legitimacy effects depend on the ways that community institutions are activated under the sustainability model relative to NGO administration? The sustainability model is based on a principle of joint responsibility between the community and national government institutions. As part of the implementation, communities assigned to operate through the sustainability model received management capacity training. The question is whether this training was adequate and whether the transfer of authority to community institutions inspired greater community engagement in the administration of the schools. We will look at whether indicators of management quality and community engagement plausibly mediate the access/learning, sustainability, or legitimacy effects. These indicators include whether sustainability model communities differ from NGO administration communities in the amount and manner of funding for classes, levels of community satisfaction and engagement, or teacher motivation and performance. We will also conduct an analysis that examines how performance under the sustainability model varies with levels of pre-training administrative capacity. We assessed such administrative capacity prior to the launching the training for the sustainability model intervention. A descriptive analysis of the results of the administrative capacity assessment is given in Burde, Middleton, and Samii (2017). For the current study, if the training were adequate, we should find that our measure of pre-existing administrative capacity does not have a substantial moderating effect. We will also examine whether the \u201ccommunity engagement\u201d treatment variation introduced in Phase I moderates the effectiveness of the sustainability model relative to the NGO benchmark. 3. Does sustainability improve under enhanced variations of the NGO-administered CBE class, in particular, enhancements focusing on teacher recruitment and community engagement? During the Phase I period, communities were randomly assigned to receive enhancements focused on teacher recruitment and community engagement. The teacher recruitment enhancement constrained the NGO to recruit teachers who had educational qualifications that would allow them to be hired into the MOE system. The status quo was that NGOs would recruit teachers who had requisite literacy and numeracy and that were well integrated in the village, but otherwise may not have had adequate formal education to qualify for being hired by the MOE. The community engagement enhancement used Qur\u2019anic messaging, adult reading groups, and a community library to try to increase parents\u2019 engagement with their children\u2019s learning. Communities were randomly assigned to received either one or both of these enhancements. Our interest is to see whether these enhancements then translate into better sustainability outcomes.", "q17": "Research Design Treatment Assignment The design of ALSE Phase II analysis builds on the randomization done prior to ALSE Phase I. In 2014, candidate villages were randomly assigned to treatment conditions using a restricted randomization, whereby a treatment assignment profile was randomly selected from the set of treatment assignment profiles that satisfied a covariate balance criterion. The details of this assignment procedure are given in the technical appendix of the ALSE Phase I endline report (Burde, Middleton, and Samii 2016). At that time, communities were randomly assigned to one of two different intervention conditions that would not be implemented until Phase II. The conditions were either the \u201csustainability model\u201d treatment condition that involved handing over the village school management responsibility to community institutions at the start of Phase II, or a control condition that involved continued NGO management through the duration of Phase II. The teacher recruitment and community engagement enhancements were similarly randomly assigned, and these were done in a way that perfectly cross-cut each other and the sustainability model assignment. As such, the overall design is a three-way full factorial design. Table 1 (see attached pre-analysis plan) shows the distribution of communities over the treatment conditions. Data Collection Our outcome data come from face-to-face surveys of village heads and samples of household heads in the study villages as well as literacy and numeracy learning assessments conducted with children from the sampled households. Sample sizes with respect to villages, households, and children appear in Table 1. The surveys were conducted between October and December 2017 toward the end or just after the conclusion of an academic year during which either the sustainability model or extended NGO administration were in effect. D3 Systems/ACSOR managed the enumeration teams that conducted the face-to-face interviews. They were trained on our data collection instruments and procedures. Their work was subject to independent monitoring and audits in randomly selected villages by teams of ALSE project associates. The respondent sampling procedure was developed to account for the fact that written registers of households were not available, and so household enumeration and selection had to occur in the field. To select respondents, first village heads were identified in each village and the enumeration teams obtained permission to conduct the survey. The village heads were also interviewed. Then, households were enumerated by having enumeration team members start at the central mosque or equivalent and radiate outward, enumerating and listing domiciles until they enumerated 70 households. Then, every other household on the list was selected for interview for a target of 35 households. Multiple attempts were made to contact households if no one was present at the first attempt. If a selected household refused or had no one present after these multiple attempts, this would be documented and the next household on the list would be selected as a replacement. Heads of household or the most senior person available was chosen for an interview in the selected household. In addition, the survey team collected data on rosters of other household members and all children. Children aged 6-13 were also given the verbal and mathematical learning assessments. Finally, the survey team interviewed the teacher in each of the village schools. The household response rate for the survey (using the AAPOR Response Rate 3 criterion) was 95.1%; for children on the learning assessments it was 78.4%; for community leaders it was 98.3%; for teachers it was 98.6%. For more details and discussion of deviations from sampling protocol, see Frank (2018). Outcome Variables The survey gathered data on outcome variables that we classify into 12 themes. The first five themes are our main outcomes of interest: (i) access and attendance (ii) learning, (iii) sustainability, (iv) civic engagement and village institution legitimacy (v) national government legitimacy The next seven themes track \u201cmechanism\u201d outcomes that we intend to use to understand any differences between the treatments: (vi) barriers to school access (vii) the amount spent per eligible student (viii) ways that funds are applied in communities (ix) community engagement with managing education (x) community satisfaction with education services (xi) teacher motivation, and (xii) teacher performance. Table 2, panels 1-12 (see attached pre-analysis plan), display the indicators measured for each of these themes, the data source, the type of variable created, and then the nature of the hypotheses to be tested on each. (Our strategies for hypothesis testing are described below.) Moderator Variables We also have data on a set of moderator variables that we plan to use in assessing conditions that contribute to the functioning of the sustainability model. In some cases what interests us are moderator effects for the attendance (Table 2 - Panel 1) and learning outcomes (that is, verbal learning assessments, math learning assessments, and school attendance, as shown in Table 2 - Panels 1 and 2), and in other cases for sustainability outcomes (as shown in Table 2 - Panel 3). The relevant moderator variables and effects of interest include the following: (i) Capacity of the administrating organizations\u2019 (NGO vs community institutions) moderator effect on attendance, learning, and sustainability, (ii) Teacher qualifications effect on attendance, learning, and sustainability, (iii) Levels of community engagement moderator effect on attendance, learning, and sustainability, (iv) The quality of NGO services prior to handover moderator effect on attendance, learning, and sustainability, (v) Various barriers to accessing school among households moderator effect on attendance, learning, and sustainability, (vi) Village population size moderator effect on attendance, learning and sustainability; (vii) HH economic conditions, which define both status and also incentives for educational attainment, moderator effect on attendance, learning and sustainability, (viii) Gender moderator effect on attendance and learning, (ix) Children\u2019s ages moderator effect on attendance and learning, and (x) Social institutions and ethnicity moderator effect on attendance, learning, and sustainability. Table 3 (see attached pre-analysis plan) lists the indicators associated with these moderators along with details on how they will be used. The equivalency hypotheses are motivated by a desire to check whether the sustainability model operates in a way that unintentionally disadvantages certain types of households relative to NGO administration. For example, for gender, we want to be sure that under the community administration of the sustainability model that there is no disadvantage for girls. Another example is community management capacity: here, we want to ensure that the training that was done prior to handover to community institutions was adequate so as to ensure that all communities were equally ready to take on the school management responsibilities. (Of course, had there been no such training, we would pose a non-equivalency hypothesis, because one would presume that community\u2019s ability to manage the school would be affected by such capacities.) The non-equivalency hypotheses are based on factors that one would expect to contribute to the performance of community institutions---for example, the intervention that sought to ensure teachers with relevant qualifications were hired so as to facilitate the sustainabilty of the class. \u2003 Estimation and Inference In the following section we discuss estimation and inference for both the equivalency and non-equivalency hypothesis that are indicated in Table 2, adjustments for multiple comparisons, and estimation and inference for moderator effects. For discussion of estimating average treatment effects, inference for average treatment effects, multiple comparisions for average treatment effects, and moderator effects, please refer to the attched pre-analysis plan. Application of methods to research questions Primary Research Questions 1. Do access or learning suffer from switching to the sustainability model rather than continuing NGO administration? This will be assessed through the non-inferiority analysis of access/attendance and learning assessment outcomes. Reasons for differences or similarities in access/attendance or learning will be examined through non-inferiority and treatment effects analysis (as indicated in Table 2) for the community engagement in managing education, parental involvement, community satisfaction with education services, teacher motivation, and teacher performance outcomes. 2. Does the sustainability model substantially improve stakeholders\u2019 confidence in institutionalizing access to primary education into the future? This will be assessed through our estimates and inference for treatment effects on the sustainability outcomes. 3. Does the sustainability model promote local or national government legitimacy relative to the legitimacy effects under NGO administration? This will be assessed through our estimates and inference for treatment effects on the civic engagement and village institution legitimacy and the national government legitimacy outcomes. 4. Can the sustainability model operate at costs that are substantially less than NGO administration? This will be assessed through the costing exercise listed as the \u201camount spent per student\u201d outcome theme (Table 1 - Panel 7) as well as treatment effects for the ways that funds are applied in communities outcome theme. Secondary Research Questions 1. Does the sustainability model generate effects that are biased against girls or particular ethnic groups relative to the NGO benchmark? This will be assessed through our moderator effects analysis with the gender and social institutions moderator themes. 2. Do the access/learning, sustainability, or legitimacy effects depend on the ways that community institutions are activated under the sustainability model relative to NGO administration? This will be assessed through the moderator effects analysis with the administering organization capacity, community engagement, and the quality of services under NGO administration moderator themes. 3. Does sustainability improve under enhanced variations of the NGO-administered CBE class, in particular, enhancements focusing on teacher recruitment and community engagement? This will be assessed through the moderator effects analysis with both the moderator effect estimated from the first indicator in the community engagement moderator theme as well as the teacher qualifications moderator theme. 4. Does access/learning, sustainability, or legitimacy depend on other incentives or constraints that communities face for education? This will be assessed through moderator effects analysis with barriers to education, village demographics, access to economic opportunities, and age of children moderator themes.", "q18":

The current study was designed to identify what effect, if any, allegations about sexual harassing behavior by a candidate influences voter attitudes as well as likelihood to turn out to vote in that election. The study includes a survey experiment in which a randomly assigned group of White American respondents views a treatment condition comprised of a news article detailing allegations and evidence of sexual harassment of women by a hypothetical male candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives.

We hypothesize that the group exposed to the sexual harassment allegation treatment will have more negative attitudes about the candidate in question, and that the effects will vary according to gender and partisanship of the respondent. Women of both parties will be less supportive of the accused candidate when exposed to the sexual harassment condition. Subjects with Democratic Party affiliation will exhibit less supportive attitudes about the candidate when he is coded as a Republican Party candidate, and similarly but to a lesser degree with the candidate as no party affiliation; or coded as a Democrat. We hypothesize turn out to be higher in the sexual harassment allegation treatment group among Democratic women compared with the control and placebo groups. For Republican subjects assigned to the sexual harassment allegation treatment condition, we expect they will be less supportive of the candidate when he is coded to be a Democrat. We hypothesize respondent willingness to turn out to vote to be lower in the sexual harassment allegation treatment group among Republican women compared with the control and placebo group. We also hypothesize the same relationships for outcome measures rating the ideology of the candidate, a feeling thermometer toward the candidate, and trait ratings of the candidate.
