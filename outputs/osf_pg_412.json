Yet, when citizens are evaluating spending behavior and welfare benefits of government spending from different sources, their willingness to sanction and monitor may be driven by more than just a psychological aversion to loss and a desire to recover their taxed private revenue in the form of public goods provision. Accountability is a complex process, and in the presence of other political market failures -- such as repression, poor citizen access to information, or a lack of accountability mechanisms such as competitive elections -- taxation may increase citizens' desire for punishment without increasing observed sanctioning behavior in the real world. In particular, barriers to the citizenry's ability to hold elected officials accountable may diminish the impact of individual-level psychological mechanisms. First, and perhaps most importantly, citizens must act in concert to exercise meaningful political power. Even in developed countries, the well-known coordination problems inherent in collective action often thwart attempts to organize for political change. In the developing world, the collective action problem is magnified by inadequate communications and transportation infrastructure, the high marginal cost of foregoing wages for the poor, and, in some cases, the very real possibility that the government responds to political expression with violence. These problems have the effect of driving down citizens' belief that others will act alongside them should they choose to do so, and makes the collective action dilemma especially problematic. Of course, solving the collective action problem is not by itself sufficient to monitor or punish elected officials. In authoritarian or quasi-authoritarian environments, politicians may have little incentive to respond to any attempts by citizens to hold officials accountable for corruption or incompetence. And in both authoritarian and democratic countries, the state may simply be incapable of instituting the kind of monitoring and punishment regime desired by citizens. For these reasons, citizens across sub-Saharan Africa tend to place extremely low probability on the success of any political action. With such low levels of external efficacy, it is therefore possible that we might observe few attempts to hold politicians more accountable for tax-based expenditures than other forms of expenditures even if taxation places them in a loss frame as the endowment effect suggests. These issues may be magnified for some non-tax revenue sources such as oil, which is opaque and generally has weaker accountability mechanisms than tax-based revenues. As such, any attempt to measure the effect of taxation on accountability must consider not only individual-level psychological mechanisms but also two critical quantities: whether citizens believe that others will act with them, and whether political action, conditional on occurring, will yield the desired effect. There are thus two features of revenue expenditure and accountability beyond purely psychological mechanisms that may govern the frequency of political action to monitor and punish elected officials for spending behavior: %revenue-specific institutions that may make accountability more difficult for some sources than others; especially severe collective action problems facing citizens who wish to monitor or punish elected officials; and high level of pessimism with respect to the probability that an action will be successful if taken. Equally as important, these features may vary with respect to the source of revenue itself. While scholars often distinguish between tax- and non-tax revenues when studying accountability, relatively few studies have attempted to establish whether there are differences across non-tax revenues. Finally, political action does not occur in a vacuum, but in the context of norms and beliefs regarding the appropriate use of government funds. In particular, it is possible that public education campaigns could reduce the effect of revenue source on citizens' willingness to punish, especially if such campaigns stressed the responsibility of governments to spend funds on development and public goods. To remedy this, we conducted lab-in-the-field experiment that follows in broad strokes the Martin (204) design, in which the author utilized laboratory experiments in Uganda to measure the existence of a loss aversion mechanism after citizens pay taxes. In the core games, one Citizen and one Leader play a modified ultimatum game, in which the Leader must allocate a group fund and the Citizen can choose whether to pay to punish this allocation; the source of the group fund is either a tax on the Citizen's ``wages\" or non-earned. We augment this initial design with additional arms designed to test the effect of collective action, uncertainty over whether punishment will occur, the source of the revenue from which the spending is being financed, and the degree of ownership the subject has over the revenue in question."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Our major quantity of interest is the threshold beyond which the Citizen will choose not to punish the Leader. This is the minimum amount that the Leader must transfer back to avoid punishment. Our major hypotheses are as follows: 1. Thresholds will be higher in the tax condition than the non-tax conditions. 2. Thresholds will be lower in the grant condition relative to all other conditions. 3. Among the three oil treatments, thresholds will be lowest in the base condition, followed by the Framing and Ownership conditions. In other words, increasing ownership should yield increasing thresholds. 4. Collective action should allow Citizens to coordinate on the highest possible threshold given their preferences, pushing up the average threshold relative to non-collective action conditions.

Yet, when citizens are evaluating spending behavior and welfare benefits of government spending from different sources, their willingness to sanction and monitor may be driven by more than just a psychological aversion to loss and a desire to recover their taxed private revenue in the form of public goods provision. Accountability is a complex process, and in the presence of other political market failures -- such as repression, poor citizen access to information, or a lack of accountability mechanisms such as competitive elections -- taxation may increase citizens' desire for punishment without increasing observed sanctioning behavior in the real world. In particular, barriers to the citizenry's ability to hold elected officials accountable may diminish the impact of individual-level psychological mechanisms. First, and perhaps most importantly, citizens must act in concert to exercise meaningful political power. Even in developed countries, the well-known coordination problems inherent in collective action often thwart attempts to organize for political change. In the developing world, the collective action problem is magnified by inadequate communications and transportation infrastructure, the high marginal cost of foregoing wages for the poor, and, in some cases, the very real possibility that the government responds to political expression with violence. These problems have the effect of driving down citizens' belief that others will act alongside them should they choose to do so, and makes the collective action dilemma especially problematic. Of course, solving the collective action problem is not by itself sufficient to monitor or punish elected officials. In authoritarian or quasi-authoritarian environments, politicians may have little incentive to respond to any attempts by citizens to hold officials accountable for corruption or incompetence. And in both authoritarian and democratic countries, the state may simply be incapable of instituting the kind of monitoring and punishment regime desired by citizens. For these reasons, citizens across sub-Saharan Africa tend to place extremely low probability on the success of any political action. With such low levels of external efficacy, it is therefore possible that we might observe few attempts to hold politicians more accountable for tax-based expenditures than other forms of expenditures even if taxation places them in a loss frame as the endowment effect suggests. These issues may be magnified for some non-tax revenue sources such as oil, which is opaque and generally has weaker accountability mechanisms than tax-based revenues. As such, any attempt to measure the effect of taxation on accountability must consider not only individual-level psychological mechanisms but also two critical quantities: whether citizens believe that others will act with them, and whether political action, conditional on occurring, will yield the desired effect. There are thus two features of revenue expenditure and accountability beyond purely psychological mechanisms that may govern the frequency of political action to monitor and punish elected officials for spending behavior: %revenue-specific institutions that may make accountability more difficult for some sources than others; especially severe collective action problems facing citizens who wish to monitor or punish elected officials; and high level of pessimism with respect to the probability that an action will be successful if taken. Equally as important, these features may vary with respect to the source of revenue itself. While scholars often distinguish between tax- and non-tax revenues when studying accountability, relatively few studies have attempted to establish whether there are differences across non-tax revenues. Finally, political action does not occur in a vacuum, but in the context of norms and beliefs regarding the appropriate use of government funds. In particular, it is possible that public education campaigns could reduce the effect of revenue source on citizens' willingness to punish, especially if such campaigns stressed the responsibility of governments to spend funds on development and public goods. To remedy this, we conducted lab-in-the-field experiment that follows in broad strokes the Martin (204) design, in which the author utilized laboratory experiments in Uganda to measure the existence of a loss aversion mechanism after citizens pay taxes. In the core games, one Citizen and one Leader play a modified ultimatum game, in which the Leader must allocate a group fund and the Citizen can choose whether to pay to punish this allocation; the source of the group fund is either a tax on the Citizen's ``wages\" or non-earned. We augment this initial design with additional arms designed to test the effect of collective action, uncertainty over whether punishment will occur, the source of the revenue from which the spending is being financed, and the degree of ownership the subject has over the revenue in question.", "q16": "Our major quantity of interest is the threshold beyond which the Citizen will choose not to punish the Leader. This is the minimum amount that the Leader must transfer back to avoid punishment. Our major hypotheses are as follows: 1. Thresholds will be higher in the tax condition than the non-tax conditions. 2. Thresholds will be lower in the grant condition relative to all other conditions. 3. Among the three oil treatments, thresholds will be lowest in the base condition, followed by the Framing and Ownership conditions. In other words, increasing ownership should yield increasing thresholds. 4. Collective action should allow Citizens to coordinate on the highest possible threshold given their preferences, pushing up the average threshold relative to non-collective action conditions. We expect heterogeneous treatment effects by experience paying taxes, gender, and perceptions of corruption. Women, those with experience paying taxes, and those with high perceptions of corruption should all be more likely to choose higher thresholds under some conditions. In particular, those with more experience paying taxes should have higher thresholds in the taxation condition than those with less experience.", "q17": "These hypotheses will be tested using

"Previous research has looked at how client deservingness influences rule bending (Scott and Pandey 2000), but the previous research looked at the influence of redtape on mitigating rule bending. In this study, we look at whether cueing the deservingness of a student influences rule bending and whether the sector of the organization (University or nonprofit foundation) influences rule bending. Our experimental study examines how sector and deservingness of clients influences rule following in public services relevant to students.

Question order effects are well established in survey methodology research. This experiment investigates the specific case of asking the same substantive question about confidence in vote counting, but varying the geographic scope referenced in the question. In one condition, voters are asked about \u201cyour vote\u201d, then \u201cvotes in your county or city\u201d, then \u201cvotes in your \u201d, and finally \u201cvotes nationwide\u201d. In the other condition, this order is reversed: nationwide, state, county or city, and finally \u201cyour vote\u201d. Beginning the sequence with \u201cyour vote\u201d versus \u201cvotes nationwide\u201d may call to mind different considerations about the voting process that may persist through the progression of geographic scope and thereby elicit different responses about confidence for each geographic scope. The experiment replicates past unpublished studies using the same design in prior iterations of the CCES (SKL & RCO in 2016). These prior iterations found significant differences from the question order: beginning the battery of ballot confidence questions with \u201cvotes nationwide\u201d causes lower reported confidence at each geographic scope than beginning the battery with \u201cyour vote\u201d.

Question order effects are well established in survey methodology research. This experiment investigates the specific case of asking the same substantive question about confidence in vote counting, but varying the geographic scope referenced in the question. In one condition, voters are asked about \u201cyour vote\u201d, then \u201cvotes in your county or city\u201d, then \u201cvotes in your \u201d, and finally \u201cvotes nationwide\u201d. In the other condition, this order is reversed: nationwide, state, county or city, and finally \u201cyour vote\u201d. Beginning the sequence with \u201cyour vote\u201d versus \u201cvotes nationwide\u201d may call to mind different considerations about the voting process that may persist through the progression of geographic scope and thereby elicit different responses about confidence for each geographic scope. The experiment replicates past unpublished studies using the same design in prior iterations of the CCES (SKL & RCO in 2016). These prior iterations found significant differences from the question order: beginning the battery of ballot confidence questions with \u201cvotes nationwide\u201d causes lower reported confidence at each geographic scope than beginning the battery with \u201cyour vote\u201d.
