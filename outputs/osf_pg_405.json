The program provides information on the naturalization process as well as naturalization application assistance through the Office for New Americans' network of Opportunity Centers (OCs) located around New York. During the fi\frst year of the NaturalizeNY program, two pilot programs were tested to better understand the barriers of naturalization among the low-income immigrant population in New York. The pilot programs use monetary encouragements and behavioral nudges in an attempt to increase the naturalization rates among low-income immigrants. Eligible immigrants could register for the NaturalizeNY program by completing a registration tool that captures their basic demographic and immigration information. Eligible applicants were divided into two groups based on whether or not they appeared to qualify for the federal fee waiver program for naturalization. If a participant's household income is below 150% of the FPL or they receive MTBs, then the registration system informs them that they potentially qualify for a fee waiver from the federal government. Among this group, behavioral nudges such as letters, SMS, and emails were randomly assigned. \u000f If a participant's household income is between 150% and 300% of the FPL and they do not receive MTBs, then the registration enters them into a lottery for a chance to receive a voucher that will pay the fee for their naturalization application.

There was also a control group that did not receive any additional behavioral encouragements beyond an initial notification that they might be eligible for a fee waiver after completing the program registration.

In theory, such programming could capture audience attention through its conflictual, yet inclusive, framing, thereby stimulating engagement. Further, discussion programs might combat polarization, by fostering understanding of alternate viewpoints and demonstrating that political conflicts can be addressed through dialogue. Despite the growing popularity of such programs, evidence about their impact is lacking; evaluations are typically limited to measures of audience size and the public's recognition of programming. This project will seek to identify the impact of two discussion-based programs in Niger--one centered on call-ins and the other on in-studio discussions by experts--through a field experiment utilizing a modified symmetric encouragement design, in which a subset of subjects is regularly incentivized to listen to a call-in program, another subset to an in-studio discussion program broadcast at the same time, and a third group is assigned to a control condition.

In theory, such programming could capture audience attention through its conflictual, yet inclusive, framing, thereby stimulating engagement. Further, discussion programs might combat polarization, by fostering understanding of alternate viewpoints and demonstrating that political conflicts can be addressed through dialogue. Despite the growing popularity of such programs, evidence about their impact is lacking; evaluations are typically limited to measures of audience size and the public's recognition of programming. This project will seek to identify the impact of two discussion-based programs in Niger--one centered on call-ins and the other on in-studio discussions by experts--through a field experiment utilizing a modified symmetric encouragement design, in which a subset of subjects is regularly incentivized to listen to a call-in program, another subset to an in-studio discussion program broadcast at the same time, and a third group is assigned to a control condition. Subjects' political knowledge, engagement, perceptions of internal efficacy, support for institutions that foster accountability, attitudes towards out-groups, and attitudinal moderation will be measured at a pre-treatment baseline, and again after a six-week encouragement phase.

The proliferation of conspiracy theories and other misinformation about health, medicine, and science have therefore created a significant challenge for public health officials. These theories often fill the void created by a lack of public understanding of a scientific or health issue and often persist and even gain credibility despite clear evidence to the contrary as they circulate in public discourse and through social networks. For instance, many people in Brazil --- the center of the current Zika epidemic --- seemingly do not understand the causes of the disease, the reasons for its spread, or the consequences it can have for people\u2019s health. Rumors and unsupported reports have blamed the mosquito-borne disease and the resulting surge in microcephaly on genetically modified mosquitoes, on larvicides, and on prenatal vaccines. The spread of these conspiracy theories could threaten public health efforts to prevent Zika by dissuading people from protecting themselves against Zika, undermining efforts to enlist the public\u2019s help in preventing the spread of the disease, and reducing support for responses to the outbreak by public health officials. Public health officials have employed a variety of messaging strategies to inform the public and counter these false beliefs. However, the effectiveness of realistic health messaging interventions addressing misperceptions have only been evaluated in a limited number of cases. How should public health officials respond? In this study, we will conduct a survey experiment with a large sample of Brazilian adults evaluating the effects of three types of public health messaging: a myths and facts approach to correcting misperceptions about Zika (debunking false claims about GMO mosquitos causing Zika and blaming larvicides and the TDAP vaccine for the increased incidence of microcephaly), instructions on how to protect oneself by preventing mosquito breeding in and around one\u2019s home, and information on how Zika is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. We estimate the effects of these messages, which we adapted directly from materials used by public health organizations (http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=11661&Itemid=41735&lang=en http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=33071&Itemid=270&lang=en http://www.who.int/emergencies/zika-virus/articles/rumours/en/), on factual beliefs about Zika, opinions about different public policies that could prevent the spread of the disease, and self-reported intention to take steps to protect oneself from the disease. While each of these approaches could be effective, there are also reasons for concern. In particular, the myths and facts approach could be ineffective or counterproductive. First, the two-sided format used in a myths and facts approach may spur directionally motivated reasoning among people with a general tendency to endorse conspiracy theories or among people who believe in the specific misperceptions we present and refute; for these people, corrections may fail or even cause them to become more confident in their factual beliefs or policy opinions (Nyhan and Reifler 2014; Flynn, Nyhan, and Reifler 2017). Similarly, false information can in some cases produce a so-called continued influence or belief perseverance effect on people\u2019s beliefs and opinions even after being debunked (e.g., Johnson et al. 1994, Thorson 2016). Finally, introducing false information can sometimes increase the familiarity of a false claim and thereby cause it to seem more plausible, especially over time as memory for the truth value of the claims fades (Schwarz et al. 2007, Berinsky 2015, Pluviano et al. N.d.). As a contrast, we test two communication approaches that could be more effective. First, we evaluate the effects of providing accurate information about the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the main carrier of Zika. During times of disease outbreaks, increasing awareness of the disease has been shown to be an effective method of causing behavior changes among susceptible populations that help lower the incidence of disease and prevent outbreaks from escalating (Funk et al. 2009). These effects are not limited to disease outbreaks; spreading awareness of endemic diseases can also lower disease prevalence (Funk, Gilad, and Jansen 2010). The same results may thus be expected when people are exposed to accurate information about Zika. By increasing people\u2019s awareness of their susceptibility to the mosquito-born transmission, this information may help people better understand how Zika is spread, increase support for policies to reduce the risk of transmission by mosquitoes, and encourage people to take actions to reduce their vulnerability to the virus (Champion and Skinner 2008). In addition, providing accurate information about the way Zika is transmitted may be more effective at displacing false beliefs than denying their validity, which can be less effective if the denials do not provide an alternative causal account (Nyhan and Reifler 2015). We also test the effect of a message that instead encourages people to take specific steps to prevent mosquito breeding, a direct form of encouragement that might provide a cue to action for people to engage in protective health behaviors (Champion and Skinner 2008). In addition to increasing awareness of Zika, this type of messaging could help induce a sense of control and self-efficacy. Past studies have demonstrated that likelihood of conspiracy belief increases when people feel a lack of control (Whitson and Galinsky 2008; Sullivan, Landau, and Rothschild 2010). These findings suggest that increasing feelings of control through messaging that provides specific guidance on how to prevent disease spread could help mitigate conspiracy belief.
