Crowdsourcing platforms allow a multitude of stakeholders including policy practitioners, civil society advocates, and ordinary citizens to engage in the policymaking process. Despite crowdsourcing\u2019s obvious appeal as a research and policy tool, there is relatively little existing knowledge of incentives that stimulate \u201cthe crowd\u2019s\u201d willingness to participate. Our experiment is designed to explore the most effective strategies to induce potential knowledge holders to provide information under non-emergency conditions. To this end, we will seek to determine how to entice Members of Parliament in seven African countries to provide information on Chinese-funded development projects in or near their constituency district. Incentives for crowdsourcing Different types of contributors have varying incentives for participating in crowdsourcing initiatives, including monetary or other material rewards, self or issue-interests (calling the police or fire-department could be considered contributing information to a crowdsourcing platform), or to enhance one\u2019s reputation. For example, a study on emergency crowdsourcing during the Haitian earthquake demonstrated that despite their diverse background, knowledge holders were motivated by both monetary and social incentives (Ramchurn et al 2013; Zook et al 2010). Inhabitants of the disaster zone would provide selective representations of local situations in order to facilitate on-the-ground rescue work, and the distant aid agencies could also provide tools and information that are important to emergency response via the crowdsourcing platform. Different actors can also play important roles to incentivize crowdsourcing. Donor partner countries are in a position to present the advantages and opportunities of crowdsourced initiatives and incentivize their partner governments to support, or at least permit crowdsourcing (Bott & Young 2012). In the absence of an emergency, the incentives for crowdsourcing information provision are more complicated to identify. Empirical evidence from studies on the social psychology of crowdsourcing identify three categories of incentives: extrinsic incentives (such as monetary payment or punishments), intrinsic incentives (such as inherent generosity or procrastination), and reputational incentives (such as reciprocity, publicity and praise). Among three types of incentives, the extrinsic incentives are usually considered the most effective, but may crowd out intrinsic motivations. However, there is still evidence regarding the power of intrinsic and reputational incentives in motivating participation in crowdsourcing, and prior research has identified that the combination of all three types of incentives harnesses the maximum amount of engagement in crowdsourcing (Findley et al 2012; Feldman 2005; Tirole 2006; Frey 2001; Kreps 1997). Whether the extrinsic incentive is stronger than the intrinsic incentive depends on the specific circumstances, such as the ambiguity of task and the strength of relevant social norm. The theory of Motivation Crowding Effects also suggest that while the external monetary incentives and punishments generally undermine intrinsic motivation, under identifiable conditions they may also strengthen existing intrinsic motivation. The impact of combining multiple incentives is also supported by the results of several randomized field experiment in development economics (Olken et al 2012; Banerjee et al 2010; Ashraf et al 2011). For example, Olken et al. found that the combination of financial and non-financial incentivizing treatments would increase Indonesian midwives\u2019 effort in the provision of public health service, while the single factor of monetary compensation has no significant impact on their behavior. Crowdsourcing mechanisms Several papers have studied how crowdsourcing incentive structures affect participation. (Brabham 2010; Lakhani et al. 2007; Lietsala & Joutsen 2007). Empirical evidence shows that the type of technology used to elicit crowd feedback can affect the level of intrinsic reward a person gets when participates in a crowdsourcing effort (Ruggiero 2000; Yang et al 2012). All else being equal, crowdsourcing initiatives that are more engaging for participants will be more successful. These findings are consistent with the three categories of incentives. The low transaction costs and far reach of the internet make it an ideal platform for crowdsourcing by strengthening the reputational payoff of content contribution. For instance, users voluntarily provide information to websites \u2013 such as YouTube, Facebook, or blogs \u2013 because they are rewarded with a desired degree of social notoriety. The spread of smartphones further solidifies the internet as the preferred crowdsourcing platform by lowering the barriers for users to contribute information. This reduces procrastination, which is considered an obstacle to intrinsic motivation. Moreover, certain crowdsourcing mechanisms emphasize intrinsic motivations such as enjoyment of social proof and over monetary rewards. A typical example is Lietsala and Joutsen\u2019s research on the production of Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning, the world\u2019s first feature-length film created through crowdsourcing. The survey on 130 community members and moviemakers shows that among all incentives to participation, most people are motivated by the fun of making a movie, while the desire for monetary reward is the least selected answer. Activation energy Given the research result that a crowdsourcing campaign\u2019s incentive structure and technological platform play central roles in eliciting participation, we are interested in distinguishing the mechanisms that provide high motivation for participation. As we consider crowdsourcing to be a type of voluntary, goal-directed behavior, the psychological concept of activation energy is helpful in explaining the motivation of \u201cthe crowd\u201d. Psychologists define activation energy as an initial investment of energy required to start an active behavior. Thus, tasks requiring lower activation energy to start are more likely to be completed (Achor 2011, Csikszentmihalyi 1997). In other words, crowdsourcing mechanism which requires low activation energy would entice more potential knowledge holders to contribute information because the process is easier to complete. For example, Netflix users are much more willingly to rate movies by clicking star rating than writing a review (Nielsen 2006). The effect of ease-of-use on people\u2019s effort to complete a task is supported by various studies on cognitive and social psychology (Davis 1989, Shin 2006, Webster & Hackley 1997). According to Davis, a technology is more actively used when it is easy to use and navigate. Similarly, learning tools designed to facilitate learner\u2019s engagement are expected to increase the degree of understanding and continuation. There is also empirical evidence that facilitating the participation process will encourage people to undertake costly actions (Behavioural Insights Team 2012; Behavioural Insights Team 2013; Kane et al 2004). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted to test the effectiveness of different messages designed for motivating behavioral changes, such as increasing charitable giving or reducing tax fraud. The research results reveal that the process should be made as easy as possible, and the key messages must be easy to identify and understand. For example, people are more likely to pay their tax when a form with information already held is provided, and simple message language is proved to be more persuasive than complex messages. Also, the most incentivizing message is personalized, locally relevant, and framed within the context of a greater good or social norm. Our contribution to the literature on crowdsourcing will expand on previous research by testing how varying the response mechanism influences participation. References Achor, Shawn.

We will also explore whether the perceived salience of the information being supplied or requested influences responses. If the literature on activation energy provides explanatory purchase, we expect the treatments that reduce the cognitive burden of responding will elicit more information. Therefore, we expect that MPs receiving a link to a survey that guides them through entry of information on Chinese financed development projects will provide the most information, followed by those who are asked to provide information in an email response, then by those who are directed to enter information directly onto project pages on china.aiddata.org. Additionally, if the information request is more locally relevant to the personal and professional background of the elites, we expect that these treatments will be met with better response rates. We expect that MPs who see the name of their district in the subject line of an email will be more likely to provide information than will those MPs who see the name of their country in the email subject line. The use of a full factorial design will also allow us to determine whether these two different strategies can be complementary or counter-productive when used in tandem. Consistent with the reasoning outlined above, we predict that MPs are more likely to contribute information on Chinese financed development projects when they are asked to crowdsource information that is perceived as salient and in an easy-to-use response format. In the context of our treatment groups, this means that we expect MPs who receive an email with (1) their district identified in the subject line of the email and (2) a link to a survey in the email will be most responsive and that MPs who receive an email with (1) their country identified in the subject line of the email and (2) directions to enter project information via a link to china.aiddata.org will be least responsive. Table 1: Expectations of MP Responses Across Several Outcomes Effect Type: Activation Energy (Ease of Response) Hierarchy of MP Responsiveness: Survey > Email Response > Website Entry Effect Type: Salience (Local Relevance) Hierarchy of MP Responsiveness: MP District > Country\""}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "\"Outcome Measure We will collect data on three outcomes of interest: 1) the open rate, or how many MPs open the email, 2) the substantive response rate, or how many MPs responded with project-specific information, and 3) the percentage of projects that an MP provided information for, which will measure how much project information MPs were willing or able to provide. Treatment and Control Conditions To test the effectiveness of different strategies at inducing crowdsourcing responses, we will send tailored emails to each subject asking them to contribute information and opinions about Chinese-funded development projects in or near their district. Email templates for each group are attached. This experiment will benefit from a full factorial design. The first factor will require altering the format in which subjects are asked to contribute data. For the control group, the email will contain a list of projects in or near the MP\u2019s district and provide a hyperlink for each project page on china.aiddata.org. MPs will be asked to review existing information for accuracy and completeness, and provide feedback through the comments section of the project page. For the first treatment group, the email will contain a list of projects in or near the recipient\u2019s district, and MP will be directed to a Qualtrics survey that will list the projects again. Each page of the survey will pose a different question and ask respondents to identify the projects about which they possess additional information. The Qualtrics survey will include both direct and open-ended questions. For the second treatment group, MPs will receive a list of projects and 4 accompanying questions that we have determined to require relatively little energy to answer. The MPs will be asked to submit responses directly into a response email. If an MP replies, we will follow up with four additional questions that require a greater deal of time investment from the respondent. If it is truly the case that activation energy shapes a person\u2019s propensity to contribute to a crowdsourcing initiative, we expect response rates for the second round of emails to drop significantly. Two weeks after the initial emails are sent, MPs who have not responded will receive a tailored reminder email that is very similar to the original email they received. One week after the second reminder email, MPs who have still not responded will receive a second reminder email with a specified deadline for their response. The other key component of the full factorial design is a test of whether and how changes in the content of email subject lines impact our outcome measures: email open rates, substantive response rates, and the completeness of responses. Across all conditions, we will randomly assign each MP to receive a \u201ccountry-level\u201d email subject line or a \u201cdistrict-level\u201d subject line. The country-level subject line will read, \u201cHow many Chinese-funded projects is (Country) implementing?\u201d The district-level subject line will read, \u201cHow many Chinese-funded projects is (District) implementing?\u201d We anticipate the district keyword will signal a higher level of salience to MPs. By comparing the outcome measures of the two groups across all treatments, we will attempt to test whether manipulating the perceived salience of an email subject affects the willingness of MPs to engage and to supply information. We will assign each MP with six projects that are in or near their district. Every MP will receive at least two national projects to ensure a level of standardization across respondents. To assign the local projects, we mapped the electoral and/or administrative districts of each country in conjunction with AidData\u2019s geocoded Chinese-funded development projects using QGIS software. Our research has indicated that administrative districts are often comprised of multiple electoral districts; therefore electoral districts are more localized than administrative districts. In order to be able ask MPs about projects within and near their electoral district, we joined the geocoded dataset to the district shapefiles. The outcome rendered a dataset that lists project locations and the corresponding electoral districts. Next, all the project locations with a geocoded precision code of 1 (indicating an exact location) will be assigned to the MP that represents the listed district. Projects assigned in this manner will be recorded as \u201cin\u201d the MP\u2019s district. If a project\u2019s electoral division cannot be assigned to an MP, we will rely on the larger administrative district to assign projects. These projects will be classified as \u201cnear\u201d the MP\u2019s district. If certain MPs are assigned fewer than 5 projects (including the two national projects assigned across all MPs), we will assign regional projects (indicated by a variable precision code). National projects are identified by the precision code \u201c6\u201d or \u201c8.\u201d Assignment of projects to MPs has already been completed for our first target country, Rwanda. Subject Pool Our research subjects will consist of current members parliament (MPs) in seven African countries: Ghana (178 MPs), Uganda (379 MPs), Botswana (58 MPs), Rwanda (104 MPs), Namibia (60 MPs), Kenya (266 MPs), and South Africa (400 MPs). All seven countries have English as an official language, and they vary in terms of wealth and regime type. The size of the subject pool is believed to be large enough (n=1,445) to draw a statistically significant conclusion. Subjects will be recruited for participation in the survey based on their status as MPs in the seven selected countries. We constructed the subject pool based on publicly available information. We first extracted contact and covariate information for each MP from the parliament or government websites where available, and relied on additional online information repositories when unavailable. Though we restricted our sample to English speaking African countries with readily available contact information, we believe our sample to be a representative subset of African countries. There is a wide spectrum of regime type, ranging from the fairly stable democracies of Namibia and Botswana, to mixed regimes (anocracies) like Kenya and autocracies like Uganda and Rwanda. In terms of economic development, there is again heterogeneity in the sample with Botswana and South Africa representing some of the strongest economies on the continent, Ghana emblematic of emerging economies in Africa, and Uganda representing countries with less robust economic growth. We hope the diversity of the sample will allow us to examine whether our crowdsourcing program is robust across institutional contexts or only suited to certain regimes. Randomization To balance on key observable covariates, we employed a stratified randomization procedure. Before randomly assigning experimental conditions to the subjects, we stratified subjects based on covariates that might be expected influence their knowledge of Chinese development projects. The blocking strata included the nationality of MP (Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, Rwanda, Namibia, Botswana, South Africa) and the number of projects in their district (0, 1-9, 10 or more). After blocking into each strata, we assigned by computerized randomization one of six treatment combinations (2 possible groups within the subject line, 3 possible groups for the email body). Data Analysis Protocol Based on the stratification criteria, we identified 21 strata as possible combinations of 7 countries and 3 levels of local Chinese-fund project density. The prevalence of project covariate coding as below: 0= no Chinese-funded project in the MP\u2019s electoral district 1= 1-9 Chinese-funded projects in the MP\u2019s electoral district 2= 10 or more Chinese funded projects in the MP\u2019s electoral district We will use Mailchimp, an email marketing service, to distribute each email treatment. Mailchimp also tracks respondents who open the email and the links that they click within the body of the email. The open rate, one of our key outcome measures, will be measured using Mailchimp statistics. We will code and analyze the dependent variables (DV) using the following methods: DV1 - Open rate (binary variable): 0 = no emails were opened; 1 = at least 1 email was opened. DV2 - Provision of substantive response (binary variable): 0= no substantive response was provided; 1= there is provision of substantive information about the project; N/A= emails unopened. The provision of substantive information is defined as either responding to one or more questions or providing additional contact as required. DV3 - Number of projects with information provided: value = the number of projects where information is provided. As a randomization check, we will perform logistic regression analyses to learn if the covariates (nationality of MP and number of projects in MP\u2019s district) were significantly associated with the probability of assignment to any one condition versus the others. As a first cut at data analysis, we will perform difference-of-means estimation for all three outcome variables. We also perform subgroup analysis within the three strata of Chinese project density. For the open rate, we will perform subgroup analysis for each country independently. Logistic regressions for the open rate and provision of substantive response will supplement the difference-in-means analysis. Covariates for country and density of Chinese aid projects will be employed in the regressions to check robustness. For the number of projects with a substantive response we will use zero-inflated count regression analysis with the same control variables. Because the second and third dependent variables, provision of substantive response and number of projects with substantive information, are conditional on response we will also employ a two-stage model to estimate the complier average causal effect (CACE, see Gerber and Green 2012).

Best regards, Dan Nielson Chief Social Scientist AidData Center for Development Policy APPENDIX: Example Qualtrics Survey Template [Page One] Are you familiar with any of the projects listed above? If so, which projects? Check all that apply. \u00b7 Loan for Kivu Belt road project: http://china.aiddata.org/projects/30353 On December 27, 2012 the Rwandan government passed a law authorizing the loan agreement that was signed in China on July 20, 2012. The loan is through China's ExIm Bank for a total amount of 113,409230.63 US Dollars. The loan has an interest rate of 1.5 percent, a maturity of twenty years, and a seven year grace period. The total value of the project is 320 USD million with the remainder of the funding coming through loans from the African Development Bank and Arab Development Bank. China Roads and Bridges Corporation is responsible for implementing the project with the Canadian firm CIMA overseeing construction. The entire Kivu Belt road will cover 185 km; the Chinese loan will cover two sections of the whole project, one connecting Mwityazo of Nyamasheke district with Ruvumbu of Karongi district and another section connecting Ruvumbu to Kibuye. \u00b7 Construction of Cement Factory: http://china.aiddata.org/projects/2009 On January 14, 2009, Rwandan President Paul Kagame and Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi agreed for China to fund the construction and operation of the cement factory (CIMERWA) in Bugarama, Rwanda. Chinese company, Pengfei Group Co. Ltd oversaw the construction of the plant. As of October 2010, 30% of the price of the plant had been paid and construction had begun. \u00b7 Kigali Road Network Rehabilitation Project: http://china.aiddata.org/projects/2014 Following a bilateral summit in Beijing on July 28-29, 2009, China gave Rwanda an interest-free, 219 million RMB loan for the rehabilitation of the Kigali road network. Rwandan Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary Eugene Munyakayanza and Chinese Vice-Minister in the Ministry of Commerce Fu Ziying led the Rwandan and Chinese delegations that signed of the loan agreement between the Rwandan Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning and the Exim Bank of China. The start and end dates of the project are unknown. \u00b7 Rehabilitation of the Urban Roads in Kigali: http://china.aiddata.org/projects/955 On October 24, 2008 in Rwanda, Chinese Ambassador Sun Shuzhong and the Rwandan Finance Minister signed an agreement for a concessional loan of 30.79 million loan for the construction of a Kigali municipal road reconstruction project. The road was constructed by China Road and Bridge Corporation. The 36km road neared completion in April 2011, with an estimated one month left before completion. \u00b7 Construction of Ministry of Foreign Affairs Headquarters: http://china.aiddata.org/projects/1886 In December 2006, China began construction on a new Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MINAFET) headquarters worth $7.66 million USD in Kigali. The project was implemented by Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co. Ltd (BCEG). On January 14, 2009, the Chinese Foreign Minister, Yang Jiechi, handed the office block over to the MINAFET. \u00b7 Loan for the Construction of a Fibre-optic network in Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda: http://china.aiddata.org/projects/30108 In 2007, Uganda and the Exim Bank of China signed an agreement for a loan worth 106 million USD for the construction of the National Data Transmission Backbone Infrastructure (NBI) and the funding of the Electronic Government Infrastructure (EGI) initiative (some earlier sources have indicated the loan was for 120 million USD). The loan has an interest rate of 2%, a grace period of 5 years and a maturity of 20 years. The loan is being used to fund the construction of a fiber-optic infrastructure linking the country to surrounding countries as well as government ministries to each other. The project is being implemented by China's Huawei Technologies in three phases. The first phase was concluded in 2007, connecting 27 government ministries in the Kampala Metroplitan Area, and Entebbe, Jinja, Mukono, and Bombo as well as 5 transmission sites. The second phase was concluded in 2011, constructing a datacentre, beginning a pilot project for messaging and collaboration tools, and laying, 1,548 kilometers of fiber-optic cable linking Luwero, Nakasongola, Masindi, Gulu, Nimule, Lira, Soroti, Kumi, Mbale, Tororo, Malaba, Busia, Hoima, Kyenjojo, Fort Portal, Kasese, Bushenyi, and Mbarara, including 17 transmission sites. The third phase will lay 307 kilometers of cable connecting Katuna, Kabale, Ntungamo, Masaka, and Mutukula through 3 transmissions sites, linking Uganda with Rwanda and Tanzania.

Crowdsourcing platforms allow a multitude of stakeholders including policy practitioners, civil society advocates, and ordinary citizens to engage in the policymaking process. Despite crowdsourcing\u2019s obvious appeal as a research and policy tool, there is relatively little existing knowledge of incentives that stimulate \u201cthe crowd\u2019s\u201d willingness to participate. Our experiment is designed to explore the most effective strategies to induce potential knowledge holders to provide information under non-emergency conditions. To this end, we will seek to determine how to entice Members of Parliament in seven African countries to provide information on Chinese-funded development projects in or near their constituency district. Incentives for crowdsourcing Different types of contributors have varying incentives for participating in crowdsourcing initiatives, including monetary or other material rewards, self or issue-interests (calling the police or fire-department could be considered contributing information to a crowdsourcing platform), or to enhance one\u2019s reputation. For example, a study on emergency crowdsourcing during the Haitian earthquake demonstrated that despite their diverse background, knowledge holders were motivated by both monetary and social incentives (Ramchurn et al 2013; Zook et al 2010). Inhabitants of the disaster zone would provide selective representations of local situations in order to facilitate on-the-ground rescue work, and the distant aid agencies could also provide tools and information that are important to emergency response via the crowdsourcing platform. Different actors can also play important roles to incentivize crowdsourcing. Donor partner countries are in a position to present the advantages and opportunities of crowdsourced initiatives and incentivize their partner governments to support, or at least permit crowdsourcing (Bott & Young 2012). In the absence of an emergency, the incentives for crowdsourcing information provision are more complicated to identify. Empirical evidence from studies on the social psychology of crowdsourcing identify three categories of incentives: extrinsic incentives (such as monetary payment or punishments), intrinsic incentives (such as inherent generosity or procrastination), and reputational incentives (such as reciprocity, publicity and praise). Among three types of incentives, the extrinsic incentives are usually considered the most effective, but may crowd out intrinsic motivations. However, there is still evidence regarding the power of intrinsic and reputational incentives in motivating participation in crowdsourcing, and prior research has identified that the combination of all three types of incentives harnesses the maximum amount of engagement in crowdsourcing (Findley et al 2012; Feldman 2005; Tirole 2006; Frey 2001; Kreps 1997). Whether the extrinsic incentive is stronger than the intrinsic incentive depends on the specific circumstances, such as the ambiguity of task and the strength of relevant social norm. The theory of Motivation Crowding Effects also suggest that while the external monetary incentives and punishments generally undermine intrinsic motivation, under identifiable conditions they may also strengthen existing intrinsic motivation. The impact of combining multiple incentives is also supported by the results of several randomized field experiment in development economics (Olken et al 2012; Banerjee et al 2010; Ashraf et al 2011). For example, Olken et al. found that the combination of financial and non-financial incentivizing treatments would increase Indonesian midwives\u2019 effort in the provision of public health service, while the single factor of monetary compensation has no significant impact on their behavior. Crowdsourcing mechanisms Several papers have studied how crowdsourcing incentive structures affect participation. (Brabham 2010; Lakhani et al. 2007; Lietsala & Joutsen 2007). Empirical evidence shows that the type of technology used to elicit crowd feedback can affect the level of intrinsic reward a person gets when participates in a crowdsourcing effort (Ruggiero 2000; Yang et al 2012). All else being equal, crowdsourcing initiatives that are more engaging for participants will be more successful. These findings are consistent with the three categories of incentives. The low transaction costs and far reach of the internet make it an ideal platform for crowdsourcing by strengthening the reputational payoff of content contribution. For instance, users voluntarily provide information to websites \u2013 such as YouTube, Facebook, or blogs \u2013 because they are rewarded with a desired degree of social notoriety. The spread of smartphones further solidifies the internet as the preferred crowdsourcing platform by lowering the barriers for users to contribute information. This reduces procrastination, which is considered an obstacle to intrinsic motivation. Moreover, certain crowdsourcing mechanisms emphasize intrinsic motivations such as enjoyment of social proof and over monetary rewards. A typical example is Lietsala and Joutsen\u2019s research on the production of Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning, the world\u2019s first feature-length film created through crowdsourcing. The survey on 130 community members and moviemakers shows that among all incentives to participation, most people are motivated by the fun of making a movie, while the desire for monetary reward is the least selected answer. Activation energy Given the research result that a crowdsourcing campaign\u2019s incentive structure and technological platform play central roles in eliciting participation, we are interested in distinguishing the mechanisms that provide high motivation for participation. As we consider crowdsourcing to be a type of voluntary, goal-directed behavior, the psychological concept of activation energy is helpful in explaining the motivation of \u201cthe crowd\u201d. Psychologists define activation energy as an initial investment of energy required to start an active behavior. Thus, tasks requiring lower activation energy to start are more likely to be completed (Achor 2011, Csikszentmihalyi 1997). In other words, crowdsourcing mechanism which requires low activation energy would entice more potential knowledge holders to contribute information because the process is easier to complete. For example, Netflix users are much more willingly to rate movies by clicking star rating than writing a review (Nielsen 2006). The effect of ease-of-use on people\u2019s effort to complete a task is supported by various studies on cognitive and social psychology (Davis 1989, Shin 2006, Webster & Hackley 1997). According to Davis, a technology is more actively used when it is easy to use and navigate. Similarly, learning tools designed to facilitate learner\u2019s engagement are expected to increase the degree of understanding and continuation. There is also empirical evidence that facilitating the participation process will encourage people to undertake costly actions (Behavioural Insights Team 2012; Behavioural Insights Team 2013; Kane et al 2004). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted to test the effectiveness of different messages designed for motivating behavioral changes, such as increasing charitable giving or reducing tax fraud. The research results reveal that the process should be made as easy as possible, and the key messages must be easy to identify and understand. For example, people are more likely to pay their tax when a form with information already held is provided, and simple message language is proved to be more persuasive than complex messages. Also, the most incentivizing message is personalized, locally relevant, and framed within the context of a greater good or social norm. Our contribution to the literature on crowdsourcing will expand on previous research by testing how varying the response mechanism influences participation. References Achor, Shawn.

We will also explore whether the perceived salience of the information being supplied or requested influences responses. If the literature on activation energy provides explanatory purchase, we expect the treatments that reduce the cognitive burden of responding will elicit more information. Therefore, we expect that MPs receiving a link to a survey that guides them through entry of information on Chinese financed development projects will provide the most information, followed by those who are asked to provide information in an email response, then by those who are directed to enter information directly onto project pages on china.aiddata.org. Additionally, if the information request is more locally relevant to the personal and professional background of the elites, we expect that these treatments will be met with better response rates. We expect that MPs who see the name of their district in the subject line of an email will be more likely to provide information than will those MPs who see the name of their country in the email subject line. The use of a full factorial design will also allow us to determine whether these two different strategies can be complementary or counter-productive when used in tandem. Consistent with the reasoning outlined above, we predict that MPs are more likely to contribute information on Chinese financed development projects when they are asked to crowdsource information that is perceived as salient and in an easy-to-use response format. In the context of our treatment groups, this means that we expect MPs who receive an email with (1) their district identified in the subject line of the email and (2) a link to a survey in the email will be most responsive and that MPs who receive an email with (1) their country identified in the subject line of the email and (2) directions to enter project information via a link to china.aiddata.org will be least responsive. Table 1: Expectations of MP Responses Across Several Outcomes Effect Type: Activation Energy (Ease of Response) Hierarchy of MP Responsiveness: Survey > Email Response > Website Entry Effect Type: Salience (Local Relevance) Hierarchy of MP Responsiveness: MP District > Country\"", "q17": "\"Outcome Measure We will collect data on three outcomes of interest: 1) the open rate, or how many MPs open the email, 2) the substantive response rate, or how many MPs responded with project-specific information, and 3) the percentage of projects that an MP provided information for, which will measure how much project information MPs were willing or able to provide. Treatment and Control Conditions To test the effectiveness of different strategies at inducing crowdsourcing responses, we will send tailored emails to each subject asking them to contribute information and opinions about Chinese-funded development projects in or near their district. Email templates for each group are attached. This experiment will benefit from a full factorial design. The first factor will require altering the format in which subjects are asked to contribute data. For the control group, the email will contain a list of projects in or near the MP\u2019s district and provide a hyperlink for each project page on china.aiddata.org. MPs will be asked to review existing information for accuracy and completeness, and provide feedback through the comments section of the project page. For the first treatment group, the email will contain a list of projects in or near the recipient\u2019s district, and MP will be directed to a Qualtrics survey that will list the projects again. Each page of the survey will pose a different question and ask respondents to identify the projects about which they possess additional information. The Qualtrics survey will include both direct and open-ended questions. For the second treatment group, MPs will receive a list of projects and 4 accompanying questions that we have determined to require relatively little energy to answer. The MPs will be asked to submit responses directly into a response email. If an MP replies, we will follow up with four additional questions that require a greater deal of time investment from the respondent. If it is truly the case that activation energy shapes a person\u2019s propensity to contribute to a crowdsourcing initiative, we expect response rates for the second round of emails to drop significantly. Two weeks after the initial emails are sent, MPs who have not responded will receive a tailored reminder email that is very similar to the original email they received. One week after the second reminder email, MPs who have still not responded will receive a second reminder email with a specified deadline for their response. The other key component of the full factorial design is a test of whether and how changes in the content of email subject lines impact our outcome measures: email open rates, substantive response rates, and the completeness of responses. Across all conditions, we will randomly assign each MP to receive a \u201ccountry-level\u201d email subject line or a \u201cdistrict-level\u201d subject line. The country-level subject line will read, \u201cHow many Chinese-funded projects is (Country) implementing?\u201d The district-level subject line will read, \u201cHow many Chinese-funded projects is (District) implementing?\u201d We anticipate the district keyword will signal a higher level of salience to MPs. By comparing the outcome measures of the two groups across all treatments, we will attempt to test whether manipulating the perceived salience of an email subject affects the willingness of MPs to engage and to supply information. We will assign each MP with six projects that are in or near their district. Every MP will receive at least two national projects to ensure a level of standardization across respondents. To assign the local projects, we mapped the electoral and/or administrative districts of each country in conjunction with AidData\u2019s geocoded Chinese-funded development projects using QGIS software. Our research has indicated that administrative districts are often comprised of multiple electoral districts; therefore electoral districts are more localized than administrative districts. In order to be able ask MPs about projects within and near their electoral district, we joined the geocoded dataset to the district shapefiles. The outcome rendered a dataset that lists project locations and the corresponding electoral districts. Next, all the project locations with a geocoded precision code of 1 (indicating an exact location) will be assigned to the MP that represents the listed district. Projects assigned in this manner will be recorded as \u201cin\u201d the MP\u2019s district. If a project\u2019s electoral division cannot be assigned to an MP, we will rely on the larger administrative district to assign projects. These projects will be classified as \u201cnear\u201d the MP\u2019s district. If certain MPs are assigned fewer than 5 projects (including the two national projects assigned across all MPs), we will assign regional projects (indicated by a variable precision code). National projects are identified by the precision code \u201c6\u201d or \u201c8.\u201d Assignment of projects to MPs has already been completed for our first target country, Rwanda. Subject Pool Our research subjects will consist of current members parliament (MPs) in seven African countries: Ghana (178 MPs), Uganda (379 MPs), Botswana (58 MPs), Rwanda (104 MPs), Namibia (60 MPs), Kenya (266 MPs), and South Africa (400 MPs). All seven countries have English as an official language, and they vary in terms of wealth and regime type. The size of the subject pool is believed to be large enough (n=1,445) to draw a statistically significant conclusion. Subjects will be recruited for participation in the survey based on their status as MPs in the seven selected countries. We constructed the subject pool based on publicly available information. We first extracted contact and covariate information for each MP from the parliament or government websites where available, and relied on additional online information repositories when unavailable. Though we restricted our sample to English speaking African countries with readily available contact information, we believe our sample to be a representative subset of African countries. There is a wide spectrum of regime type, ranging from the fairly stable democracies of Namibia and Botswana, to mixed regimes (anocracies) like Kenya and autocracies like Uganda and Rwanda. In terms of economic development, there is again heterogeneity in the sample with Botswana and South Africa representing some of the strongest economies on the continent, Ghana emblematic of emerging economies in Africa, and Uganda representing countries with less robust economic growth. We hope the diversity of the sample will allow us to examine whether our crowdsourcing program is robust across institutional contexts or only suited to certain regimes. Randomization To balance on key observable covariates, we employed a stratified randomization procedure. Before randomly assigning experimental conditions to the subjects, we stratified subjects based on covariates that might be expected influence their knowledge of Chinese development projects. The blocking strata included the nationality of MP (Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, Rwanda, Namibia, Botswana, South Africa) and the number of projects in their district (0, 1-9, 10 or more). After blocking into each strata, we assigned by computerized randomization one of six treatment combinations (2 possible groups within the subject line, 3 possible groups for the email body). Data Analysis Protocol Based on the stratification criteria, we identified 21 strata as possible combinations of 7 countries and 3 levels of local Chinese-fund project density. The prevalence of project covariate coding as below: 0= no Chinese-funded project in the MP\u2019s electoral district 1= 1-9 Chinese-funded projects in the MP\u2019s electoral district 2= 10 or more Chinese funded projects in the MP\u2019s electoral district We will use Mailchimp, an email marketing service, to distribute each email treatment. Mailchimp also tracks respondents who open the email and the links that they click within the body of the email. The open rate, one of our key outcome measures, will be measured using Mailchimp statistics. We will code and analyze the dependent variables (DV) using the following methods: DV1 - Open rate (binary variable): 0 = no emails were opened; 1 = at least 1 email was opened. DV2 - Provision of substantive response (binary variable): 0= no substantive response was provided; 1= there is provision of substantive information about the project; N/A= emails unopened. The provision of substantive information is defined as either responding to one or more questions or providing additional contact as required. DV3 - Number of projects with information provided: value = the number of projects where information is provided. As a randomization check, we will perform logistic regression analyses to learn if the covariates (nationality of MP and number of projects in MP\u2019s district) were significantly associated with the probability of assignment to any one condition versus the others. As a first cut at data analysis, we will perform difference-of-means estimation for all three outcome variables. We also perform subgroup analysis within the three strata of Chinese project density. For the open rate, we will perform subgroup analysis for each country independently. Logistic regressions for the open rate and provision of substantive response will supplement the difference-in-means analysis. Covariates for country and density of Chinese aid projects will be employed in the regressions to check robustness. For the number of projects with a substantive response we will use zero-inflated count regression analysis with the same control variables. Because the second and third dependent variables, provision of substantive response and number of projects with substantive information, are conditional on response we will also employ a two-stage model to estimate the complier average causal effect (CACE, see Gerber and Green 2012).

If so, which projects? Check all that apply. \u00b7 Loan for Kivu Belt road project: http://china.aiddata.org/projects/30353 On December 27, 2012 the Rwandan government passed a law authorizing the loan agreement that was signed in China on July 20, 2012. The loan is through China's ExIm Bank for a total amount of 113,409230.63 US Dollars. The loan has an interest rate of 1.5 percent, a maturity of twenty years, and a seven year grace period. The total value of the project is 320 USD million with the remainder of the funding coming through loans from the African Development Bank and Arab Development Bank. China Roads and Bridges Corporation is responsible for implementing the project with the Canadian firm CIMA overseeing construction. The entire Kivu Belt road will cover 185 km; the Chinese loan will cover two sections of the whole project, one connecting Mwityazo of Nyamasheke district with Ruvumbu of Karongi district and another section connecting Ruvumbu to Kibuye. \u00b7 Construction of Cement Factory: http://china.aiddata.org/projects/2009 On January 14, 2009, Rwandan President Paul Kagame and Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi agreed for China to fund the construction and operation of the cement factory (CIMERWA) in Bugarama, Rwanda. Chinese company, Pengfei Group Co. Ltd oversaw the construction of the plant. As of October 2010, 30% of the price of the plant had been paid and construction had begun. \u00b7 Kigali Road Network Rehabilitation Project: http://china.aiddata.org/projects/2014 Following a bilateral summit in Beijing on July 28-29, 2009, China gave Rwanda an interest-free, 219 million RMB loan for the rehabilitation of the Kigali road network. Rwandan Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary Eugene Munyakayanza and Chinese Vice-Minister in the Ministry of Commerce Fu Ziying led the Rwandan and Chinese delegations that signed of the loan agreement between the Rwandan Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning and the Exim Bank of China. The start and end dates of the project are unknown. \u00b7 Rehabilitation of the Urban Roads in Kigali: http://china.aiddata.org/projects/955 On October 24, 2008 in Rwanda, Chinese Ambassador Sun Shuzhong and the Rwandan Finance Minister signed an agreement for a concessional loan of 30.79 million loan for the construction of a Kigali municipal road reconstruction project. The road was constructed by China Road and Bridge Corporation. The 36km road neared completion in April 2011, with an estimated one month left before completion. \u00b7 Construction of Ministry of Foreign Affairs Headquarters: http://china.aiddata.org/projects/1886 In December 2006, China began construction on a new Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MINAFET) headquarters worth $7.66 million USD in Kigali. The project was implemented by Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co. Ltd (BCEG). On January 14, 2009, the Chinese Foreign Minister, Yang Jiechi, handed the office block over to the MINAFET. \u00b7 Loan for the Construction of a Fibre-optic network in Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda: http://china.aiddata.org/projects/30108 In 2007, Uganda and the Exim Bank of China signed an agreement for a loan worth 106 million USD for the construction of the National Data Transmission Backbone Infrastructure (NBI) and the funding of the Electronic Government Infrastructure (EGI) initiative (some earlier sources have indicated the loan was for 120 million USD). The loan has an interest rate of 2%, a grace period of 5 years and a maturity of 20 years. The loan is being used to fund the construction of a fiber-optic infrastructure linking the country to surrounding countries as well as government ministries to each other. The project is being implemented by China's Huawei Technologies in three phases. The first phase was concluded in 2007, connecting 27 government ministries in the Kampala Metroplitan Area, and Entebbe, Jinja, Mukono, and Bombo as well as 5 transmission sites. The second phase was concluded in 2011, constructing a datacentre, beginning a pilot project for messaging and collaboration tools, and laying, 1,548 kilometers of fiber-optic cable linking Luwero, Nakasongola, Masindi, Gulu, Nimule, Lira, Soroti, Kumi, Mbale, Tororo, Malaba, Busia, Hoima, Kyenjojo, Fort Portal, Kasese, Bushenyi, and Mbarara, including 17 transmission sites. The third phase will lay 307 kilometers of cable connecting Katuna, Kabale, Ntungamo, Masaka, and Mutukula through 3 transmissions sites, linking Uganda with Rwanda and Tanzania.

The current body of research lacks independent and scientific study of NGO behavior. Though there are some examples, these outliers are rare and difficult to generalize (see Reinikka and Svensson 2001). As NGOs become more influential in development, a more scientific understanding of their behavior becomes critical (Aldashev and Verdier 2010; Doh and Teegen 2002). In order to increase the body of scientific knowledge concerning NGO behavior, we perform a randomized field experiment designed to measure the extent of NGO opportunism. Variation in NGO type and function increases the difficulty of generalizing about NGO behavior (hence the need for a randomized controlled experiment). For some time, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have played an important role in public good provision and development initiatives. Because most NGOs claim non-profit status, political neutrality, liberal ideology, and a normative agenda, NGOs are considered by many to be the ideal mechanism for success in these important assignments. In some cases, NGOs may be the only mechanism. Yet the term \u201cNGO\u201d can apply to wide range of organizations (Spar and Dail 2002). Indeed, the variation can be so great (and multi-dimensional) that two NGOs may have nothing in common besides their non-profit, non-government status. NGOs may be international or community-based, well-funded or non-funded, infrastructure-oriented or advocacy-oriented. In short, it is a mistake to treat NGOs as a black box. Furthermore, the nature of typical NGO projects does not lend itself easily to measurement and accountability. Traditional mechanisms of accountability employed in the for-profit sector are ineffective in the NGO-sector. NGOs may not be concerned with increasing revenue or maximizing profits. There are few established professional codes of conduct to compare across organizations. The outcome of NGO projects and initiatives are often non-quantifiable (Fowler 1996). As mentioned, this leads many to speculate about the effects of increased NGO population and competition for funding. Many are hopeful, assuming NGOs will cooperate, coordinate and be unaffected in pursuit of their organizational missions (Matthews 1997; Simmons 1998; Price 1998). Others are less optimistic, claiming that NGOs will behave opportunistically in order to survive in an uncertain environment (Cooley and Ron 2002; Aldashev and Verdier 2010). Many point to growing principal-agent problems between donors, NGOs, and constituents (Brown and Moore 2001; Doh and Teegen 2002). It is important to note that none of this necessarily suggests that NGOs are becoming inherently corrupt and dishonest, or that their altruistic missions have changed. It does suggest that as competition for donor funds increases and as NGOs become more populous, NGOs may need to behave selfishly or opportunistically in some domains for their own preservation. At times, self-interested NGO priorities may not agree with those of their donors or their constituents (Cooley and Ron 2002). The current study seeks to assess whether NGOs behave opportunistically in the context of establishing a partnership with a research institution for future projects and funding. We randomly assign five conditions across a large sample of NGOs (n > 50,000) in India. In each condition, NGOs are informed (via email) about the possibility of a future partnership with the Political Economy and Development Lab (PEDL). At the end of the email, each NGO is asked to respond to a survey in which the NGO estimates reimbursement cost for the use of their staff members in the future partnership. Each treatment condition receives a different level of additional information about PEDL in the text of the survey. We analyze the effect of this additional information on the estimated reimbursement cost. The extent to which the estimated reimbursement cost varies relative to the control condition is our measure of opportunistic behavior. This is the third round of experiments on the topic: the first was conducted with roughly 800 NGOs in Uganda, the second with 13,000 international NGOs worldwide, and this third experiment will study the 52,000 Indian NGOs.\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"This experiment yields itself to four specific hypotheses. (I) When an audit is promised to evaluate an eventual partnership between PEDL and an NGO, estimated reimbursement costs will increase as NGOs are more careful to account for even minor expenses related to the project. (II) Implied project competition will increase reimbursement cost as NGOs may not respond to market competition incentives, but instead may be motivated to signal credibility through higher costs. (III) Information revealing PEDL\u2019s familiarity with NGO partnerships\u2014 suggesting minimal information asymmetry\u2014should decrease estimated reimbursement cost. (IV) NGOs\u2019 estimated reimbursement costs will increase when given information suggesting wealthy donors and abundant resources. Treatment 1, the Audit Condition, receives the following additional language: \u201cPlease be aware that all PEDL projects are subject to thorough audits, so any expenses in future partnerships will be carefully scrutinized.\u201d This additional information should prompt NGOs to be more careful when they respond with their reimbursement cost per staff member per day. A prima facie expectation might be that NGOs will lower their estimates in wariness of being revealed to have submitted inflated bids. Alternatively, as NGOs are more careful in the calculation of their reimbursement cost, we might also expect that they will factor more expenses into their estimates. Thus, despite the logic behind the avoidance of being caught inflating bids, we expect estimates to increase in response to the Audit Condition. Additionally, because of the added accountability, we expect this treatment will also decrease response rates. Some NGOs may be discouraged from responding because they are unaccustomed to rigorous audits or lack the organization to handle them. Treatment 2, the Competition Condition, is designed to signal to the recipient NGOs that PEDL is considering the reimbursement cost estimates of multiple NGOs. The treatment implies that PEDL is most likely to partner with the NGO that provides the most competitive estimate. The additional language added to this e-mail is found here: \u201cPlease be aware that we have sent the same inquiry to many organizations, so there will likely be competition for future partnerships.\u201d Microeconomic theory suggests that competition should induce lower prices. Therefore, NGOs should submit lower bids in this condition. However, while NGOs have strong incentives to contract with PEDL for future partnerships, we suspect that NGOs operate with the understanding that credibility may be more important than cost in the non-profit sector. Furthermore, NGOs may operate with the understanding that higher reimbursement cost is a signal of credibility and competence. Based on these assumptions and against microeconomic expectations, we expect that NGOs will increase their reimbursement estimates in response to the Competition Condition. Treatment 3, the Prior Knowledge Condition, is designed to suggest minimal information asymmetry between the donor/partner and the local NGO. Often miscommunication and confusion results from information asymmetry, which leads to increased financial cost and inefficiency in development work. Implying that PEDL has partnered with NGOs before and is familiar with typical reimbursement costs should reduce confusion and push NGOs to be more careful calculating their estimates. The additional language for this treatment is as follows: \u201cPlease be aware that we have worked with many NGOs around the world, so we are familiar with average personnel costs.\u201c We expect this additional information will prompt NGOs to lower their reimbursement estimates compared to the control group. Lastly, Treatment 4, the Big Money Condition, contains the following additional language: \u201cPlease be aware that past projects have been supported by more than $3 million in grants and contracts from donors including the Gates Foundation, the Hewlett Foundation, the World Bank, and the African Development Bank, so PEDL typically brings significant resources to partnerships.\u201d This treatment suggests that PEDL is well funded and endowed with abundant resources. This provides an incentive for NGOs to inflate their reimbursement estimates because there are no institutional constraints or traditional ranges for reimbursement costs in development work. We expect that NGOs will behave opportunistically by increasing their reimbursement estimates in response to this treatment. We also suspect that response rates will increase due to this treatment. Because the information suggests there is significant money and resources available, we expect NGOs will be more confident in their chances of establishing a partnership.\""}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "\"PROTOCOL 1. The experiment will be conducted on a sample of 52,364 NGOs in India. The sample comes from an online directory of Indian NGOs. All NGOs in the sample have an email address for their organization. Non-English speaking organizations are dropped from the sample. 2. We randomly assign all NGOs into one of five conditions: the Audit Condition, the Competition Condition, the Prior Knowledge Condition, and Big Money Condition, and the Control Condition. We block randomize based on geographic region and according to NGO size (based on the self-reported number of full-time employees and number of active projects). We suspect these blocking covariates may affect how NGOs respond to the treatment conditions, though we have no prior hypotheses about directions of the relationships. Half the sample is assigned to the Control Condition. The remaining half is distributed uniformly across the remaining four conditions. 3. Each NGO in each condition receives an email expressing PEDL\u2019s interest in a project partnership with the recipient NGO. The email requests that the NGO respond to a survey in which the NGO estimates the daily reimbursement cost expected by the recipient NGO for the use of their staff members for the project discussed in the email. NGOs in the Control Condition receive no additional information in their email. NGOs in one of the four treatment conditions receive the following information in identical locations in the survey.

PEDL performs research to fight poverty and promote global development. We are collecting information about how Indian NGOs participate in development. Our goal is to map the different ways that NGOs participate in policy-making and implementation. We would appreciate your brief responses on the questionnaire linked below. We are also exploring the potential for research partnerships. Our projects generally last 2-6 months, involve 1-4 NGO staff members (entry level personnel or enumerators), and have budgets between $5,000 and $100,000. This is not an invitation for immediate collaboration: both of us will need to make sure there is a good institutional fit. But we hope the information you provide may lead to fruitful conversations about potential collaboration in the future.

The current body of research lacks independent and scientific study of NGO behavior. Though there are some examples, these outliers are rare and difficult to generalize (see Reinikka and Svensson 2001). As NGOs become more influential in development, a more scientific understanding of their behavior becomes critical (Aldashev and Verdier 2010; Doh and Teegen 2002). In order to increase the body of scientific knowledge concerning NGO behavior, we perform a randomized field experiment designed to measure the extent of NGO opportunism. Variation in NGO type and function increases the difficulty of generalizing about NGO behavior (hence the need for a randomized controlled experiment). For some time, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have played an important role in public good provision and development initiatives. Because most NGOs claim non-profit status, political neutrality, liberal ideology, and a normative agenda, NGOs are considered by many to be the ideal mechanism for success in these important assignments. In some cases, NGOs may be the only mechanism. Yet the term \u201cNGO\u201d can apply to wide range of organizations (Spar and Dail 2002). Indeed, the variation can be so great (and multi-dimensional) that two NGOs may have nothing in common besides their non-profit, non-government status. NGOs may be international or community-based, well-funded or non-funded, infrastructure-oriented or advocacy-oriented. In short, it is a mistake to treat NGOs as a black box. Furthermore, the nature of typical NGO projects does not lend itself easily to measurement and accountability. Traditional mechanisms of accountability employed in the for-profit sector are ineffective in the NGO-sector. NGOs may not be concerned with increasing revenue or maximizing profits. There are few established professional codes of conduct to compare across organizations. The outcome of NGO projects and initiatives are often non-quantifiable (Fowler 1996). As mentioned, this leads many to speculate about the effects of increased NGO population and competition for funding. Many are hopeful, assuming NGOs will cooperate, coordinate and be unaffected in pursuit of their organizational missions (Matthews 1997; Simmons 1998; Price 1998). Others are less optimistic, claiming that NGOs will behave opportunistically in order to survive in an uncertain environment (Cooley and Ron 2002; Aldashev and Verdier 2010). Many point to growing principal-agent problems between donors, NGOs, and constituents (Brown and Moore 2001; Doh and Teegen 2002). It is important to note that none of this necessarily suggests that NGOs are becoming inherently corrupt and dishonest, or that their altruistic missions have changed. It does suggest that as competition for donor funds increases and as NGOs become more populous, NGOs may need to behave selfishly or opportunistically in some domains for their own preservation. At times, self-interested NGO priorities may not agree with those of their donors or their constituents (Cooley and Ron 2002). The current study seeks to assess whether NGOs behave opportunistically in the context of establishing a partnership with a research institution for future projects and funding. We randomly assign five conditions across a large sample of NGOs (n > 50,000) in India. In each condition, NGOs are informed (via email) about the possibility of a future partnership with the Political Economy and Development Lab (PEDL). At the end of the email, each NGO is asked to respond to a survey in which the NGO estimates reimbursement cost for the use of their staff members in the future partnership. Each treatment condition receives a different level of additional information about PEDL in the text of the survey. We analyze the effect of this additional information on the estimated reimbursement cost. The extent to which the estimated reimbursement cost varies relative to the control condition is our measure of opportunistic behavior. This is the third round of experiments on the topic: the first was conducted with roughly 800 NGOs in Uganda, the second with 13,000 international NGOs worldwide, and this third experiment will study the 52,000 Indian NGOs.\"", "q16": "\"This experiment yields itself to four specific hypotheses. (I) When an audit is promised to evaluate an eventual partnership between PEDL and an NGO, estimated reimbursement costs will increase as NGOs are more careful to account for even minor expenses related to the project. (II) Implied project competition will increase reimbursement cost as NGOs may not respond to market competition incentives, but instead may be motivated to signal credibility through higher costs. (III) Information revealing PEDL\u2019s familiarity with NGO partnerships\u2014 suggesting minimal information asymmetry\u2014should decrease estimated reimbursement cost. (IV) NGOs\u2019 estimated reimbursement costs will increase when given information suggesting wealthy donors and abundant resources. Treatment 1, the Audit Condition, receives the following additional language: \u201cPlease be aware that all PEDL projects are subject to thorough audits, so any expenses in future partnerships will be carefully scrutinized.\u201d This additional information should prompt NGOs to be more careful when they respond with their reimbursement cost per staff member per day. A prima facie expectation might be that NGOs will lower their estimates in wariness of being revealed to have submitted inflated bids. Alternatively, as NGOs are more careful in the calculation of their reimbursement cost, we might also expect that they will factor more expenses into their estimates. Thus, despite the logic behind the avoidance of being caught inflating bids, we expect estimates to increase in response to the Audit Condition. Additionally, because of the added accountability, we expect this treatment will also decrease response rates. Some NGOs may be discouraged from responding because they are unaccustomed to rigorous audits or lack the organization to handle them. Treatment 2, the Competition Condition, is designed to signal to the recipient NGOs that PEDL is considering the reimbursement cost estimates of multiple NGOs. The treatment implies that PEDL is most likely to partner with the NGO that provides the most competitive estimate. The additional language added to this e-mail is found here: \u201cPlease be aware that we have sent the same inquiry to many organizations, so there will likely be competition for future partnerships.\u201d Microeconomic theory suggests that competition should induce lower prices.

Research on torture has focused on perceptions of the practice, support for the practice, perceptions of what constitutes torture, why the use of torture persists despite arguments against it, and the efficacy of the practice. While many of these studies assess stated attitudes toward torture, scholars have not yet adequately addressed how framing impacts perceptions on torture. Additionally, research to date has focused only on stated attitudes about torture. Yet, as we know from other domains, there may be a disparity between what people say and how they act, especially on a contentious issue such as torture. We are left with an inadequate understanding of how framing impacts views on torture, and how stated beliefs are related to actual behaviors in support of those beliefs. The present study will fill this gap in the literature by examining how the interrogator-suspect dyad, proximity to the event, and type of behavior used impact perceptions of torture. This study will also examine how framing impacts behavior in support of stated attitudes to more fully elucidate the relationship between beliefs and actions about torture. The proposed project will involve a pilot study and will be adjusted and scaled up based on funding. Since the revelation of the so-called torture memos, academics, policymakers, and observers have argued over how to define and measure it. Some politicians and members of government in the United States have attempted to redefine torture, argued that actions in which military and intelligence officers have engaged do not meet the definition of torture, or that laws against torture do not apply to detention centers overseas. Among civilians, the definition of torture differs between individuals, and an individual\u2019s conceptualization of torture is also fuzzy (Norris, Larsen & Stastny, 2010). What is and is not perceived to be torture varies both between and within individuals, depending on how the practice is framed. Research has shown that how one perceives torture can vary based on a number of factors, including whether or not the perpetrator or the suspect is a member of the observer\u2019s in-group (Miron, Branscombe & Biernat, 2010; Norris et al., 2010; Tarrant, Branscombe, Warner & Weston, 2012) and proximity to the act (Gray & Wegner, 2010). Sherif et al. (1961) found that a strong notion of in-group and out-group identity can lead to increased aggression. Recent experiments have applied this finding to test the impact of in-group and out-group identity on perceptions of torture. Participants in experiments are more likely to define an act as torture when it is perpetrated against a member of their in-group as opposed to an out-group member (Norris et al., 2010), are more likely to justify torture and have less empathy for the suspect with the perpetrator is a member of the participant\u2019s in-group (Tarrant et al., 2012), and require a higher level of injustice and more information to say that a practice perpetrated by a member of their group was racist (Miron et al., 2010). Research has also shown that threats from an out-group, as is the case since 9/11, can generate more support for strict policies (e.g. Moghaddam, 2007) and has led to more prejudice against Arab Americans (see Oswald, 2006 and Persson, Musher & Dara, 2006) Gray and Wegner (2010) examined differences in perceptions of guilt and pain in an experiment on torture using distant and close conditions. While their aims were different than those of this study, we too utilize distant and close conditions to understand how spatial proximity to the torturous event impacts perceptions of torture as a function of the dyad involved in the act and in-group bias. Additionally, research has shown disparity between individuals\u2019 stated attitudes toward torture and their actual beliefs about the practice. For example, Carlsmith (2008) found that while people abstractly support utilitarian laws and policies toward torture, their behaviors often contradict their stated attitudes in favor of retributive motivations. Furthermore, Carlsmith and Sood (2009) found disparity between stated reasons and actual reasons for support torture. We are also interested in differences between perceptions of psychological versus physical torture. The aim of the present study is to broaden our understanding of torture perceptions by examining how views are impacted by both the interrogator-suspect dyad, spatial proximity to the event, and type of torture method used. The study will also bridge another gap in the literature by including a behavioral measure in addition to attitudinal measures. This study uses a 4 (race in the interrogator-suspect dyad) x 2 (domestic v v. transnational) x 3 (psychological torture v. physical torture v. no torture) a between-subjects design aimed at understanding how in-group bias and spatial proximity to torture impact perceptions of torture and willingness to behave in a manner that is consistent with stated beliefs. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of 24 conditions. Our project will be listed on Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk website for participants to voluntarily decide to participate. Each participant will first read and accept the consent form before being directly to our questionnaire housed on SurveyMonkey, which allows for random assignment to one of the 24 conditions. By listing the 24 conditions under one name on MTurk, this prevents a person from being able to participate twice. Once on SurveyMonkey, each participant will be randomly assigned to a condition. Participants will first fill out a background demographic questionnaire, followed but a questionnaire about attitudes and opinions about various interrogation tactics. Participants will then read a vignette about a HYPOETHICAL interrogation scenario. We will vary the dyad of the interrogator and suspect using Caucasian and Middle Eastern names to create four conditions (Caucasian interrogator-Caucasian suspect, Caucasian interrogator-Middle Eastern suspect, Middle Eastern interrogator-Caucasian suspect, Middle Eastern interrogator-Middle Eastern suspect). We will also vary whether the interrogation described in the vignette takes place in the United States or in Afghanistan to create two conditions. Lastly, we will vary whether the hypothetical interrogation tactics described are considered psychological torture, physical torture, or no torture (control) to create three conditions. All together, there are 24 conditions in this study. After reading the vignette describing a hypothetical, participants will answer a series of questions about the scenario and fill out another questionnaire about their attitudes and opinions about various interrogations tactics. Lastly, participants will be told that they have the option to sign a petition to the White House that is either a) in support of the tactics in the vignette, b) in opposition to the tactics in the vignette, or c) they can skip this option without penalty. MTurk's policies do not allow us to actually collect identifying information from participants, so we will proxy this by asking participants to click one of the aforementioned options that will take them either to the appropriate survey or to the end of the study. Regardless of which option someone clicks, the next screen will inform them that there is not actually a petition and will also include the debriefing information.\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"H1: Participants will be more likely to describe the scenario as torture when the suspect is Caucasian than when the suspect is of Middle Eastern descent.
