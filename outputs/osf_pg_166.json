involved in regulatory registration and inspections to improve the safety, quality and efficacy of medical products.

However, the literature shows that inadequate competent regulatory scientists is a challenge to ensuring safe, quality and effective medical products in sub-Saharan Africa (Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative, 2013; Ekeigwe, 2019; Ndomondo-Sigonda, Miot, Naidoo, Dodoo, &amp; Kaale, 2017; World Health Organization, 2019). Despite efforts by developmental agencies such as the WHO, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), to train regulatory scientists, the problem still persists as noted in the 2019 report of Mckinsey &amp; Company on \u201cShould sub-Saharan Africa makes its own drugs\u201d (Conway, Sabow, &amp; Sun, 2019). Insufficient competent regulatory scientists in sub-Saharan Africa is a persistent problem and there is a dearth of academic research in developing the competences of regulatory scientists in sub-Saharan Africa. \nCompetency frameworks are the substrate for effective development of the capacity of regulatory scientists and any other profession. (Drago, Shire, &amp; Ekmekci, 2016). The absence of a competency framework has resulted in a wide skills range among regulators in sub-Saharan Africa; NMRAs are not at the same level in the regulation of medical products and difficulty in the \u2018portability\u2019 of regulatory scientists in the region. This in turn leads to huge variations in the efficient and effective regulation of medical products and therefore impairs access to safe, quality and effective medicinal products. (World Health Organization, 2010). Therefore, it is important to describe the competences required of regulatory scientists in sub-Saharan Africa. This will serve as a template for developing curriculum, training, and recruitment processes. This review will focus on the competencies for regulatory scientists (regulators/regulatees) involved in the registration and inspection of medical products.\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "What are the competence needs of regulatory scientists in sub-Saharan Africa for regulatory registration and inspection?"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies."}, "q6": {"extra": [], "value": ["No blinding is involved in this study."]}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q8": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Qualitative systematic review of the literature.

Insufficient competent regulatory scientists in sub-Saharan Africa is a persistent problem and there is a dearth of academic research in developing the competences of regulatory scientists in sub-Saharan Africa. \nCompetency frameworks are the substrate for effective development of the capacity of regulatory scientists and any other profession. (Drago, Shire, &amp; Ekmekci, 2016). The absence of a competency framework has resulted in a wide skills range among regulators in sub-Saharan Africa; NMRAs are not at the same level in the regulation of medical products and difficulty in the \u2018portability\u2019 of regulatory scientists in the region. This in turn leads to huge variations in the efficient and effective regulation of medical products and therefore impairs access to safe, quality and effective medicinal products. (World Health Organization, 2010). Therefore, it is important to describe the competences required of regulatory scientists in sub-Saharan Africa. This will serve as a template for developing curriculum, training, and recruitment processes.

These events tend to reduce voters\u2019 incomes and diminish their living conditions. The 2010 earthquake in Chile, the 2017 floods in Peru, the rise of crime in Venezuela since 2005, and the spread of international criminal gangs in Central America are examples of particular negative circumstances that have affected citizens\u2019 standard of living in different developing countries. We know that negative events such as natural disasters and crime can have an impact on electoral outcomes (Achen and Bartels, 2004; Marshall, 2015). Why do citizens change their political behavior after negative shocks? I plan to study how these adverse events change voters\u2019 political preferences. In particular, I focus on how natural disasters and crime victimization make candidates with certain labels more attractive to voters than others. Do crime victims tend to prefer right-wing candidates? Can natural disasters increase the probability of voting for left-wing politicians? The current literature about the political consequences of negative events tends to focus on voters\u2019 retrospective assessments of incumbents\u2019 performance. The main argument is that citizens (mis)attribute responsibilities after negative shocks, and punish or reward incumbents according to that (mis)evaluation. However, this approach fails to notice the importance of prospective political preferences. I hold that citizens, besides blaming or gratifying incumbents for their response to a negative event, are also selecting political authorities that can enhance their welfare. Victims focus on improving their living conditions after a negative shock, which leads them to pay attention to particular policy issues that can help them to achieve that goal. As a consequence, affected voters are more likely to select candidates that are better suited to address these new policy concerns. How do voters know which candidate matches their new policy preferences? Victims can exploit certain labels to identify the politician that is more likely to implement the policies they most care about. For example, ideological labels (e.g., left and right) can work as informational shortcuts to connect candidates with simple policy outcomes (e.g., welfare and iron-fist policies). Party labels can also work as heuristics in places where ideology is less salient."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Based on this argument, I present the following hypotheses. First, the negative event will modify voters\u2019 policy preferences. 1. I expect that disaster victims will be more likely to support the distribution of welfare policies by the government. 2. I expect that crime victims will be more likely to support the use of iron-fist policies by the government. Second, these new policy preferences will lead voters to support candidates with particular ideological labels. 3. I expect that disaster victims will be more likely to vote for left-wing candidates. 4. I expect that crime victims will be more likely to vote for right-wing candidates. Third, the previous expectations can only be true if voters are able to connect simple policy issues with ideological labels. 5. I expect that a majority of respondents will link welfare policies with left-wing candidates. 6. I expect that a majority of respondents will link iron-fist policies with right-wing candidates. I will conduct this study in Chile. This country presents the ideal conditions since disasters and crime are not rare events. Natural catastrophes are quite common across the entire national territory (Hewitt, 2014), and according to official data, 27% of households have been a crime victim in the last 12 months. Additionally, voters do have the capacity to place parties/coalitions on the ideological spectrum (Calvo and Murillo, 2012). Therefore, ideological labels can work as informational shortcuts to make informed decisions."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "This study is based on a face-to-face survey. Respondents will need to imagine they are disaster or crime victims. I follow a two-step procedure to select participants. In the first step, I select the county that better predicts the electoral results in Chile. There have been six presidential elections in this country since the transition to democracy (1989, 1993, 1999, 2005, 2009, and 2013), and 32 candidates have competed in these elections. I compare the presidential electoral results in the 345 municipalities in Chile with the national electoral results. The analysis is straightforward; for each municipality, I sum up the absolute differences between this county and the national results for the 32 candidates that ran in the six presidential elections. The municipality with the lowest absolute difference was Cerrillos. This county is part of the Greater Santiago conurbation. Table 1 reports the vote share between Chile and Cerrillos, and it is useful to visually inspect how this municipality is an excellent predictor of the national electoral results (see document attached). In summary, the goal of this analysis is to avoid implementing the survey in counties that are outliers and do not represent the average political preferences in Chile. In a second step, I will select respondents within Cerrillos. This municipality can be divided into four neighborhoods: Lo Err\u00e1zuriz, Divino Maestro, Villa M\u00e9xico, and Cerrillos. One enumerator will be assigned to each neighborhood, and within this area, we will use a random walk to select every 3rd household in a given street. It is expected that enumerators will cover the entire neighborhood by the end of the survey implementation. This study will be conducted by four enumerators in August 2017. The questionnaire can be divided into five sections. The first part will ask for general political opinions: evaluation of the president, voting preferences, etc. The second part will ask for respondents\u2019 background characteristics: age, education, etc. The third part will attempt to learn if citizens are capable of connecting simple policy ideas with ideological labels. In particular, it will ask participants to link social and iron-fist policies with left or right-wing politicians. The fourth part will use an experimental design by providing three different scenarios to participants: to be a disaster victim, to be a crime victim, and a control condition (no extra information). The disaster condition will say: \"Imagine you are a disaster victim. Yesterday there was a 9.0 earthquake in Santiago that destroyed an important part of your house and your belongings. Please take five seconds to think about the personal consequences of this disaster [WAIT FIVE SECONDS].\" The crime condition will say: \"Imagine you are a crime victim. Yesterday three people violently entered your house and stole you important and expensive belongings. Please take five seconds to think about the personal consequences of this crime [WAIT FIVE SECONDS].\" The control condition will not provide information about a disaster or a crime. The outcome for disaster victims is: \"Taking into account the post-disaster context, do you think that authorities to help victims of natural disasters should distribute social policies or that every person is responsible for his/her own welfare?\" The outcome for crime victims is: \"Taking into account the post-crime context, do you think that authorities to reduce crime should apply iron-fist policies or should focus on rehabilitation of criminals? Participants in the control condition will receive both questions (but without the phrase: \"taking into account the post-disaster/crime context\"). The fifth part will use a conjoint experiment to measure respondents\u2019 electoral choices. Participants will be asked to decide between two (non-real) candidates that will be competing for the position of president in the 2017 elections. Respondents will see information about three attributes of these two presidential candidates: ideology (left and right), profession (gardener, teacher, engineer), and age (30, 40, 50). These attributes will be randomly chosen to generate the candidates\u2019 profiles (Hainmueller, Hopkins and Yamamoto, 2014). Each of the respondents will have to evaluate five pairs of profiles and select one candidate for president. The treatment condition will be repeated by the enumerator. I include ideology as an attribute because this is a relevant political label in Chile, and should help voters to identify the candidate that will implement the policies they most care about. I also include education and age because these attributes can provide signals of candidates\u2019 competencies to address the consequences of a negative shock. These two characteristics might be seen as valence issues by voters. I use the fourth part of the survey to compute statistical power. In order to achieve 80% power, I will need to have a sample size of at least 871 subjects (disaster treatment, crime treatment, and control). Regarding hypotheses 1 and 2, I will regress the outcome (policy preferences) on a treatment indicator (1: disaster or crime victim, 0: control). I will also include a model with controls that should predict the outcome (e.g., age, education, and ideology). I expect that the disaster treatment will increase support for welfare policies. Meanwhile, the crime treatment will increase support for iron-fist policies. Regarding hypotheses 3 and 4, the empirical strategy will be based on an interaction between the candidates\u2019 attributes (conjoint experiment) and the hypothetical scenarios (vignette experiment). This interaction (see document attached) describes the change in effect of the candidates\u2019 attributes between control and treatment conditions (disaster or crime victim). I expect that the disaster treatment will increase support for left-wing candidates. Meanwhile, the crime treatment will increase support for right-wing candidates. Regarding hypotheses 5 and 6, I need to show that a majority of respondents (>50%) are able to link social policies with left-wing politicians and iron-fist policies with right-wing politicians."},

These events tend to reduce voters\u2019 incomes and diminish their living conditions. The 2010 earthquake in Chile, the 2017 floods in Peru, the rise of crime in Venezuela since 2005, and the spread of international criminal gangs in Central America are examples of particular negative circumstances that have affected citizens\u2019 standard of living in different developing countries. We know that negative events such as natural disasters and crime can have an impact on electoral outcomes (Achen and Bartels, 2004; Marshall, 2015). Why do citizens change their political behavior after negative shocks? I plan to study how these adverse events change voters\u2019 political preferences. In particular, I focus on how natural disasters and crime victimization make candidates with certain labels more attractive to voters than others. Do crime victims tend to prefer right-wing candidates? Can natural disasters increase the probability of voting for left-wing politicians? The current literature about the political consequences of negative events tends to focus on voters\u2019 retrospective assessments of incumbents\u2019 performance. The main argument is that citizens (mis)attribute responsibilities after negative shocks, and punish or reward incumbents according to that (mis)evaluation. However, this approach fails to notice the importance of prospective political preferences. I hold that citizens, besides blaming or gratifying incumbents for their response to a negative event, are also selecting political authorities that can enhance their welfare. Victims focus on improving their living conditions after a negative shock, which leads them to pay attention to particular policy issues that can help them to achieve that goal. As a consequence, affected voters are more likely to select candidates that are better suited to address these new policy concerns. How do voters know which candidate matches their new policy preferences? Victims can exploit certain labels to identify the politician that is more likely to implement the policies they most care about. For example, ideological labels (e.g., left and right) can work as informational shortcuts to connect candidates with simple policy outcomes (e.g., welfare and iron-fist policies). Party labels can also work as heuristics in places where ideology is less salient.", "q16": "Based on this argument, I present the following hypotheses. First, the negative event will modify voters\u2019 policy preferences. 1. I expect that disaster victims will be more likely to support the distribution of welfare policies by the government. 2. I expect that crime victims will be more likely to support the use of iron-fist policies by the government. Second, these new policy preferences will lead voters to support candidates with particular ideological labels. 3. I expect that disaster victims will be more likely to vote for left-wing candidates. 4. I expect that crime victims will be more likely to vote for right-wing candidates. Third, the previous expectations can only be true if voters are able to connect simple policy issues with ideological labels. 5. I expect that a majority of respondents will link welfare policies with left-wing candidates. 6. I expect that a majority of respondents will link iron-fist policies with right-wing candidates. I will conduct this study in Chile. This country presents the ideal conditions since disasters and crime are not rare events. Natural catastrophes are quite common across the entire national territory (Hewitt, 2014), and according to official data, 27% of households have been a crime victim in the last 12 months. Additionally, voters do have the capacity to place parties/coalitions on the ideological spectrum (Calvo and Murillo, 2012). Therefore, ideological labels can work as informational shortcuts to make informed decisions.", "q17": "This study is based on a face-to-face survey. Respondents will need to imagine they are disaster or crime victims. I follow a two-step procedure to select participants. In the first step, I select the county that better predicts the electoral results in Chile. There have been six presidential elections in this country since the transition to democracy (1989, 1993, 1999, 2005, 2009, and 2013), and 32 candidates have competed in these elections. I compare the presidential electoral results in the 345 municipalities in Chile with the national electoral results. The analysis is straightforward; for each municipality, I sum up the absolute differences between this county and the national results for the 32 candidates that ran in the six presidential elections. The municipality with the lowest absolute difference was Cerrillos. This county is part of the Greater Santiago conurbation. Table 1 reports the vote share between Chile and Cerrillos, and it is useful to visually inspect how this municipality is an excellent predictor of the national electoral results (see document attached). In summary, the goal of this analysis is to avoid implementing the survey in counties that are outliers and do not represent the average political preferences in Chile. In a second step, I will select respondents within Cerrillos. This municipality can be divided into four neighborhoods: Lo Err\u00e1zuriz, Divino Maestro, Villa M\u00e9xico, and Cerrillos. One enumerator will be assigned to each neighborhood, and within this area, we will use a random walk to select every 3rd household in a given street. It is expected that enumerators will cover the entire neighborhood by the end of the survey implementation. This study will be conducted by four enumerators in August 2017. The questionnaire can be divided into five sections. The first part will ask for general political opinions: evaluation of the president, voting preferences, etc. The second part will ask for respondents\u2019 background characteristics: age, education, etc. The third part will attempt to learn if citizens are capable of connecting simple policy ideas with ideological labels. In particular, it will ask participants to link social and iron-fist policies with left or right-wing politicians. The fourth part will use an experimental design by providing three different scenarios to participants: to be a disaster victim, to be a crime victim, and a control condition (no extra information). The disaster condition will say: \"Imagine you are a disaster victim. Yesterday there was a 9.0 earthquake in Santiago that destroyed an important part of your house and your belongings. Please take five seconds to think about the personal consequences of this disaster [WAIT FIVE SECONDS].\" The crime condition will say: \"Imagine you are a crime victim. Yesterday three people violently entered your house and stole you important and expensive belongings. Please take five seconds to think about the personal consequences of this crime [WAIT FIVE SECONDS].\" The control condition will not provide information about a disaster or a crime. The outcome for disaster victims is: \"Taking into account the post-disaster context, do you think that authorities to help victims of natural disasters should distribute social policies or that every person is responsible for his/her own welfare?\" The outcome for crime victims is: \"Taking into account the post-crime context, do you think that authorities to reduce crime should apply iron-fist policies or should focus on rehabilitation of criminals? Participants in the control condition will receive both questions (but without the phrase: \"taking into account the post-disaster/crime context\"). The fifth part will use a conjoint experiment to measure respondents\u2019 electoral choices. Participants will be asked to decide between two (non-real) candidates that will be competing for the position of president in the 2017 elections. Respondents will see information about three attributes of these two presidential candidates: ideology (left and right), profession (gardener, teacher, engineer), and age (30, 40, 50). These attributes will be randomly chosen to generate the candidates\u2019 profiles (Hainmueller, Hopkins and Yamamoto, 2014). Each of the respondents will have to evaluate five pairs of profiles and select one candidate for president. The treatment condition will be repeated by the enumerator. I include ideology as an attribute because this is a relevant political label in Chile, and should help voters to identify the candidate that will implement the policies they most care about. I also include education and age because these attributes can provide signals of candidates\u2019 competencies to address the consequences of a negative shock. These two characteristics might be seen as valence issues by voters. I use the fourth part of the survey to compute statistical power.
