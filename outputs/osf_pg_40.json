Because healthy people who have psychotic-like experiences (PLE) are at heightened risk of developing mental disorders, it is important to understand the cause of these symptoms. The present study aims to find support for the framework that abnormalities in connections of the brain (white matter) cause cognitive deficits, which in turn cause a proneness to PLE. To this end, we will look at the mediating quality of general intelligence and processing speed on the relationship between white matter and PLE (research question 1). The second goal of this study is to find out whether any specific white matter abnormalities are associated with PLE (research question 2). To investigate these questions, we will analyse the structural connectomes of 8185 participants sampled by the UK biobank using a cross-sectional design.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-13T14:03:37.969453", "date_modified": "2020-04-13T13:54:37.504115", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["Cognition", "Connectivity", "Delusions", "Hallucinations", "processing speed", "White matter"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Minke Bosma", "Tim Ziermans", "Stephen Lawrie", "Simon Cox", "Colin Buchanan", "Heather Whalley"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "a8eef3bdebf1091f903307c494ce4024acc6fa42baa375394d287d80267578b86cd46f515bcaacafb11f99c669cc61d46683805066711c146b4f749b7087c90ec67b969803cb45ca574e23a2a7769a3d5730957429c2d54c062fd6e2d1598eea3150016b92639aef7c0f313a4f82ad0c84f0e7e0c298436de81ac9d7fe2c9f69229a7332a48f2897c552bdf78e488df8", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-13T14:03:37.944027", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Minke Bosma, Stephen Lawrie, Simon Cox, Tim Ziermans, Colin Buchanan, Heather Whalley"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Research Question 1 \n\nHypothesis 1\nSlower processing speed acts as an intermediate mediator between white matter disturbances (white matter integrity and connectome integration) and lower general cognitive ability.\n\nHypothesis 2 \nLower general cognitive ability partially mediates the relationship between poorer white matter integrity and the presence of PLE. \n\nHypothesis 3 \nLower general cognitive ability partially mediates the relationship between poorer brain integration and the presence of PLE. \n\n\n\n\nResearch Question 2 \nThe four hypotheses specified below are all non-directional because previous research has provided evidence for both positive and negative associations.

Before calculation of these variables, we will apply a consistency thresholding method to the structural connectomes, to retain 30% of all connections. Then, as measures of white matter integrity, the general mean diffusivity (gMD) and general fractional anisotropy (gFA) will be extracted from the MD and FA weighted connectomes. Second, global efficiency will be calculated from both of the weighted connectomes as measures of connectome integration. The exact calculation of global efficiency can be found in Rubinov &amp; Sporns (2010).\n\nMediating variables \nThe two mediating variables in this study will be processing speed and general cognitive ability (g). Processing speed will be measured as the mean time to correctly identify matches in the UKB reaction time task. General cognitive ability will be calculated as the general factor of the scores on the UKB pairs memory, UKB reaction time, UKB prospective memory, UKB fluid intelligence and UKB numeric memory. The exact data fields and respective links to the UK biobank data showcase for these variables are provided in the supplementary materials, table 1. \n\nOutcome variables \nThis study will look at two outcome variables. For research question 1, the outcome variable will be whether participants indicated to have ever had a PLE. This variable is thus dichotomous, with two categories: ever had a PLE and never had a PLE. For research question 2, the outcome variable will be whether participants reported to have had a specific PLE. This variable is categorical, with 5 categories: Ever had an auditory hallucination, ever had a visual hallucination, ever had a persecutory delusion, ever had a delusion of reference and never had a psychotic-like experience. These variables were all derived from answers on the UKB mental health questionnaire. The exact data fields and respective links to the UK biobank data showcase for these variables are provided in the supplementary materials, table 1. More information on the exact questions of the mental health questionnaire can be found in the supplementary materials, table 2. \nData from participants who indicate having had different kinds of PLE will be used in the categories of all the PLE they reported (e.g. if a participant indicated to have had a visual hallucination and an auditory hallucination, their data will be used in both these categories). Because of the low prevalence rate of each of the PLE, we will match participants with PLE and controls by age and sex with a 1:10 ratio, where the biggest group with PLE will be taken as a benchmark (for example, if the biggest PLE category is visual hallucinations with 200 participants, the no PLE category will have 2000 participants).\n\nCovariates\nThis study will include age at recruitment, sex and amount of distress as covariates in all analyses. Amount of distress will be measured through the question \u201cHow distressing did you find having any of these experiences?\u201d. Answer possibilities where: \u201cPrefer not to answer\u201d, \u201cDo not know\u201d, \u201cNot distressing at all, it was a positive experience\u201d, \u201cNot distressing, a neutral experience\u201d, \u201cA bit distressing\u201d, \u201cQuite distressing\u201d, and \u201cVery distressing\u201d.

Before entering the scores into the PCA, the normality of the distribution of the scores will be checked. If scores aren\u2019t normally distributed, necessary transformations will be performed. Based on previous studies that looked at deriving a measure of general cognitive ability from the scores on these reaction tasks ((Fawns-Ritchie &amp; Deary, 2019; Lyall et al., 2016) we expect the all the scores to correlate with a low to medium effect size. We also expect that a single principal component will emerge from the PCA, accounting for about 40% of the variance We will therefore save the first unrotated component of this PCA as a measure of general cognitive ability. \n\nPCA for gFA and gMD\nTo obtain the general FA and MD measures, we will perform PCA on the FA and MD scores of all the connections left after thresholding of the FA and MD weighted connectomes. Before entering the scores into the PCA, the normality of the distribution of the scores will be checked. If scores aren\u2019t normally distributed, necessary transformations will be performed. Based on a study by Alloza et al. (2016) that also calculated a general FA and MD trough PCA, we expect one principal component to emerge for both FA and MD. We expect the principal component for FA to explain approximately 45% of the variance and the principal component for MD to explain about 55% of the variance. Therefore, the first unrotated principal component will be saved as a measure of either general FA or general MD.\n\nResearch question 1\nHypotheses belonging to research question one will be tested with mediation analyses through SEM. Models will be constructed using the Lavaan package in R, using the full information maximum likelihood estimation to account for missing data. We will construct 4 mediation models, alternating between general FA, general MD and global efficiency from a MD and FA weighed connectome as independent variables. \n\tRegression slopes will be estimated through SEM using linear and logistic regression. Based on Rijnhart, Twisk, Eekhout, &amp; Heymans (2019), we won\u2019t standardize the regression coefficients. We expect significant regression slopes between all measures of the independent variables (gFA,gMD, global efficiency) and the dependent variable (having PLE). We also expect significant slopes between the independent variables and mediating variables, and significant slopes on a logistic regression for the mediating variables and the dependent variable. Furthermore, we expect that the bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals of the indirect effects (a*b and d*e) and the proportion mediated (ab /(ab +c) and de/(de +a) ) does not contain zero (i.e. the indirect effects are significant). Assumptions of multivariate normality and homoscedasticity will be checked for the linear regressions. When violated, non-linear transformations or corrections will be performed. False discovery rate (FDR) corrections will be applied to correct for multiple testing. The exact model that will be entered in SEM is pictured in figure 1. As mentioned before, age, sex and amount of distress will be entered as covariates in these analyses. \n\nResearch Question 2 \nTo test the hypotheses of research question two, we will perform logistic regressions with mean FA and mean MD per ROI-ROI connection of the thresholded connectomes as independent variables, and category as dependent variable. This will result in a multitude of regression coefficients relating white matter integrity in ROI-ROI connections to PLE. To test our hypotheses that integrity in specific white matter tracts is altered for specific PLE, we will perform the Williams test for the comparison of regression slope magnitudes on the hypothesized tracts (Williams, 1959). We expect that the hypothesized tracts be significantly more strongly correlated with our dependent variable than the other connections. Again, all analyses will be corrected for multiple testing using FDR correction.\n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Figure 1.docx"}, "nodeId": "zm2gb", "sha256": "25aad9848a8430861f50986b1177f2de4791af2539b1b011d2ec25da071b98c6", "viewUrl": "/project/2jkty/files/osfstorage/5e9471dbf135350393d5a9b0/", "selectedFileName": "Figure 1.docx"}], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "If any of the predicting or mediating variables are not normally distributed, we will apply the necessary transformations to approximate normality.

Before calculation of these variables, we will apply a consistency thresholding method to the structural connectomes, to retain 30% of all connections. Then, as measures of white matter integrity, the general mean diffusivity (gMD) and general fractional anisotropy (gFA) will be extracted from the MD and FA weighted connectomes. Second, global efficiency will be calculated from both of the weighted connectomes as measures of connectome integration. The exact calculation of global efficiency can be found in Rubinov &amp; Sporns (2010).\n\nMediating variables \nThe two mediating variables in this study will be processing speed and general cognitive ability (g). Processing speed will be measured as the mean time to correctly identify matches in the UKB reaction time task. General cognitive ability will be calculated as the general factor of the scores on the UKB pairs memory, UKB reaction time, UKB prospective memory, UKB fluid intelligence and UKB numeric memory. The exact data fields and respective links to the UK biobank data showcase for these variables are provided in the supplementary materials, table 1. \n\nOutcome variables \nThis study will look at two outcome variables. For research question 1, the outcome variable will be whether participants indicated to have ever had a PLE. This variable is thus dichotomous, with two categories: ever had a PLE and never had a PLE. For research question 2, the outcome variable will be whether participants reported to have had a specific PLE. This variable is categorical, with 5 categories: Ever had an auditory hallucination, ever had a visual hallucination, ever had a persecutory delusion, ever had a delusion of reference and never had a psychotic-like experience. These variables were all derived from answers on the UKB mental health questionnaire. The exact data fields and respective links to the UK biobank data showcase for these variables are provided in the supplementary materials, table 1. More information on the exact questions of the mental health questionnaire can be found in the supplementary materials, table 2. \nData from participants who indicate having had different kinds of PLE will be used in the categories of all the PLE they reported (e.g. if a participant indicated to have had a visual hallucination and an auditory hallucination, their data will be used in both these categories). Because of the low prevalence rate of each of the PLE, we will match participants with PLE and controls by age and sex with a 1:10 ratio, where the biggest group with PLE will be taken as a benchmark (for example, if the biggest PLE category is visual hallucinations with 200 participants, the no PLE category will have 2000 participants).\n\nCovariates\nThis study will include age at recruitment, sex and amount of distress as covariates in all analyses. Amount of distress will be measured through the question \u201cHow distressing did you find having any of these experiences?\u201d. Answer possibilities where: \u201cPrefer not to answer\u201d, \u201cDo not know\u201d, \u201cNot distressing at all, it was a positive experience\u201d, \u201cNot distressing, a neutral experience\u201d, \u201cA bit distressing\u201d, \u201cQuite distressing\u201d, and \u201cVery distressing\u201d. We will recode all the informative (the last 5) answers from -1 (not distressing at all) to 3 (very distressing). The exact data fields and respective links to the UK biobank data showcase for these variables are provided in the supplementary materials, table 1.

The score for processing speed will be calculated as the mean time to correctly identify matches on 12 trials of the UKB reaction time task\n", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "PCA for general cognitive ability \nTo create a score for general cognitive ability the test scores on UKB pairs memory, UKB reaction time, UKB prospective memory, UKB fluid intelligence and UKB numeric memory will be entered in a PCA. Before entering the scores into the PCA, the normality of the distribution of the scores will be checked. If scores aren\u2019t normally distributed, necessary transformations will be performed. Based on previous studies that looked at deriving a measure of general cognitive ability from the scores on these reaction tasks ((Fawns-Ritchie &amp; Deary, 2019; Lyall et al., 2016) we expect the all the scores to correlate with a low to medium effect size. We also expect that a single principal component will emerge from the PCA, accounting for about 40% of the variance We will therefore save the first unrotated component of this PCA as a measure of general cognitive ability. \n\nPCA for gFA and gMD\nTo obtain the general FA and MD measures, we will perform PCA on the FA and MD scores of all the connections left after thresholding of the FA and MD weighted connectomes. Before entering the scores into the PCA, the normality of the distribution of the scores will be checked. If scores aren\u2019t normally distributed, necessary transformations will be performed. Based on a study by Alloza et al. (2016) that also calculated a general FA and MD trough PCA, we expect one principal component to emerge for both FA and MD. We expect the principal component for FA to explain approximately 45% of the variance and the principal component for MD to explain about 55% of the variance. Therefore, the first unrotated principal component will be saved as a measure of either general FA or general MD.\n\nResearch question 1\nHypotheses belonging to research question one will be tested with mediation analyses through SEM. Models will be constructed using the Lavaan package in R, using the full information maximum likelihood estimation to account for missing data. We will construct 4 mediation models, alternating between general FA, general MD and global efficiency from a MD and FA weighed connectome as independent variables. \n\tRegression slopes will be estimated through SEM using linear and logistic regression. Based on Rijnhart, Twisk, Eekhout, &amp; Heymans (2019), we won\u2019t standardize the regression coefficients. We expect significant regression slopes between all measures of the independent variables (gFA,gMD, global efficiency) and the dependent variable (having PLE). We also expect significant slopes between the independent variables and mediating variables, and significant slopes on a logistic regression for the mediating variables and the dependent variable. Furthermore, we expect that the bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals of the indirect effects (a*b and d*e) and the proportion mediated (ab /(ab +c) and de/(de +a) ) does not contain zero (i.e. the indirect effects are significant). Assumptions of multivariate normality and homoscedasticity will be checked for the linear regressions. When violated, non-linear transformations or corrections will be performed. False discovery rate (FDR) corrections will be applied to correct for multiple testing. The exact model that will be entered in SEM is pictured in figure 1. As mentioned before, age, sex and amount of distress will be entered as covariates in these analyses. \n\nResearch Question 2 \nTo test the hypotheses of research question two, we will perform logistic regressions with mean FA and mean MD per ROI-ROI connection of the thresholded connectomes as independent variables, and category as dependent variable. This will result in a multitude of regression coefficients relating white matter integrity in ROI-ROI connections to PLE. To test our hypotheses that integrity in specific white matter tracts is altered for specific PLE, we will perform the Williams test for the comparison of regression slope magnitudes on the hypothesized tracts (Williams, 1959). We expect that the hypothesized tracts be significantly more strongly correlated with our dependent variable than the other connections. Again, all analyses will be corrected for multiple testing using FDR correction.\n\n", "q17.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e9471dbf135350393d5a9b0", "file_name": "Figure 1.docx", "file_urls": {"html":

Here, we will assess the scientific literature to analyze the characteristics of articles published on COVID-19 during the first 3 months of this pandemic. We will assess the type, quantity, and quality of this literature to get an insight in the available knowledge base for controlling this pandemic early on. We will divide the literature in primary and secondary articles. Primary articles refer to original research studies that create new or confirming data on a problem, e.g. an health issue. Secondary articles use these data to assess the current knowledge status on this problem. We will also compare the publishing pattern during the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic with this pattern during the most recent pandemic, i.e., the H1N1 pandemic.\n\nOBJECTIVES\nOur main objectives are summarized in the following 3 research questions: \n(1) What is the prevalence of primary and secondary articles on COVID-19 in the first 3 months of the pandemic?\n(2) What are the characteristics of both primary and secondary articles?\n(3) How does the publishing pattern during the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic compare with the publishing pattern of the last pandemic, i.e., Swine Flu pandemic?\n\nMETHODS\nType of study\nWe will conduct a cross-sectional (meta-epidemiological) study.\n\nReporting of the study\nWe will use Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement as the framework for reporting this study (von Elm 2007). We will report our methods for the Swine Flu sample at the end of the methods section. \n\nEligibility criteria\nAny type of article published on COVID-19 will be eligible. This implies that a broad spectrum of articles ranging from letters to the editors to randomized controlled trials will be included. No eligibility criteria will be applied to specific participants, interventions, comparators, outcomes, endpoints, or settings of the articles. Articles that did not present an abstract as well as abstracts that were not reported  in English will be excluded.\n\nInformation sources and search strategy\nWe will search eligible articles on COVID-19  in PubMed (MEDLINE) till April 2 2020. Our search strategy for PubMed (MEDLINE) is presented in Table 1 and will be prepared for the eligible search dates. We will use the search string \u201c(COVID-19 OR COVID)\u201d and apply the filter \u2018Abstract\u2019.\n\nTable 1.

These operators pilot tested these methods on 40 articles to calibrate operators and to fine-tune research methods, e.g., the data extraction forms (Table 2). Disagreements during the selection of articles and data extraction procedures will be resolved through discussions between these operators. A methodologist will be consulted in the case of persisting disagreements. We will report the flow of our selection of articles and will include our raw data with the final research study.\n\nTable 2.

Primary articles cover original research studies and secondary articles cover perspectives and syntheses of the available knowledge on COVID-19 such as, viewpoints, commentaries, guidelines, reviews etc. Primary articles will be divided in 5 groups, i.e., human medical research, in silico, in vitro, animal research, and surveys or studies on health professionals. These groups will be further subdivided according to the pertinent research designs.\nOur classification of articles will not be exclusively based on the labels assigned by the authors of the articles, because of the potential risk of  mislabeling (Esene 2014). We will weigh the author\u2019 labels before assigning our final classification. \n\nAbstract assessment\nWe will screen the abstracts to assess whether objectives and limitations of the article were reported or not. Limitations will be subdivided in methodological and general limitations. The former refers to reporting of at least one methodological limitation in the abstract. General limitations refer to reporting some sort of limitation not inherent to the design of the paper, e.g., further research on this topic is needed etc. \n\nInformation sources and search strategy for the Swine Flu sample\nWe will search PubMed (MEDLINE) for eligible articles on H1N1 during the first 3 months of the Swine Flu outbreak (04/25/09-7/25/09). Our search strategy for PubMed (MEDLINE) is presented in Table 3. We will use the search string \u201c((H1N1) OR \"swine influenza\")\u201d and apply the filter \u2018Abstract\u2019. This search strategy will be prepared for the eligible search dates.\n\nTable 3.

We will report on the classification of primary and secondary articles in this sample. \n\nData analysis\nWe will use descriptive statistics expressed as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) and ranges or absolute counts and percentages. Multivariate logistic regression models will be developed to explore factors associated with the primary outcomes and to provide odds ratio adjusted for confounders (Peng &amp; So, 2002; Heck, Thomas &amp; Tabata, 2013). Variables will be retained in the models regardless of their statistical significance. Goodness of fit will be assessed with Hosmer-Lemshow test and Nagelkerke R squared. Data analyses and figures will be done with SPSS (version 24, IBM) and R 3.6.3 (R Core Team, 2020, www.R-project.org/). \n\nOutcomes\nTable 4 summarizes our planned outcomes. For most of these outcomes we will calculate prevalence statistics. We did not involve patients or other stakeholders in developing our research questions or outcomes.\n\nTable 4.

After the completion of our pilot tests we decided not to extract these data, because they could not be extracted reliably. This manuscript represents the latest version of our protocol, i.e., the protocol after the completion of our pilot tests. All differences between this protocol and the methods used in the study will be reported in the final manuscript of the study with rationale.\n\nREFERENCES\nEsene 2014\nEsene IN, Ngu J, El Zoghby M, et al.

S\u00e9n\u00e9chal and Young, 2008). Yet, families with low social economic status (SES) might provide less stimulating environment for language development to their children, as compared to families with high SES, as they have sparser access to books and engage less frequently in shared reading interactions (Kelly et al., 2011, Melhuish et al., 2008). For instance, it has been estimated, that by the age of 4 years, toddlers from low SES families have heard about 30 million less words than peers from higher SES families (Hart and Risley, 1995). The current longitudinal study aims to assess home activities and interactions that parents engage in with their 8 to 36-month-old infants during the period of coronavirus lockdown in the UK, and to examine their role in early vocabulary development of British infants across families varying in SES-background.

(2D:4D)", "description": "1. Background\n\nAutism spectrum conditions are characterised by routine behaviours, narrow interests, and social and communicative difficulties (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).  There is a marked sex difference in autism diagnosis, with approximately four males being diagnosed per every one female (Fombonne, 2009), an effect that may (at least in part) be explainable in terms of atypical foetal sex hormone exposure (Auyeung et al., 2009; Baron-Cohen et al., 2015, 2019).  The prevalence of autism is approximately 1-2% (e.g. Baron-Cohen et al., 2009), which is a marked increase from Lotter's (1966) early estimate of 0.04%.  There are several reasons why prevalence might have increased, which include better recognition of autistic symptoms, growth of relevant services, and broadening of diagnostic criteria to include Asperger\u2019s disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS).  However, it appears unlikely that these factors completely explain the effect.\n\nWith excellent attention to detail, and the ability to remain focussed on repetitive tasks, autistic people are often found to have an aptitude for working in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) industries (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, &amp; Clubley, 2001; Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Stott, Bolton, &amp; Goodyer, 1997).  This effect also appears to extend to the broader autism phenotype (BAP), those people who display higher than average levels of autistic traits, but who do not themselves warrant a clinical diagnosis.  It has also been suggested that autism might be subject to positive assortative mating (i.e., people who measure highly in autistic traits may be more likely than chance to have children together; Baron-Cohen, 2006a, 2006b).  However, there is more than once process by which this could operate.  For instance, it could be that individuals with similar levels of autistic traits consciously or unconsciously seek each other out as romantic partners (active assortment) or that individuals with similar levels of autistic traits are more likely than chance to share other characteristics, such as a working environment, which lead to increased chances of a relationship starting (social homogamy) (see Kardum, Hudek-Knezevic, Schmitt, &amp; Covic, 2017).  In addition, individuals may begin relationships with others who are more similar to themselves than expected by chance as regards autistic traits (initial assortment) or become more similar to their partner over the course of their relationship (convergence) (Kardum et al., 2017).\n\nEvidence for the idea that autism is subject to assortative mating is provided by the observation that a person diagnosed with autism is 10-12 times more likely to marry or have a child with another autistic person than is someone without such a diagnosis (Nordsletten et al., 2016).  Furthermore, greater genetic similarity between the parents of autistic children than would be expected by chance has been reported (Connolly, Anney, Gallagher, &amp; Heron, 2019), as have positive spousal correlations for a quantitative measure of autistic traits (Constantino &amp; Todd, 2005).  Assortative mating may have important implications, and a greater recognition of such processes may help us understand geographical trends in autism prevalence.  This latter point is made clearer by the finding that rates of autism can sometimes cluster (Mazumdar, King, Liu, Zerubavel, &amp; Bearman, 2010; van Meter et al., 2010), with children in Eindhoven (i.e. the \u2018Silicon Valley of Europe\u2019) being twice as likely to be autistic as children from two similar sized cities (Utrecht and Haarlem) in the Netherlands (Roelfsema et al., 2012).\n\nThe proposed research aims to increase our understanding of the processes that might underpin assortative mating in autism.  More specifically, we aim to determine whether autistic traits, empathizing, systemizing, and prenatal sex hormone exposure (as indexed by 2D:4D ratio) are correlated between heterosexual dating couples.\n\n\n2. Method\n\n2.1 A priori power analysis\n\nWe conducted an a priori power analysis using G*Power 3.1 (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, &amp; Lang, 2009; Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007) to determine the sample size.  Assuming a medium effect size (r = 0.30) for intra-couple correlations on personality variables (e.g. Kardum et al., 2017) and 80% power, this analysis determined that a sample size of n=67 couples would be required to observe a statistically significant effect (p smaller than 0.05) with a one-tailed Pearson\u2019s correlation test.\n\n2.2 Apparatus/Materials\n\n2.2.1 Demographics\nParticipants will report their sex, age, ethnicity, living status (i.e. whether or not living with their partner), length of relationship, marital status, educational level, student status, occupational status, and autism diagnostic status (see Appendix for wording of questions and response options).\n\n2.2.2 Autistic traits and related measures\nWe will use the autism spectrum quotient (AQ; Baron-Cohen et al., 2001) to measure autistic traits, the Empathy Quotient (EQ; Baron-Cohen &amp; Wheelwright, 2004) to measure empathizing, and the Systemizing Quotient-Revised (SQ-R; Wheelwright et al., 2006) to measure systemizing.  In addition, we will use the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Hill, Raste, &amp; Plumb, 2001) and the Embedded Figures Test (Witkin, Oltman, Raskin, &amp; Karp, 1971), as behavioural tasks that tap into abilities prerequisite to empathizing and systemizing, respectively.\n\n2.2.3 Digit Ratio (2D:4D)\nPrenatal testosterone exposure will be estimated via the proxy measure of digit ratio (2D:4D), i.e. the ratio of length between the second (index) and fourth (ring) fingers (see Manning et al., 1998; Manning, 2008).  The second and fourth fingers will be measured directly from participants\u2019 hands by Research Assistants and MSc students using digital Vernier callipers (see Manning, 2008).  Two sets of measurements will be taken in the following order: R2D, R4D, L2D, L4D.  These will then be used to calculate two sets of R2D:4D (R2D:4D1 and R2D:4D2) and L2D:4D (L2D:4D1 and L2D:4D2) measurements.  Assuming that the intraclass-correlation coefficients (ICC) for the two sets of measurements are high, these will be averaged to produce the R2D:4D and L2D:4D values used in all further analyses.  If the measurements are found not to be reliable, we will use whichever set of measurements provides the lower standard deviation.  M2D:4D will be calculated as the average of R2D:4D L2D:4D, and D[R-L] will be calculated as the arithmetic mean difference between R2D:4D and L2D:4D (see (Manning, 2002).\n\n\n3. Study 1: Assortative Mating on Autistic Traits and Related Measures\n\n3.1 Hypotheses and analysis plan\n\nH1: There will be sex differences for each autism-related variable\n\uf0a7\tPaired samples t tests to examine the difference in partners\u2019 AQ scores (predicted direction: males higher than females)\n\uf0a7\tPaired samples t test to examine the difference in partners\u2019 EQ scores (predicted direction: females higher than males)\n\uf0a7\tPaired samples t test to examine the difference in partners\u2019 SQ-R scores (predicted direction: males higher than females)\n\uf0a7\tPaired samples t test to examine the difference in partners\u2019 D scores (predicted direction: males higher [i.e. more male-typical] than females)\n\uf0a7\tPaired samples t test to examine the difference in partners\u2019 RMET scores (predicted direction: females higher than males)\n\uf0a7\tPaired samples t test to examine the difference in partners\u2019 EFT mean response times (predicted direction: males faster than females)\n\nH2: Variables related to social homogamy will be positively correlated within couples\n\uf0a7\tPearson\u2019s correlation test to determine the association between males\u2019 age and the age of their female partners (predicted direction: positive correlation)\n\uf0a7\tSpearman\u2019s correlation test to determine the association between males\u2019 educational attainment and the educational attainment of their female partners (predicted direction: positive correlation)\n\uf0a7\tChi-square test to determine whether males\u2019 STEM status is associated with the STEM status of their female partners (predicted direction: males working/studying in STEM will be more likely than chance to have female partners working/studying in STEM)\n\nH3: Autism-related variables will be positively correlated within couples\n\uf0a7\tPearson\u2019s correlation test to determine the association between males\u2019 total AQ scores and the total AQ scores of their female partners (predicted direction: positive correlation)\n\uf0a7\tPearson\u2019s correlation test to determine the association between males\u2019 total EQ scores and the total EQ scores of their female partners (predicted direction: positive correlation)\n\uf0a7\tPearson\u2019s correlation test to determine the association between males\u2019 total SQ-R scores and the total SQ-R scores of their female partners (predicted direction: positive correlation)\n\uf0a7\tPearson\u2019s correlation test to determine the association between males\u2019 D scores and the D scores of their female partners (predicted direction: positive correlation)\n\uf0a7\tPearson\u2019s correlation test to determine the association between males\u2019 total RMET scores and the total RMET scores of their female partners (predicted direction: positive correlation)\n\uf0a7\tPearson\u2019s correlation test to determine the association between males\u2019 EFT mean response time and the EFT mean response time of their female partners (predicted direction: positive correlation)\n\nH4: Intra-couple similarity for autism-related variables will be higher for actual couples than for random male/female pairings\n\uf0a7\tWithin couple difference scores for autism-related variables will be calculated by subtracting the standardised score for females from the standardised score for males (for each of AQ, EQ, SQ-R, RMET, and EFT, respectively [note that sex-specific standardised D scores will be calculated separately]).  We will then compute random-pairings' difference scores for each of these variables as averages of all other male/female pairings that are possible within the dataset.\n\uf0a7\tWithin-subjects t tests will be used to compare the observed standardised difference scores (i.e. for actual couples) with the average similarity scores for random pairings.\no\tIt is predicted that observed standardised difference scores for AQ, EQ, SQ-R, D, RMET, and EFT will be smaller than the corresponding average standardised difference scores computed for all other possible male/female pairings.\n\nH5: Intra-couple similarity for autism-related variables will reflect initial assortment rather than convergence\n\uf0a7\tPearson\u2019s correlation tests to determine the association between length of relationship and intra-couple similarity for autism-related variables (i.e. standardised female AQ, EQ, SQ-R, RMET, and EFT scores subtracted from male standardised AQ, EQ, SQ-R, RMET, and EFT scores, respectively [note that the difference in sex-specific standardised D scores will be calculated separately]) (prediction: no correlations)\no\tNo statistically significant (i.e. p smaller than 0.05, two-tailed) association between length of relationship and the outcome variable will signify initial assortment rather than convergence.\no\tConvergence may be indicated if there is a significant negative correlation between length of relationship and intra-couple similarity (i.e. with low scores indicating greater similarity).  However, it should be noted that greater resemblance within couples who have been together longer could also indicate that couples who are more similarly matched at baseline are more likely to remain together compared to couples that are more disparate at baseline.\n\nH6: Intra-couple similarity for autism-related variables may reflect social homogamy (in regard to age and educational attainment) or active assortment\n\uf0a7\tPearson\u2019s correlation tests to determine the association between intra-couple similarity in age (i.e. female age subtracted from male age) and intra-couple similarity in autism-related variables (i.e. standardised female AQ, EQ, SQ-R, RMET, and EFT scores subtracted from standardised male AQ, EQ, SQ-R, RMET, and EFT scores, respectively [note that the difference in sex-specific standardised D scores will be calculated separately]) (prediction: no direction of effects predicted)\n\uf0a7\tSpearman\u2019s correlation tests to determine the association between intra-couple similarity in educational attainment (i.e. female educational attainment subtracted from male educational attainment) and intra-couple similarity in autism-related variables (i.e. standardised female AQ, EQ, SQ-R, RMET, and EFT scores subtracted from standardised male AQ, EQ, SQ-R, RMET, and EFT scores, respectively [note that the difference in sex-specific standardised D scores will be calculated separately]) (prediction: no direction of effects predicted)\no\tNo statistically significant (i.e. p smaller than 0.05, two-tailed) association between intra-couple similarity in age and/or educational attainment and intra-couple similarity in autism-related variables will signify active assortment rather than social homogamy.\no\tSocial homogamy will be indicated if intra-couple similarity in autism-related variables is positively correlated with intra-couple similarity in age and/or educational attainment. \n\nH7: Social homogamy regarding STEM status will influence intra-couple similarity for autism-related variables\n\uf0a7\tBetween-subjects t tests to compare intra-couple similarity in autism-related variables (i.e. AQ, EQ, SQ-R, D, RMET, and EFT) between couples for whom both members work/study in STEM and couples for whom either one or neither member work/study in STEM (prediction: similarity in AQ, EQ, SQ-R, D, RMET, and EFT scores will be higher in couples for whom both members work/study in STEM areas)\n\n\n4. Study 2: Assortative Mating and Digit Ratio (2D:4D)\n\nStudies by Manning (2002, p. 50) and Voracek, Dressler, and Manning (2007) reported statistically significant positive correlations between the digit ratios of heterosexual partners.  However, more recent studies (e.g. Kalichman, Batsevich, &amp; Kobyliansky, 2019; Richards, Bellin, &amp; Davies, 2017) have not observed such effects.  We therefore intend to meta-analyse the available data to determine whether or not such effects exist.\n\nIt became obvious from initial literature searches that using relevant search terms (e.g. \u2018assortative mating\u2019, \u2018spousal correlation\u2019, \u2018partner correlation\u2019) would not return some of the studies of which we were already aware that include relevant data.  The reason for this is that studies that have collected 2D:4D from spouses have rarely done so specifically to investigate the possibility of assortative mating (e.g. Hauth, de Bruijn, Staal, Buitelaar, &amp; Rommelse, 2014).  For this reason, we do not intend to conduct a systematic literature review, but will use Review Manager (Cochrane Collaboration, 2019) to conduct quantitative meta-analyses for all relevant available data of which we are aware (including those of Study 1).  If a small number of studies with substantially different sample sizes are identified, we will compute fixed-effects models (i.e. to reduce the influence of imprecise small studies on the overall sample size estimate); if there is no large discrepancy in sample size (or we identify tens of relevant studies), we will conduct random-effects models.  Causes of between-study heterogeneity will be examined qualitatively, and the potential for publication bias will be evaluated via visual assessment of funnel plots.\n\n4.1 Hypotheses and analysis plan\n\nH1: R2D:4D will be positively correlated between romantic partners\nH2: L2D:4D will be positively correlated between romantic partners\nH3: M2D:4D will be positively correlated between romantic partners\nH4: D[R-L] will be not be correlated between romantic partners\n\n\nReferences\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

with a disproportionate distribution of 79% in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The cost of illness of diabetes will pressurize the health system in LMICs as primary health care (PHC) systems are traditionally organized for acute care and the main sources of health care financing are through general taxation and out-of-pocket payment.\n\nWith reference to Declaration of Alma-Ata, PHC includes both community and primary facility-based care, ranging from promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative services. Targeting PHC is a sustainable and relatively inexpensive approach in addressing the issues that contributes to the loses in care.\n\nThere were systematic reviews on effectiveness of different interventions on diabetes care carried out at the facility level. Systematic reviews that included studies from developed countries showed that multicomponent intervention improved T2D care. Outcomes measured by most of the systematic reviews are intermediate clinical outcomes (e.g. glycaemic control) and process of care. Despite a large body of literature on different interventions on diabetes management, little evidence is known for LMICs with different priorities, workforce and financial arrangement. There is also a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of complex intervention in this setting. Hence, we would like to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize evidence on complex interventions for type 2 diabetes in primary health care setting of LMICs.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-16T05:22:13.168671", "date_modified": "2020-04-16T04:26:30.096666", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Xin Rou Teh", "Masliyana Husin", "Sheamini Sivasampu", "Su May Liew", "Ka Keat Lim"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "338573cbd9aa6968c07f5907ef6eb66f7e9aca7c9346122be18cf5d832fe3540743db7992bf7168002d8bc314be1d02eb79309b40b022d1a31cb0aeb9d6cc36e5f3ab19b1ea1334bd65170ab25e41b0bf1f85e0e01265594faf9e17e9a11e8ba01c64aa410dd98d264edf04e2fed920b7765db2fda2db34511213d9f03f1b4382e24dfa9f83772bde997fcff01c395fe", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-16T05:22:13.152797", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Xin Rou Teh, Masliyana Husin, Sheamini Sivasampu, Liew Su May, Ka Keat Lim"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Review Question: Is complex intervention on Type 2 diabetes patients in primary health care setting effective at improving clinical and patient-reported outcomes in low- and middle-income countries?"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": ["No blinding is involved in this study."]}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q6": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Systematic review and meta-analyses"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": "Not applicable"}, "q8": {"extra": [], "value": "Registration prior to analysis of the data"}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q10": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Trials will be identified through systematic searches from inception of the following databases until date of search will be\nincluded:\n1.

Further clarification with the study author will be made if the uncertainty is relevant to determine the eligibility\nof the study. When there is disagreement, both reviewers will discuss and come to a consensus. If disagreement persists, opinion from third reviewer (KKL/SS) is needed. Reasons of exclusion will be recorded. For final selection, all included full text studies will be screened against the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
