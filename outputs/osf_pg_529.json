Cold calling within the context of teaching is a technique involving randomly calling on a student to answer a question or solve a problem during class. Presumably, teachers do so because they believe that this strategy is effective in motivating their students to pay attention to the material that are teaching and to effectively encode that material. In this experiment, we will test the hypothesis that students who anticipate being cold called during a lecture will pay more attention to the lecture (and learn more from the lecture) relative to students who do not expect to be cold called. Additionally, we will explore the possibility that the effectiveness of cold calling may depend on the extent to which a student experiences performance anxiety. Students with high performance anxiety may be particularly likely to pay attention and effectively learn the lecture material in the cold calling condition because they are motivated to avoid embarrassing themselves by not knowing the answer to the question.
