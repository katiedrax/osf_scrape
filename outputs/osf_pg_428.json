The answers will then be coded to automatically count the number of moral words by using both the original Moral Foundations dictionary (http://moralfoundations.org/sites/default/files/files/downloads/moral%20foundations%20dictionary.dic) and an expanded version of the same dictionary created by me, by including synonyms and antonyms from word net (https://wordnet.princeton.edu). Importantly, this study does not seek to associate any particular moral views to specific identities. Rather, my goal is to compare how each form of political engagement (partisan versus ideological) uses moral adjectives to describe someone in the outgroup.", "q16": "1. Participants receiving the party identification treatment use, overall, moral adjectives differently than participants in the other three treatments. 2. Participants receiving the ideology treatment use, overall, moral adjectives differently than participants in the other three treatments. 3. Participants use moral adjectives differently when describing someone they know personally and a public figure. 4. The stronger the attachment, the more likely the participant is to use moral words. 5. Partisans use moral words differently when describing someone who identifies with the same party, who identifies with the opposite party, who identifies as an independent and who is not politically engaged. 6. Ideologues use moral words differently when describing someone who identifies with the same ideology, who identifies with the opposite ideology, who identifies as a moderate and who is not politically engaged.", "q17": "All hypotheses will be tested by a simple poisson teste of differences in ratio between the count of moral words used to describe the the ingroup and the outgroup. For robustness, I will also run a poisson linear model of count moral words on available demographic variables (party identification, self-described ideology, religion, gender, race/ethnicity).", "q18": "United States of America", "q19": "approximately 400", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "100924", "q25": "2/3/16", "q26": "Researchers", "q27": "", "q28": "No", "q29": "", "q30": "", "q31": "", "q32": "", "q33": ["Experimental Design"], "q34": ["Elections"], "q35": "Agree", "q36": "Agree", "q37": [{"file_id": "5e384a27fa39b701691dbee5", "file_name": "20161125AA_survey.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/rp4na/files/osfstorage/5e384a27fa39b701691dbee5", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e384a27fa39b701691dbee5"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "ad115899e2799f41010f175c91aede38d67187d97c442e430644101fb4884e91"}}], "q38": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=rp4na", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "rp4na", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "rp4na", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/d5gfm/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "d5gfm", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3ue8s/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "3ue8s", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0f/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0f", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/rp4na/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/rp4na/"}}, {"id": "dfqw7", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Do Politicians' Relatives Get Better Jobs?

We can imagine two reasons why they might. One explanation is that elected officials respond more favorably to members of their in-group (Butler and Crabtree, 2015). Using both observational methods and experimental studies, scholars have repeatedly found that office holders respond more often and provide better advice to individuals like them (Grose, 2014; Butler, 2014). These findings suggest that since elected officials are citizens and mostly native-born, they should prefer to help native-born constituents over immigrants. A second explanation is rooted in the importance that elected officials place on retaining office. In theory, office-seeking politicians should focus their work on maximizing voter support.

We can imagine two reasons why they might. One explanation is that elected officials respond more favorably to members of their in-group (Butler and Crabtree, 2015). Using both observational methods and experimental studies, scholars have repeatedly found that office holders respond more often and provide better advice to individuals like them (Grose, 2014; Butler, 2014). These findings suggest that since elected officials are citizens and mostly native-born, they should prefer to help native-born constituents over immigrants. A second explanation is rooted in the importance that elected officials place on retaining office. In theory, office-seeking politicians should focus their work on maximizing voter support. To the degree that this is true, we should expect office holders to favor the native born, whose citizenship is conferred automatically, than immigrants, only a fraction of whom attain citizenship.
