Stimulation (tDCS) is a safe and accessible, non-invasive brain stimulation technique for testing causal links between different brain regions and functions.  However, the effectiveness of single-trial tDCS to manipulate higher-order cognitive functions, such as memory, is in question. This study will investigate the extent to which 20 minutes of anodal tDCS to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), relative to a sham stimulation condition, impacts recollection accuracy and working memory performance as a function of time-of-day in younger and older adults. We also will include an active parietal stimulation control in younger adults. Moreover, this study will test the extent that tDCS to dlPFC impacts memory performance by modulating impacting information-specific processes and/or cognitive control processes that operate across different types of information, thereby informing basic theories of how dlPFC contributes to memory in younger and older adults."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "1.  Younger Adults Primary Hypothesis: dlPFC tDCS/Sham X AM/PM. We hypothesize that tDCS benefits may be larger during suboptimal times of cognitive function. For younger adults, we predict that tDCS of the dlPFC will improve episodic memory accuracy and working memory, relative to sham tDCS or active parietal tDCS. We also predict larger tDCS benefits during the AM than PM session (i.e., the suboptimal time of cognitive function for many younger adults).\n\n2. Older Adults Primary Hypothesis: dlPFC tDCS/Sham X AM/PM. We predict that tDCS of the dlPFC will improve episodic memory accuracy and working memory in older adults, relative to sham tDCS, with larger benefits during the PM session than the AM session (i.e., the suboptimal time of cognitive function for many older adults). \n\n3. Owl-Lark Hypotheses: tDCS effects may be moderated by time of day preferences, so in secondary analyses of tDCS effects we will assess tDCS effects as a function of an individual\u2019s optimal time of processing (measured by self-report and wrist accelerometry) instead of age group. We predict larger tDCS benefits during suboptimal times of processing.\n\n4. Task-based Hypotheses: To the extent that tDCS boosts memory by improving cognitively controlled processes, high difficulty items should benefit more from tDCS than low difficulty items on each memory task.

The first set of primary analyses will estimate the effect of tDCS to left dlPFC on cognitive performance and the extent to which different aspects of the cognitive task will be impacted. These analyses will be done separately for episodic and working memory. \n\n1.a This analysis will be done on younger adults only.  We shall use a linear mixed (i.e., random participant-level intercepts) model with memory performance (defined as memory accuracy computed by subtracting false alarms from target hits) as the dependent variable and stimulation condition (stimulation vs. sham), session Time of Day (AM, PM), and task manipulations (stimulus format and difficulty) as within-subjects predictors along with session order as a covariate (session 1, session 2). Interaction terms between stimulation condition and both task manipulation and time of day will be used to examine the impact of these variables on the stimulation effect.\n\n1.b This analysis will use the same model as in 1a (above), but including data from both younger and older adults and a corresponding age-group factor in the model. Interaction terms between age group, stimulation condition, and time-of-day will be used to determine whether the overall stimulation effect is the same for older as for younger adults, and if not, whether the difference varies by time of day.\n\n1.c This analysis will assess the impact of preferred time of day on tDCS effects, using wrist-worn (minimum 7-days, max 12-days) accelerometry to measure preferred time of day (i.e. \u201cOwl\u201d vs \u201cLark\u201d), and validation using the subjective Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ). For this analysis, accelerometry-derived variables capturing preferred time of days (eg, including wake time, rise time and midpoint of sleep) will be added as covariates to the model in 1.b., and interactions between these, time of day and stimulation effects will be evaluated.\n\n\n\nSet 2. The second set of primary analyses will focus on dlPFC vs parietal vs sham effects in younger adults only. For these analyses, similar models to those described above will be used (e.g., 1a, 1c, 2), except we will include 3 levels for tDCS (dlPFC, parietal, sham). We will test the relative fit of three models: (1) a model in which parietal has the same effect as sham, (2) a model in which parietal has the same effect as dlPFC, and (3) a model in which the effect of parietal differs from the other two conditions.\n\nAll analyses will initially be performed without using the baseline performance measures. We shall then repeat each analysis adjusting for the baseline value of the cognitive measure being analyzed. To the extent that the cognitive measures are highly correlated across timepoints, the latter analyses will provide additional power.\n\nSTATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE\n\nA two-sided p-value cutoff of 0.05 will be used for all null-hypothesis significance testing. In addition, point estimates for all first order and interaction effects will be reported, together with 95% confidence intervals. Between-individual contrasts (e.g., overall treatment effects) will be standardized (i.e., equivalent to Cohen\u2019s d). Results of all analyses performed will be reported (not just those that meet the 0.05 cutoff). Since Hypotheses 1-4 are distinct, we shall not make any adjustment for multiple testing across the corresponding analyses. Within each analysis, we shall use a hierarchical approach in which we begin with an overall test of the null hypothesis at the coarsest level, separately for episodic and working memory, and only if that is statistically significant will we conduct further testing among subgroups.\n\nAlthough the primary analyses will utilize the frequentist approach to estimating and testing, we will complement this with a secondary Bayesian analysis using the same model. For parameters capturing treatment effects or between-group differences in treatment effects (i.e., interaction terms), we shall use a weakly informative prior (e.g., Normal(0, 1-10)). The primary value of this analysis will be to provide more interpretable (i.e. probability) statements about the magnitude of the effects of tDCS and about the amount of information contained in the data.\n\nSECONDARY ANALYSES\nWe will assess the impact of sleep quality for the prior night on tDCS effects, using wrist accelerometer data to measure sleep quality (eg, sleep fragmentation as total number of awakenings and sleep stage shifts divided by total sleep time, sleep efficiency as sleep duration divided by the time between the start and end of the first and last nocturnal inactivity period).  Sleep diaries will provide data missing from the objective measures, where applicable.

We don\u2019t anticipate this threshold to exclude many  subjects.\n\n Exclusion Criteria:\nNeuropsychological conditions associated with cognitive decline or seizure\nCochlear implants or metal in the brain/skull (except titanium)\nNon-removable metal earrings or metal dental braces\n Psychoactive medications, diagnosis of depression, bipolar disorder, or any psychotic diagnoses\n History of excessive use (clinically treated) alcohol or narcotics\n Hospitalization for head trauma (e.g. concussions) in the past 5 years\n Individuals above a threshold score on an assessment of depression, specifically, a score of 10 or above on the PHQ-9 (Manea et al., 2012)\n Risk of pregnancy\n Low tolerance of skin irritation\n Prior brain stimulation experience (self-report)\n\n\n Study Enrollment Procedures \nYounger adults will be recruited from the University of Chicago (primarily students) and surrounding community, and older adults will be recruited from a database maintained by the Gallo lab, as well as newly recruited participants from the Chicago area using word-of-mouth and advertisements (e.g., Chicago Tribune). \nThe Study Coordinator will recruit participants, and if they are eligible and wish to participate, use AM/PM Randomization REDCap database to assign them to have their AM session first or their PM session first. The participant will then be scheduled for all 3 sessions.\nParticipants will give informed consent for all 3 sessions during the baseline/study orientation day. All participants must consent for themselves. At this time they are considered enrolled.\nYounger adults will be paid $10.00 for the first session, $20.00 for the second session and $40.00 for the final session. They can exchange $10.00 for one course credit, for up to three credits. \nOlder adults will be paid $20.00 for the first session, $30.00 for the second session and $50.00 for the final session.\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "The primary manipulation is the tDCS stimulation condition. The stimulation condition (tDCS active vs. sham) is manipulated between-subjects, while time of testing (AM/PM) is manipulated within-subjects, and age (younger, older) is between-subjects. More specifically: 50 Younger Adults will be randomly assigned to three between-subjects tDCS conditions (left prefrontal active stimulation, left parietal active stimulation, left sham stimulation (\u00bd prefrontal, \u00bd partietal), total YA n=150) and 50 cognitively normal older adults will be randomly assigned to two between-subject tDCS conditions (left prefrontal active, left sham prefrontal, total OA n=100).", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "- Memory performance - Our primary dependent variable (DV) will be accuracy on the episodic memory and working memory tasks. These will be assessed in each of the 3 sessions (baseline no-tDCS, AM tDCS, PM tDCS). For the episodic memory task, accuracy is defined as the proportion of studied items attributed to the correct source, minus the proportion of non-studied items incorrectly attributed to that source. For the working memory task, accuracy is defined as the proportion of targets correctly identified minus the proportion of lures incorrectly endorsed.\n\n- Sleep quality (As measured by the wrist accelometry data)\n\n- Time of day preference (as measured by the \"Morningness Eveningness Questionaire\", as well as wrist accelometry data\n\n-Neuropsychological assessments  (MOCA - Montreal Cognitive Assessement, portion of the Shipley Assessement)\n\n-Alertness ratings\n\n- Demographics\n\n- Substance intake (caffeine, nicotine, alcohol consumpition)\n\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Primary Analyses Set 1 (1a, 1b, 1c). The first set of primary analyses will estimate the effect of tDCS to left dlPFC on cognitive performance and the extent to which different aspects of the cognitive task will be impacted. These analyses will be done separately for episodic and working memory. \n\n1.a This analysis will be done on younger adults only.  We shall use a linear mixed (i.e., random participant-level intercepts) model with memory performance (defined as memory accuracy computed by subtracting false alarms from target hits) as the dependent variable and stimulation condition (stimulation vs. sham), session Time of Day (AM, PM), and task manipulations (stimulus format and difficulty) as within-subjects predictors along with session order as a covariate (session 1, session 2). Interaction terms between stimulation condition and both task manipulation and time of day will be used to examine the impact of these variables on the stimulation effect.\n\n1.b This analysis will use the same model as in 1a (above), but including data from both younger and older adults and a corresponding age-group factor in the model. Interaction terms between age group, stimulation condition, and time-of-day will be used to determine whether the overall stimulation effect is the same for older as for younger adults, and if not, whether the difference varies by time of day.\n\n1.c This analysis will assess the impact of preferred time of day on tDCS effects, using wrist-worn (minimum 7-days, max 12-days) accelerometry to measure preferred time of day (i.e. \u201cOwl\u201d vs \u201cLark\u201d), and validation using the subjective Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ). For this analysis, accelerometry-derived variables capturing preferred time of days (eg, including wake time, rise time and midpoint of sleep) will be added as covariates to the model in 1.b., and interactions between these, time of day and stimulation effects will be evaluated.\n\n\n\nSet 2. The second set of primary analyses will focus on dlPFC vs parietal vs sham effects in younger adults only. For these analyses, similar models to those described above will be used (e.g., 1a, 1c, 2), except we will include 3 levels for tDCS (dlPFC, parietal, sham). We will test the relative fit of three models: (1) a model in which parietal has the same effect as sham, (2) a model in which parietal has the same effect as dlPFC, and (3) a model in which the effect of parietal differs from the other two conditions.\n\nAll analyses will initially be performed without using the baseline performance measures. We shall then repeat each analysis adjusting for the baseline value of the cognitive measure being analyzed. To the extent that the cognitive measures are highly correlated across timepoints, the latter analyses will provide additional power.\n\nSTATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE\n\nA two-sided p-value cutoff of 0.05 will be used for all null-hypothesis significance testing. In addition, point estimates for all first order and interaction effects will be reported, together with 95% confidence intervals. Between-individual contrasts (e.g., overall treatment effects) will be standardized (i.e., equivalent to Cohen\u2019s d). Results of all analyses performed will be reported (not just those that meet the 0.05 cutoff). Since Hypotheses 1-4 are distinct, we shall not make any adjustment for multiple testing across the corresponding analyses. Within each analysis, we shall use a hierarchical approach in which we begin with an overall test of the null hypothesis at the coarsest level, separately for episodic and working memory, and only if that is statistically significant will we conduct further testing among subgroups.\n\nAlthough the primary analyses will utilize the frequentist approach to estimating and testing, we will complement this with a secondary Bayesian analysis using the same model. For parameters capturing treatment effects or between-group differences in treatment effects (i.e., interaction terms), we shall use a weakly informative prior (e.g., Normal(0, 1-10)). The primary value of this analysis will be to provide more interpretable (i.e. probability) statements about the magnitude of the effects of tDCS and about the amount of information contained in the data.\n\nSECONDARY ANALYSES\nWe will assess the impact of sleep quality for the prior night on tDCS effects, using wrist accelerometer data to measure sleep quality (eg, sleep fragmentation as total number of awakenings and sleep stage shifts divided by total sleep time, sleep efficiency as sleep duration divided by the time between the start and end of the first and last nocturnal inactivity period).  Sleep diaries will provide data missing from the objective measures, where applicable. For the analyses, we will conduct a linear mixed model identical to the ones already described, using sleep quality as a covariate. \n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships":
