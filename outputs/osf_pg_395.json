lenses.

This study makes a contribution to this growing literature. This study is also unique in that it is the first to examine the intersecitonality between female and Hispanic candidates in terms of White Republican voting behavior. We chose to study Republican voting behavior (as opposed to general or Democratic voting behavior) for several reasons. Historically, both women and ethnic minority groups have been less represented in the Republican party than in the Democratic party. Additionally, existing literature on Republican voter behavior suggests that female Hispanic candidates may face particular difficulty with Republican voters. Through this study, we hope to explore how Hispanic, and specifically female Hispanic candidates fare with white Republican voters. As both women and Hispanics become more active in the political sphere, we hope that this study will contribute to an understanding of voter behavior towards these candidates."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Our primary hypotheses are as follows: H1: White Republicans vote for coethnic candidates more than non-coethnic candidates.

In addition to testing our four primary hypotheses, the size of our sample allowed us to ask a variety of questions useful for subgroup analyses. Subgroup analyses was done by gender, political ideology, gender attitudes, and 2016 Presidential candidate preference (Trump v. non-Trump). From this information, we also developed three questions: Q1: Within the Republican Party, are female candidates more likely to receive support from female (as opposed to male) voters?

Our experiment explores White Republican voter behavior towards female and Hispanic candidates. While Republican voting behavior towards female candidates has been subject to significant empirical study, voting behavior towards Hispanic candidates has not been as closely examined. This study makes a contribution to this growing literature. This study is also unique in that it is the first to examine the intersecitonality between female and Hispanic candidates in terms of White Republican voting behavior. We chose to study Republican voting behavior (as opposed to general or Democratic voting behavior) for several reasons. Historically, both women and ethnic minority groups have been less represented in the Republican party than in the Democratic party. Additionally, existing literature on Republican voter behavior suggests that female Hispanic candidates may face particular difficulty with Republican voters. Through this study, we hope to explore how Hispanic, and specifically female Hispanic candidates fare with white Republican voters. As both women and Hispanics become more active in the political sphere, we hope that this study will contribute to an understanding of voter behavior towards these candidates.", "q16": "Our primary hypotheses are as follows: H1: White Republicans vote for coethnic candidates more than non-coethnic candidates. H2: Among white Republicans, female Hispanic candidates face a double penalty. H3: Among white Republicans, tough female Hispanic candidates do as well as white male candidates (\"tough\" meaning tough on immigration). H4: Strong Republicans are less likely than weaker Republicans to support female Hispanic candidates. In addition to testing our four primary hypotheses, the size of our sample allowed us to ask a variety of questions useful for subgroup analyses. Subgroup analyses was done by gender, political ideology, gender attitudes, and 2016 Presidential candidate preference (Trump v. non-Trump). From this information, we also developed three questions: Q1: Within the Republican Party, are female candidates more likely to receive support from female (as opposed to male) voters? Q2: Within the Republican Party, are those with less favorable gender attitudes less likely to support White and Hispanic female candidates? Q3: Are Trump supporters less likely than non-Trump supporters to support female Hispanic candidates?", "q17": "Subjects were randomly assigned to see four candidates: a White male, a White female, a Hispanic male, and a Hispanic female, and indicate their vote preference for one candidate.

Cross-national research has found that UN peacekeepers bring conflicts to an end, increase duration of peace, and reduce armed group victimization.

The vignettes randomise features of hypothetical MPs, bills, implications of the rebellion and reactions to the rebellion of the party\u2019s leadership. Experiment 1 reveals voters\u2019 preferences for rebellious vs. non-rebellious MPs while controlling for the gender of the MP, the seniority of the MP, the content of the bill, the government status of the MP\u2019s party and the public\u2019s preferences.

Experiment 2 reveals whether the circumstances under which MPs rebel against the party leadership affect the degree to which voters like rebellious MPs. Here, we take the reaction of the party\u2019s leadership to the rebellion, the amount of support for the rebellious vote, the bill content, the reasons for which the MP rebelled, the seniority of the MP, the gender of the MP, the government status of the MP\u2019s party and the public\u2019s preferences into account.

Previous research suggests that representatives often have distorted images of the electorate. However, it remains unclear why political elites misperceive voter preferences, and how these constraints can be overcome. I argue that misperceptions result from a combination of unequal exposure and cognitive biases. If elected officials rely on availability heuristics to gauge public preferences, inequalities in political voice can generate distorted images of the electorate. In turn, a systematic tendency to project their own preferences on others \u2013 known as social projection \u2013 may also hinder the development of accurate beliefs. These arguments are tested in a survey experiment with local elected officials in Switzerland. Subjects will be asked to predict the outcome of two upcoming referendums in their constituencies after being assigned to different informational nudges designed to avoid availability heuristics and social projection. Referendum results provide local-level measures of voter preferences and allow me to test the effect of the nudges in reducing misperceptions.

Voter preferences: Federal referendum results disaggregated at the local level. Source: Swiss Federal Statistical Office. Dates of administration Public Official Survey: November 7 \u2013 November 24, 2018 Federal Referendums: November 25, 2018 Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants As part of the 2017 National Survey of Members of the Local Executive Members (N=7,825), respondents were invited to provide their email contacts if interested in taking part in a follow-up study about federal referendums. A total of 5,393 officials provided their contact information. An email invitation with a link to the Qualtrics survey was sent to this group on November 7, 2018. Experimental design A 3x1 experimental design tests the key expectations derived from the theory (H1. H1b, H2, H2b). A control group receives no additional information prior to the referendum predictions task (described below). A second group receives information about the composition of the electorate in their constituency (electorate composition treatment). A third group receives this same informational treatment plus a recommendation to avoid projecting their own preferences on the electorate (electorate composition + active debias treatment). The specific wording of each treatment is described below. [Electorate composition treatment] When thinking about the preferences of voters, if often helps considering the views of different groups in the constituency. To help you in this process, think about the residents of [CITY NAME] and give us your best guess to the following questions: [For Horned Cow Initiative] What share of the workers in [CITY NAME] works in the primary sector (including agriculture, forestry, or fishing)? (responses recorded from 0 to 100) In the 2015 federal elections, what was the combined share of votes received by the SP and the GPS in [CITY NAME]. (responses recorded from 0 to 100) [For Self-Determination Initiative] In the 2015 federal elections, what share of voters in [CITY NAME] voted for the SVP? (responses recorded from 0 to 100) What share of the population in [CITY NAME] was born outside of Switzerland? (responses recorded from 0 to 100) NEXT PAGE To give you some reference points, here are your answers along with the most recent data from the Federal Statistical Office in your municipality and in Switzerland as a whole. [Table with respondent\u2019s own perceptions of electorate composition alongside data from the Federal Statistical Office] This information is intended to help you consider the preferences of the average voter in your municipality. [Active debias treatment] [After the electorate composition vignette] Finally, one last tip. Decades of research show that people tend to project their own preferences on others. Without noticing, we often overestimate approval for issues we support, while underestimating approval for issues we oppose. Try to take this into account when making your prediction. Randomization Survey participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: control group, electorate composition group, and electorate composition + active debias group. To avoid contagion effects, randomization was made at the official level and not at the official-initiative level. Randomization is performed with the R package blockTools. Multivariate continuous blocking is used to maximize balance between conditions on (1) respondents\u2019 self-reported partisanship, (2) language (German, French, or Italian), (3) municipality size (population), local support for (4) the SVP and (5) the SP in the previous general election, and (5) canton. Individual-level information required for the randomization comes from the original survey from which respondents were recruited. Primary and secondary outcome measures [After being presented with the official description of the Self-Determination Initiative] It is always hard to anticipate the results of popular votes, but we would like to ask you to predict the share of voters in [CITY NAME] that will SUPPORT the Initiative for Self-Determination. Please give us your best guess from 0% to 100%: [After being presented with the official description of the Horned Cow Initiative] It is always hard to anticipate the results of popular votes, but we would like to ask you to predict the share of voters in [CITY NAME] that will SUPPORT the Horned Cow Initiative. Please give us your best guess from 0% to 100%: Referendum results disaggregated at the municipal level will be used to measure voter preferences in each municipality. The key outcome variable is the following measure of misperceptions: |Perceived % voter support \u2013 % voters supporting the referendum|. Manipulation check After the prediction tasks, respondents are asked the following question: In the prediction tasks above, which tips did you receive? [Response options: No tips; Information about the electorate; Information about the electorate and a suggestion to avoid projecting my own preferences; The results from an old referendum.] Analyses H1 and H2 will be tested with two-sample t-tests. H1 implies testing the difference in misperceptions between the electorate composition group and the control group. H2 will be tested by comparing average misperceptions in the electorate composition + active debias group and the electorate composition group. These tests will be done for each federal initiative separately and by pooling both initiatives. The pooled analysis will be tested using OLS with clustered standard errors by local official and fixed effects for initiative. Finally, to test the sensitivity of the results to distance between the day when respondents took the survey and day of the referendum, I will estimate OLS models accounting for the number of days between submitting the survey and Election Day. H1b and H2b will be tested using OLS. H1b requires interacting the treatment conditions with a measure of the average absolute distance between the two questions on electorate composition and their true figures. Respondents in the control group are asked the same set of questions at the end of the survey, after the prediction task, to allow for this comparison. H2b is tested by interacting the treatment conditions with a binary measure that takes the value of 1 if the respondent\u2019s position on the initiative is aligned with the revealed preferences of the majority of voters in the same municipality, and 0 otherwise. The hypotheses on correlates of misperceptions (H3-H7) will be tested using OLS with models estimated for each initiative and a model where both initiatives are pooled. Controls: fixed effects by state, municipality size (population), distance between survey submission and referendum day, years in office, political ideology, age, sex, and education. The key predictors required to test each hypothesis are described below: [Past electoral performance \u2013 H3] Electoral performance will be measured as a 5-point scale based on the following question: Given your original expectations about the election, how did you feel about the result obtained? The election results were: 1. Very much below my expectations 2. Slightly below my expectations 3. Just as I expected 4. Slightly above my expectations 5. Very much above my expectations [Issue saliency \u2013 H4] This hypothesis is tested by comparing average absolute misperceptions for the Self-Determination Initiative (high salience) and the Horned Cow Initiative (low salience). This coding decision is based on a series of contacts with Swiss experts on direct democracy. [Professionalization \u2013 H5] The effect of professionalization will be tested with two variables: (1) a binary measure of whether the official receives a salary from the municipality, and (2) a 3-point scale where 0 is volunteer, 1 is part-time employee, and 2 is full time employee. The following questions are used to build these variables: Are you volunteering or employed by the community? 1. No salary 2. Hired Do you have another professional activity? (Yes/No) [Progressive ambition\u2013 H6] Progressive ambition will be measured as a 4-point scale based on the following question: How would you describe your position regarding a candidacy for a different political office outside of your municipality in the future? 1. Definitely interested 2. I might be interested if there is a good chance 3. I would not rule it out completely, but I have no interest right now 4. I would absolutely exclude it [Representative role \u2013 H7] Officials\u2019 self-reported representative role will be measured in two ways based on the importance given to the opinion of the population and the inner convictions of the respondent. A binary version of the variable takes the value of 1 if the respondent states that public opinion matters more than inner convictions, and 0 otherwise. A continuous version of the variable will simply be the difference between the two scales. The specific wording of the question is the following: How important are the following factors when making important decisions? [Response options: Not important, Rather unimportant, Rather important, Important] 1. Opinion of the population \u2026 6. Inner convictions and rules of actions Notes: - Appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models will be computed and reported, including treatment effects by subgroup and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. - I will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from any interaction models described above. In some cases, I may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity.

Previous research suggests that representatives often have distorted images of the electorate. However, it remains unclear why political elites misperceive voter preferences, and how these constraints can be overcome. I argue that misperceptions result from a combination of unequal exposure and cognitive biases. If elected officials rely on availability heuristics to gauge public preferences, inequalities in political voice can generate distorted images of the electorate. In turn, a systematic tendency to project their own preferences on others \u2013 known as social projection \u2013 may also hinder the development of accurate beliefs. These arguments are tested in a survey experiment with local elected officials in Switzerland. Subjects will be asked to predict the outcome of two upcoming referendums in their constituencies after being assigned to different informational nudges designed to avoid availability heuristics and social projection. Referendum results provide local-level measures of voter preferences and allow me to test the effect of the nudges in reducing misperceptions. The study also offers an opportunity to understand what explains the capacity of elected officials to gauge public preferences.", "q16": "Reducing Misperceptions: H1: Information about the composition of the electorate increases the accuracy of elite perceptions of public preferences H2: Informing public officials about the tendency to project our own preferences on others increases the accuracy of elite perceptions of public preferences Heterogeneous Treatment Effects: H1b: The effects of providing information about the composition of the electorate [H1] should be higher among local officials whose prior image of the electorate was less accurate.

Voter preferences: Federal referendum results disaggregated at the local level. Source: Swiss Federal Statistical Office. Dates of administration Public Official Survey: November 7 \u2013 November 24, 2018 Federal Referendums: November 25, 2018 Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants As part of the 2017 National Survey of Members of the Local Executive Members (N=7,825), respondents were invited to provide their email contacts if interested in taking part in a follow-up study about federal referendums. A total of 5,393 officials provided their contact information. An email invitation with a link to the Qualtrics survey was sent to this group on November 7, 2018. Experimental design A 3x1 experimental design tests the key expectations derived from the theory (H1. H1b, H2, H2b). A control group receives no additional information prior to the referendum predictions task (described below). A second group receives information about the composition of the electorate in their constituency (electorate composition treatment). A third group receives this same informational treatment plus a recommendation to avoid projecting their own preferences on the electorate (electorate composition + active debias treatment). The specific wording of each treatment is described below. [Electorate composition treatment] When thinking about the preferences of voters, if often helps considering the views of different groups in the constituency. To help you in this process, think about the residents of [CITY NAME] and give us your best guess to the following questions: [For Horned Cow Initiative] What share of the workers in [CITY NAME] works in the primary sector (including agriculture, forestry, or fishing)? (responses recorded from 0 to 100) In the 2015 federal elections, what was the combined share of votes received by the SP and the GPS in [CITY NAME]. (responses recorded from 0 to 100) [For Self-Determination Initiative] In the 2015 federal elections, what share of voters in [CITY NAME] voted for the SVP? (responses recorded from 0 to 100) What share of the population in [CITY NAME] was born outside of Switzerland? (responses recorded from 0 to 100) NEXT PAGE To give you some reference points, here are your answers along with the most recent data from the Federal Statistical Office in your municipality and in Switzerland as a whole. [Table with respondent\u2019s own perceptions of electorate composition alongside data from the Federal Statistical Office] This information is intended to help you consider the preferences of the average voter in your municipality. [Active debias treatment] [After the electorate composition vignette] Finally, one last tip. Decades of research show that people tend to project their own preferences on others. Without noticing, we often overestimate approval for issues we support, while underestimating approval for issues we oppose. Try to take this into account when making your prediction. Randomization Survey participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: control group, electorate composition group, and electorate composition + active debias group. To avoid contagion effects, randomization was made at the official level and not at the official-initiative level. Randomization is performed with the R package blockTools. Multivariate continuous blocking is used to maximize balance between conditions on (1) respondents\u2019 self-reported partisanship, (2) language (German, French, or Italian), (3) municipality size (population), local support for (4) the SVP and (5) the SP in the previous general election, and (5) canton. Individual-level information required for the randomization comes from the original survey from which respondents were recruited. Primary and secondary outcome measures [After being presented with the official description of the Self-Determination Initiative] It is always hard to anticipate the results of popular votes, but we would like to ask you to predict the share of voters in [CITY NAME] that will SUPPORT the Initiative for Self-Determination. Please give us your best guess from 0% to 100%: [After being presented with the official description of the Horned Cow Initiative] It is always hard to anticipate the results of popular votes, but we would like to ask you to predict the share of voters in [CITY NAME] that will SUPPORT the Horned Cow Initiative. Please give us your best guess from 0% to 100%: Referendum results disaggregated at the municipal level will be used to measure voter preferences in each municipality. The key outcome variable is the following measure of misperceptions: |Perceived % voter support \u2013 % voters supporting the referendum|. Manipulation check After the prediction tasks, respondents are asked the following question: In the prediction tasks above, which tips did you receive? [Response options: No tips; Information about the electorate; Information about the electorate and a suggestion to avoid projecting my own preferences; The results from an old referendum.] Analyses H1 and H2 will be tested with two-sample t-tests. H1 implies testing the difference in misperceptions between the electorate composition group and the control group. H2 will be tested by comparing average misperceptions in the electorate composition + active debias group and the electorate composition group. These tests will be done for each federal initiative separately and by pooling both initiatives. The pooled analysis will be tested using OLS with clustered standard errors by local official and fixed effects for initiative. Finally, to test the sensitivity of the results to distance between the day when respondents took the survey and day of the referendum, I will estimate OLS models accounting for the number of days between submitting the survey and Election Day. H1b and H2b will be tested using OLS. H1b requires interacting the treatment conditions with a measure of the average absolute distance between the two questions on electorate composition and their true figures. Respondents in the control group are asked the same set of questions at the end of the survey, after the prediction task, to allow for this comparison. H2b is tested by interacting the treatment conditions with a binary measure that takes the value of 1 if the respondent\u2019s position on the initiative is aligned with the revealed preferences of the majority of voters in the same municipality, and 0 otherwise. The hypotheses on correlates of misperceptions (H3-H7) will be tested using OLS with models estimated for each initiative and a model where both initiatives are pooled. Controls: fixed effects by state, municipality size (population), distance between survey submission and referendum day, years in office, political ideology, age, sex, and education. The key predictors required to test each hypothesis are described below: [Past electoral performance \u2013 H3] Electoral performance will be measured as a 5-point scale based on the following question: Given your original expectations about the election, how did you feel about the result obtained? The election results were: 1. Very much below my expectations 2. Slightly below my expectations 3. Just as I expected 4. Slightly above my expectations 5. Very much above my expectations [Issue saliency \u2013 H4] This hypothesis is tested by comparing average absolute misperceptions for the Self-Determination Initiative (high salience) and the Horned Cow Initiative (low salience). This coding decision is based on a series of contacts with Swiss experts on direct democracy. [Professionalization \u2013 H5] The effect of professionalization will be tested with two variables: (1) a binary measure of whether the official receives a salary from the municipality, and (2) a 3-point scale where 0 is volunteer, 1 is part-time employee, and 2 is full time employee. The following questions are used to build these variables: Are you volunteering or employed by the community? 1. No salary 2. Hired Do you have another professional activity? (Yes/No) [Progressive ambition\u2013 H6] Progressive ambition will be measured as a 4-point scale based on the following question: How would you describe your position regarding a candidacy for a different political office outside of your municipality in the future? 1. Definitely interested 2. I might be interested if there is a good chance 3. I would not rule it out completely, but I have no interest right now 4. I would absolutely exclude it [Representative role \u2013 H7] Officials\u2019 self-reported representative role will be measured in two ways based on the importance given to the opinion of the population and the inner convictions of the respondent. A binary version of the variable takes the value of 1 if the respondent states that public opinion matters more than inner convictions, and 0 otherwise. A continuous version of the variable will simply be the difference between the two scales. The specific wording of the question is the following: How important are the following factors when making important decisions? [Response options: Not important, Rather unimportant, Rather important, Important] 1. Opinion of the population \u2026 6. Inner convictions and rules of actions Notes: - Appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models will be computed and reported, including treatment effects by subgroup and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. - I will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from any interaction models described above. In some cases, I may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity. If so, I will verify that I can reject the null of no difference in treatment effects in a more complex interactive model reported in an appendix when possible. - Don\u2019t know responses will be considered missing data for the factual belief outcome measures. - Summary statistics for the sample will also be reported. I may also collect and report response timing data to capture respondent attention. - The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity. - Where applicable, regression results for binary dependent variables will be verified for robustness using logit.
