Emotion Recognition in Autism Spectrum Disorders?", "description": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by difficutlies in social communication, and restricted and repetitive interests (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Given that the ability to infer emotion from facial expressions is crucial for social interaction, emotion recognition has long been suspected to be a core difficulty within ASD (Hobson, 1986). However, whilst many studies suggest a disparity in the facial expression recognition ability of autistic and neurotypical individuals (Ashwin, Chapman, Colle, &amp; Baron\u2010Cohen, 2006; Dziobek, Bahnemann, Convit, &amp; Heekeren, 2010; Lindner &amp; Ros\u00e9n, 2006; Philip et al., 2010), there have been inconsistent findings, ranging from no differences between autistic and neurotypical individuals to large disparities (see Keating &amp; Cook, in press, and Uljarevic &amp; Hamilton, 2012 for reviews). Despite these inconsistencies, the evidence largely suggests that there are differences in facial expression recognition between autistic and neurotypical individuals. \n\nOnly recently has there been a shift towards using dynamic depictions of faces (which include kinematic information) as opposed to static stimuli to assess facial expression recognition. Indeed, studies that employ dynamic tasks are profoundly under-represented in meta-analyses investigating the emotion recognition of autistic individuals (Keating &amp; Cook, in press.). This may be problematic given that naturally occurring facial expressions are inherently dynamic, and therefore may have greater ecological validity (Uljarevic &amp; Hamiltom, 2013; Krumhuber, Kappas &amp; Manstead, 2013). Amongst the few studies that have examined the influence of facial movement kinematics on emotion perception, there is a consensus that there are differences between autistic and neurotypical individuals. For instance, Sato and colleagues (2013) found that autistic children were more likely to rate slow-moving morphs as \u2018natural\u2019 looking than neurotypical children. Another study had a professional actress display emotional (joy, surprise, sadness and disgust), and non-emotional (porunication of A, O, I, and tongue protrusion) expressions slowly (Tardif et al., 2008). The speed of these videos were then manipulated to give three conditions (very-slow, slow, and normal). Importantly, in their post-hoc analyses, Tardif and colleagues (2008) identified that the autistic individuals had superior emotion recognition in the slow relative to the normal speed condition. \n\nThe findings of these behavioural investigations resonate well with those from neurophysiological studies. Generally, this literature suggests that autistic individuals, relative to neurotypicals, exhibit slowed processing of static face images as indexed by N170 latency (see Kang et al., 2018 for a summary). As a whole, the evidence suggests that autistic individuals may experience improved emotion recognition for slow moving faces. However, more research employing dynamic stimuli is necessary to confirm the assertion that autistic individuals have better emotion recognition for slowed facial stimuli. \n\nA parallel literature concerns emotion recognition from body movements. Here it has been suggested that kinematic aspects of bodily movement contribute to emotion recognition, and may underpin the differences in emotion recognition between autistic and neurotypical individuals. Indeed evidence of this comes from studies using point-light displays (PLD)- a set of moving dots that convey biological motion. One study manipulated these PLDs in terms of acceleration and had participants rate the naturalness of the displayed movements (Lee &amp; Chang, 2019). This study found a robust association between performance on this biological motion naturalness task and attention switching domain scores on the AQ (Lee &amp; Chang, 2019). Therefore, it seems that kinematics may be implicated in the emotion recognition differences between those high and low in ASD traits. \n\nIndeed, recent developments in the face processing literature emphasize the importance of kinematic cues in emotion recognition. One study demonstrated this by utilisng point-light displays of the face (known as PLFs) which had been manipulated to achieve three spatial levels (S1 \u2013 50% spatial; S2 \u2013 100%; S3 \u2013 150%) and three kinematic levels (K1 \u2013 50% speed; K2 \u2013 100%; K3 \u2013 150%) (Sowden et al., under review). This study revealed that intensity ratings, given by neurotypical participants, were modulated as a function of both spatial and kinematic cues. Specifically, at the S1 and K1 levels (i.e. with less spatial movement/ lower speed), participants rated the PLFs as more intensely sad, and less intensely angry and happy, and at the S3 and K3 levels (i.e. with  more spatial movement/ greater speed), they rated the PLFs as less intensely sad, and more intensely angry and happy (Sowden et al., under review). This novel PLF task has great utility for investigating facial expression recognition as it eliminates contrast, texture, colour and luminance cues (e.g. a flushed face or tears), and other information (e.g. identity) that can be seen in photograph stimuli. Hence, this task allows us to investigate the importance of the kinematic and spatial aspects of facial expressions without these factors confounding the results. To the best of our knowledge it is also the first task which can index independent contributions of both spatial and kinematic cues in facial emotion recognition. Therefore, the present study will utilise dynamic face stimuli, that have been manipulated kinematially and spatially (Sowden et al., under review) to identify whether, compared to neurotypical individuals, those with ASD exhibit differences in processing the kinematic and/or spatial properties of facial expressions.\n\nAlexithymia\nWhen discussing the facial expression recognition of autistic individuals, it is also crucial to consider the role of alexithymia. Alexithymia is a subclinical condition characterized by difficulties identifying and expressing emotions (Kooiman, Spinhoven &amp; Trijsburg, 2002). Whilst the incidence of alexithymia in the neurotypical population is 13% (Salminen et al., 1999), in the autistic population these rates are elevated, with 40- 65% of autistic adults meeting criteria (Berthoz &amp; Hill, 2005; Hill, Berthoz &amp; Frith, 2004). \n\nWhilst some research has suggested that autistic individuals exhibit differences relative to neurotypicals in recognizing others\u2019 emotion, there are considerable individual differences \u2013 not everyone with an autism diagnosis exhibit face processing differences (Harms, Martin &amp; Wallace, 2010; Uljarevic &amp; Hamilton, 2012). It has been proposed that alexithymia, and not autistic traits, may account for the reported impairments in facial emotion recognition, and this could explain the inconsistencies in previous research (Bird and Cook, 2013). Indeed the \u201calexithymia hypothesis\u201d (Bird and Cook, 2013) postulates that alexithymia underpins the individual differences in emotion processing that are seen in the ASD population such that intact emotion recognition is typical in individuals that have an autism diagnosis without co-ocurring alexithymia . Indeed, this hypothesis is supported by the finding that there are no differences in facial expression recognition between autistic participants and neurotypicals when the two groups are matched in terms of alexithymia (Cook, Brewer, Shah, &amp; Bird, 2013). Moreover when the variables of this study were examined continuously, it was found that possessing alexithymic traits, but not autistic traits, was predictive of poorer performance on emotion recognition and empathy tasks (Cook, Brewer, Shah, &amp; Bird, 2013). Thus overall, it appears that alexithymia is heavily implicated in differences in facial expression recognition that are commonly (but not universally) documented within ASD populations. \n\nThe current study\nFirst participants will complete various questionnaires including the Autism Quotient (AQ; Baron-Cohen, et al., 2006), and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS; Bagby, et al., 1994). Next, participants will complete Sowden et al\u2019s (under review) facial expression recognition task. In this task, participants will rate PLF (point-light face) stimuli regarding the extent to which they appear happy, angry and sad. These PLFs vary in emotion (happy, angry and sad), and have been adapted to achieve three spatial movement levels (S1 \u2013 50% spatial movement; S2 \u2013 100%; S3 \u2013 150%) and three kinematic (speed) levels (K1 \u2013 50% speed; K2 \u2013 100%; K3 \u2013 150%). Then, participants will complete two adapted PLF tasks in which they rate the naturalness of facial expressions that have been manipulated spatially and kinematically. Finally, participants will complete the Matrix Reasoning Item Bank (MaRs-IB; Chierchia et al. 2019), which assesses non-verbal reasoning.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-13T15:27:59.809289", "date_modified": "2020-04-08T17:09:36.708870", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Emotion Recognition", "Facial Expressions"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "dc7b9039ee89c4adfd4ea3ceadbb1f2c8268cbdb823c0c7e640fb87c07323d7d3850ef25e59e73a3e9f7433729751caab65cb361cea3df3a43e6a06f75bac61bce2723c2d9c3cbce6be289e0b6f20eae154143352ae511cd505aa25f3e5b1770f4b4b4a13281f0aa35145e7eb280998591cbd1b0a53cf61b749a3b118400075e36087db9bbd838a279c890029795e944", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-13T15:27:59.789940", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Connor Keating, Sophie Sowden, Jennifer Cook"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "There are a number of hypotheses that are relevant to the upcoming study:\n\nANOVAs: In order to replicate the findings in Sowden et al., (under review) data from neurotpyical participants will be analysed with a repeated measures 3x3x3 ANOVA with the factors emotion (happy vs. angry vs. sad), stimulus spatial level (S1 vs. S2 vs. S3), and stimulus kinematic level (K1 vs. K2 vs. K3). This ANOVA will be run with facial expression recognition accuracy as the dependent variable. We here focus our predictions on the primary effects of importance from Sowden et al., (under review). We predict an interaction between emotion and spatial level such that facial expression recognition accuracy will be enhanced at the S3 level (relative to the S1 and S2 level) for the happy and angry expressions, but lower for sad expressions (as sad expressions with increased movement may appear angry). In contrast, facial expression recognition accuracy will be enhanced at the S1 level for sad expression, but diminished for happy and angry expressions (as sad expressions with less movement look more intensely sad leading to enhanced accuracy). Furthermore, we predict an interaction between emotion and kinematic level such that facial expression recognition accuracy will be elevated at the K3 level (relatvie to K1 and K2) for happy and angry expressions, but lower for sad expressions (as sad expressions with increased speed may look angry). Conversely, we predict that at the K1 level (relative to K2 and K3), facial expression recognition accuracy will be elevated for sad expressions, but lower for angry and sad (as when sad expressions are slowed down they look more intensely sad). These predictions are made on the basis of findings from Sowden et al., (under review).\n\nIn addition, this task will bring novel insight by analysing the recognition task data with a mixed 2x3x3x3 ANOVA with the factors group (ASD vs. control), emotion (happy vs. angry vs. sad), stimulus spatial level (S1 vs. S2 vs. S3), and stimulus kinematic level (K1 vs. K2 vs. K3). This ANOVA will be run with facial expression recognition accuracy as the dependent variable. In this analysis we predict a main effect of group such that the ASD group will have significantly lower facial expression recognition accuracy than controls. It is unclear whether facial expression recognition differences are due to difficulties processing spatial or kinematic properties of faces and therefore we will explore whether the group main effect is modulated by an interaction with spatial and/or kinematic level.\n\nMutliple Regression Analysis: The facial expression recognition data will be analysed using a multiple regression analysis across both groups.

This ANOVA will be run with facial expression recognition accuracy as the dependent variable. We here focus our predictions on the primary effects of importance from Sowden et al., (under review). We predict an interaction between emotion and spatial level such that facial expression recognition accuracy will be enhanced at the S3 level (relative to the S1 and S2 level) for the happy and angry expressions, but lower for sad expressions (as sad expressions with increased movement may appear angry). In contrast, facial expression recognition accuracy will be enhanced at the S1 level for sad expression, but diminished for happy and angry expressions (as sad expressions with less movement look more intensely sad leading to enhanced accuracy). Furthermore, we predict an interaction between emotion and kinematic level such that facial expression recognition accuracy will be elevated at the K3 level (relatvie to K1 and K2) for happy and angry expressions, but lower for sad expressions (as sad expressions with increased speed may look angry). Conversely, we predict that at the K1 level (relative to K2 and K3), facial expression recognition accuracy will be elevated for sad expressions, but lower for angry and sad (as when sad expressions are slowed down they look more intensely sad). These predictions are made on the basis of findings from Sowden et al., (under review).\n\nIn addition, this task will bring novel insight by analysing the recognition task data with a mixed 2x3x3x3 ANOVA with the factors group (ASD vs. control), emotion (happy vs. angry vs. sad), stimulus spatial level (S1 vs. S2 vs. S3), and stimulus kinematic level (K1 vs. K2 vs. K3). This ANOVA will be run with facial expression recognition accuracy as the dependent variable. In this analysis we predict a main effect of group such that the ASD group will have significantly lower facial expression recognition accuracy than controls. It is unclear whether facial expression recognition differences are due to difficulties processing spatial or kinematic properties of faces and therefore we will explore whether the group main effect is modulated by an interaction with spatial and/or kinematic level.\n\nMutliple Regression Analysis: The facial expression recognition data will be analysed using a multiple regression analysis across both groups. We hypothesize that alexithymic traits will account for more variance than autistic traits with respect to facial expression recognition accuracy. \n", "q3": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Using data from a pilot study (Sowden et al., under review), 8 participants are required in the NT group in order to have 95% power to detect an effect size of 0.70 (\u03b7P2) at alpha level 0.01 for the emotion*spatial interaction. Moreover, 11 participants are required in the NT group in order to have 95% power to detect an effect size of 0.53 (\u03b7P2) for the emotion* kinematic interaction at alpha level 0.01. \n\nThese power analyses were completed on the basis of data from a previous pilot study which investigated controls. It is probable that there will be greater variation in the ASD group. Therefore the present study will exceed the sample sizes generated in these power calculations to account for greater variance in the ASD group. Beyond this, Button and colleagues (2013) argue that effect size estimates are commonly inflated (\u201cthe winners curse\u201d), and argue that power calculations are likely to be \u201cextremely optimistic\u201d.

In addition, an ADOS-2 assessment will be completed only in the ASD group to verify ASD diagnosis. \n\nNext, participants will complete the facial expression recognition task.

These PLFs vary in emotion (happy, angry and sad), and have been adapted to achieve three spatial movement levels (S1 \u2013 50% spatial movement; S2 \u2013 100%; S3 \u2013 150%) and three kinematic levels (K1 \u2013 50% speed; K2 \u2013 100%; K3 \u2013 150%) resulting in 9 manipulations per emotion (e.g. (1) S1, K1, (2) S2, K1, (3) S3, K1, (4) S1, K2, (5) S2, K2, (6) S3, K2, (7) S1, K3, (8), S2, K3, (9) S3, K3).

Risk perceptions play a crucial role in preventative health behavior (Ferrer &amp; Klein, 2015) and there is vast evidence that individuals express optimistic bias, an underestimation of health risks in comparison to others (Helweg-Larsen &amp; Shepperd, 2001). This study will explore risk perceptions for coronavirus in real-time as the pandemic unfolds among a representative sample of US adults recruited via Prolific. Participants will respond to Qualtrics surveys across two time points, baseline (Time 1) and two weeks later (Time 2). We will examine how risk perceptions vary based on individual differences and across time, how risk perceptions and socially-informed cognitions (descriptive norms, prototypes) relate to precautionary behaviors for the coronavirus, and how community-level variables (state, severity of outbreak), political beliefs, and gender-related beliefs inform coronavirus risk perception and related behavioral pathways.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-13T04:57:25.799049", "date_modified": "2020-03-26T14:44:11.621779", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["coronavirus", "COVID-19", "optimistic bias"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Marie Helweg-Larsen", "Sarah DiMuccio", "Laurel Peterson"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "b15cd8f88d7733c52ad8ceab106904147652869f8ee94dea75b8671e710fa88f29a6d6fc42ebee40418f5ad7d5088ba98421aa60bfde759378debb68535a941501341171fb897bd4855b97389c92c8cae8ceec8f828d4dc0e0b1b3c994baafe403a72855796acfab5187b59d6e97344ae8af3540a06b16c980d02112193217b837d33b834f26d39058af349e0c81bb34", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-13T04:57:25.781319", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Preregistration Template from AsPredicted.org", "registered_meta": {"data": {"extra": [], "value": "No, no data have been collected for this study yet."}, "name": {"extra": [], "value": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Risk Perception\n"}, "other": {"extra": [], "value": "For analyses on behaviors, we will examine whether receiving the flu vaccination during the 2019-20 flu season is a putative covariate.\n\nFor analyses examining the relation of personal risk and optimistic bias to behavior, we will examine whether current stay-at-home orders or classifying oneself as vulnerable to the coronavirus is a putative covariate/moderator.\n\nWe will explore sensitivity analyses based on location (e.g., rural versus urban areas, states with stricter or more permissive orders focused on prevention, states or areas with severe outbreaks). \n\nWe will conduct exploratory analyses on intention to receive a coronavirus vaccine if it becomes available in the future.\n\nBased on the rapid-changing nature of the pandemic, we may examine between-participant differences using a pre- post- design based on unknown major events (e.g., comparing personal risk for participants who filled out the survey on days before or after, for example, President Trump dies from coronavirus; comparing reported social distance behavior on days before or after, for example, a nationwide enforced stay-at-home mandate). \n\nReferences in this preregistration:\n\nChauvin, B.
