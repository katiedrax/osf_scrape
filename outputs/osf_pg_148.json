(Yes/No)\na)\tYes: The stimulus was presented right before participants\u2019 behaviors were measured.\nb)\tNo: The stimulus was visible and unchanging throughout the experiment.\n8.\tWhether the outcomes were positive or negative? (Yes/No)\na)\tYes: Positive outcomes included helping others, washing hands, voting participation, selecting healthy food, moral behavior, and social desirable responding. \nb)\tNo: Negative outcomes included littering, dishonesty, antisocial punishment, bicycle theft, and social undesirable responding.   \n9.\tWhether the responses were measured as a continuous variable or a dichotomized variable? (Yes/No)\na)\tYes: The outcome variable was continuous (e.g., the amount of money donated, the amount of healthy food consumed, etc.).\nb)\tNo: The outcome variable was dichotomized (i.e., whether the participants did or did not display the behavior). \n10.\tWhether the response of participants was real observed behavior or self-reported judgment? (Yes/No)\na)\tYes: The response of participants was real behavior (such as real monetary donations).\nb)\tNo: The response of participants was making a judgment (merely making an attitude judgment).\n11.\tWhether the study was a lab versus field (online) experiment?(Yes/No)\na)\tYes: The study was performed in a laboratory.\nb)\tNo: The study was performed in a real-world context (including the online context).\n12.\tWhether the experiment was a between- versus within-subjects design?

(Yes/No)\na)\tYes: The study was preregistered.\nb)\tNo: The study was not preregistered.\n\nHypotheses\nIn the introduction of our manuscript, we provided our hypotheses basing on earlier studies. \n\nExplanations of existing data\nWe have collected the references of six meta-analyses (Bradley et al., 2018; Dear et al., 2019; Nettle et al., 2013; Northover, et al., 201a; Northover et al., 2017b; Sparks &amp; Barclay, 2013; ). \nData collection procedures\nTo identify relevant articles in the published or unpublished literature:\n1.\tSearching terms: \"cues of being watched\" OR \"cues of observation\" OR \"eye cue\" OR \"eye cues\" OR \"eye images\" OR \"eye like\" OR \"eye primes\" OR \"eye spot\" OR \"eye spots\" OR \"eyespot\" OR \"eyespot effects\" OR \"eyespots\" OR \"face cues\" OR \"gaze cues \" OR \"images of eyes\" OR \"implicit gaze\" OR \"implicit observability\" OR \"observation cues\" OR \"perception of human face\" OR \"social cues\" OR \"surveillance cues\" OR \"watching eyes\" OR \"watching you\" . Most of these search terms were identified by Dear (2019).\n2.\tThe database: PsycInfo, Pubmed, Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertation, ResearchGate, psyarxiv.com, psychfiledrawer.org, and other relevant databases.\n3.\tEmailed the first or corresponding authors of relevant papers for unpublished data.\n\nSample size\nWe have collected 92 effect sizes from 43 studies. This number may increase as we continue to search for relevant studies and receive responses from authors of relevant articles. After collecting articles, we extracted all effect sizes from all studies that met our inclusion criteria. \n\nMeasured variables\nThe effect size of interest was calculated following procedures provided by Lipsey and Wilson (2001). One meta-analysis we conducted investigated the effect of watching eyes on the amount of behavioral response (continuous variables), and the other meta-analysis investigated the effect of watching eyes on the proportion of participants who displayed a given behavioral response (dichotomized variables). \n\nStatistical Models\nSome studies in our meta-analysis included multiple effect sizes. These effect sizes are not independent. Traditional meta-regression model did not handle the unknown correlations among dependent effect sizes. To control statistical dependency, we will use robust variance meta-regression proposed by Fisher and Tipton (2015). In our meta-regression with RVE, we will use the \u201ccorrelated effects\u201d weighting scheme and the default assumed within-study effect-size correlation (r=.08). In the sensitivity analysis, we will test the impact of assumed correlation, and report different pattern of effect size at different level of rho. The differences between traditional meta-regression and meta-regression with RVE will be explored. \n\nMeta-Regression Models\n1. Test the overall effect using an intercept-only model.\n2. Test each moderator.\n\nInvestigate publication bias\n1. Examine the funnel plot with all studies included.\n2. Examine the funnel plots with some studies based on moderators.\n3. To detect publication bias, we will report p-curve analysis for all studies and for moderators. \nWe will use the \u201cmetaphor\u201d (Viechtbauer, 2010) and \u201crobumeta\u201d (Fisher &amp; Tipton, 2015) packages in R to perform our meta-analysis. \n\n\n\nReferences\nBradley, A., Lawrence, C., &amp; Ferguson, E.

prevalence of applicant faking calls into question whether PIs identify the best applicants or the best liars (Robie et al., 2007). This proposed study would test a proactive, item-level method of PI faking prevention: construct-irrelevant item attributes (CIIAs). CIIAs are contextual attributes of items, such as time frame (i.e., whether an item asks about past or future behaviour). These attributes are grouped into opposite pairs of attribute values (e.g., past vs. future, definite vs. indefinite). Widhiarso et al. (2019) found that if PI items are designed using some of these attributes, participants are less likely to fake their responses to them; making the items faking resistant. Widhiarso et al. (2019) also found that each attribute pair contained an attribute that made items more relatively resistant to faking than its opposite attribute. The present study is a conceptual replication and extension of this work. I propose that participants will be less likely to fake their responses to items written to incorporate these resistant attributes. To test this hypothesis, I will conduct an experiment in which participants are instructed to either answer these items honestly or fake their responses as if applying for a job. I will determine the faking resistance of each attribute by testing whether items designed with that attribute show uniform differential item functioning. These findings would support the efficacy of an underutilized yet widely applicable faking prevention method, improving the validity of PIs as selection tools.

This proposed study would test a proactive, item-level method of PI faking prevention: construct-irrelevant item attributes (CIIAs). CIIAs are contextual attributes of items, such as time frame (i.e., whether an item asks about past or future behaviour). These attributes are grouped into opposite pairs of attribute values (e.g., past vs. future, definite vs. indefinite). Widhiarso et al. (2019) found that if PI items are designed using some of these attributes, participants are less likely to fake their responses to them; making the items faking resistant. Widhiarso et al. (2019) also found that each attribute pair contained an attribute that made items more relatively resistant to faking than its opposite attribute. The present study is a conceptual replication and extension of this work. I propose that participants will be less likely to fake their responses to items written to incorporate these resistant attributes. To test this hypothesis, I will conduct an experiment in which participants are instructed to either answer these items honestly or fake their responses as if applying for a job. I will determine the faking resistance of each attribute by testing whether items designed with that attribute show uniform differential item functioning. These findings would support the efficacy of an underutilized yet widely applicable faking prevention method, improving the validity of PIs as selection tools.

Therefore, we record the accuracy of these two kinds of stimuli to detect which strategy is used by each participant.\nDuring the reconstruction phase, a total of ten questions like \"Reconstruct a good example of category Azolitis/Leporidis\" will be asked, and participants are required to answer by adjusting four pairs of values in eight sliders to adjust the ellipses.

Difference in perceived susceptibility (i.e., the third person perception, or TPP scores) will be obtained by subtracting the participants\u2019 own rating of the argument\u2019s convincingness from their expectations of how convincing each of the \u201cother\u201d groups of people would find the argument (e.g., TPP = Other Group \u2013 Self Rating). Therefore, TPP scores could range from +100 (indicating that the participant thinks the \u201cother\u201d would be completely convinced whereas the participant is not at all convinced) to -100 (indicating that the participant is completely convinced and thinks that the other would not be convinced at all) for each of the eight different \u201cother\u201d groups (e.g., TPP_Rural = Rating for people who live in rural areas \u2013 rating for the self; TPP_Biblit = Rating for people who believe the Bible should be interpreted literally \u2013 rating for the self). Participants were asked about each of the following identity groups: Republicans, Democrats, biblical literalists, atheists, rural dwellers, urban dwellers, people who didn\u2019t go to college, and people who attended graduate school.\n\nConspiracy mentality will be measured using the 5-item generalized conspiracy mentality scale by Bruder and colleagues (2013). Participants will be shown each statement, such as \u201cmany important things happen in the world, which the public is never informed about\u201d, and asked whether the statement is (1) definitely false, (2) probably false, (3) probably true, or (4) definitely true. The scale will be analyzed using item response theory and cronbach\u2019s alpha and combined into an averaged index.\n\nCall for Censorship. We will ask participants about censoring flat Earth videos on YouTube. For these items, participants will be shown a series of statements and asked to what extent they agreed or disagreed with those statements (strongly disagree = 1 to strongly agree = 6). The statements include asking participants whether YouTube should:\n\u2022\tshut down or delete channels that upload flat Earth videos; \n\u2022\tban users who upload flat Earth videos; \n\u2022\tdelete videos that argue the Earth is;\n\u2022\tdemonetize channels that upload flat Earth videos; \n\u2022\trefrain from recommending flat Earth videos to other users; and \n\u2022\tbe fined for distributing flat Earth videos. \nAs for our second study preregistration, we stated we will create an averaged index using these items so long as the items have good inter-item reliability (Cronbach\u2019s alpha &gt; .80) and a scree \u201cacceleration factor\u201d test shows evidence for one factor. It is worth noting in our second study, however, that the non-graphical solutions (e.g., parallel analysis, optimal coordinates analysis) suggest a two-factor solution. We may see this for this survey as well. If this is the case, we will report an analysis using the two-factor solution in an appendix. \n\nSocial Distance. We will also ask participants to rate how similar or dissimilar people from various groups are to themselves (e.g., Eveland, Nathanson, Detenber, &amp; McLeod, 1999). Participants will read the following: \u201cFor each of the following identity groups, please tell us whether you feel that the people in this group\u2014whether you belong to the group or not\u2014are a lot like you or not at all like you. Like for the self-report and the third person ratings, participants answered this question using a slider scale from 0 (Not at all like me) to 100 (A lot like me). Participants were asked about each of the identity groups they rate earlier in the survey, including Republicans, Democrats, biblical literalists, atheists, rural dwellers, urban dwellers, people who didn\u2019t go to college, and people who attended graduate school.\n\nReligiosity. Participants will be asked two questions to gauge their religiosity: (1) how much guidance does your faith, religion, or spirituality provide in your day-to-day life on a 6-point scale (not religious to a great deal) and (2) do you pray, and if so, how often, on a 5-point scale (I don\u2019t pray to at least daily). These two items will be centered and scaled before being averaged together and rescaled. \n\nPolitical party affiliation. To gauge political party affiliation, we ask participants the following: \u201cWhen there is an important election, what do you do most of the time?\u201d Participants are given 5 response options: vote for the Democrat, vote for the Republican, vote for an independent or third-party candidate, \u2018I don\u2019t vote\u2019, or \u2018other (please specify)\u2019. Then, Don\u2019t vote, other, and no response will be combined into one category labeled \u201cother\u201d (consistent with study 2). This variable will be treated as categorical with Democrat as the referent in all analyses.\n\nYouTube use. Unlike our previous studies that restricted the sample to regular YouTube users, we opened our sample up to a more nationally representative sample and measured YouTube use with the following question: \u201cHow often do you watch videos on YouTube\u201d with the following response options: Seldom/Never, Just a few times a year, Monthly, Weekly, or Daily.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Third_Person_Flat_Earth_-_QUALTRICS_SAMPLE.docx"}, "nodeId": "vjtfc", "sha256": "61ba1c2eef461ef23a0f4f8135a1f4cc801ff8790f6a82b74ad8117f4b628516", "viewUrl": "/project/bqvnd/files/osfstorage/5e0e5324385755003333934b/", "selectedFileName": "Third_Person_Flat_Earth_-_QUALTRICS_SAMPLE.docx"}], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "TPP scores.

Later in the survey, participants were asked to rate how convincing they think other types of people might find the video.

Children who are Dual Language Learners (DLLs) in the Head Start program may develop English and their home language in distinctly different patterns. Think, for example, of a DLL student who excels at communicating in both English and Spanish compared to a child with strong Spanish and emerging English skills. While Head Start program policy clearly requires classrooms to support DLL students, a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach to support DLL students will not meet the needs of this diverse group.\nResearch indicates there are meaningful differences in school readiness indicators between groups of children who have different patterns of Spanish-English dual language development. Findings indicate that children who have the most even proficiency between languages reap the most benefits. While this reiterates the importance of maintaining home languages while supporting English growth, it is unclear how early care environments influence the joint development of English and Spanish.\nIndividually testing environmental impacts on each language separately may inadvertently miss critical information about the \u201cwhole\u201d DLL student. The approach proposed in this project is innovative as it considers the impacts of early care environments on both English and Spanish development simultaneous rather than inspecting each language individually.  Understanding the complex interplay between home and classroom influences and the simultaneous development of two languages will provide opportunities for programs and families to work together to individualize services for this unique population.

Children in latent groups with English or Spanish vocabulary in the average range will have better behavioral outcomes as compared to those who have delays in either language (Halle et al., 2014). As language skills increase, behavior problems decrease indicating we can expect the same from this group (Brownlie et al., 2004; van Daal, Verhoeven &amp; van Balkon, 2007). It is excepted that proficiency in either Spanish or English would be related to positive behavioral outcomes because Head Start Performance Standards directly address DLLs\u2019 unique cultural and linguistic needs (U.S. Dept. of HHS, 2016) thus providing an underlying structure to support children who are proficient in Spanish regardless of their English language proficiency.\nRQ 2. After controlling for demographic factors, are there significant differences between latent dual language groups in terms of family and home environment factors?\nH 2. Based on research indicating that parent use of their native language predicts children\u2019s grammatical abilities in that language (Guti\u00e9rrez-Clellen &amp; Kreiter, 2003), and the home learning environment positively impacts child language development (Payne, Whitehurst, &amp; Angell, 1994; Raikes et al., 2006; S\u00e9n\u00e9chal &amp; LeFevre, 2001; Tabors, Roach, &amp; Snow, 2001; Tamis-LeMonda, Bornstein, &amp; Baumwell, 2001), we hypothesize that home environmental context (e.g. number of people, books, and materials in the home in Spanish) and values/practices (e.g. frequency of activities to support language, parent language proficiency, parent value of home language), will impact latent dual language group membership.\nRQ 3. For each latent dual language group, how do factors within the classroom impact behavior outcomes?\nH 3.  Based on documented behavioral impacts for children who are unable to communicate well with teachers and peers (Olsen, 1997) and the positive relation between classroom quality and child behavior (Halle et al. 2010)  it is expected that there will be differences between latent language groups in terms of the impact of classroom and teacher characteristics on child behavior."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

LGM is the covariance structural equation model (SEM) representation of the multilevel model (MLM) for change. LGM is capable of adjusted standard errors for data that is nested. This is important given the structure of the current study (i.e., time nested within individuals). LGM fits a growth model with fixed (i.e., average level) and random (i.e., variability around the average) effects and correctly estimates adjusted standard errors.  In short, this is a flexible and powerful methodological approach capable of estimating growth curve models to test hypotheses about within-person change over time (i.e., intraindividual change) and between-person differences in change over time (i.e., interindividual change; Bollen, 2014; Ram &amp; Grimm, 2007; Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002; Singer &amp; Willett, 2003).  In addition, results using these methods are robust to missing data. Due to attrition over time in the FACES dataset, not all cases are complete. The most typical method for handling incomplete (or missing) data is by using maximum likelihood estimation. This estimation method assumes repeated measures are continuous and normally distributed. Preliminary analyses will be inspected to ensure the selected data meet these assumptions.\nLGM in Mplus was chosen because of some distinct advantages that fit the\n current proposal\u2019s analytical needs: (a) the ability to handle item missing data on both the outcomes and the predictors via utilization of full-information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation; (b) the ability to assess model fit via global fit statistics (e.g., Confirmatory Fit Index [CFI]) to analytically evaluate and determine the best-fitting growth model; (c) the ability to model and analyze changes in multiple variables, and relationships among multiple variables, simultaneously (Chou et al., 1998; Diallo, Morin,&amp; Parker, 2014; Ferrer et al., 2004; Willett, 2004 ).\nA limitation of the previous study was inability to test non-linear trajectories. Due to the number of missing cases at the fourth time point (kindergarten) the previous project selected to only included three timepoints whereas four time points are required to test quadradic slopes. However, with twice the sample size afforded by linking the 2006 and 2009 studies, it is expected that sufficient cases from Spanish-speaking households will be available at the final data collections point to test latent quadratic slopes (non-linear trajectories). This is an important extension of the previous research with receptive language particularly because a similar study using expressive language detected non-linear dual language patterns (Escobar &amp; Tamis-LeMonda, 2017).\nAs a first step to conduct a parallel process analysis, separate models will be fitted to English and Spanish vocabulary raw scores, thus, all of the following steps will be completed for English and Spanish separately. First, intercept-only first-order latent growth curve models (LGCM) will be examined. In the baseline models, all cases will be considered to have identical growth patterns, means, variances, and covariances. All parameters are constrained to be equivalent across groups. In essence, the model is forced to assume all students belong to a single-group.\nNext, fit statistics for linear and non-linear LGC models will be compared to intercept-only models. Then, random effects of the linear models were inspected. In contrast to fixed-effects (i.e., the sample's mean value for intercept and slope) random effects indicate the amount of variability around the sample's mean value for intercept and slope. In order to proceed with investigating if time-invariant predictors explain variability in random effects, these values must be statistically significant. The addition of covariates is intended to explain the observed variability around the sample\u2019s mean intercept and slope. If random effects are statistically significant, child gender (the only time-invariant covariate planned for inclusion) will be entered on the slopes and intercepts of the two separate models. Covariates will be set to their individual variances as a requirement of time-invariant variables in LGCM. If child gender is not statistically significant it will be dropped from the final parallel process model.\nThe two resulting models (one for Spanish, one for English) will be combined into a single parallel-process model. Residual variances for each outcome variable will be constrained to be equal over the three measurement occasions. Syntax will be added to prompt the generation of data-driven groups based on students\u2019 Spanish and English language scores. To account for the possibility that there may be more or fewer unobserved groups than hypothesized, models were tested with 2, 3, 4, and 5 group solutions. Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was compared between models to determine the best-fitting model (Nylund, Asparouhov, &amp; Muth\u00e9n, 2007). The number and nature of groups in the final best fitting model will be described.\nA total of 905 cases are expected to be available for analyses. Using an equation for estimating power in latent class analyses (Dziak, Lanza, &amp; Tan, 2014) a model with 3 classes, and 4 variables (Spanish vocabulary, English vocabulary, and child gender), an effect size of .17 is needed to have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis with the current estimated sample size. This ranges between the benchmarks for a small (.10) and medium (.30) effect size (Cohen, 1988).\nResearch question one:   Does latent dual language group membership differentially predict behavior outcomes? A multivariate regression analysis will test the relation between latent language group and behavior outcomes. In this analysis, dual language membership will essentially be treated as a categorical variable as assigned through the process described above. As a precaution, an intraclass correlation coefficient analyses will first be conducted to inspect the proportion of between-unit variance to total variance. As described previously, FACES used a multi-stage clustered sampling technique. Unlike simple random sampling, it is expected that observations are not independent because there are inherent clusters at each stage of sampling. Children in the same program, center, or classroom, are more likely to share similar characteristics due to being drawn from the same environment. An intraclass correlation will be conducted at the program, center, and teacher level to describe how similar student\u2019s scores are at each level. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), indicate the proportion of between-unit variance to total variance. In addition to providing contextual information about language scores, the presence of significant clustering can lead to considerable bias in the results of tests of statistical significance in conventional OLS regression analyses, which does not take the dependence of observations into account (Cohen, Cohen, West &amp; Aiken, 2003). In previous work using data from Spanish-speaking children in the FACES dataset has not indicated a significant amount of clustering that requires a more complex analytic method to account for clustering and it is expected a regression analysis will be sufficiently sophisticated to answer research questions one. \nDescriptive analyses and preliminary correlations of all variables of interest will first be inspected to ensure the distribution of scores relation between covariates and outcomes meet assumptions. Latent dual language group will be dummy coded based on model generated assignment. Regression analysis has been selected because it allows for the inclusion of multiple covariates to be entered into the model. This will be important as we expect to include family demographic variables, child gender, and initial behavioral scores as control variables in order to tease out the distinct impact of language group on behavior. With a total sample size of 905 cases a power analysis, using G*Power, indicates that an analysis with an error probability of p &lt; .05, testing 5 predictors (e.g. child gender, initial behavior, maternal education, length of time in the U.S, and family income) has sufficient power (.92) to detect a small effect (.02).\nThe results will provide links from a holistic view of dual language development to behavior development. Results will inform discussions with the partner Head Start site to develop person-centered strategies focused on the unique strengths and needs of DLL students in the Head Start program. \nResearch question two: After controlling for demographic factors, are there significant differences between latent dual language groups in terms of family and home environment factors? An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to address this research question. This technique allows for the inspection of between group differences on key family and home environment outcomes while accounting/controlling for differences that might be attributable to group membership. ANCOVA is used to remove noise from the analysis that was induced by random differences between groups. Because it is impossible to randomly assign children to be a part of a specific dual language group, group assignment is not randomized meaning there may be confounding effects on the outcome variable of interest. Thus, this analytic method would permit controlling for demographic variables, such as maternal education, to inspect the specific differences between group averages on the family outcome variable of interest.\nUnderstanding how family and home environment factors differ between groups can provide clues for programs to understand what developmental pattern a child might be headed towards beyond their presenting language ability. Findings may additionally provide insight into key variables that meaningfully impact child language development which may prove to be useful points of leverage for families as they make choices that guide children toward the language development trajectory of most value to them.\nResearch question three: For each latent dual language group, how do factors within the classroom impact behavior outcomes? An intercepts-and-slopes-as-outcomes multilevel regression analysis (Luke, 2004) will be used to answer this question. This type of analysis allows researchers to inspect both random intercepts and random slopes with predictors at both the individual level and the cluster level. \nMost importantly, this approach allows for the ability to test potential interaction effects between the individual level predictors and cluster level predictors. This means that we can inspect whether there is a difference between dual language groups in respect to how classroom level variables, such as teacher education, impact child behavior. Teacher education is a cluster level variable because it varies between, but not within, each Head Start classroom. In other words, all the children in the same classroom are experiencing the same teacher characteristics. The impact these cluster level variables have on behavior outcomes will provide direction for person-specific strategies for teachers. Results would provide direction to tailor classroom support to meeting the unique needs of DLL children based on differences observed based on latent dual language group.

Researchers follow 3- and 4-year-old children from their first year in a Head Start classroom until their first year in kindergarten. Data is collected at the program, center, classroom, child, and family level. A major limitation of the previous study the current proposal is building upon was that the smallest group of children had such a limited sample size that it may have not had the power necessary to address subsequent questions. FACES, with its successive nationally representative samples, provides descriptive data from different years\u2019 studies (FACES 2014, 2009, 2006, 2003, and so on) that may be used to analyze trends and changes in the Head Start program, the population enrolled, and the services provided. For example, it is possible to combine data from FACES 2006 and FACES 2009, as is planned for the current study. Participation rates in FACES are historically high and a total of 905 cases from Spanish-speaking households are expected to be available for analyses (456 cases from 2006; 449 cases from 2009). To facilitate cross-study comparisons, the content and naming of the measures used in the FACES instruments is structured with considerable overlap. This means that once the variables and sample of interest have been selected from each study, the files can be merged to increase the overall sample size available for planned analyses.\nFACES data collection in 2006 and 2009 occurred in three waves that followed children from their first year in Head Start until the spring of their kindergarten year. Only children who are coded as Spanish-speakers, have not been identified as having a speech or language disorder at any assessment wave, and were three years old at the first wave of data collection, thus having an opportunity to experience two full years of Head Start before kindergarten, will be included in analyses. FACES data are used to answer questions about children who are dual language learners (DLL) and attend Head Start, particularly with respect to a congressionally mandated report on such children. Thus, each study provides detailed information relevant to DLL students. Additionally, for many children from non-English homes, Head Start may be the first fully immersive English experience where they are expected to participate and learn making it a critical scene to investigate dual language development and the surrounding care context.

The PPVT was administered to all children in the study, regardless of home language, and the TVIP was administered to all children whose parents indicated their primary home language was Spanish.  Both measures are designed to measure receptive vocabulary of participants from age 2 and a half years to adults (Dunn &amp; Dunn, 2006). Administration and scoring is similar across measures. Participants are shown picture plates with four pictures and asked to point to the picture that best represents a stimulus word presented orally by the examiner. The items are presented in order of increasing difficulty. Testing is discontinued after participants have made eight or more errors in a set of 12 stimulus words. One point is awarded for each correct response, and the sum of the correct responses is used as the index of receptive vocabulary. Scores may be converted into standard scores, with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 (Dunn &amp; Dunn, 2007). The administration manual notes the following about the PPVT\u2019s application to English language learners: \n\u201cThe PPVT-4 instrument was normed exclusively on individuals who are proficient in English, and therefore it would not be best practice to report a normative score on this test for an individual who is not English proficient. As a criterion measure, however, the PPVT-4 scale is useful for assessing the extent and nature of a person\u2019s knowledge of standard American English words. The early item sets of each PPVT-4 form include high-frequency, commonly used words. These words can aid in screening individuals for whom English is not the primary language and in planning interventions for those who want to attain English proficiency.\u201d (Dunn &amp; Dunn, 2007, p.3)\nSplit-half reliability and alpha coefficients are consistently high at all ages and grades (Dunn &amp; Dunn, 2007). The FACES User Guide indicates that the Cronbach alpha scores across time points ranged from 0.91 to 0.97 for the PPVT and 0.89 to 0.94 for the TVIP (Malone et al., 2013). Average test-retest reliability is reported to be .93 (Malone et al., 2013). The PPVT demonstrates convergent validity as it has been found to correlate with two established tests of expressive vocabulary: the Expressive Vocabulary Test, Second Edition (.80 to .84), and the Comprehensive Assessment of Spoken Language (mid-.60s to high .70s; Dunn &amp; Dunn, 2007). All children participating in FACES testing were administered the PPVT. Split half reliabilities of the TVIP range from .80 to .94 (Dunn et al., 1986). The content validity of the measure with the Kauffman Assessment Battery for Children Spanish ranged from .25 to .56 and concurrent validity was .44 with the Habilidad General Ability Test (Dunn et al., 1986).\nChild gender will be included as a control variable in analyses targeted at identifying latent language groups because gender has been shown to influence language development in both monolinguals and bilinguals. Studies of monolingual language development report female children tend to have a larger vocabulary than males of the same age (Huttenlocher, Haight, Bryk, Seltzer, &amp; Lyons, 1991). Studies of DLL students have mixed results related to whether gender makes a significant impact on English language learning (Greenberg-Motamedi, 2015; Grissom, 2004; Thompson, 2017; Uriarte et al., 2011), or experience no differences related to dual language development vocabulary (Hammer, Davison, Lawrence, &amp; Miccio, 2009).\nChild Problem and Prosocial Behavior were both collected from both parents and teachers. Taken together, the parent and teacher ratings permitted a comparison of assessment items for a given child and allowed construction of composites of children\u2019s social behavior across settings and data sources. However, given that different behaviors may be more or less salient in the home versus the classroom, a subset of items in the rating scales is unique to each setting and data source.\nParents and teachers were asked to rate each child on a set of behaviors that assessed the child\u2019s basic social skill and behavior problems. The ratings included items drawn from the Personal Maturity Scale, Social Skills Rating System (SSRS; Gresham and Elliott 1990; Elliott et al. 1988) and Behavior Problems Index (BPI; Peterson and Zill 1986). Teachers and parents indicated the extent to which a given statement (such as \u201cmakes friends easily\u201d) was characteristic of the child, from 1 (\u201cnever\u201d) to 3 (\u201cvery often\u201d). Summary scores were created from the three-point scale items.\nItems in the FACES behavior problems scale, which measure negative child behaviors associated with learning problems, come from an abbreviated adaptation of the Personal Maturity Scale and from the Behavior Problems Index (BPI; Peterson and Zill 1986). The BPI included undercontrol (such as aggression, hyperactivity, and destructiveness) and overcontrol (such as social withdrawal, depression, and somatic problems) behaviors; the internal consistency of the BPI total score ranged from 0.88 to 0.89 in the National Health Interview Survey and the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY) (Berry et al. 2004). Given that the BPI does not adequately assess pro-social or positive behaviors, additional items for the parent and teacher rating scales were taken from the SSRS and from the Personal Maturity Scale..\nThe Personal Maturity Scale was originally used in the 1976\u20131977 National Survey of Children (Zill and Daly 1993) and later adapted by Alexander and Entwisle for use in their longitudinal study of achievement of Baltimore\u2019s inner-city elementary school children (Alexander and Entwisle 1988). The scale, which measured a child\u2019s interest or participation, cooperation or compliance, and attention span or restlessness, consists of 13 items forming three subscales, with alpha reliabilities ranging from 0.74 to 0.85. The SSRS social skills scale\u2019s alpha coefficients range from 0.87 to 0.90 for parent reports across the elementary and preschool SSRS forms, respectively, and 0.94 for the teacher forms.\nParent interviews were collected from participating families via computer-assisted personal and telephone interviews conducted in Spanish and English. A rich resources of information is available including demographic information (e.g. immigration status, maternal education), information specific to the presence and value of Spanish in the home (e.g. number of people, books, and materials in the home in Spanish, how proficient the respondent is in English in Spanish, how valuable home and English language is to the respondent), and questions addressing the home learning environment. \nIn FACES, information about activities with children come from previous national surveys, including the NHES and Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) Inventory, a standard measure of the quality of the language and learning environment in the home. FACES obtained information about the frequency of various types of stimulating or educational activities with the child, such as singing songs or nursery rhymes, counting together, visiting the park, and shopping or running errands. These items, drawn from national surveys, were used to form scales that assessed the parent\u2019s participation in the child\u2019s educational experiences and cognitive stimulation. \nClassroom variables available for analyses include observational measures of quality, teacher characteristics, and curriculum and support specific to DLL students. Observational measures of the classroom include the Instructional Support (instructional support, concept development, and language modeling) domain of the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS; Pianta et al., 2008) and the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale\u2013Revised (ECERS\u2013R).   \nThe CLASS observes and assesses the quality of interactions between teachers and students in classrooms and measures aspects of interactions related to children\u2019s early academic achievement and social competencies. Each dimension is rated on a seven-point scale (1 = \u201cminimally characteristic\u201d to 7 = \u201chighly characteristic\u201d) for each of four observation cycles. For Instructional Support domain, publisher-reported internal consistency = 0.79, correlation between two observations as an indicator of test-retest reliability = 0.86, and average inter-rater reliability (within one point of rating from master raters) is 87 percent (Pianata et al., 2008). \nThe Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale\u2013Revised (ECERS\u2013R) is a global rating of classroom quality based on structural features of the classroom (Harms et al. 2005). The classroom environment is defined as the use of space, materials, and experiences to enhance children\u2019s development, daily schedule, and supervision. Even though child development research has made wide use of the ECERS\u2013R to predict optimal child outcomes (for example, Phillips et al. 1994), research studies have not consistently supported the seven-scale factor structure of the full ECERS\u2013R (Malone et al. 2010). Accordingly, FACES used a subset of items from the ECERS\u2013R which has also been used by the Multi-State Study of Prekindergarten, the State-Wide Early Education Program (SWEEP; Early et al. 2005), and the Chicago Program Evaluation Project (C-PEP) study (Ross et al. 2008). The items in the short form represent the strongest 21 items identified by researchers in a large-scale study (Clifford et al. 2005) and form two factors: Teaching and Interactions (that is, the quality of teacher-child interactions) and Provisions for Learning (that is, materials available in the classroom and the arrangement of the classroom space). Each of the two factors encompasses 11 to 12 items, with each item rated on a seven-point scale that denotes a level of quality associated with the scale score. A score of one is considered \u201cinadequate,\u201d 3 is \u201cminimal quality,\u201d 5 is \u201cgood quality,\u201d and 7 is \u201cexcellent quality.\u201d In spring 2010 and spring 2011 of FACES 2009, the internal consistency reliability (Cronbach\u2019s alpha) for the Teaching and Interactions mean score and the Provisions for Learning mean score ranged, respectively, from 0.84 to 0.85 and from 0.80 to 0.84. For the ECERS\u2013R, inter-rater reliability for the full scale ranges from 0.85 (rank-order correlations) to 0.92 (Pearson), and inter-rater reliability on individual items reached agreement of 71 percent for agreement within one point. Internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s alpha) ranged from 0.71 (parents and staff) to 0.88 (activities), with an alpha coefficient of 0.92 for the full scale (Harms et al. 2005).\nTeacher characteristics, are a set of structural factors related to child care quality, include teacher education and training. The Head Start teacher interview asked about the classroom teacher\u2019s teaching experience (number of years teaching in Head Start), educational background (the highest grade or year of school completed), teaching credentials (for example, Child Development Associate), salary, and demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity). Additionally, teacher\u2019s Teachers\u2019 knowledge and beliefs about best teaching practices for early childhood education was collected using 15 statements representing opinions on how Head Start children should be taught and managed (Burts et al. 1990). Two statements posit that \u201cHead Start classroom activities should be responsive to individual differences in development\u201d and \u201cStudents should work silently and alone on seatwork.\u201d The Head Start teacher indicated whether and to what extent he or she agreed or disagreed with each statement based on a five-point Likert type scale (1 = \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d; 5 = \u201cstrongly agree\u201d).\nPresence of overt DLL support provided is also collected through questions asked in teacher and program interviews. Surveys ask about what specific curriculum are used and if there is guidance provided to support language development of DLL children. Respondents were asked questions about the language demographic in the classroom such as how many adults and children in the classroom speak Spanish, who in the classroom uses Spanish for instruction and speaking to the group, and the availability of materials in Spanish in the classroom. Finally, interviews also asked teachers to rate their proficiency speaking and understanding Spanish.

LGM is the covariance structural equation model (SEM) representation of the multilevel model (MLM) for change. LGM is capable of adjusted standard errors for data that is nested. This is important given the structure of the current study (i.e., time nested within individuals). LGM fits a growth model with fixed (i.e., average level) and random (i.e., variability around the average) effects and correctly estimates adjusted standard errors.  In short, this is a flexible and powerful methodological approach capable of estimating growth curve models to test hypotheses about within-person change over time (i.e., intraindividual change) and between-person differences in change over time (i.e., interindividual change; Bollen, 2014; Ram &amp; Grimm, 2007; Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002; Singer &amp; Willett, 2003).  In addition, results using these methods are robust to missing data. Due to attrition over time in the FACES dataset, not all cases are complete. The most typical method for handling incomplete (or missing) data is by using maximum likelihood estimation. This estimation method assumes repeated measures are continuous and normally distributed. Preliminary analyses will be inspected to ensure the selected data meet these assumptions.\nLGM in Mplus was chosen because of some distinct advantages that fit the\n current proposal\u2019s analytical needs: (a) the ability to handle item missing data on both the outcomes and the predictors via utilization of full-information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation; (b) the ability to assess model fit via global fit statistics (e.g., Confirmatory Fit Index [CFI]) to analytically evaluate and determine the best-fitting growth model; (c) the ability to model and analyze changes in multiple variables, and relationships among multiple variables, simultaneously (Chou et al., 1998; Diallo, Morin,&amp; Parker, 2014; Ferrer et al., 2004; Willett, 2004 ).\nA limitation of the previous study was inability to test non-linear trajectories. Due to the number of missing cases at the fourth time point (kindergarten) the previous project selected to only included three timepoints whereas four time points are required to test quadradic slopes. However, with twice the sample size afforded by linking the 2006 and 2009 studies, it is expected that sufficient cases from Spanish-speaking households will be available at the final data collections point to test latent quadratic slopes (non-linear trajectories). This is an important extension of the previous research with receptive language particularly because a similar study using expressive language detected non-linear dual language patterns (Escobar &amp; Tamis-LeMonda, 2017).\nAs a first step to conduct a parallel process analysis, separate models will be fitted to English and Spanish vocabulary raw scores, thus, all of the following steps will be completed for English and Spanish separately. First, intercept-only first-order latent growth curve models (LGCM) will be examined. In the baseline models, all cases will be considered to have identical growth patterns, means, variances, and covariances. All parameters are constrained to be equivalent across groups. In essence, the model is forced to assume all students belong to a single-group.\nNext, fit statistics for linear and non-linear LGC models will be compared to intercept-only models. Then, random effects of the linear models were inspected. In contrast to fixed-effects (i.e., the sample's mean value for intercept and slope) random effects indicate the amount of variability around the sample's mean value for intercept and slope. In order to proceed with investigating if time-invariant predictors explain variability in random effects, these values must be statistically significant. The addition of covariates is intended to explain the observed variability around the sample\u2019s mean intercept and slope. If random effects are statistically significant, child gender (the only time-invariant covariate planned for inclusion) will be entered on the slopes and intercepts of the two separate models. Covariates will be set to their individual variances as a requirement of time-invariant variables in LGCM. If child gender is not statistically significant it will be dropped from the final parallel process model.\nThe two resulting models (one for Spanish, one for English) will be combined into a single parallel-process model. Residual variances for each outcome variable will be constrained to be equal over the three measurement occasions. Syntax will be added to prompt the generation of data-driven groups based on students\u2019 Spanish and English language scores. To account for the possibility that there may be more or fewer unobserved groups than hypothesized, models were tested with 2, 3, 4, and 5 group solutions. Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was compared between models to determine the best-fitting model (Nylund, Asparouhov, &amp; Muth\u00e9n, 2007). The number and nature of groups in the final best fitting model will be described.\nA total of 905 cases are expected to be available for analyses. Using an equation for estimating power in latent class analyses (Dziak, Lanza, &amp; Tan, 2014) a model with 3 classes, and 4 variables (Spanish vocabulary, English vocabulary, and child gender), an effect size of .17 is needed to have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis with the current estimated sample size. This ranges between the benchmarks for a small (.10) and medium (.30) effect size (Cohen, 1988).\nResearch question one:   Does latent dual language group membership differentially predict behavior outcomes? A multivariate regression analysis will test the relation between latent language group and behavior outcomes. In this analysis, dual language membership will essentially be treated as a categorical variable as assigned through the process described above. As a precaution, an intraclass correlation coefficient analyses will first be conducted to inspect the proportion of between-unit variance to total variance. As described previously, FACES used a multi-stage clustered sampling technique. Unlike simple random sampling, it is expected that observations are not independent because there are inherent clusters at each stage of sampling. Children in the same program, center, or classroom, are more likely to share similar characteristics due to being drawn from the same environment. An intraclass correlation will be conducted at the program, center, and teacher level to describe how similar student\u2019s scores are at each level. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), indicate the proportion of between-unit variance to total variance. In addition to providing contextual information about language scores, the presence of significant clustering can lead to considerable bias in the results of tests of statistical significance in conventional OLS regression analyses, which does not take the dependence of observations into account (Cohen, Cohen, West &amp; Aiken, 2003). In previous work using data from Spanish-speaking children in the FACES dataset has not indicated a significant amount of clustering that requires a more complex analytic method to account for clustering and it is expected a regression analysis will be sufficiently sophisticated to answer research questions one. \nDescriptive analyses and preliminary correlations of all variables of interest will first be inspected to ensure the distribution of scores relation between covariates and outcomes meet assumptions. Latent dual language group will be dummy coded based on model generated assignment. Regression analysis has been selected because it allows for the inclusion of multiple covariates to be entered into the model. This will be important as we expect to include family demographic variables, child gender, and initial behavioral scores as control variables in order to tease out the distinct impact of language group on behavior. With a total sample size of 905 cases a power analysis, using G*Power, indicates that an analysis with an error probability of p &lt; .05, testing 5 predictors (e.g. child gender, initial behavior, maternal education, length of time in the U.S, and family income) has sufficient power (.92) to detect a small effect (.02).\nThe results will provide links from a holistic view of dual language development to behavior development. Results will inform discussions with the partner Head Start site to develop person-centered strategies focused on the unique strengths and needs of DLL students in the Head Start program. \nResearch question two: After controlling for demographic factors, are there significant differences between latent dual language groups in terms of family and home environment factors? An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to address this research question. This technique allows for the inspection of between group differences on key family and home environment outcomes while accounting/controlling for differences that might be attributable to group membership. ANCOVA is used to remove noise from the analysis that was induced by random differences between groups. Because it is impossible to randomly assign children to be a part of a specific dual language group, group assignment is not randomized meaning there may be confounding effects on the outcome variable of interest. Thus, this analytic method would permit controlling for demographic variables, such as maternal education, to inspect the specific differences between group averages on the family outcome variable of interest.\nUnderstanding how family and home environment factors differ between groups can provide clues for programs to understand what developmental pattern a child might be headed towards beyond their presenting language ability. Findings may additionally provide insight into key variables that meaningfully impact child language development which may prove to be useful points of leverage for families as they make choices that guide children toward the language development trajectory of most value to them.\nResearch question three: For each latent dual language group, how do factors within the classroom impact behavior outcomes? An intercepts-and-slopes-as-outcomes multilevel regression analysis (Luke, 2004) will be used to answer this question. This type of analysis allows researchers to inspect both random intercepts and random slopes with predictors at both the individual level and the cluster level. \nMost importantly, this approach allows for the ability to test potential interaction effects between the individual level predictors and cluster level predictors. This means that we can inspect whether there is a difference between dual language groups in respect to how classroom level variables, such as teacher education, impact child behavior. Teacher education is a cluster level variable because it varies between, but not within, each Head Start classroom. In other words, all the children in the same classroom are experiencing the same teacher characteristics. The impact these cluster level variables have on behavior outcomes will provide direction for person-specific strategies for teachers. Results would provide direction to tailor classroom support to meeting the unique needs of DLL children based on differences observed based on latent dual language group.

Children from Spanish-speaking households who were three years old when they participated in the study were selected for analyses.  Data were collected at three time points spanning two full years of Head Start participation. Parallel-process latent growth models identified three patterns of dual language development. The smallest group (Average English and Spanish) was characterized by standard scores of English and Spanish in the \u2018Average\u2019 range across time.

Children who are Dual Language Learners (DLLs) in the Head Start program may develop English and their home language in distinctly different patterns. Think, for example, of a DLL student who excels at communicating in both English and Spanish compared to a child with strong Spanish and emerging English skills. While Head Start program policy clearly requires classrooms to support DLL students, a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach to support DLL students will not meet the needs of this diverse group.\nResearch indicates there are meaningful differences in school readiness indicators between groups of children who have different patterns of Spanish-English dual language development. Findings indicate that children who have the most even proficiency between languages reap the most benefits. While this reiterates the importance of maintaining home languages while supporting English growth, it is unclear how early care environments influence the joint development of English and Spanish.\nIndividually testing environmental impacts on each language separately may inadvertently miss critical information about the \u201cwhole\u201d DLL student. The approach proposed in this project is innovative as it considers the impacts of early care environments on both English and Spanish development simultaneous rather than inspecting each language individually.

", "q4": "RQ 1. Does latent dual language group membership differentially predict behavior outcomes?\nH 1. Children in latent groups with English or Spanish vocabulary in the average range will have better behavioral outcomes as compared to those who have delays in either language (Halle et al., 2014). As language skills increase, behavior problems decrease indicating we can expect the same from this group (Brownlie et al., 2004; van Daal, Verhoeven &amp; van Balkon, 2007). It is excepted that proficiency in either Spanish or English would be related to positive behavioral outcomes because Head Start Performance Standards directly address DLLs\u2019 unique cultural and linguistic needs (U.S. Dept. of HHS, 2016) thus providing an underlying structure to support children who are proficient in Spanish regardless of their English language proficiency.\nRQ 2.

Extant data from the Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES:2009) were analyzed. Children from Spanish-speaking households who were three years old when they participated in the study were selected for analyses.  Data were collected at three time points spanning two full years of Head Start participation. Parallel-process latent growth models identified three patterns of dual language development. The smallest group (Average English and Spanish) was characterized by standard scores of English and Spanish in the \u2018Average\u2019 range across time. The second group (Moderately Low Increasing to Average English; Stable Average Spanish) showed Spanish and English standard scores that were closely related across time. Standard scores for this group were on the cusp between the \u2018Average\u2019 and \u2018Moderately Low\u2019 ranges. The final, and largest, group (Increasing Extremely Low English; Stable Average Spanish) had Spanish standard scores in the \u2018Average\u2019 range across time and English standard scores that increased more than one standard deviation, to \u2018Moderately Low,\u2019 by Head Start exit. Effects of group membership on executive functioning scores at Head Start exit were tested and showed that children with similar standard scores in English and Spanish across time, performed statistically significantly better on the executive functioning task than children in the largest group suggestions that the positive relation between bilingualism and executive function may be due to cascading effects between overlapping processes. However, a limitation of this study was that the smallest group of children had such a limited sample size that it may have not had the power necessary to address subsequent questions. The current proposal address this limitation by linking the 2006 and 2009 FACES studies to effectively double the sample size available. Furthermore, the current proposal takes the additional step of not only investigating how latent language groups predict school-readiness outcomes, but also the impact of early language environments on patterns of dual language development.", "q8.question": "To identify the latent dual language groups, a parallel process latent growth model (LGM) will be conducted to simultaneously estimate the growth curves for English and Spanish.  LGM is the covariance structural equation model (SEM) representation of the multilevel model (MLM) for change. LGM is capable of adjusted standard errors for data that is nested. This is important given the structure of the current study (i.e., time nested within individuals). LGM fits a growth model with fixed (i.e., average level) and random (i.e., variability around the average) effects and correctly estimates adjusted standard errors.  In short, this is a flexible and powerful methodological approach capable of estimating growth curve models to test hypotheses about within-person change over time (i.e., intraindividual change) and between-person differences in change over time (i.e., interindividual change; Bollen, 2014; Ram &amp; Grimm, 2007; Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002; Singer &amp; Willett, 2003).  In addition, results using these methods are robust to missing data. Due to attrition over time in the FACES dataset, not all cases are complete. The most typical method for handling incomplete (or missing) data is by using maximum likelihood estimation. This estimation method assumes repeated measures are continuous and normally distributed. Preliminary analyses will be inspected to ensure the selected data meet these assumptions.\nLGM in Mplus was chosen because of some distinct advantages that fit the\n current proposal\u2019s analytical needs: (a) the ability to handle item missing data on both the outcomes and the predictors via utilization of full-information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation; (b) the ability to assess model fit via global fit statistics (e.g., Confirmatory Fit Index [CFI]) to analytically evaluate and determine the best-fitting growth model; (c) the ability to model and analyze changes in multiple variables, and relationships among multiple variables, simultaneously (Chou et al., 1998; Diallo, Morin,&amp; Parker, 2014; Ferrer et al., 2004; Willett, 2004 ).\nA limitation of the previous study was inability to test non-linear trajectories. Due to the number of missing cases at the fourth time point (kindergarten) the previous project selected to only included three timepoints whereas four time points are required to test quadradic slopes. However, with twice the sample size afforded by linking the 2006 and 2009 studies, it is expected that sufficient cases from Spanish-speaking households will be available at the final data collections point to test latent quadratic slopes (non-linear trajectories). This is an important extension of the previous research with receptive language particularly because a similar study using expressive language detected non-linear dual language patterns (Escobar &amp; Tamis-LeMonda, 2017).\nAs a first step to conduct a parallel process analysis, separate models will be fitted to English and Spanish vocabulary raw scores, thus, all of the following steps will be completed for English and Spanish separately. First, intercept-only first-order latent growth curve models (LGCM) will be examined. In the baseline models, all cases will be considered to have identical growth patterns, means, variances, and covariances. All parameters are constrained to be equivalent across groups. In essence, the model is forced to assume all students belong to a single-group.\nNext, fit statistics for linear and non-linear LGC models will be compared to intercept-only models. Then, random effects of the linear models were inspected. In contrast to fixed-effects (i.e., the sample's mean value for intercept and slope) random effects indicate the amount of variability around the sample's mean value for intercept and slope. In order to proceed with investigating if time-invariant predictors explain variability in random effects, these values must be statistically significant. The addition of covariates is intended to explain the observed variability around the sample\u2019s mean intercept and slope. If random effects are statistically significant, child gender (the only time-invariant covariate planned for inclusion) will be entered on the slopes and intercepts of the two separate models. Covariates will be set to their individual variances as a requirement of time-invariant variables in LGCM. If child gender is not statistically significant it will be dropped from the final parallel process model.\nThe two resulting models (one for Spanish, one for English) will be combined into a single parallel-process model. Residual variances for each outcome variable will be constrained to be equal over the three measurement occasions. Syntax will be added to prompt the generation of data-driven groups based on students\u2019 Spanish and English language scores. To account for the possibility that there may be more or fewer unobserved groups than hypothesized, models were tested with 2, 3, 4, and 5 group solutions. Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was compared between models to determine the best-fitting model (Nylund, Asparouhov, &amp; Muth\u00e9n, 2007). The number and nature of groups in the final best fitting model will be described.\nA total of 905 cases are expected to be available for analyses. Using an equation for estimating power in latent class analyses (Dziak, Lanza, &amp; Tan, 2014) a model with 3 classes, and 4 variables (Spanish vocabulary, English vocabulary, and child gender), an effect size of .17 is needed to have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis with the current estimated sample size. This ranges between the benchmarks for a small (.10) and medium (.30) effect size (Cohen, 1988).\nResearch question one:   Does latent dual language group membership differentially predict behavior outcomes? A multivariate regression analysis will test the relation between latent language group and behavior outcomes. In this analysis, dual language membership will essentially be treated as a categorical variable as assigned through the process described above. As a precaution, an intraclass correlation coefficient analyses will first be conducted to inspect the proportion of between-unit variance to total variance. As described previously, FACES used a multi-stage clustered sampling technique. Unlike simple random sampling, it is expected that observations are not independent because there are inherent clusters at each stage of sampling. Children in the same program, center, or classroom, are more likely to share similar characteristics due to being drawn from the same environment. An intraclass correlation will be conducted at the program, center, and teacher level to describe how similar student\u2019s scores are at each level. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), indicate the proportion of between-unit variance to total variance. In addition to providing contextual information about language scores, the presence of significant clustering can lead to considerable bias in the results of tests of statistical significance in conventional OLS regression analyses, which does not take the dependence of observations into account (Cohen, Cohen, West &amp; Aiken, 2003). In previous work using data from Spanish-speaking children in the FACES dataset has not indicated a significant amount of clustering that requires a more complex analytic method to account for clustering and it is expected a regression analysis will be sufficiently sophisticated to answer research questions one. \nDescriptive analyses and preliminary correlations of all variables of interest will first be inspected to ensure the distribution of scores relation between covariates and outcomes meet assumptions. Latent dual language group will be dummy coded based on model generated assignment. Regression analysis has been selected because it allows for the inclusion of multiple covariates to be entered into the model. This will be important as we expect to include family demographic variables, child gender, and initial behavioral scores as control variables in order to tease out the distinct impact of language group on behavior. With a total sample size of 905 cases a power analysis, using G*Power, indicates that an analysis with an error probability of p &lt; .05, testing 5 predictors (e.g. child gender, initial behavior, maternal education, length of time in the U.S, and family income) has sufficient power (.92) to detect a small effect (.02).\nThe results will provide links from a holistic view of dual language development to behavior development. Results will inform discussions with the partner Head Start site to develop person-centered strategies focused on the unique strengths and needs of DLL students in the Head Start program. \nResearch question two: After controlling for demographic factors, are there significant differences between latent dual language groups in terms of family and home environment factors? An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to address this research question. This technique allows for the inspection of between group differences on key family and home environment outcomes while accounting/controlling for differences that might be attributable to group membership. ANCOVA is used to remove noise from the analysis that was induced by random differences between groups. Because it is impossible to randomly assign children to be a part of a specific dual language group, group assignment is not randomized meaning there may be confounding effects on the outcome variable of interest. Thus, this analytic method would permit controlling for demographic variables, such as maternal education, to inspect the specific differences between group averages on the family outcome variable of interest.\nUnderstanding how family and home environment factors differ between groups can provide clues for programs to understand what developmental pattern a child might be headed towards beyond their presenting language ability. Findings may additionally provide insight into key variables that meaningfully impact child language development which may prove to be useful points of leverage for families as they make choices that guide children toward the language development trajectory of most value to them.\nResearch question three: For each latent dual language group, how do factors within the classroom impact behavior outcomes? An intercepts-and-slopes-as-outcomes multilevel regression analysis (Luke, 2004) will be used to answer this question. This type of analysis allows researchers to inspect both random intercepts and random slopes with predictors at both the individual level and the cluster level. \nMost importantly, this approach allows for the ability to test potential interaction effects between the individual level predictors and cluster level predictors. This means that we can inspect whether there is a difference between dual language groups in respect to how classroom level variables, such as teacher education, impact child behavior. Teacher education is a cluster level variable because it varies between, but not within, each Head Start classroom. In other words, all the children in the same classroom are experiencing the same teacher characteristics. The impact these cluster level variables have on behavior outcomes will provide direction for person-specific strategies for teachers. Results would provide direction to tailor classroom support to meeting the unique needs of DLL children based on differences observed based on latent dual language group. ", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "FACES is a series of longitudinal studies of Head Start classrooms, children, and families. Researchers follow 3- and 4-year-old children from their first year in a Head Start classroom until their first year in kindergarten. Data is collected at the program, center, classroom, child, and family level. A major limitation of the previous study the current proposal is building upon was that the smallest group of children had such a limited sample size that it may have not had the power necessary to address subsequent questions. FACES, with its successive nationally representative samples, provides descriptive data from different years\u2019 studies (FACES 2014, 2009, 2006, 2003, and so on) that may be used to analyze trends and changes in the Head Start program, the population enrolled, and the services provided. For example, it is possible to combine data from FACES 2006 and FACES 2009, as is planned for the current study. Participation rates in FACES are historically high and a total of 905 cases from Spanish-speaking households are expected to be available for analyses (456 cases from 2006; 449 cases from 2009). To facilitate cross-study comparisons, the content and naming of the measures used in the FACES instruments is structured with considerable overlap. This means that once the variables and sample of interest have been selected from each study, the files can be merged to increase the overall sample size available for planned analyses.\nFACES data collection in 2006 and 2009 occurred in three waves that followed children from their first year in Head Start until the spring of their kindergarten year. Only children who are coded as Spanish-speakers, have not been identified as having a speech or language disorder at any assessment wave, and were three years old at the first wave of data collection, thus having an opportunity to experience two full years of Head Start before kindergarten, will be included in analyses. FACES data are used to answer questions about children who are dual language learners (DLL) and attend Head Start, particularly with respect to a congressionally mandated report on such children. Thus, each study provides detailed information relevant to DLL students. Additionally, for many children from non-English homes, Head Start may be the first fully immersive English experience where they are expected to participate and learn making it a critical scene to investigate dual language development and the surrounding care context.

", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Receptive vocabulary in English and Spanish was measures using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) and Test de Vocabulario en Im\u00e1genes Peabody (TVIP; Dunn, Padilla, Lugo, &amp; Dunn, 1986) respectively. The PPVT was administered to all children in the study, regardless of home language, and the TVIP was administered to all children whose parents indicated their primary home language was Spanish.  Both measures are designed to measure receptive vocabulary of participants from age 2 and a half years to adults (Dunn &amp; Dunn, 2006). Administration and scoring is similar across measures. Participants are shown picture plates with four pictures and asked to point to the picture that best represents a stimulus word presented orally by the examiner. The items are presented in order of increasing difficulty. Testing is discontinued after participants have made eight or more errors in a set of 12 stimulus words. One point is awarded for each correct response, and the sum of the correct responses is used as the index of receptive vocabulary. Scores may be converted into standard scores, with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 (Dunn &amp; Dunn, 2007). The administration manual notes the following about the PPVT\u2019s application to English language learners: \n\u201cThe PPVT-4 instrument was normed exclusively on individuals who are proficient in English, and therefore it would not be best practice to report a normative score on this test for an individual who is not English proficient. As a criterion measure, however, the PPVT-4 scale is useful for assessing the extent and nature of a person\u2019s knowledge of standard American English words. The early item sets of each PPVT-4 form include high-frequency, commonly used words. These words can aid in screening individuals for whom English is not the primary language and in planning interventions for those who want to attain English proficiency.\u201d (Dunn &amp; Dunn, 2007, p.3)\nSplit-half reliability and alpha coefficients are consistently high at all ages and grades (Dunn &amp; Dunn, 2007). The FACES User Guide indicates that the Cronbach alpha scores across time points ranged from 0.91 to 0.97 for the PPVT and 0.89 to 0.94 for the TVIP (Malone et al., 2013). Average test-retest reliability is reported to be .93 (Malone et al., 2013). The PPVT demonstrates convergent validity as it has been found to correlate with two established tests of expressive vocabulary: the Expressive Vocabulary Test, Second Edition (.80 to .84), and the Comprehensive Assessment of Spoken Language (mid-.60s to high .70s; Dunn &amp; Dunn, 2007). All children participating in FACES testing were administered the PPVT. Split half reliabilities of the TVIP range from .80 to .94 (Dunn et al., 1986). The content validity of the measure with the Kauffman Assessment Battery for Children Spanish ranged from .25 to .56 and concurrent validity was .44 with the Habilidad General Ability Test (Dunn et al., 1986).\nChild gender will be included as a control variable in analyses targeted at identifying latent language groups because gender has been shown to influence language development in both monolinguals and bilinguals. Studies of monolingual language development report female children tend to have a larger vocabulary than males of the same age (Huttenlocher, Haight, Bryk, Seltzer, &amp; Lyons, 1991). Studies of DLL students have mixed results related to whether gender makes a significant impact on English language learning (Greenberg-Motamedi, 2015; Grissom, 2004; Thompson, 2017; Uriarte et al., 2011), or experience no differences related to dual language development vocabulary (Hammer, Davison, Lawrence, &amp; Miccio, 2009).\nChild Problem and Prosocial Behavior were both collected from both parents and teachers. Taken together, the parent and teacher ratings permitted a comparison of assessment items for a given child and allowed construction of composites of children\u2019s social behavior across settings and data sources. However, given that different behaviors may be more or less salient in the home versus the classroom, a subset of items in the rating scales is unique to each setting and data source.\nParents and teachers were asked to rate each child on a set of behaviors that assessed the child\u2019s basic social skill and behavior problems. The ratings included items drawn from the Personal Maturity Scale, Social Skills Rating System (SSRS; Gresham and Elliott 1990; Elliott et al. 1988) and Behavior Problems Index (BPI; Peterson and Zill 1986). Teachers and parents indicated the extent to which a given statement (such as \u201cmakes friends easily\u201d) was characteristic of the child, from 1 (\u201cnever\u201d) to 3 (\u201cvery often\u201d). Summary scores were created from the three-point scale items.\nItems in the FACES behavior problems scale, which measure negative child behaviors associated with learning problems, come from an abbreviated adaptation of the Personal Maturity Scale and from the Behavior Problems Index (BPI; Peterson and Zill 1986). The BPI included undercontrol (such as aggression, hyperactivity, and destructiveness) and overcontrol (such as social withdrawal, depression, and somatic problems) behaviors; the internal consistency of the BPI total score ranged from 0.88 to 0.89 in the National Health Interview Survey and the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY) (Berry et al. 2004). Given that the BPI does not adequately assess pro-social or positive behaviors, additional items for the parent and teacher rating scales were taken from the SSRS and from the Personal Maturity Scale..\nThe Personal Maturity Scale was originally used in the 1976\u20131977 National Survey of Children (Zill and Daly 1993) and later adapted by Alexander and Entwisle for use in their longitudinal study of achievement of Baltimore\u2019s inner-city elementary school children (Alexander and Entwisle 1988). The scale, which measured a child\u2019s interest or participation, cooperation or compliance, and attention span or restlessness, consists of 13 items forming three subscales, with alpha reliabilities ranging from 0.74 to 0.85. The SSRS social skills scale\u2019s alpha coefficients range from 0.87 to 0.90 for parent reports across the elementary and preschool SSRS forms, respectively, and 0.94 for the teacher forms.\nParent interviews were collected from participating families via computer-assisted personal and telephone interviews conducted in Spanish and English. A rich resources of information is available including demographic information (e.g. immigration status, maternal education), information specific to the presence and value of Spanish in the home (e.g. number of people, books, and materials in the home in Spanish, how proficient the respondent is in English in Spanish, how valuable home and English language is to the respondent), and questions addressing the home learning environment. \nIn FACES, information about activities with children come from previous national surveys, including the NHES and Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) Inventory, a standard measure of the quality of the language and learning environment in the home. FACES obtained information about the frequency of various types of stimulating or educational activities with the child, such as singing songs or nursery rhymes, counting together, visiting the park, and shopping or running errands. These items, drawn from national surveys, were used to form scales that assessed the parent\u2019s participation in the child\u2019s educational experiences and cognitive stimulation. \nClassroom variables available for analyses include observational measures of quality, teacher characteristics, and curriculum and support specific to DLL students. Observational measures of the classroom include the Instructional Support (instructional support, concept development, and language modeling) domain of the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS; Pianta et al., 2008) and the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale\u2013Revised (ECERS\u2013R).   \nThe CLASS observes and assesses the quality of interactions between teachers and students in classrooms and measures aspects of interactions related to children\u2019s early academic achievement and social competencies. Each dimension is rated on a seven-point scale (1 = \u201cminimally characteristic\u201d to 7 = \u201chighly characteristic\u201d) for each of four observation cycles. For Instructional Support domain, publisher-reported internal consistency = 0.79, correlation between two observations as an indicator of test-retest reliability = 0.86, and average inter-rater reliability (within one point of rating from master raters) is 87 percent (Pianata et al., 2008). \nThe Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale\u2013Revised (ECERS\u2013R) is a global rating of classroom quality based on structural features of the classroom (Harms et al. 2005). The classroom environment is defined as the use of space, materials, and experiences to enhance children\u2019s development, daily schedule, and supervision. Even though child development research has made wide use of the ECERS\u2013R to predict optimal child outcomes (for example, Phillips et al. 1994), research studies have not consistently supported the seven-scale factor structure of the full ECERS\u2013R (Malone et al. 2010). Accordingly, FACES used a subset of items from the ECERS\u2013R which has also been used by the Multi-State Study of Prekindergarten, the State-Wide Early Education Program (SWEEP; Early et al. 2005), and the Chicago Program Evaluation Project (C-PEP) study (Ross et al. 2008). The items in the short form represent the strongest 21 items identified by researchers in a large-scale study (Clifford et al. 2005) and form two factors: Teaching and Interactions (that is, the quality of teacher-child interactions) and Provisions for Learning (that is, materials available in the classroom and the arrangement of the classroom space). Each of the two factors encompasses 11 to 12 items, with each item rated on a seven-point scale that denotes a level of quality associated with the scale score. A score of one is considered \u201cinadequate,\u201d 3 is \u201cminimal quality,\u201d 5 is \u201cgood quality,\u201d and 7 is \u201cexcellent quality.\u201d In spring 2010 and spring 2011 of FACES 2009, the internal consistency reliability (Cronbach\u2019s alpha) for the Teaching and Interactions mean score and the Provisions for Learning mean score ranged, respectively, from 0.84 to 0.85 and from 0.80 to 0.84. For the ECERS\u2013R, inter-rater reliability for the full scale ranges from 0.85 (rank-order correlations) to 0.92 (Pearson), and inter-rater reliability on individual items reached agreement of 71 percent for agreement within one point. Internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s alpha) ranged from 0.71 (parents and staff) to 0.88 (activities), with an alpha coefficient of 0.92 for the full scale (Harms et al. 2005).\nTeacher characteristics, are a set of structural factors related to child care quality, include teacher education and training. The Head Start teacher interview asked about the classroom teacher\u2019s teaching experience (number of years teaching in Head Start), educational background (the highest grade or year of school completed), teaching credentials (for example, Child Development Associate), salary, and demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity). Additionally, teacher\u2019s Teachers\u2019 knowledge and beliefs about best teaching practices for early childhood education was collected using 15 statements representing opinions on how Head Start children should be taught and managed (Burts et al. 1990). Two statements posit that \u201cHead Start classroom activities should be responsive to individual differences in development\u201d and \u201cStudents should work silently and alone on seatwork.\u201d The Head Start teacher indicated whether and to what extent he or she agreed or disagreed with each statement based on a five-point Likert type scale (1 = \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d; 5 = \u201cstrongly agree\u201d).\nPresence of overt DLL support provided is also collected through questions asked in teacher and program interviews. Surveys ask about what specific curriculum are used and if there is guidance provided to support language development of DLL children. Respondents were asked questions about the language demographic in the classroom such as how many adults and children in the classroom speak Spanish, who in the classroom uses Spanish for instruction and speaking to the group, and the availability of materials in Spanish in the classroom. Finally, interviews also asked teachers to rate their proficiency speaking and understanding Spanish.

The number and nature of groups in the final best fitting model will be described.\nA total of 905 cases are expected to be available for analyses. Using an equation for estimating power in latent class analyses (Dziak, Lanza, &amp; Tan, 2014) a model with 3 classes, and 4 variables (Spanish vocabulary, English vocabulary, and child gender), an effect size of .17 is needed to have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis with the current estimated sample size. This ranges between the benchmarks for a small (.10) and medium (.30) effect size (Cohen, 1988).\nResearch question one:   Does latent dual language group membership differentially predict behavior outcomes? A multivariate regression analysis will test the relation between latent language group and behavior outcomes. In this analysis, dual language membership will essentially be treated as a categorical variable as assigned through the process described above. As a precaution, an intraclass correlation coefficient analyses will first be conducted to inspect the proportion of between-unit variance to total variance. As described previously, FACES used a multi-stage clustered sampling technique. Unlike simple random sampling, it is expected that observations are not independent because there are inherent clusters at each stage of sampling. Children in the same program, center, or classroom, are more likely to share similar characteristics due to being drawn from the same environment. An intraclass correlation will be conducted at the program, center, and teacher level to describe how similar student\u2019s scores are at each level. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), indicate the proportion of between-unit variance to total variance. In addition to providing contextual information about language scores, the presence of significant clustering can lead to considerable bias in the results of tests of statistical significance in conventional OLS regression analyses, which does not take the dependence of observations into account (Cohen, Cohen, West &amp; Aiken, 2003). In previous work using data from Spanish-speaking children in the FACES dataset has not indicated a significant amount of clustering that requires a more complex analytic method to account for clustering and it is expected a regression analysis will be sufficiently sophisticated to answer research questions one. \nDescriptive analyses and preliminary correlations of all variables of interest will first be inspected to ensure the distribution of scores relation between covariates and outcomes meet assumptions. Latent dual language group will be dummy coded based on model generated assignment. Regression analysis has been selected because it allows for the inclusion of multiple covariates to be entered into the model. This will be important as we expect to include family demographic variables, child gender, and initial behavioral scores as control variables in order to tease out the distinct impact of language group on behavior. With a total sample size of 905 cases a power analysis, using G*Power, indicates that an analysis with an error probability of p &lt; .05, testing 5 predictors (e.g. child gender, initial behavior, maternal education, length of time in the U.S, and family income) has sufficient power (.92) to detect a small effect (.02).\nThe results will provide links from a holistic view of dual language development to behavior development. Results will inform discussions with the partner Head Start site to develop person-centered strategies focused on the unique strengths and needs of DLL students in the Head Start program. \nResearch question two: After controlling for demographic factors, are there significant differences between latent dual language groups in terms of family and home environment factors? An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to address this research question. This technique allows for the inspection of between group differences on key family and home environment outcomes while accounting/controlling for differences that might be attributable to group membership. ANCOVA is used to remove noise from the analysis that was induced by random differences between groups. Because it is impossible to randomly assign children to be a part of a specific dual language group, group assignment is not randomized meaning there may be confounding effects on the outcome variable of interest. Thus, this analytic method would permit controlling for demographic variables, such as maternal education, to inspect the specific differences between group averages on the family outcome variable of interest.\nUnderstanding how family and home environment factors differ between groups can provide clues for programs to understand what developmental pattern a child might be headed towards beyond their presenting language ability. Findings may additionally provide insight into key variables that meaningfully impact child language development which may prove to be useful points of leverage for families as they make choices that guide children toward the language development trajectory of most value to them.\nResearch question three: For each latent dual language group, how do factors within the classroom impact behavior outcomes? An intercepts-and-slopes-as-outcomes multilevel regression analysis (Luke, 2004) will be used to answer this question. This type of analysis allows researchers to inspect both random intercepts and random slopes with predictors at both the individual level and the cluster level. \nMost importantly, this approach allows for the ability to test potential interaction effects between the individual level predictors and cluster level predictors. This means that we can inspect whether there is a difference between dual language groups in respect to how classroom level variables, such as teacher education, impact child behavior. Teacher education is a cluster level variable because it varies between, but not within, each Head Start classroom. In other words, all the children in the same classroom are experiencing the same teacher characteristics. The impact these cluster level variables have on behavior outcomes will provide direction for person-specific strategies for teachers. Results would provide direction to tailor classroom support to meeting the unique needs of DLL children based on differences observed based on latent dual language group.

Before that, they choose an avatar with whom they identify to represent them in the game. These avatars will consist of emojis depicting different ethnic or national identities; this is used to make their social identity salient. Adopting the classical narrative used in the Cyberball paradigm (see Zadro et al., 2004), participants will be told that they are supposed to practice their mental visualisation skills by playing a ball-toss game on the computer with other participants, connected through the internet. They will be told that performance is unimportant, but that they should focus on visualising themselves, the situation and the other players.

Demographic questions asking about age, gender, education, employment status and ethnicity are also included. The whole questionnaire intended to be used in the main analysis can be found in the appendix.\n\nNeed satisfaction. Need satisfaction will be measured using a scale taken from Jamieson et al. (2010). It consists of four scales with 5 items each, measuring satisfaction of need for control (e.g. \u201cI felt I had control over the course of the game\u201d), need for meaningful existence (e.g. \u201cI felt important\u201d), need for self-esteem (e.g. \u201cI felt liked\u201d) and need for belonging (\u201cI felt I belonged to the group\u201d). Answers are given on a 5-point scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). These items are specifically designed to be used after the Cyberball manipulation, however Jamieson et al. (2010) do not indicate estimations of reliability or validity, only correlations between scales. They are correlated significantly, between .43 and .68 in study 1 and between .32 and .69 in study 2.\n\nRadicalisation. Indicators of radicalisation consist of the \u201cExtremism Scale\u201d as well as the \u201cPro-violence and Illegal Acts in Relation to Extremism Scale (PIARES)\u201d by Ozer &amp; Bertelsen (2018). The former examines participants extremist mindset, including items like \u201cMost people in this country have a lifestyle and culture that is necessary to change totally.\u201d or \u201cIt is a waste of time to try to find common solutions with those whose thoughts about life are completely different than ours.\u201d. The latter asks whether participants support the use of violence or breaking the law in order to achieve certain goals related to the extremist mindset. Thus, this scale is not explicitly related to the ostracism manipulation but refers to a general state of mind after the ostracism experience. The Extremism Scale consists of 14 items and the PIARES consists of 12 items, 6 for each dimension. Items are scored on a seven-point Likert scale ranging from (1) \u201cStrongly disagree\u201d to (7) \u201cStrongly agree\u201d. The measurement was validated on 686 Danish and US-American high school and college students using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, yielding satisfactory results, as well as construct validity through correlations with criteria scales. There are no estimates of reliability given.\nSimilar to PIARES, we will add two dimensions with the same items, however asking whether participants would try to achieve these goals using legal means (termed \u201cLegal Means in Relation to Extremism\u201d) and whether they would not take action at all when it comes to these goals (termed \u201cNo Acts in Relation to Extremism\u201d). Thereby, we hope to capture a broader variety of the effect of ostracism and need threat. This extended questionnaire will be tested before the main study on a sample of about 50 participants to establish reliability. However, if the pilot study indicates insufficient reliability of these two extra dimensions, they will be excluded from the main analysis.\n\nManipulation Check. For evaluating the success of the ostracism manipulation, several items will be used to assess perception of inclusion. These items are taken from (Zadro et al., 2004; see also Jamieson et al., 2010) and are the following: \u201cWhat percent of the throws were thrown to you?\u201d or \u201cWhat percent of the throws were thrown to player 2\u201d, \u201cTo what extent were you included by the other participants during the game?\u201d or \u201cTo what extend was player 2 included by the other participants during the game?\u201d (rated on a 7-point Likert scale) and a 9-point bipolar scale asking how participants or player 2 felt during the game, consisting of the poles \u201crejected\u201d and \u201caccepted\u201d.\n\nAttention Check. Throughout the survey, a total of 6 items measuring attentiveness of the respondent are included, asking to indicate a specific answer (e.g. \u201cThis is an attention check, please choose the answer \"Not at all\".\u201d).\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "We will work with SEM using mean scores of obtained measures."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q19": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "We will run a structural regression model, using the four conditions as predictors; needs for belonging, self-esteem, control and meaningful existence as mediators; and 5 outcome variables: extremism, pro-violence in relation to extremism, illegal acts in relation to extremism, legal means in relation to extremism, and no acts in relation to extremism.

Before that, they choose an avatar with whom they identify to represent them in the game. These avatars will consist of emojis depicting different ethnic or national identities; this is used to make their social identity salient. Adopting the classical narrative used in the Cyberball paradigm (see Zadro et al., 2004), participants will be told that they are supposed to practice their mental visualisation skills by playing a ball-toss game on the computer with other participants, connected through the internet. They will be told that performance is unimportant, but that they should focus on visualising themselves, the situation and the other players. Participants in the \u201cother\u201d-condition are told to watch a specific player (\u201cplayer 2\u201d) and visualise the same aspects but from his or her perspective. Player 2 will be represented by the same emoji participants chose before but of the opposite gender, to indicate it is indeed a different person. The simulated players will also introduce themselves briefly in a chat window. Participants are instructed to throw the ball to one of the other players if the receive it or to watch the throws in the \u201cother\u201d-condition. The game is set to a total of 30 throws in all conditions, where inclusion is defined as receiving the ball 1/3 of the time and exclusion as receiving it only twice within the first 5 throws but not after that. After the game, participants are redirected to the questionnaire. Survey length will be approximately 15 minutes, based on an average of 8 seconds per items and a duration of 5 minutes playing Cyberball. ", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "The survey contains scales measuring 9 factors in total, as well as a check on the success of the manipulation. Demographic questions asking about age, gender, education, employment status and ethnicity are also included. The whole questionnaire intended to be used in the main analysis can be found in the appendix.\n\nNeed satisfaction. Need satisfaction will be measured using a scale taken from Jamieson et al. (2010). It consists of four scales with 5 items each, measuring satisfaction of need for control (e.g. \u201cI felt I had control over the course of the game\u201d), need for meaningful existence (e.g. \u201cI felt important\u201d), need for self-esteem (e.g. \u201cI felt liked\u201d) and need for belonging (\u201cI felt I belonged to the group\u201d). Answers are given on a 5-point scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). These items are specifically designed to be used after the Cyberball manipulation, however Jamieson et al. (2010) do not indicate estimations of reliability or validity, only correlations between scales. They are correlated significantly, between .43 and .68 in study 1 and between .32 and .69 in study 2.\n\nRadicalisation. Indicators of radicalisation consist of the \u201cExtremism Scale\u201d as well as the \u201cPro-violence and Illegal Acts in Relation to Extremism Scale (PIARES)\u201d by Ozer &amp; Bertelsen (2018). The former examines participants extremist mindset, including items like \u201cMost people in this country have a lifestyle and culture that is necessary to change totally.\u201d or \u201cIt is a waste of time to try to find common solutions with those whose thoughts about life are completely different than ours.\u201d. The latter asks whether participants support the use of violence or breaking the law in order to achieve certain goals related to the extremist mindset. Thus, this scale is not explicitly related to the ostracism manipulation but refers to a general state of mind after the ostracism experience. The Extremism Scale consists of 14 items and the PIARES consists of 12 items, 6 for each dimension. Items are scored on a seven-point Likert scale ranging from (1) \u201cStrongly disagree\u201d to (7) \u201cStrongly agree\u201d. The measurement was validated on 686 Danish and US-American high school and college students using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, yielding satisfactory results, as well as construct validity through correlations with criteria scales. There are no estimates of reliability given.\nSimilar to PIARES, we will add two dimensions with the same items, however asking whether participants would try to achieve these goals using legal means (termed \u201cLegal Means in Relation to Extremism\u201d) and whether they would not take action at all when it comes to these goals (termed \u201cNo Acts in Relation to Extremism\u201d). Thereby, we hope to capture a broader variety of the effect of ostracism and need threat. This extended questionnaire will be tested before the main study on a sample of about 50 participants to establish reliability. However, if the pilot study indicates insufficient reliability of these two extra dimensions, they will be excluded from the main analysis.\n\nManipulation Check. For evaluating the success of the ostracism manipulation, several items will be used to assess perception of inclusion. These items are taken from (Zadro et al., 2004; see also Jamieson et al., 2010) and are the following: \u201cWhat percent of the throws were thrown to you?\u201d or \u201cWhat percent of the throws were thrown to player 2\u201d, \u201cTo what extent were you included by the other participants during the game?\u201d or \u201cTo what extend was player 2 included by the other participants during the game?\u201d (rated on a 7-point Likert scale) and a 9-point bipolar scale asking how participants or player 2 felt during the game, consisting of the poles \u201crejected\u201d and \u201caccepted\u201d.\n\nAttention Check. Throughout the survey, a total of 6 items measuring attentiveness of the respondent are included, asking to indicate a specific answer (e.g. \u201cThis is an attention check, please choose the answer \"Not at all\".\u201d).\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "We will work with SEM using mean scores of obtained measures.", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "We will run a structural regression model, using the four conditions as predictors; needs for belonging, self-esteem, control and meaningful existence as mediators; and 5 outcome variables: extremism, pro-violence in relation to extremism, illegal acts in relation to extremism, legal means in relation to extremism, and no acts in relation to extremism. A simplified representation of the model is attached; please note that due to clarity, error indicators and some arrows/relationships are missing. However, the two inclusion conditions are assumed to lead to higher need satisfaction, whereas the two exclusion conditions are assumed to lead to lower need satisfaction. This is assumed for all four needs. \nHigher need satisfaction in each need in turn is associated with a lower manifestation of extremism, pro-violence and illegal acts, represented by a negative correlation as well as higher values in legal means and no acts, represented by a positive correlation. \nLower need satisfaction in each need in turn is associated with a higher manifestation of extremism, pro-violence and illegal acts, represented by a negative correlation as well as lower values in legal means and no acts, represented by a positive correlation.
