relationship-specific power changes the associations of different self-relevant brands with life satisfaction. In these three studies we have distinguished between aspirational brands (brands reflecting a person\u2019s risky ideal-self) from expressive brands (brands reflecting a person\u2019s comfortable present-self). We have found that thinking about aspirational brands is better for high-relationship-power consumers whereas thinking about expressive brands is better for low-relationship-power consumers (Pilot Studies A, B, and C). The effect disappears (Pilot Study B) or diminishes (Pilot Study C) when perceived partner judgments are removed. We interpret these findings using risk-regulation models of relationship security, in which insecurity (e.g., low relationship-power) is associated with need for partner approval when considering relationship-external growth or expansion.\n\nThe purpose of Study 1 (the study being pre-registered) is to replicate Pilot Study A, but replacing a forced-choice paradigm for considering brands with a manipulation of whether participants think about one brand over the other. In Pilot Study A, participants were introduced to aspirational and expressive brands and then were asked to choose one of the two brands. In Pilot Study B, we manipulated whether participants thought about one brand or the other. In both studies, aspirational brands were associated with higher life satisfaction for high-relationship-power participants than expressive brands, whereas expressive brands were associated with higher life satisfaction for low-relationship-power participants than aspirational brands. In Study 1, we would like to replicate this basic finding using the manipulation from Pilot Study B. In all other aspects, Study 1 will replicate Pilot Study A, which means that Study 1 will discard other features of Pilot Study B, such as a manipulation of partner approval.\n\nOther differences between Pilot Study A and Study 1: \n- Pilot Study A measured pre-manipulation relationship-power using 4 items of the modified Anderson et al. (2012) 8-item measure. The remaining 4 items were measured post-manipulation, to test for within-person changes in relationship power. We did not observe changes in power as a result of our manipulation and therefore Study 1 will measure relationship power using all 8 items of the original scale, before the manipulation, discarding any test of pre-post changes in relationship power.\n- Pilot Study A used a single-item measure of relationship power (in addition to the 4-item modified Anderson et al scale), which in hindsight better measured \"who benefits from the relationship\" than it measured relationship power per se. Study 1 will discard this measure in place of the 8-item modified Anderson et al scale (see note #1, above).\n- Pilot Study A used early drafts of our definitions of aspirational and expressive brands. Study 1, in our manipulation of brand awareness, will utilize the most recent versions, which better reflect our conceptualizations of these brands. \n- Pilot Study A utilized a measure of relationship dependence as a DV, in addition to Satisfaction with Life (SWL). This measure will be discarded in Study 1, and we will measure only SWL as our sole DV, consistent with our model thus far."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "1.

Consistent with our studies thus far, we expect a positive and significant effect of power on life satisfaction.

In Pilot Study A, participants were introduced to aspirational and expressive brands and then were asked to choose one of the two brands. In Pilot Study B, we manipulated whether participants thought about one brand or the other.

Study 1 will discard this measure in place of the 8-item modified Anderson et al scale (see note #1, above).\n- Pilot Study A used early drafts of our definitions of aspirational and expressive brands. Study 1, in our manipulation of brand awareness, will utilize the most recent versions, which better reflect our conceptualizations of these brands. \n- Pilot Study A utilized a measure of relationship dependence as a DV, in addition to Satisfaction with Life (SWL).

We have found that thinking about aspirational brands is better for high-relationship-power consumers whereas thinking about expressive brands is better for low-relationship-power consumers (Pilot Studies A, B, and C). The effect disappears (Pilot Study B) or diminishes (Pilot Study C) when perceived partner judgments are removed. We interpret these findings using risk-regulation models of relationship security, in which insecurity (e.g., low relationship-power) is associated with need for partner approval when considering relationship-external growth or expansion.\n\nThe purpose of Study 1 (the study being pre-registered) is to replicate Pilot Study A, but replacing a forced-choice paradigm for considering brands with a manipulation of whether participants think about one brand over the other. In Pilot Study A, participants were introduced to aspirational and expressive brands and then were asked to choose one of the two brands. In Pilot Study B, we manipulated whether participants thought about one brand or the other. In both studies, aspirational brands were associated with higher life satisfaction for high-relationship-power participants than expressive brands, whereas expressive brands were associated with higher life satisfaction for low-relationship-power participants than aspirational brands. In Study 1, we would like to replicate this basic finding using the manipulation from Pilot Study B. In all other aspects, Study 1 will replicate Pilot Study A, which means that Study 1 will discard other features of Pilot Study B, such as a manipulation of partner approval.\n\nOther differences between Pilot Study A and Study 1: \n- Pilot Study A measured pre-manipulation relationship-power using 4 items of the modified Anderson et al. (2012) 8-item measure. The remaining 4 items were measured post-manipulation, to test for within-person changes in relationship power. We did not observe changes in power as a result of our manipulation and therefore Study 1 will measure relationship power using all 8 items of the original scale, before the manipulation, discarding any test of pre-post changes in relationship power.\n- Pilot Study A used a single-item measure of relationship power (in addition to the 4-item modified Anderson et al scale), which in hindsight better measured \"who benefits from the relationship\" than it measured relationship power per se. Study 1 will discard this measure in place of the 8-item modified Anderson et al scale (see note #1, above).\n- Pilot Study A used early drafts of our definitions of aspirational and expressive brands. Study 1, in our manipulation of brand awareness, will utilize the most recent versions, which better reflect our conceptualizations of these brands. \n- Pilot Study A utilized a measure of relationship dependence as a DV, in addition to Satisfaction with Life (SWL).

We distinguished aspirational brands (reflecting a person\u2019s ideal-self) from expressive brands (reflecting a person\u2019s present-self) and found that thinking about aspirational brands is better for high-relationship-power consumers whereas thinking about expressive brands is better for low-relationship-power consumers. The effect disappears when perceived partner judgments are removed. We interpreted these findings using risk-regulation models of relationship security, in which insecurity (e.g., low relationship-power) is associated with need for partner approval when considering relationship-external growth or expansion.\n\nWe have chosen to pre-register our hypotheses and intended procedures for a fourth study.

We do not anticipate a main effect of brand type on life satisfaction, as no main effect of this variable has shown up in any of our prior studies. We anticipate a significant 2-way interaction.\n\nFollowing a significant interaction test, we will conduct a simple effects test of brand type on life satisfaction at 1.5 standard deviations above and below the mean of relationship power. The point of this test is to identify whether aspirational brands are preferred over expressive brands, at higher power, and whether the reverse preference holds at lower power.\n\nFinally, we will conduct a Johnson-Neyman procedure to identify the point on the power continuum at which the relationship between brand type and life satisfaction switches from nonsignificant to statistically significant (at high levels of power) and the point on the power continuum at which the relationship between brand type and life satisfaction switches from statistically significant to nonsignificant (at low levels of power).
