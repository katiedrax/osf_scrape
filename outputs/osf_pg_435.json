We aim to extend this research by observing long-term civic participation among MTO participants in the years that followed, in particular, the causal effect of MTO intervention on voter registration and turnout. In addition, we wish to observe long-term participation among the adult children of MTO participants. Research by Chetty et al. found that the effects of MTO on life outcomes can change overtime, and that treatment effects are stronger for children than adults. We want to explore similar patterns for effects on political behavior. Our mediation models will also test for various mechanisms. These are outlined in \u201cMoving to Opportunity for Fair Housing Demonstration Program: Final Impacts Evaluation,\u201d Exhibit 1.1 (Sanbonmatsu et al. 2011). Finally, we seek to account for spurious effects from contemporary non-political outcomes of MTO."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "We hypothesize that when children are assigned to a low-poverty voucher condition, their political participation will be higher later in life than those who are assigned to a no-voucher condition. Those assigned to a standard voucher condition (unrestricted) will exhibit weaker effects. We expect those assigned as adults or teens to be much less positively affected, likely exhibiting null or negative effects. We will test the moderating effects of gender, race/ethnicity (for racial subgroups with sufficient power), duration of exposure/moving frequency (if available), and city at random assignment (if sufficiently powered). Additionally, we will conduct mediation analysis, using nonparametric procedures (Imai et al. 2010) to estimate the average causal mediation effect and average direct effect of each respective mediator. For example, prior research suggests the MTO intervention led to gains in education and later earnings for children whose families received vouchers to live in low-poverty neighborhoods.

We aim to extend this research by observing long-term civic participation among MTO participants in the years that followed, in particular, the causal effect of MTO intervention on voter registration and turnout. In addition, we wish to observe long-term participation among the adult children of MTO participants. Research by Chetty et al. found that the effects of MTO on life outcomes can change overtime, and that treatment effects are stronger for children than adults. We want to explore similar patterns for effects on political behavior. Our mediation models will also test for various mechanisms. These are outlined in \u201cMoving to Opportunity for Fair Housing Demonstration Program: Final Impacts Evaluation,\u201d Exhibit 1.1 (Sanbonmatsu et al. 2011). Finally, we seek to account for spurious effects from contemporary non-political outcomes of MTO.", "q16": "We hypothesize that when children are assigned to a low-poverty voucher condition, their political participation will be higher later in life than those who are assigned to a no-voucher condition. Those assigned to a standard voucher condition (unrestricted) will exhibit weaker effects. We expect those assigned as adults or teens to be much less positively affected, likely exhibiting null or negative effects. We will test the moderating effects of gender, race/ethnicity (for racial subgroups with sufficient power), duration of exposure/moving frequency (if available), and city at random assignment (if sufficiently powered). Additionally, we will conduct mediation analysis, using nonparametric procedures (Imai et al. 2010) to estimate the average causal mediation effect and average direct effect of each respective mediator. For example, prior research suggests the MTO intervention led to gains in education and later earnings for children whose families received vouchers to live in low-poverty neighborhoods. These are plausible mechanisms for higher rates of political participation later in life. Mediation analysis will allow us to explore the degree to which any gains in political participation among children assigned to the low-poverty vouchers are driven by higher educational attainment and improved earnings.", "q17": "The research team will be licensing data about the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Moving to Opportunity (MTO) program from the National Bureau for Economics Research.

With regard to migration, too, previous studies have found a significant relationship between general risk preferences and migration decisions (e.g., Jaeger et al. 2010, Dustmann et al. 2017). Typically, the economic literature on migration builds on standard human capital models, whereby migration is driven by individuals maximising the net present value of lifetime earnings (e.g. Bodvarsson and Van den Berg 2013). Dohmen et al. (2011) suggest that the general willingness to take risks among Germans indeed correlates with experimental evidence and across domains such as car driving, financial matters, or leisure time (cp. Einav et al. 2012). This finding may result from the widely accepted view that risk aversion constitutes a personality trait, similar to the Big Five (e.g. Josef et al. 2016). Others have found risk preferences to diverge significantly between domains (MacCrimmon and Wehrung 1990; Weber et al. 2002). In such models, possible hardship during migration enters the equation implicitly in the form of costs of migration, which lower the expected pay-off in the destination location (e.g. Williams and Balasz 2012). However, the importance of these costs is questionable in most existing studies on risk perception and migration, as they usually observe regional migration within (industrialised) countries, such as Germany (Jaeger et al. 2010, Dohmen et al. 2011) or China (Akg\u00fcc et al. 2016; Dustmann et al. 2017). Here, the risk of the migration journey is negligible, and possible negative outcomes can be assumed not to be life-threatening. In other words, severe consequences of uncertain behaviour, and least of all the risk of dying, does not play a role in the utility maximisation function of said migrants. This picture changes dramatically for migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa to Europe, who face multiple threats to life during their journey. In 2017, fatalities in the Mediterranean Sea amounted to an estimated 20% of those who set off from The Gambia (Camara and Hunt 2018). Such high probabilities of dying impose the question whether general and/or domain-specific (i.e., regarding the journey itself) risk perceptions can still explain migration behaviour. We provide a simple yet powerful test by assessing migration intentions and risk preferences based on a self-reported general risk measure, lottery choices, and domain-specific risk assessments among 10'000 young Gambians. Subsequently, we follow respondents over 9 months to observe who engages in high-risk migration, and whether risk measures correlate with this decision."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "In exploratory analyses, we will test the assumption about the generalisability of risk preferences (e.g., Dohmen et al. 2011) and investigate to what extent the general risk measure (lottery and general risk perception) correlates with the domain-specific, self-reported risk of dying during the migration journey.

In the context of ``back way'' migration, i.e. illegal routes across the Mediterranean Sea, arrival is not secured. In fact, death is a possible alternative. Hence, a migrant's uncertainty does not only occur in terms of host country (economic) integration, but in terms of arrival in the respective country in the first place. To shed light on this mechanism, we ask respondents about their perception of, first, the probability of migrants in general to die during migration to Europe, and, second, about their individual survival probability, should the respondent decide to leave. We relate the respondent's domain-specific risk assessment to general measures of risk aversion by adding two general risk measures: first, we offer respondents to take part in a lottery. This lottery will also be implemented in subsequent survey waves. Second, we ask respondents directly about their willingness to take risks, as this item has been shown to render robust results compared to more sophisticated measures of risk aversion (cf. Dohmen et al. 2011). Eventually, we define our outcome straightforwardly as stated migration intentions and subsequent actual migration, that is, in waves two, three, and four the respondent or a ``representative'' (see below) informs the interviewer on th respondent's whereabouts. In exploratory analyses, we will test the assumption about the generalisability of risk preferences (e.g., Dohmen et al. 2011) and investigate to what extent the general risk measure (lottery and general risk perception) correlates with the domain-specific, self-reported risk of dying during the migration journey.

Migration drivers also include a measure of actual versus potential well-being, approximated by the individual economic situation (monthly earnings, nutrition, appearance) relative to the expected earnings situation after successful migration.

With regard to migration, too, previous studies have found a significant relationship between general risk preferences and migration decisions (e.g., Jaeger et al. 2010, Dustmann et al. 2017). Typically, the economic literature on migration builds on standard human capital models, whereby migration is driven by individuals maximising the net present value of lifetime earnings (e.g. Bodvarsson and Van den Berg 2013). Dohmen et al. (2011) suggest that the general willingness to take risks among Germans indeed correlates with experimental evidence and across domains such as car driving, financial matters, or leisure time (cp. Einav et al. 2012). This finding may result from the widely accepted view that risk aversion constitutes a personality trait, similar to the Big Five (e.g. Josef et al. 2016). Others have found risk preferences to diverge significantly between domains (MacCrimmon and Wehrung 1990; Weber et al. 2002). In such models, possible hardship during migration enters the equation implicitly in the form of costs of migration, which lower the expected pay-off in the destination location (e.g. Williams and Balasz 2012). However, the importance of these costs is questionable in most existing studies on risk perception and migration, as they usually observe regional migration within (industrialised) countries, such as Germany (Jaeger et al. 2010, Dohmen et al. 2011) or China (Akg\u00fcc et al. 2016; Dustmann et al. 2017). Here, the risk of the migration journey is negligible, and possible negative outcomes can be assumed not to be life-threatening. In other words, severe consequences of uncertain behaviour, and least of all the risk of dying, does not play a role in the utility maximisation function of said migrants. This picture changes dramatically for migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa to Europe, who face multiple threats to life during their journey. In 2017, fatalities in the Mediterranean Sea amounted to an estimated 20% of those who set off from The Gambia (Camara and Hunt 2018). Such high probabilities of dying impose the question whether general and/or domain-specific (i.e., regarding the journey itself) risk perceptions can still explain migration behaviour. We provide a simple yet powerful test by assessing migration intentions and risk preferences based on a self-reported general risk measure, lottery choices, and domain-specific risk assessments among 10'000 young Gambians. Subsequently, we follow respondents over 9 months to observe who engages in high-risk migration, and whether risk measures correlate with this decision.", "q16": "In exploratory analyses, we will test the assumption about the generalisability of risk preferences (e.g., Dohmen et al. 2011) and investigate to what extent the general risk measure (lottery and general risk perception) correlates with the domain-specific, self-reported risk of dying during the migration journey.

We investigate whether Chinese public opinion responds to information about crisis events and behavior in a manner that could influence the strategic calculus of the Chinese government. We employ survey experiments involving hypothetical scenarios as well as a novel real history design in which respondents are selectively reminded of real events. We investigate whether the public disapproves of inaction or backing down after a threat. We then investigate whether the public disapproves of inaction or backing down after other events, such as foreign provocations, after the mobilization of troops (but no threat), and after nationalist rhetoric is used. We also examine whether an authoritarian regime like China can utilize elite informational cues emphasizing the costs of war to attenuate disapproval for inaction when the national honor is at stake."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "HTA (Thin Audience Costs): Statements of commitment to stand firm (a) increase public resolve and (b) increase disapproval of backing down.

disapproval and the challenge posed to them by public protests. However, we don\u2019t have a good understanding of how publics in authoritarian states respond to information about events and their state\u2019s behavior in crises. We investigate whether Chinese public opinion responds to information about crisis events and behavior in a manner that could influence the strategic calculus of the Chinese government. We employ survey experiments involving hypothetical scenarios as well as a novel real history design in which respondents are selectively reminded of real events. We investigate whether the public disapproves of inaction or backing down after a threat. We then investigate whether the public disapproves of inaction or backing down after other events, such as foreign provocations, after the mobilization of troops (but no threat), and after nationalist rhetoric is used. We also examine whether an authoritarian regime like China can utilize elite informational cues emphasizing the costs of war to attenuate disapproval for inaction when the national honor is at stake.", "q16": "HTA (Thin Audience Costs): Statements of commitment to stand firm (a) increase public resolve and (b) increase disapproval of backing down. HTH (Thick Audience Costs): Actions that engage national honor\u2014such as the use of force, being the target of force, provocations and public insults, having a narrative of national grievance, and statements of commitment\u2014will (a) increase public resolve and (b) increase disapproval of backing down or inaction. HEm (Elite Cue - Policy preferences): Statements by government representatives that warn against war, such as by emphasizing the costs of war, will (a) decrease resolve and (b) increase public support for inaction or backing down. HEi (Elite Cue - Attenuated audience costs): Statements by government representatives that warn against war, such as by emphasizing the costs of war, will reduce the audience costs generated from
