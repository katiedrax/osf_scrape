Costa and McCrae's (1992) NEO-PI-R Facets of conscientiousness are self-efficacy, orderliness, dutifulness, achievement-striving, self-discipline, and cautiousness. Self-efficacy is defined as beliefs about one\u2019s own capacity to accomplish a task, and it often contributes to motivation (Bandura, 1997). Orderliness is described as being \u201cprepared.\u201d Tendencies related to orderliness include neatness and cleanliness (Roberts et al., 2014). High dutifulness is characterized by following rules in contrast to breaking them, and achievement-striving is described as working hard versus just doing enough to get by (P. T. Costa &amp; McCrae, 2008). Self-discipline is illustrated by someone who does their chores right away versus a person who wastes their time (P. T. Costa &amp; McCrae, 2008). The sixth trait of cautiousness is described as not rushing into things and avoiding mistakes (P. Costa, Costa, &amp; Mccrae, 2016). The facets of conscientiousness (self-efficacy, orderliness, dutifulness, achievement-striving, and self-discipline) will be assessed using Costa and McCrae's (1992) NEO-PI-R Facets scale taken from the International Personality Item Pool (n.d.). The scale consists of 60 statements (10 for each facet) measured on a five-point Likert scale with endpoints that range from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). \n\nFor the purpose of this research, religiosity and spirituality are almost synonymous since they are measured with the same scale. However, religiosity is defined as the more outward, institutional aspects of religion (e.g., religious practices, organized religious doctrines); however, spirituality is defined as the more inward, personal aspects of religion (e.g., subjective spiritual experiences, personal spiritual beliefs, etc.) (Schettino, 2012).

There are four main research questions in this study: \n\nRQ1: Does conscientiousness predict attitudes toward posthumous organ donation? \nRQ2: Does religiosity predict attitudes toward posthumous organ donation?\nRQ3: Do any of the six facets of conscientiousness (self-efficacy, orderliness, dutifulness, achievement-striving, self-discipline, and cautiousness) predict attitudes toward posthumous organ donation? \nRQ4: Are there differences between registered donors and non-registered donors in terms of attitude toward organ donation?", "q4": "RQ1 Correlational Hypothesis (Directional): \nHypothesis 1: There is a positive relationship between conscientiousness and attitudes toward posthumous organ donation. \n\nRQ2 Correlational Hypothesis (Directional): \nHypothesis 2: There is a positive relationship between religiosity and attitudes toward posthumous organ donation. \n\nRQ3 Correlational Hypotheses (Directional): \nHypothesis 3 (Correlational, Directional): There is a positive relationship between self-efficacy and attitudes toward posthumous organ donation. \nHypothesis 4 (Correlational, Directional): There is a positive relationship between orderliness and attitudes toward posthumous organ donation. \nHypothesis 5 (Correlational, Directional): There is a positive relationship between dutifulness and attitudes toward posthumous organ donation. \nHypothesis 6 (Correlational, Directional): There is a positive relationship between achievement-striving and attitudes toward posthumous organ donation. \nHypothesis 7 (Correlational, Directional): There is a positive relationship between self-discipline and attitudes toward posthumous organ donation. \nHypothesis 8 (Correlational, Directional): There is a positive relationship between cautiousness and attitudes toward posthumous organ donation. \n\nRQ4 Quasi-Experimental Hypothesis (Directional): Hypothesis 9: Registered donors will have more positive attitudes toward organ donation than non-registered potential donors. \n", "q5": "Other", "q6": ["No blinding is involved in this study."], "q7": "", "q9": "Participants will consist of undergraduate students from Olivet Nazarene University. \nAn email will be distributed that contains a brief description of the study as well as a link\nleading to the survey.

Costa and McCrae's (1992) NEO-PI-R Facets of conscientiousness are self-efficacy, orderliness, dutifulness, achievement-striving, self-discipline, and cautiousness. Self-efficacy is defined as beliefs about one\u2019s own capacity to accomplish a task, and it often contributes to motivation (Bandura, 1997). Orderliness is described as being \u201cprepared.\u201d Tendencies related to orderliness include neatness and cleanliness (Roberts et al., 2014). High dutifulness is characterized by following rules in contrast to breaking them, and achievement-striving is described as working hard versus just doing enough to get by (P. T. Costa &amp; McCrae, 2008). Self-discipline is illustrated by someone who does their chores right away versus a person who wastes their time (P. T. Costa &amp; McCrae, 2008). The sixth trait of cautiousness is described as not rushing into things and avoiding mistakes (P. Costa, Costa, &amp; Mccrae, 2016). The facets of conscientiousness (self-efficacy, orderliness, dutifulness, achievement-striving, and self-discipline) will be assessed using Costa and McCrae's (1992) NEO-PI-R Facets scale taken from the International Personality Item Pool (n.d.). The scale consists of 60 statements (10 for each facet) measured on a five-point Likert scale with endpoints that range from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). \n\nFor the purpose of this research, religiosity and spirituality are almost synonymous since they are measured with the same scale. However, religiosity is defined as the more outward, institutional aspects of religion (e.g., religious practices, organized religious doctrines); however, spirituality is defined as the more inward, personal aspects of religion (e.g., subjective spiritual experiences, personal spiritual beliefs, etc.) (Schettino, 2012). Religiosity will be assessed using the Spirituality/Religiousness scale taken from the International Personality Item Pool (n.d.). It will be measured on a five-point Likert scale with endpoints that range from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree).", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "Conscientiousness. The facets of conscientiousness (self-efficacy, orderliness, dutifulness, achievement-striving, and self-discipline) will be assessed using Costa and McCrae's (1992) NEO-PI-R Facets scale taken from the International Personality Item Pool (n.d.). The scale consists of 60 statements (10 for each facet) measured on a five-point Likert scale with endpoints that range from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). After reverse scoring of the indicated items, an overall score for each facet will be obtained, and the overall score for conscientious will be determined as well.   \n\nSpirituality/Religiousness. Religiosity will be assessed using the Spirituality/Religiousness scale taken from the International Personality Item Pool (n.d.). It will be measured on a five-point Likert scale with endpoints that range from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). After reverse scoring of the indicated items, an overall score for religiosity will be determined with higher scores indicating a higher level of religiosity. \n\nOrgan Donation Attitude Scale. Attitude toward donating organs will be measured using two methods. One method will utilize the Organ Donation Attitude Scale (ODAS). This test consists of 20 statements that will be scored on a four-point Likert scale ranging from strongly agreed (4 points), agreed (3 points), disagreed (2 points), or strongly disagreed (1 point). Items 2, 13, 14, and 16 will be reversed scored. Two questions do not directly pertain to organ donation and will not be scored. The scores range from 18-72, and higher scores reflect more positive views toward organ donation.  Two questions will be used to create binary groups for the ANOVA. Question 6 states, \"I am willing to have organs donated after my death,\" and Question \n7 states, \"I have signed an organ donor card or the back of my driver\u2019s license.\" Participants who answer agree or strongly agree will be grouped together while those who answer disagree or strongly disagree will be grouped in a separate group. \n\n", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Multiple regression analysis will be carried out to predict positive attitudes toward organ donation based on conscientiousness and religiosity which addresses the first three hypotheses.

After the variables have been standardized, it will be determined how much positive attitudes toward organ donation increase for each predictor. The greatest predictor of positive attitudes toward organ donation will be determined as well.  \n\nUsing an ANOVA, being a registered organ donor or not will be the independent variable since it is a nominal/categorical level.

However, the negative effect of emotion suppression may not be cross-culturally consistent. We hypothesize that emotion suppression may not be harmful in interdependent cultures in which people are encouraged to suppress their emotions to maintain harmonious relationships with others. The proposed research will thus examine whether culture moderates the relationship between daily use of emotion suppression and sleep, a critical component of health maintenance, in a two-weeks of daily diary study. We predict that emotion suppression will be associated with poor quality of sleep among European Americans, but this relationship will be attenuated or even disappear among East Asians. This prediction will be tested using data from a larger study. The larger study aims to address a different research question (on the moderating role of culture in the relationships between daily affective styles and health) and the data collection is currently underway.
