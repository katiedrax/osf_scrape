Prior work in the literature has demonstrated that children increasingly are sensitive to understanding the impartiality of some procedures as they age (Grocke, Rossano, &amp; Tomasello, 2015; Shaw and Olson, 2014). However, not all impartial procedures are always impartial, and they can often be used to justify policy that benefits the self (Descioli, Massenkoff, Shaw, Petersen, &amp; Kurzban, 2014). The current study examines children\u2019s sensitivity to when others use impartial procedures selectively to selfishly advantage the self. In a previous experiment, we show children a story of a distributor that uses two different decision-rules that research demonstrates children generally consider to be fair: equal distribution (LoBue, Nishida, Chiong, DeLoache, J. &amp; Haidt, 2011) and merit-based distribution (Baumard, Mascaro, &amp; Chevallier, 2012). In two conditions, the distributor either distributes selfishly (changing the decision-rule used when it advantages himself) or consistently (keeping the decision-rule constant even if it disadvantages himself). We measure children\u2019s fairness evaluations across two time points in the story to examine how fairness evaluations change after the distributor is shown to selectively choose impartial procedures. We find that children generally think both equal distribution and merit-based distribution are fair. However, children rate an inconsistent decision-rule change significantly less fair than a consistent decision-rule change. \n\nHowever, this study does not control for whether or not children merely like inconsistency in decision-rule itself instead of moral inconsistency specifically. Thus, in this next study, we examine whether or not children merely dislike inconsistency by telling participants a story very similar to our previous study. Instead, however, the distributor changes his decision rule across two different time points in both conditions. In this study, whether or not the distributor changes the decision-rule used (here, from merit to equality) remains constant across conditions. We vary between condition whether or not the distributor changes the decision rule used on Day 2 to selfishly advantage the self (Advantage Self condition) or instead advantage the other (Advantage Other condition). \n\nSpecifically, children are told a story about two characters in a classroom: Circle and Square. These characters have to help clean the classroom and distribute some resources across two days (two different time points). Across both days, children are told that Square is always the character who is deciding how the resources are distributed. \n\nIn both conditions, children see an identical Day 1: There are four markers in the classroom and Circle and Square have to help clean today. They see that Square does a good job helping to clean the classroom whereas Circle does a not so good job. They are then told that Square is going to decide how to share the resources. Square decides to use a merit rule on Day 1 (e.g., the person who did a better job gets more stickers) and children see a distribution in which Square takes three for himself (who did a better job) and gives one to Circle (who did a not so good job). After this first distribution, children are asked to evaluate how fair that was. We expect that, as there is no difference in what children see between conditions by this point, that children\u2019s fairness evaluations should be equivalent across conditions as they see the same stimuli. We include this fairness evaluation only to keep identical the structure of the previous study, as well as to help children stay engaged throughout the course of the story.  \n\nWhat we expect to differ across conditions is how fair children evaluate the distribution at Day 2. Children in both conditions are told that Square changes his mind on the second day and decides to use an equality rule to distribute the resources: i.e., he decides to split the markers evenly between himself and Circle no matter how well they each did at helping to clean. The only difference between the conditions is who did a better job: in the Advantage Self condition, Square does a worse job than Circle at helping to clean the classroom. In the Advantage Other condition, Square does a better job than Circle at helping to clean the classroom. Although Square is inconsistent with which decision-rule he uses in both conditions, we predict that children will evaluate the distribution in the Advantage Self condition as far more unfair than the Advantage Other condition. Specifically, Square will be seen as more unfair when he switches to an equality rule that benefits himself (giving equally rather than less to himself as would be consistent witht he \u201cmerit rule\u201d) than one in which he does not benefit himself (giving equally rather than giving more to himself that would be consistent with the \u201cmerit rule). \n\nThus, this study rules demonstrates that it is not inconsistency per se that children find objectionable, but instead inconsistency that is used to benefit the self. \n"}, "study_type": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment"}, "study_type_other": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"data": "No, no data have been collected for this study yet.", "name": "Moral inconsistency in children's selection of decision-rules - not merely \"inconsistency\" alone.

If the smaller, sooner option occurs now, this is known as delay discounting. If the smaller, sooner option occurs in the future, this is known as intertemporal discounting. The extent to which the later option is discounted varies largely between people, and research has shown mixed age effects.

Because of limited time horizons, older adults view the future as more uncertain, and this uncertainty may lead older adults to discount future rewards more than younger adults. Thus, for older adults, the greater the delay between now and an outcome, the greater their uncertainty about whether they will be alive and able to realize that outcome. This predicts that for longer time delays, older adults will discount more than younger adults. However, for shorter time delays older adults should not show a differences from younger adults.

option. In these situations, people tend to devalue, or discount, the later option. This devaluation is known as temporal discounting. If the smaller, sooner option occurs now, this is known as delay discounting. If the smaller, sooner option occurs in the future, this is known as intertemporal discounting. The extent to which the later option is discounted varies largely between people, and research has shown mixed age effects. Some studies have found that with age, people discount more steeply, others have found that with age people discount less steeply, and others have not found any evidence that age has an effect on temporal discounting at all.  We posit that one of the reasons for these heterogeneous results is that existing studies have used a mixture of time delays, ranging from days to years. One prominent theory of aging, socioemotional selectivity theory (SST), suggests that older adults become more present-oriented than younger adults because their future is more limited. Because of limited time horizons, older adults view the future as more uncertain, and this uncertainty may lead older adults to discount future rewards more than younger adults. Thus, for older adults, the greater the delay between now and an outcome, the greater their uncertainty about whether they will be alive and able to realize that outcome. This predicts that for longer time delays, older adults will discount more than younger adults. However, for shorter time delays older adults should not show a differences from younger adults.

The extent to which the later option is discounted varies largely between people, and research has shown mixed age effects.

Because of limited time horizons, older adults view the future as more uncertain, and this uncertainty may lead older adults to discount future rewards more than younger adults. Thus, for older adults, the greater the delay between now and an outcome, the greater their uncertainty about whether they will be alive and able to realize that outcome. This predicts that for longer time delays, older adults will discount more than younger adults. However, for shorter time delays older adults should not show a differences from younger adults.

These two continuous predictors (log(k) and delay in days) will be used in a linear model.\n\n\nH1: Main effect of number of days such that longer delays ( &gt; 365 days) having greater acceptance of the sooner option.\nH2: Age * number of days interaction such that age difference only appear for longer delays (&gt;365 days)\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=54k6n", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "parent": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ch3t6/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "ch3t6", "type": "registrations"}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ch3t6/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "ch3t6", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "54k6n", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/yqfzf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "yqfzf", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ca27w/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "ca27w", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/54k6n/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/54k6n/"}}], "links": {"first": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json", "last": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "prev": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=258", "next": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=260", "meta": {"total": 5469, "per_page": 10}}}
