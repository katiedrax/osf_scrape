The NFL\u2019s championship game, The Super Bowl, is the most watched television event in the United States every year. Yet in an increasingly sorted, partisan, and divided United States, (e.g., Hetherington and Weiler 2018) \u201c[p]ro football is unique in that its fandom stretches across partisan lines\u201d (Paine, Eten, and Jones-Rooy 2017). In recent years, the NFL has faced two major controversies. First, evidence has mounted that the sport causes major brain trauma in its players, specifically chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) (Aschwanden 2018). Second, players have protested police brutality and racism by kneeling during the national anthem. The movement was started by Colin Kaepernick who remains unsigned by any NFL franchise, likely as a result of his protest (ESPN News Service 2016). These issues have caused the NFL trouble in public relations and are highly politically salient. President Trump has inserted himself into these controversies, coming out strongly against not only the national anthem protest, but also against rules designed to protect players from brain injuries (Payne 2017). As partisanship and ideology are increasingly pertinent to economic and lifestyle decisions Americans make, understanding how these controversies are affected by partisanship and ideology is an important empirical and theoretical question. As one of the United States\u2019 few remaining bi-partisan cultural and media products the NFL offers unique insight into a divided country. RQ 1: How does ideology/partisanship affect engagement with the NFL? Expectations: Based on previous research we expect that liberals, moderates, and conservatives to report watching roughly the same amount of NFL (Paine, Eten, and Jones-Rooy 2017). RQ 2: How does ideology/partisanship affect exposure to different NFL controversies? Expectations: We expect left-leaning individuals to report watching more NFL when they are primed to think about the NFL\u2019s Players Coalition\u2019s efforts to provide funding for criminal justice reform, law enforcement/community relations, and education. However, we expect left-leaning individuals to say they watch less when they are primed to think about players suffering from CTE or Colin Kaepernick\u2019s situation and inability to get signed by a team. In the unlikely event that our survey captures sufficient numbers of pro-Trump liberals, we expect none of the treatments to have an effect. We expect reported NFL viewing among political moderates (with middle-ground feelings towards Trump) to be unaffected by all treatments except CTE. However, because of the way in which the President has inserted himself into the controversies, we expect that among pro-Trump moderates there will be a negative effect associated with the Player\u2019s Coalition, a positive effect associated with Colin Kaepernick\u2019s situation, and no effect from the CTE issue. We expect that among anti-Trump moderates there will be a positive effect associated with the Player\u2019s Coalition, a negative effect associated with Colin Kaepernick\u2019s situation, and a negative effect from the CTE issue. Finally, we expect reported NFL viewing among right-leaning individuals to be affected negatively by the player\u2019s coalition and positively by the Kaepernick situation. We expect them to be unaffected by the treatments related to CTE. However, we expect that among anti-Trump conservatives (should there be sufficient numbers in the survey) there will be a no effect associated with the Player\u2019s Coalition or Kaepernick\u2019s situation and a negative effect associated with the CTE issue. RQ 3: What effect do feelings toward Pres. Trump have on attitudes about the NFL? Because Pres. Trump has taken a keen interest in the goings-on of the NFL, particularly related to Kaepernick (e.g., see Graham 2017), it may be the case that feelings toward him, specifically, can affect how attitudes about the NFL over and above ideology or partisanship. As such, we propose the following hypotheses interacting treatment conditions with a feeling thermometer for Pres. Trump. We measure feelings toward President Trump two ways: using objective measures (35 or below is \u201cnegative,\u201d 36 \u2013 65 is \u201cneutral,\u201d 66 and above is \u201cpositive\u201d) and we use relative measures as a test as well (Trump minus 1SD+ is \u201crelatively negative,\u201d Trump mean is \u201crelatively neutral,\u201d and Trump plus 1SD+ is \u201crelatively positive)."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Table 1: Predicted relationship between treatment, political orientation and reported viewing Treatment Left Leaning Moderate Right Leaning Effects for Ideology Only Control No Effect No Effect No Effect Player\u2019s Coalition Positive No Effect Negative Kaepernick & Protest Negative No Effect Positive Brain Trauma Negative Negative Negative Effects for Interacting Ideology + Trump Feelings Control No Effect No Effect No Effect Player\u2019s Coalition No effect if pro-Trump Negative if pro-Trump, positive if anti-trump No effect if anti-Trump Kaepernick & Protest No effect if pro-Trump Positive if pro-Trump, negative if anti-trump No effect if anti-Trump Brain Trauma no effect if pro-Trump no effect if pro-Trump Negative if anti-Trump Table 2: Predicted relationship between treatment and Trump Feeling Therm.

Examples include the 2014 cyber-attack against Sony and presumably a substantial share of terrorist attacks, the vast majority of which go unclaimed. Plausibly deniable coercive acts are puzzling because Thomas Schelling suggests coercive success relies on the clarity of the underlying message: the target needs to understand that the threat is contingent on its behavior, what is being required, and the consequences of non-compliance. Not knowing the identity of the coercer may make the target unsure as to what is being demanded, what costs non-compliance will entail, and whether the perpetrator will stop if compliance is forthcoming, rendering coercive success less likely. Extant thinking suggests a straightforward, but unconvincing answer: plausible deniability offers the coercer the benefit of being shielded from retaliation by other audiences (third-party states, international organizations or domestic constituencies). Moreover, to the extent that third parties remain uncertain, the perpetrator could be shielded from retaliation by the target also, as the latter might be deterred from retaliating lest third parties interpret its actions as aggressive rather than retributive. The problem with this answer is that the benefit in question comes at the cost of coercive effectiveness, making plausible deniability self-defeating: Given the same information, rationalist arguments would lead us to expect both the target and third parties to reach the same conclusions about the identity of the perpetrator. Coercive success would imply that the target and third parties have correctly identified the perpetrator, nullifying the benefit of being shielded from retaliation.

The two programs take diametrically opposite approaches to disclosure. In Seattle, every voucher contribution is of public record; the contributor and the recipient are named. In South Dakota (whose program has since been repealed by statute) voucher contributions were to be confidential unless the contributor supplemented the publicly-funded voucher with money of her own. Under both statutes, disclosure seems to have been an afterthought, notwithstanding growing concern in some quarters that mandatory disclosure of privately funded campaign contributions may \u201cchill\u201d or \u201cdistort\u201d such political speech. Whatever may be the effects of disclosure on privately funded contributions, there is some basis for thinking that analogous disclosure requirements for publicly financed vouchers may have considerably larger effects on participation. The reason is that disclosure requirements on privately funded contributions affect only the very small \u2013 and relatively wealthy \u2013 population of Americans who give or would give (depending on the disclosure regime) their own money to candidates for elective office. Only about 1% of U.S. citizens give their own money to candidates. Voucher programs distribute publicly funded vouchers to all registered voters, a population that seems likely to include proportionately more socially and economically vulnerable individuals. Using a survey experiment, we provide an initial test of the effects of disclosure on voucher contributions. We compare three disclosure paradigms: full anonymity (a voucher regime modeled on the secret ballot), full disclosure (a voucher regime modeled on Seattle\u2019s program), and an intermediate, \u201csemi-disclosure\u201d regime in which geocoded voucher contribution histories for each voter are publicly disclosed, but without any personal identifying information."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Until now, two ideas have shaped legal-academic debates about the effect of disclosure on political speech (here, political contributions). The courts assume that disclosure may \u201cchill\u201d speech by those who do not want their political contributions to be made public. Mike Gilbert has written that disclosure can also attract or \u201cthaw\u201d speech from those who seek to \u201cgo on record\u201d as having donated, because disclosure regimes lower the cost to would-be contributors of credibly communicating their political preferences to the world. To date, these competing hypotheses have not been tested. Because \u201cchilling\u201d and \u201cthawing\u201d effects described in the theory section of the PAP may cancel out, we have no prior beliefs about the effect of disclosure (or semi-disclosure) on the proportion of the population who participates. However, we expect disclosure to change which members of the eligible-voucher-donor population elect to participate, chilling participation by people whose political preferences are not aligned with those of their social network or employer, and thawing participation by people whose preferences are closely aligned. Among people who would participate in all three regimes, we expect disclosure to increase insincere giving, with the effects concentrated among people who are most cross-pressured and economically vulnerable. However, this hypothesis presumes that there are few if any \u201craiding\u201d- type contributions in the no-disclosure condition, i.e., contributions to the least electable candidate of the opposing party.

The two programs take diametrically opposite approaches to disclosure. In Seattle, every voucher contribution is of public record; the contributor and the recipient are named. In South Dakota (whose program has since been repealed by statute) voucher contributions were to be confidential unless the contributor supplemented the publicly-funded voucher with money of her own. Under both statutes, disclosure seems to have been an afterthought, notwithstanding growing concern in some quarters that mandatory disclosure of privately funded campaign contributions may \u201cchill\u201d or \u201cdistort\u201d such political speech. Whatever may be the effects of disclosure on privately funded contributions, there is some basis for thinking that analogous disclosure requirements for publicly financed vouchers may have considerably larger effects on participation. The reason is that disclosure requirements on privately funded contributions affect only the very small \u2013 and relatively wealthy \u2013 population of Americans who give or would give (depending on the disclosure regime) their own money to candidates for elective office. Only about 1% of U.S. citizens give their own money to candidates. Voucher programs distribute publicly funded vouchers to all registered voters, a population that seems likely to include proportionately more socially and economically vulnerable individuals. Using a survey experiment, we provide an initial test of the effects of disclosure on voucher contributions. We compare three disclosure paradigms: full anonymity (a voucher regime modeled on the secret ballot), full disclosure (a voucher regime modeled on Seattle\u2019s program), and an intermediate, \u201csemi-disclosure\u201d regime in which geocoded voucher contribution histories for each voter are publicly disclosed, but without any personal identifying information.", "q16": "Until now, two ideas have shaped legal-academic debates about the effect of disclosure on political speech (here, political contributions). The courts assume that disclosure may \u201cchill\u201d speech by those who do not want their political contributions to be made public. Mike Gilbert has written that disclosure can also attract or \u201cthaw\u201d speech from those who seek to \u201cgo on record\u201d as having donated, because disclosure regimes lower the cost to would-be contributors of credibly communicating their political preferences to the world. To date, these competing hypotheses have not been tested. Because \u201cchilling\u201d and \u201cthawing\u201d effects described in the theory section of the PAP may cancel out, we have no prior beliefs about the effect of disclosure (or semi-disclosure) on the proportion of the population who participates. However, we expect disclosure to change which members of the eligible-voucher-donor population elect to participate, chilling participation by people whose political preferences are not aligned with those of their social network or employer, and thawing participation by people whose preferences are closely aligned. Among people who would participate in all three regimes, we expect disclosure to increase insincere giving, with the effects concentrated among people who are most cross-pressured and economically vulnerable. However, this hypothesis presumes that there are few if any \u201craiding\u201d- type contributions in the no-disclosure condition, i.e., contributions to the least electable candidate of the opposing party. If raiding does occur in the no-disclosure regime, then disclosure may increase sincere giving, as raiding may be socially disapproved and thus decreasing in the level of disclosure.", "q17": "The experiment is conducted in a two-wave panel.

In the second wave, we initially assign respondents to one of four treatment conditions: either the status quo (no vouchers); or a full-anonymity, semi-disclosure, or full-disclosure voucher regime in which the respondent may allocate $100 of public funds among the same candidates. We elicit the respondent\u2019s intended own-money and voucher (public money) contributions under that regime.

This goes against established theories of retrospective voting and electoral accountability. Our findings stem from two research designs and two datasets from Brazil. First, in a regression discontinuity design (RDD) exploiting data for the municipal elections of 2008, 2012 and 2016 across Brazil, we study the effect of municipalities meeting a highly visible school quality target (IDEB) on electoral outcomes. Second, in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a sample of municipalities in Pernambuco, we study the effect of informing voters before the election about their municipality\u2019s rank in the performance in an early student assessment (ANA) on individual vote choice.

The main goal of the survey is to explain this counter-intuitive finding. We have developed a number of hypotheses that could explain it: Trade-off hypotheses: \u2022 H2: Education quality vs public jobs trade-off. Voters punish good performers because they perceive a trade-off between the quality of schools and the number of people employed by the municipality (in education or other sectors) or, more generally, a trade-off between government performance and jobs. \u2022 H3: Education quality vs healthcare quality trade-off. Voters punish good performers because they perceive a trade-off between improving the quality of municipal schools and the quality of municipal clinics, which they value more. \u2022 H4: Education quality vs poverty alleviation trade-off. Voters punish good performers because they perceive a trade-off between the quality of municipal schools and the municipal government\u2019s efforts at reducing poverty, which they value more. \u2022 H5: Education quality vs government responsiveness trade-off. Voters punish good performers because they see politicians who improve school quality as less responsive to their needs. Mediated trade-off hypotheses: \u2022 H6: People who give less importance to education, relative to other policy areas, are more likely to punish the incumbent when informed about good school performance because they perceive such information as a signal of the incumbent not prioritizing their interests. \u2022 H7: Parents (H7a), parents of primary- and middle-school aged children (H7b), or parents of primary- and middle-school aged children enrolled in municipal schools (H7c) have a direct stake in education quality and thus respond positively to good school quality signals (i.e., in the opposite direction than hypothesized in H1-H5). We expect parents with a more direct stake in school quality to respond more positively to good school quality signals (i.e. our prior belief about the likelihood of these sub-hypotheses is higher for H7c than for H7b, and higher for H7b than for H7a)."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a short online survey with Brazilian respondents recruited via Facebook. The core of the survey is an information experiment, which will be preceded by some questions that help us collect pre-treatment covariates and simulate the conditions in which voters make decisions during electoral campaigns. Before the experiment we will expose respondents to a battery of questions about how important they think different policy areas are for their personal interests. In particular, respondents will be asked to rank improvements in education, healthcare, employment in the municipal sector, economic activity in general, security, and fight against poverty. This will allow us to (i) collect data about saliency of different policy areas for voters; and (ii) prime respondents to think about the importance of different policy areas, and thus simulate the conditions in which voters decide their vote during electoral campaigns. Immediately before the experiment, we will inform voters about IDEB (what it is and what it means for a municipality to meet its IDEB target), and ask them whether they had already heard about it. Rather than use a vignette experiment with information about a hypothetical mayor, we provide real-world information about the performance of the mayor (or former mayor) of the respondent's self-reported municipality. Respondents will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: control (where they are not given information about whether their municipality met its target) and treatment (where they are informed about whether their municipality met its school quality target, as per the data published in 2016). Those in the treatment group read the following question: \u201cIn the year 2016, at the end of the term of Mayor [Name], [Municipality] [did not achieve / achieved] its IDEB target. Have you heard about that result?\u201d The treatment information is accompanied by two images designed to reinforce the message: a photograph of the mayor (obtained from the official repository of the Supreme Electoral Court) and a red cross or a green checkmark, depending on the municipality's IDEB performance. Those assigned to the control group do not read any version of this question or a substitute. Next, all respondents, regardless of random assignment, read the following text: \"Thinking about [Mayor], do you agree or disagree with the following statements about [his/her] term as Mayor of [municipality] during the period 2012\u20132016?\" Response options are on a 4-point Likert scale (\"totally agree\", \"partially agree\", \"partially disagree\", \"totally disagree\"). To collect outcome data, we will ask about their agreement with the following statements, with the order of items randomized within respondents: \u2022 As mayor, he/she hired a lot of public servants. \u2022 As mayor, he/she improved municipal health clinics. \u2022 As mayor, he/she helped people like you solve problems. \u2022 As mayor, he/she reduced poverty in the municipality. \u2022 As mayor, he/she improved municipal schools. \u2022 As mayor, he/she invested a lot of money in education. After these main outcomes, we will ask respondents whether they would vote for that mayor if they were to run for another term, again with response options being in a 4-point Likert scale from \"great chance\" to \"no chance\"."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Brazil"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "3,000"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design", "Survey Methodology"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Development"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e38607cfa39b7017d1dc88c", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/w3hd5/providers/osfstorage/5e38607cfa39b7017d1dc88c", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/w3hd5/providers/osfstorage/5e38607cfa39b7017d1dc88c", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/w3hd5/providers/osfstorage/5e38607cfa39b7017d1dc88c?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/w3hd5/providers/osfstorage/5e38607cfa39b7017d1dc88c"}, "attributes": {"etag": "8c45c18c3739df7869d541f55283816dc1fb6bde70cf36a9bbda30f0ac5bf994", "kind": "file", "name": "20180914AA_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e38607cfa39b7017d1dc88c", "size": 105218, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "1b89eaf784a4c1e19ebb1a87f6a9dca5", "sha256": "d244b8bee4e3ec37a4a5a04d4d0b86b730fc3c946e40c446a503a6039da2d91a"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 105218, "modified": "2020-02-03T18:03:40.915588+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "w3hd5", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20180914AA_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T18:03:40+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "w3hd5", "sha256": "d244b8bee4e3ec37a4a5a04d4d0b86b730fc3c946e40c446a503a6039da2d91a", "viewUrl": "/project/nzq3s/files/osfstorage/5e386083fa39b7017d1dc8a0/", "selectedFileName": "20180914AA_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20180914AA_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "How do Brazilian voters trade school quality and other government outputs when evaluating municipal politicians?", "q2": "Taylor Boas | Guillermo Toral", "q3": "20180914AA", "q4": "09/14/2018 - 22:33", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to any research activities", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "9/15/18", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "In a working paper (\u201cEvaluating students and politicians: Test scores and electoral accountability in Brazil\u201d), we find that voters who receive information about the performance of municipal schools are less likely to vote for the incumbent when such signals are positive than when they are negative.

Second, in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a sample of municipalities in Pernambuco, we study the effect of informing voters before the election about their municipality\u2019s rank in the performance in an early student assessment (ANA) on individual vote choice. Contrary to expectations, we find in both the RDD and the RCT that signals about school quality decrease rather than increase electoral support for the incumbent. In the RDD, we find that municipalities that meet the IDEB target have a lower vote share for the mayor than those that miss their target. In the RCT, we find that voters are less likely to vote for the mayor the better the performance of the municipal schools.", "q16": "The main hypothesis stemming from the RCT and the RDD is that voters are less likely to vote for the incumbent when they receive positive signals about the quality of public schools (H1). The main goal of the survey is to explain this counter-intuitive finding. We have developed a number of hypotheses that could explain it: Trade-off hypotheses: \u2022 H2: Education quality vs public jobs trade-off. Voters punish good performers because they perceive a trade-off between the quality of schools and the number of people employed by the municipality (in education or other sectors) or, more generally, a trade-off between government performance and jobs. \u2022 H3: Education quality vs healthcare quality trade-off. Voters punish good performers because they perceive a trade-off between improving the quality of municipal schools and the quality of municipal clinics, which they value more. \u2022 H4: Education quality vs poverty alleviation trade-off. Voters punish good performers because they perceive a trade-off between the quality of municipal schools and the municipal government\u2019s efforts at reducing poverty, which they value more. \u2022 H5: Education quality vs government responsiveness trade-off. Voters punish good performers because they see politicians who improve school quality as less responsive to their needs. Mediated trade-off hypotheses: \u2022 H6: People who give less importance to education, relative to other policy areas, are more likely to punish the incumbent when informed about good school performance because they perceive such information as a signal of the incumbent not prioritizing their interests. \u2022 H7: Parents (H7a), parents of primary- and middle-school aged children (H7b), or parents of primary- and middle-school aged children enrolled in municipal schools (H7c) have a direct stake in education quality and thus respond positively to good school quality signals (i.e., in the opposite direction than hypothesized in H1-H5). We expect parents with a more direct stake in school quality to respond more positively to good school quality signals (i.e. our prior belief about the likelihood of these sub-hypotheses is higher for H7c than for H7b, and higher for H7b than for H7a).", "q17": "To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a short online survey with Brazilian respondents recruited via Facebook. The core of the survey is an information experiment, which will be preceded by some questions that help us collect pre-treatment covariates and simulate the conditions in which voters make decisions during electoral campaigns. Before the experiment we will expose respondents to a battery of questions about how important they think different policy areas are for their personal interests. In particular, respondents will be asked to rank improvements in education, healthcare, employment in the municipal sector, economic activity in general, security, and fight against poverty. This will allow us to (i) collect data about saliency of different policy areas for voters; and (ii) prime respondents to think about the importance of different policy areas, and thus simulate the conditions in which voters decide their vote during electoral campaigns. Immediately before the experiment, we will inform voters about IDEB (what it is and what it means for a municipality to meet its IDEB target), and ask them whether they had already heard about it. Rather than use a vignette experiment with information about a hypothetical mayor, we provide real-world information about the performance of the mayor (or former mayor) of the respondent's self-reported municipality. Respondents will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: control (where they are not given information about whether their municipality met its target) and treatment (where they are informed about whether their municipality met its school quality target, as per the data published in 2016). Those in the treatment group read the following question: \u201cIn the year 2016, at the end of the term of Mayor [Name], [Municipality] [did not achieve / achieved] its IDEB target. Have you heard about that result?\u201d The treatment information is accompanied by two images designed to reinforce the message: a photograph of the mayor (obtained from the official repository of the Supreme Electoral Court) and a red cross or a green checkmark, depending on the municipality's IDEB performance. Those assigned to the control group do not read any version of this question or a substitute. Next, all respondents, regardless of random assignment, read the following text: \"Thinking about [Mayor], do you agree or disagree with the following statements about [his/her] term as Mayor of [municipality] during the period 2012\u20132016?\" Response options are on a 4-point Likert scale (\"totally agree\", \"partially agree\", \"partially disagree\", \"totally disagree\"). To collect outcome data, we will ask about their agreement with the following statements, with the order of items randomized within respondents: \u2022 As mayor, he/she hired a lot of public servants. \u2022 As mayor, he/she improved municipal health clinics. \u2022 As mayor, he/she helped people like you solve problems. \u2022 As mayor, he/she reduced poverty in the municipality. \u2022 As mayor, he/she improved municipal schools. \u2022 As mayor, he/she invested a lot of money in education. After these main outcomes, we will ask respondents whether they would vote for that mayor if they were to run for another term, again with response options being in a 4-point Likert scale from \"great chance\" to \"no chance\".", "q18": "Brazil", "q19": "3,000", "q20": "Yes", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "", "q25": "", "q26": "Researchers", "q27": "", "q28": "No", "q29": "", "q30":
