We will also examine touch preferences in different UK cohorts, (for example among opposite and same-sex couples) and across different countries. The data will be drawn from a large survey that we are currently conducting in collaboration with the BBC and Wellcome Collection focusing more generally on touch (to be completed on 30th March 2020). There are a variety of measures in the survey, but for this project we will extract relevant variables in order to explore individual differences in preferences for touch on different parts of the body. Below we summarise our subprojects related to this global aim, which may appear as separate publications.\n\n\nSubproject 1: What individual trait differences influence the likability of touch?\n\nPrevious research has demonstrated that personality traits agreeableness and openness to experience are associated with differences in touch attitudes/experiences (e.g. Dorros et al. 2008). Agreeableness is predicted to be associated with greater liking of touch in from a partner, across all areas of the body. Openness to experience is predicted to be associated with greater liking of touch from a partner, specifically in non-intimate areas. We will extend previous work by also examining liking of touch from a stranger. Due to the novelty of this question, we do not make specific predictions for the stranger condition.\n\nAnxious attachment in relationships has previously been linked to increased effectiveness of touch in reducing pain; while avoidant attachment is associated with reduced effectiveness (Krah\u00e9 et al., 2018). Greater attachment anxiety is predicted to be associated with greater liking of touch, specifically to intimate areas of the body, in the partner or close friend condition. Greater attachment avoidance is predicted to be associated with reduced liking of touch in all conditions.\n\n\nSubproject 2: How does body representation/perception influence the liking of touch?\n\nBased on previous work identifying an association between body image and comfort with physical touch (Orbach &amp; Mikulincer, 1998), greater body acceptance is predicted to be associated with greater liking of touch in all conditions\n\nPrior work has shown that interoceptive awareness is associated with differences in the perceived pleasantness of touch (Crucianelli et al., 2018) and others have argued it is integral to emotional experience (e.g. Craig, 2003). Based on these suggestions, we predict that greater interoceptive awareness will be associated with greater liking of touch, across all conditions.\n\nTactile sensitivity refers to responsiveness to tactile stimulation. Tactile hypersensitivity could be expected to either make touch experiences more pleasant, or more unpleasant. We therefore predict to see differences in touch preference related to tactile sensitivity, but do not make a directional hypothesis.\n\n\nSubproject 3: How does the likability of touch differ for same-sex and opposite-sex couples?\n\nPrior work has reported that same-sex couples are less likely to display affection publicly (Kent &amp; El-Alayli, 2011). We therefore predict to see differences between heterosexual and same-sex couples in the liking of touch from a partner (in a public place). We predict that these differences will be focused on parts of the body typically engaged in intimate touch.\n\n\nSubproject 4: What has been the impact of Covid-19 on likability of touch?\n\nThe data for this project has been collected during a period of escalating concern over Covid-19, which is likely to have changed participants\u2019 comfort with social touch. We will control for this factor in all other subprojects by including a measure linked to the date of survey completion as an additional predictor variable. In addition, we propose to examine how touch preferences vary as a function of time point by comparing responses that may coincide with key developments in Covid-19 (including but not limited to, the first ten confirmed cases; the first reported death; instigation of more restrictive social distancing measures). For example, in England, before 24/02/20 (Time 1) versus after 24/02/20 (Time 2) based on first ten cases reported by Public Health England. Here, we predict that the likability of touch from a stranger will be reduced from Time 1 to Time 2. We also expect to see differences in preference for partner touch from Time 1 to Time 2, however the effects are less clear in this case, and so we do not make directional hypotheses related to partner touch.\n\nAdditional considerations:\n\nPrevious research has shown an association between emotional bond and the perceived acceptability of touch (Suvilehto et al., 2019). Based on this finding, a stronger emotional bond with the toucher is predicted to be associated with greater liking of touch. Emotional bond will be included as a control factor in all subprojects.\n\nThe hypotheses above are made for a UK sample. However, prior research has identified geographical differences in social touch behaviour. We predict that touch preferences will also differ between groups of participants based in different countries. Our survey is available worldwide, and based on prior surveys of this type that have been conducted by the BBC and Wellcome Collection, we envisage suitable sample sizes are likely in additional European and North American countries. However, as an opportunity sampling method is being used, we will not know the location of all participants until the study closes. As such, while we expect to see variation in the factors predicting touch attitudes across different countries, we refrain from making specific directional hypotheses at this time.\n\nAdditional groups of interest in relation to individual differences in touch attitudes include participants with autism spectrum conditions, and visual or mobility impairments. Any analyses in these groups will likely form separate papers, depending upon the sample of size of participants recruited who report these conditions. Further details on these analyses will be registered as additional sub-projects once sample sizes have been ascertained after the data collection is completed and accessed."}, "study_type": {"extra": [], "value": "Survey"}, "study_type_other": {"extra": [], "value": "Additional Information related to Q1: The data will be drawn from a large survey that we are currently conducting in collaboration with the BBC and Wellcome Collection (to be completed on 30th March 2020).

Given our large sample size, we plan to access study responses linked to social and non-social wellbeing and examine responses at different time points in order to examine changes in social and non-social wellbeing over this unusual period of time.  We propose a number of projects that will investigate the following questions (which will be treated as separate sub-projects as indicated; note, we intend that sub-projects will be published separately): \n\n1) Sub-Project 1: How have loneliness and wellbeing changed over time as the coronavirus pandemic has spread? We expect increases in loneliness and decreases in wellbeing to have been observed. We will also explore differences in loneliness and wellbeing according to age and gender.\n\n2) Sub-Project 2: How do differences in attitudes towards social touch interact with differences in loneliness and wellbeing associated with the coronavirus pandemic? We predict that participants who have high social touch attitudes will show differences in their loneliness and wellbeing changes associated with the coronavirus pandemic compared with participants who have low social touch attitudes. We will also explore differences in loneliness and wellbeing according to age and gender in this context.\n\n3) Sub-Project 3: How do differences in attachment style interact with differences in loneliness and wellbeing associated with the coronavirus pandemic? Given that attachment style has been linked with differences in wellbeing and that social isolation/distancing may influence these attachment styles differently, we predict that participants who score high in anxious attachment will show differences in their loneliness and wellbeing changes associated with the coronavirus pandemic compared with participants who score low in anxious attachment. We will also explore differences in loneliness and wellbeing according to age and gender in this context.

There are a variety of measures in the survey, but for this project we will extract data specific to social and non-social wellbeing in order to assess how these factors have changed during the coronavirus pandemic. As yet we have not accessed the full dataset and will not do so until the survey closes (closure date is 30.03.20; earliest full data access will be 31.03.20)."}, "subjects": [[{"id":

COVID-19 variables: COVID-19 exposure (whether participant or someone they know has been diagnosed with, quarantined because of, or died from COVID-19) and COVID-19 fears (as measured by 4 modified items from the Ebola Fear Inventory [Blakey et al., 2015])", "q15.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Hypothesis 1 (directional): Perceived PTG (retrospective self-report on the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory\u2013Short Form [PTGI-SF]) will be weakly positively related to actual (prospective) increases in (1a) positive traits and (1b) religiousness/spirituality.\n1. We will test this hypothesis using correlational or regression analyses.\n\nHypothesis 2 (directional): Actual improvement in mental health will be weakly to moderately positively related to actual (prospective) increases in (2a) positive traits and (2b) religiousness/spirituality.\n2. We will test this hypothesis using correlational or regression analyses.\n\nHypothesis 3 (directional): Perceived PTG will be (3a) weakly positively related to concurrently measured mental health but will be (3b) unrelated to prospectively measured change in mental health.\n3. We will test this hypothesis using correlational or regression analyses.\n\nHypothesis 4 (directional): Actual increases in positive traits will be weakly to moderately positively related to actual increases in religiousness/spirituality.\n4. We will test this hypothesis using correlational or regression analyses.\n\nHypothesis 5 (directional): The average trajectory of perceived PTG will indicate an increase in perceived PTG (5a), whereas there will be an average trajectory of decline in participants\u2019 actual (prospectively measured) change in positive traits (5b), religiousness/spirituality (5c), and mental health (5d).\n5. We will test this hypothesis using growth mixture modeling analyses.\n\nHypothesis 6 (directional): The following will be significant predictors of postdisaster psychological resilience (e.g., minimal depression and anxiety symptoms [scores of 4 or lower on the Patient Health Questionnaire\u20139 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder\u20137 (GAD-7)]): (6a) older age, (6b) male sex/gender, (6c) lower socioeconomic status, (6d) lower predisaster trauma exposure, (6e) lower predisaster personal suffering, (6f) higher predisaster positive traits, (6g) higher predisaster religiousness/spirituality, (6h) higher predisaster mental health, (6i) lower disaster-related resource loss, (6j) lower postdisaster perceived stress, and (6k) higher postdisaster social support.\n6.
