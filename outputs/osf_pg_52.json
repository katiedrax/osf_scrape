The impact of this model goes beyond the needs of this crisis and can be applied to any emergency situation where services are at risk of interruption."}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecac48", "text": "Social and Behavioral Sciences"}, {"id": "584240da54be81056cecac68", "text": "Psychology"}]]}, "relationships": {"license": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965", "type": "licenses"}}, "children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=vdmxu", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "vdmxu", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "vdmxu", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/spq8a/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "spq8a", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k97sa/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "k97sa", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/vdmxu/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vdmxu/"}}, {"id": "m97zg", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Longitudinal association between maternal autonomy support and adolescents\u2019 depressive symptoms.", "description": "This two-wave longitudinal study is part of a project exploring the key determinants of adolescents\u2019 psychological well-being.

Given the role of confirmation bias in exacerbating conflict and ideological extremism, the development of cognitive debiasing techniques seems worthwhile. However, the efficacy of social science\u2019s existing arsenal of debiasing techniques remains largely unknown, and the extant positive findings have often been inconsistent and in need of independent replication. In this proposed registered report, we aim to empirically test the efficacy of three cognitive debiasing techniques in mitigating confirmation bias: consider-the-opposite, psychoeducation, and a novel social norms manipulation. Being able to compare these strategies will have the benefit of providing theoretical advancement by shedding light on the processes that give rise to confirmation bias. Moreover, these results will help in identifying the most promising techniques to serve as the foundation for debiasing interventions.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-11T19:58:45.760717", "date_modified": "2020-03-31T19:04:06.333301", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["confirmation bias", "social psychology"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["N/"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "03d2e0c7de24e43c648aa7e98570ec6578f2f4742ed612a29fb9b412bafccddf7a5a1354eabba5e875b79f4beb804610d4b51db1209c1cebeec232503f609810ec3af73f34d14d6f320a807aee817b1a5f75c671cb3d4b38311ae5b549c992de83540cd349653ea00d7416f36860f99f81fd629a97666c66456b5c7b1a0865b3f0bfcd1edf7ff0f36e16167205910fa9", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-11T19:58:45.745161", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Pre-Registration in Social Psychology (van 't Veer & Giner-Sorolla, 2016): Pre-Registration", "registered_meta": {"looked": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "datacompletion": {"extra": [], "value": "No, data collection has not begun"}, "additionalComments": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "dataCollectionDates": {"extra": [], "value": "08/2020-08/2021"}, "description-methods": {"value": {"design": {"value": {"question2a": {"extra": [], "value": "1.\tDebiasing Condition: (consider-the-opposite vs. social norms vs. psychoeducation vs. control)\n\nParticipants assigned to the consider-the-opposite debiasing technique will be asked to generate two reasons why a person may have an attitude that conflicts with their own (Hoch, 1985).

data suggests that social media platforms such as Twitter are strategically used by supporters of extremist ideologies to promote hate speech and facilitate radicalization processes, but underlying psychological mechanisms remain unclear. What is more, the impact of hate speech messages on Twitter users has to the best of my knowledge not yet been examined. The present project aims to provide a more nuanced picture of the content and impact of tweets with hate speech content on their readers by detecting systematic patterns. \n\nThe project examines the following research questions:  \n1.\tDoes hate speech on German twitter contain messages paint immigrants and Muslims as a symbolic, realistic or safety threat?\n2.\tHow do these threat messages differ with regards to their content and wording?\n3.\tDoes the prevalence of threat messages in hate speech predict readers\u2019 reactions in form of likes?\n\nThe study will use two data subsets from the POLLY dataset which together contain over 40.000 German tweets collected in 2017 and wereas made publicly available for academic purposes by the researchers Jaki &amp; De Smedt and has been anonymized in line with the EU\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation. \n\nDrawing on the concepts of Integrated Threat Theory, I expect content on German twitter, which is classified as hate speech, to contain significantly more threat perceptions than tweets which are not classified as hate speech. I also expect that the impact of these messages is reflected in form of an increased number of likes in comparison with tweet messages that are not classified as hate speech.", "category": "project",

Participants were asked to choose a frequency on specific Facebook-related behaviors (e.g., \u201cApproximately how often do you check your Facebook?\u201d) on 6 frequency choices ( \u201cless than once a week\u201d, \u201conce a week\u201d, \u201cless than 7 times a week\u201d, \u201conce a day\u201d,  \u201c2-4 times a day\u201d, \"more than 5 times a day\"). The 4-item daily frequency of Facebook usage scale assessed individuals\u2019 daily frequency of using Facebook. Participants were asked to choose a frequency on how much they had spent engaging in  Facebook-related behaviors in the past day (e.g., \u201cIn the past day, approximately how much time have you spent on Facebook?\u201d) on 6 frequencies choices (\u201cless than 30 minutes\u201d, \u201c31-60 minutes\u201d, \u201c1-2 hours\u201d, \u201c2-3 hours\u201d,  \u201c3-6 hours\u201d, \"more than 6 hours\").\n\nPornography use: The seven-item frequency subscale of the Pornography Use Scale (Szymanski &amp; Stewart-Richardson, 2014) was used to assess frequency of pornography use. Sample items include \u201cTaken together, how many hours per week do you view 260 MIKORSKI AND SZYMANSKI sexually explicit/pornographic material (such as magazines, movies, and/or Internet site)?\u201d and \u201cWhen using/viewing sexually explicit/pornographic materials (including online, magazines, DVD/videos/movies) in one sitting, I spend approximately X amount of time doing such,\u201d Response options vary (e.g., none,once a month or less, 2 or 3 days a month, 1 or 2 days a week, 3 to 5 days a week, every day or almost every day).\n\nAppearance Comparison: Physical Appearance Comparison Scale-Revised (Schaefer &amp; Thompson, 2014). This 11-item measure assesses individuals\u2019 tendency to compare their appearance with others. Participants were asked to indicate the frequency of certain thoughts and behaviors (e.g., \"When I\u2019m out in public, I compare my physical appearance to the appearance of others.\") on a 5-point scale (0-never to 4-always).\n\nSelf-objectification: Objectified Body Consciousness Scale (McKinley &amp; Hyde, 1996). Participants were asked to indicate their agreement to items (e.g., \u201cI would be ashamed for people to know what I really weigh\u201d) on a 7-point scale (1 - strongly disagree to 7 - strongly agree).\n\nBody-esteem: Body Esteem Scale (Mendelson, Mendelson &amp; White, 2001). Participants were asked to indicate the frequency of certain thoughts and beliefs of their body (e.g., \"Other people consider me good-looking.\") on a 5 point scale(0-never to 4-always).\n\nEvery variable will be calculated into a weighted score with the factor loadings."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q16": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q17": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "We will use an SEM model to analyze our data.
