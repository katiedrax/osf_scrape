United States and the Netherlands"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Lisanne Wichgers, Laura\tJacobs, Joost van spanje"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Background. \n\nThroughout the past decades, several anti-immigration politicians in Europe have faced legal prosecution for inciting hatred. Examples are the Dutch Geert Wilders (Freedom Party (PVV)) and the Belgian Daniel F\u00e9ret (D\u00e9mocratie Nationale). The intended outcomes of hate speech prosecution include protecting the rights of (ethnic, racial and religious) minorities and immigrants, thereby warning political actors seeking to violate this democratic principle. However, recent studies have emphasized that hate speech prosecution may also have unintended consequences, such as boosting party\u2019s electoral performance and decreasing citizens\u2019 democratic support (authors, 2020; Van Spanje and De Vreese, 2014; 2015). The decision to (not) prosecute a politician for hate speech has been found to decrease democratic support for some, but not for other citizens depending on citizens\u2019 attitude regarding immigration. Prior findings suggest that it is the political idea spread by the alleged hate speech that is relevant, not the party or the politician: while confrontation with the prosecution of an anti-immigration politician seems to decrease democratic support among citizens with strong anti-immigration attitudes, it seems to increase democratic support among citizens that are pro-immigration. The opposite was observed for the decision not to prosecute the politician for hate speech: citizens with pro-immigration attitudes lost democratic support, whereas democratic support increased among citizens with strong anti-immigration attitudes.\n\nHowever, previous research has only been conducted in the Dutch context. The Netherlands has a multi-party system, with numerous political parties. Moreover, issues regarding immigration and integration have been highly salient in the past, and still are. Political ideas \u2013 in particular when they concern salient issues \u2013 are therefore generally perceived as more important than identification with a party or a politician, as was also evident from prior research about the effects of hate speech prosecution (authors, 2020; Van Spanje and De Vreese, 2014; 2015). Furthermore, many Dutch citizens believe that free speech should be restricted when being hurtful to groups of people (authors, 2020). To test if the previous findings hold, i.e., whether the political idea is indeed the main driver behind the effects, we need to test our hypotheses in a context that is different with regard to important extraneous variables. This means studying a country with a two-party system, where partisan identities are arguably stronger, and, subsequently, agreement with the political is generally deemed less important. Furthermore, as curbing discrimination is, by Dutch law, protected more than free speech, we need a country where the reverse is true.\n\nA cross-cultural study between the Netherlands and the United States provides a great opportunity to test the mechanisms underlying previous findings, as 1) due to the two-party system and high levels of affective polarization, partisan identification is arguably stronger in the US than in the Netherlands, and 2) free speech is a core American value and protected much more in the US than in the Netherlands. Hence, the US functions as a \u2018least likely case\u2019. By studying the effects of the decision to (not) prosecute a politician for hate speech in two very different environments, we advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms.\n\nPurpose of study. \n\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the mechanisms underlying the relationship between hate speech prosecution and democratic support in more detail. By examining the effects of hate speech prosecution on democratic support in two profoundly different contexts, we aim to discern what is exactly driving the effects: to what extent do agreement with the political ideas spread by the politician, identification with the prosecuted politician\u2019s party and adherence to free speech explain how citizens respond to the decision to (not) prosecute a politician for hate speech? \n\nBroad research questions. \n\nWhat are the effects of the decision to (not) prosecute a politician for hate speech on democratic support, and what is the moderating role of agreement with the politician\u2019s political ideas, party identification and adherence to free speech? The next paragraph will elaborate on our expectations regarding the similarities and differences between the two contexts.

To account for the multidimensionality of democratic support, we operationalize democratic support using four dimensions. These dimensions are largely based on four of the dimensions outlined by Norris (2011), and range from more diffuse (abstract) forms of democratic support to more specific (concrete) forms of democratic support.\n\nThe most diffuse form of democratic support in this study is \u201csystem affect\u201d, which involves a citizen\u2019s belief that the democratic system defends the basic democratic norms and values a person believes in (Muller and Williams, 1980). This is largely in line with Norris\u2019 \u201capproval of core regime principles and values\u201d. This is measured by the Political Support-Alienation Scale (Muller, Jukam and Seligson, 1982). This scale consists of the following three (originally eight) items (7-point Likert scale from 1 (\u2018completely disagree\u2019) to 7 (\u2018completely agree\u2019)): \u201cTo what extent do you feel that the fundamental rights of citizens are well protected by our democratic constitutional state?\u201d; \u201cTo what extent are you proud to live under our democratic constitutional state?\u201d; \u201cTo what extent do you feel that you and your close ones are well represented by our democratic constitutional state?\u201d.\n\nThe second dimension is \u201cevaluations of democratic performance\u201d, and represents the meso level of democratic support \u2013 the dimension that seems most difficult to measure (Norris, 2011). Evaluations of democratic performance are measured via three items (7-point scale from \u2018fully disagree\u2019 to \u2018fully agree\u2019): \u201cIn a democracy, the economic system functions badly\u201d; \u201cDemocracies are indecisive and there is too much quibbling\u201d; \u201cDemocracies are not good in maintaining order\u201d. The answers will be recoded to a higher value indicating more democratic support. These items replace the more common \u2018satisfaction with democracy\u2019-item, measuring how citizens evaluate the functioning of democratic states without necessarily having to disregard general democratic principles (Linde and Ekman, 2003; Norris, 2011).\n\nThe final two dimensions are \u201cconfidence in state institutions\u201d (11-point scale) and \u201ctrust in politicians\u201d (similar to Norris\u2019 \u201capproval of incumbent office-holders\u201d measure) (7-point scale). These two dimensions represent the most specific forms of democratic support. Confidence in state institutions is measured by the following question: \u201cPlease describe on a scale from 0 (\u2018no trust at all\u2019) to 10 (\u2018very strong trust\u2019) how much you personally trust each of the institutions\u201d, followed by the following political institutions: parliament (/congress), the Public Prosecutor (/federal prosecutors) and the government (the first two originating from the European Social Survey (ESS)). Trust in politicians is measured by the following three items (7-point Likert scale from 1 (\u2018completely disagree\u2019) to 7 (\u2018completely agree\u2019)): \u201cMost politicians give up their ideals or break their promises to gain more power\u201d; \u201cMost politicians talk much but do little to solve the real important problems in this country\u201d; \u201cMost politicians are in politics for personal gain\u201d.

The answers will be recoded afterwards to higher values indicating more trust in politicians.\n\nWe will perform a principal component analysis with principal axis factoring (using Oblimin rotation) to test if the aforementioned items form the four dimensions as intended.\n\nImmigrant attitudes.\n\nAttitudes to immigrants will be included as a moderator variable. We ask participants to evaluate four statements about immigrants and immigration, measured on a 11-point scale: \u201cIs the Netherlands (/United States) made a worse or a better place to live by people coming to live here from other countries?\u201d (0 (\u2018worse\u2019), 10 (\u2018better\u2019)), \u201cWould you say it is generally bad or good for the Dutch (/American) economy that people from different countries come to live here?\u201d (0 (\u2018bad\u2019), 10 (\u2018good\u2019)), \u201cWould you say that cultural life in the Netherlands (/United States) is generally undermined or enriched by people coming to live here from other countries?\u201d (0 (\u2018undermined\u2019), 10 (\u2018enriched\u2019)) and \u201cAre crime problems in the Netherlands (/United States) made worse or better by people coming to live here from other countries?\u201d (0 (\u2018worse\u2019), 10 (\u2018better\u2019)). These items originate from the European Social Survey (ESS). The former three items form a validated scale, but we will perform a principal component analysis to test whether the factor loading of the last item is sufficiently high. \n\nIn addition to the aforementioned scale, we include several other operationalizations of attitudes toward outgroups and generalized prejudice in the survey. These will be used as robustness checks, as we expect that the various measurements are positively correlated and should therefore yield similar results.  \n\nWe include a feeling thermometer to measure participants\u2019 feelings toward various groups in society (ranging on a scale from 0 (\u2018very negative\u2019) to 100 (\u2018very positive\u2019)). The American participants were asked about their feelings toward Muslims, Jews, Christians, Democrats, Republicans and LGBT. The Dutch participants were asked about their feelings toward Muslims, Jews, Christians, Right-wing conservatives, Left-wing progressives, LHBT and the Dutch. The primary aim of this variable is measuring to what extent attitudes toward immigrants align with feelings toward various outgroups, in particular Muslims, as the news story refers to messages about Muslims.\n\nWe measure attitudes toward multiculturalism, by the following item: \u201cSome people think that persons with a migration background in the Netherlands (/United States) should be able to live while preserving all habits and traditions of their own culture. Others think they should fully adapt to the Dutch (/American) culture. What do you think?\u201d (measured on a scale from 0 (\u2018Preserve culture of persons with migration background\u2019) to 10 (\u2018Adapt to Dutch (/American) culture\u2019)). \n\nParty identification.\n\nParty identification will be included as a moderator variable. Party identification is measured by party support, vote choice, affective and cognitive components of party identification and ideological distance of the political party. We include multiple operationalizations of party identification as robustness checks.\n\nWe measure party support by the following question: \u201cSome people perceive themselves as a supporter of a specific political party, others do not perceive themselves as a supporter of a party. Do you perceive yourself as a supporter of a party, or not?\u201d. If participants report to support a party, a follow-up question asks which party the participant perceives him/herself to be a supporter of. Subsequently, we ask how strong the participant perceives him/herself to be a supporter of this party (on a scale from 1 (\u2018supporter, but not very strong\u2019) to 7 (\u2018very strong supporter\u2019)).\n\nWe measure vote choice by the question \u201cDid you vote during the last national election (2017) (/presidential election (2016))?\u201d. If participants report having voted, a question follows asking for which party (/candidate) the participant voted. \n\nThe party identification scale specifically refers to FvD (/Republican party), but the same questions are also repeated for another political party (D66 (center party)) (/Democrat party) (order of parties randomized). The scale is an adapted version of Mael and Tetrick\u2019s (1992) \u2018Identification with a Psychological Group\u2019 (IDPG) scale, established in social psychology and proven to be applicable to political parties (Brewer and Silver, 2000; Ohr and Quandt, 2012). The scale includes four items on a 7-point Likert scale (from 1 (\u2018completely disagree\u2019) to 7 (\u2018completely agree\u2019)): \u201cIf someone criticizes the Forum for Democracy (/Republican party), this feels as a personal assault\u201d; \u201cIf I talk about the Forum for Democracy (/Republican party), I say \u201cwe\u201d instead of \u201cI\u201d\u201d; \u201cThe successes of the Forum for Democracy (/Republican party) are my successes\u201d; \u201cIf someone praises the Forum for Democracy (/Republican party), this feels as a personal compliment\u201d. Higher scores thus correspond to stronger identification with the party of the prosecuted politician.\n\nFurthermore, we include a measure of left-right (/liberal-conservative) placement of various political parties, and a measure of self-placement on the left-right (/liberal-conservative) political spectrum. By combining these, we can use this as a measurement of ideological distance of the FvD/Republican party.\n\nFree speech versus protecting minorities.\n\nWe include an item that explicitly measures to what extent participants prioritize protecting free speech over protecting minorities from discrimination: \u201cTo what extent do you think it is more important that people are able to say everything publicly, or that minorities have to be protected from discrimination?\u201d Answers are coded on a 7-point Likert-scale, from 1 (\u2018protecting free speech\u2019) to 7 (\u2018protecting minorities from discrimination\u2019)."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "For the following variables, we will take the mean of the items described in the previous paragraph to create a single mean per variable.\n\n-\tDemocratic support: System affect (3 items); Evaluations of democratic performance (3 items); Confidence in state institutions (3 items); Trust in politicians (3 items)\n-\tImmigrant attitudes: Attitudes to immigrants (4 items)\n-\tParty identification: Affective/cognitive identification (4 items).\n\nPrior to creating scales, we will calculate the reliability of the items.

Examples are the Dutch Geert Wilders (Freedom Party (PVV)) and the Belgian Daniel F\u00e9ret (D\u00e9mocratie Nationale). The intended outcomes of hate speech prosecution include protecting the rights of (ethnic, racial and religious) minorities and immigrants, thereby warning political actors seeking to violate this democratic principle. However, recent studies have emphasized that hate speech prosecution may also have unintended consequences, such as boosting party\u2019s electoral performance and decreasing citizens\u2019 democratic support (authors, 2020; Van Spanje and De Vreese, 2014; 2015). The decision to (not) prosecute a politician for hate speech has been found to decrease democratic support for some, but not for other citizens depending on citizens\u2019 attitude regarding immigration. Prior findings suggest that it is the political idea spread by the alleged hate speech that is relevant, not the party or the politician: while confrontation with the prosecution of an anti-immigration politician seems to decrease democratic support among citizens with strong anti-immigration attitudes, it seems to increase democratic support among citizens that are pro-immigration. The opposite was observed for the decision not to prosecute the politician for hate speech: citizens with pro-immigration attitudes lost democratic support, whereas democratic support increased among citizens with strong anti-immigration attitudes.\n\nHowever, previous research has only been conducted in the Dutch context. The Netherlands has a multi-party system, with numerous political parties. Moreover, issues regarding immigration and integration have been highly salient in the past, and still are. Political ideas \u2013 in particular when they concern salient issues \u2013 are therefore generally perceived as more important than identification with a party or a politician, as was also evident from prior research about the effects of hate speech prosecution (authors, 2020; Van Spanje and De Vreese, 2014; 2015). Furthermore, many Dutch citizens believe that free speech should be restricted when being hurtful to groups of people (authors, 2020). To test if the previous findings hold, i.e., whether the political idea is indeed the main driver behind the effects, we need to test our hypotheses in a context that is different with regard to important extraneous variables. This means studying a country with a two-party system, where partisan identities are arguably stronger, and, subsequently, agreement with the political is generally deemed less important. Furthermore, as curbing discrimination is, by Dutch law, protected more than free speech, we need a country where the reverse is true.\n\nA cross-cultural study between the Netherlands and the United States provides a great opportunity to test the mechanisms underlying previous findings, as 1) due to the two-party system and high levels of affective polarization, partisan identification is arguably stronger in the US than in the Netherlands, and 2) free speech is a core American value and protected much more in the US than in the Netherlands. Hence, the US functions as a \u2018least likely case\u2019. By studying the effects of the decision to (not) prosecute a politician for hate speech in two very different environments, we advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms.\n\nPurpose of study. \n\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the mechanisms underlying the relationship between hate speech prosecution and democratic support in more detail. By examining the effects of hate speech prosecution on democratic support in two profoundly different contexts, we aim to discern what is exactly driving the effects: to what extent do agreement with the political ideas spread by the politician, identification with the prosecuted politician\u2019s party and adherence to free speech explain how citizens respond to the decision to (not) prosecute a politician for hate speech? \n\nBroad research questions. \n\nWhat are the effects of the decision to (not) prosecute a politician for hate speech on democratic support, and what is the moderating role of agreement with the politician\u2019s political ideas, party identification and adherence to free speech?

The news story of the second experimental condition mentions that the politician will not be prosecuted for spreading hateful messages about Muslims. In the control condition there is a mentioning of the politician having spread hateful messages about Muslims, but without any further information about the decision to (not) prosecute the politician. The Dutch news story refers to Forum for Democracy (Forum voor Democratie, FvD) MP Theo Hiddema.

To account for the multidimensionality of democratic support, we operationalize democratic support using four dimensions. These dimensions are largely based on four of the dimensions outlined by Norris (2011), and range from more diffuse (abstract) forms of democratic support to more specific (concrete) forms of democratic support.\n\nThe most diffuse form of democratic support in this study is \u201csystem affect\u201d, which involves a citizen\u2019s belief that the democratic system defends the basic democratic norms and values a person believes in (Muller and Williams, 1980). This is largely in line with Norris\u2019 \u201capproval of core regime principles and values\u201d. This is measured by the Political Support-Alienation Scale (Muller, Jukam and Seligson, 1982). This scale consists of the following three (originally eight) items (7-point Likert scale from 1 (\u2018completely disagree\u2019) to 7 (\u2018completely agree\u2019)): \u201cTo what extent do you feel that the fundamental rights of citizens are well protected by our democratic constitutional state?\u201d; \u201cTo what extent are you proud to live under our democratic constitutional state?\u201d; \u201cTo what extent do you feel that you and your close ones are well represented by our democratic constitutional state?\u201d.\n\nThe second dimension is \u201cevaluations of democratic performance\u201d, and represents the meso level of democratic support \u2013 the dimension that seems most difficult to measure (Norris, 2011). Evaluations of democratic performance are measured via three items (7-point scale from \u2018fully disagree\u2019 to \u2018fully agree\u2019): \u201cIn a democracy, the economic system functions badly\u201d; \u201cDemocracies are indecisive and there is too much quibbling\u201d; \u201cDemocracies are not good in maintaining order\u201d. The answers will be recoded to a higher value indicating more democratic support. These items replace the more common \u2018satisfaction with democracy\u2019-item, measuring how citizens evaluate the functioning of democratic states without necessarily having to disregard general democratic principles (Linde and Ekman, 2003; Norris, 2011).\n\nThe final two dimensions are \u201cconfidence in state institutions\u201d (11-point scale) and \u201ctrust in politicians\u201d (similar to Norris\u2019 \u201capproval of incumbent office-holders\u201d measure) (7-point scale). These two dimensions represent the most specific forms of democratic support. Confidence in state institutions is measured by the following question: \u201cPlease describe on a scale from 0 (\u2018no trust at all\u2019) to 10 (\u2018very strong trust\u2019) how much you personally trust each of the institutions\u201d, followed by the following political institutions: parliament (/congress), the Public Prosecutor (/federal prosecutors) and the government (the first two originating from the European Social Survey (ESS)). Trust in politicians is measured by the following three items (7-point Likert scale from 1 (\u2018completely disagree\u2019) to 7 (\u2018completely agree\u2019)): \u201cMost politicians give up their ideals or break their promises to gain more power\u201d; \u201cMost politicians talk much but do little to solve the real important problems in this country\u201d; \u201cMost politicians are in politics for personal gain\u201d. This scale is a shortened version of the original Political Cynicism Scale (Citrin and Elkins, 1975).

For each clinical case, the participants are asked to what extent they would recommend the patient for the treatment of hepatitis C and  the likelihood of following the recommendations of the doctor and of responsibly taking the medication. Participants are randomly assigned to one of the two order conditions: participants either see the Low-SES (or high-SES) patient associated with (a) unprotected sex practices (condomless sex condition) or with (b) shared tubes for cocaine consumption (e.g., speedballs; the non-injectable drug use condition).

Particularly, when meritocracy is salient. So, we predict low-SES dehumanization to mediate the relationship between target-SES and medical decisions. And expect this mediation to be moderated by meritocracy, expecting the mediation to occur when meritocracy is salient.

Participants must be medical students and having Mexican nationality.\n\nProcedure. Participants are told that they would take part in a research study about medical decision-making processes. In the decision-making task, participants read information on Hepatitis C and on the rationalization of the treatment of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). To ensure that participants read the information, we will add an attentional check. Next, they are asked to imagine themselves as a physician, a member of a panel with the mission of recommending patients for the treatment of hepatitis C. Participants view two clinical cases.  The cases are randomized. For each clinical case, the participants are asked to what extent they would recommend the patient for the treatment of hepatitis C and  the likelihood of following the recommendations of the doctor and of responsibly taking the medication. Participants are randomly assigned to one of the two order conditions: participants either see the Low-SES (or high-SES) patient associated with (a) unprotected sex practices (condomless sex condition) or with (b) shared tubes for cocaine consumption (e.g., speedballs; the non-injectable drug use condition).

In the meritocracy condition, participants complete sentences related to meritocracy beliefs (e.g., Item: \u2018effort positive prosperity leads to\u2019 Answer: \u2018Effort leads to prosperity\u2019). In the control condition, participants complete sentences unrelated to meritocracy (e.g., Item: \u2018experience travel is an learning\u2019 Answer: \u2018learning is an experience\u2019).\n\nThe socio-economic status  (SES) of the target is manipulated in the clinical vignette.

Medical Recommendation. We will measure this by asking participants in a 7-points scale, from not at all (1) to very much (7) to what extent would they recommend the person for the hepatitis C treatment.\n\n2. Blatant Dehumanization. To capture the tendency to dehumanize low-SES patients compared to High-SES patients, we will implement the Ascent of Man measure (Kteily, Bruneau, Waytz &amp; Cotterrill, 2015). This is a blatant scale in which participants will need to rate the extent each patient scores on a scale from 0 (\u201cless evolved\u201d) to 100 (\u201cmore evolved).
