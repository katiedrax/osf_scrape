National Collegiate Athletic Ass\u2019n, 2018), there has been increased sports betting opportunities for gamblers in the United States (U.S.) (American Gaming Association, 2019). Despite the growth of legal markets, illegal sports betting (mostly through unregulated offshore sites) is still deeply entrenched across the country, including jurisdictions where domestically-licensed sportsbooks operate (American Gaming Association, 2019). These illegal sites are a problem for governments for many reasons \u2013 they may lack regulatory oversight and consumer protection mechanisms, and often enable financial crimes like money laundering and tax evasion (Albanese, 2018). \tUnderstanding consumers\u2019 motivations for using illegal online sportsbooks is essential in developing policies to discourage the use of illegal sites as well as to encourage use of legal ones. However, little is known about U.S. consumer motivation in selecting legal versus illegal online sportsbooks. Therefore, the primary goal of this study is to determine the main factors that draw U.S. consumers to place a bet on illegal online sportsbooks instead of legitimate ones. In addition, we will examine the differences in demographics and gambling behaviors of people choosing between illegal and legal sites.

Early Adversity", "description": "Early adversity (EA) can have deleterious impacts on one's well being. Specifically, being exposed to EA puts an individual at risk for atypical brain development as well as an increased susceptibility for the development of mood disorders later in life (Cicchetti &amp; Toth, 2005; Green et al. 2010; Kessler et al. 2010; Keyes et al. 2018; McLaughlin et al. 2010; Nusslock and Miller 2016; Pechtel and Pizzagalli 2011). For example, previously institutionalized youth (PI; youth who experienced orphanage care and were subsequently adopted) are at increased risk for internalizing disorders relative to their comparison (i.e., youth raised by their biological parents since birth) peers. \n\nCognitive reappraisal is an emotion regulation strategy that involves changing one\u2019s interpretation of emotional events and has been shown to be an important component of healthy social-emotional development in adolescents and adults (Cutuli 2014; Haga et al. 2009). Expressive suppression, by contrast, involves suppressing the outward expression of emotion and has been linked to decreased well-being (Cutuli 2014; Haga et al. 2009). Both cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression involve the down-regulation of emotion, however, their underlying processes and consequences are drastically different. Here we assessed the role of these two widely-studied emotion regulation strategies, cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression on the development of internalizing psychopathology (anxiety, depression, somatic complaints, and withdrawal) among PI versus comparison youths. \n\nWhile EA is a strong predictor for the development of psychopathology, less is known about what makes PI youth resilient. The present study sought to investigate whether engaging in effortful emotion regulation, such as cognitive reappraisal, would buffer PI youth against internalizing symptomatology compared to comparison youth. Identifying risk and resilience factors that modify links between EA and psychopathology is critical in order to optimize treatments tailored to the affected population.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-11T22:46:26.781270", "date_modified": "2020-04-11T22:09:17.667123", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["anxiety", "cognitive reappraisal", "depression", "early adversity", "emotion regulation", "expressive suppression", "internalizing psychopathology", "previously institutionalized", "resilience", "somatic complaints", "withdrawal"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Copyright 2020"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "fa093ad1627ec34eb3b3ad6cbebaa9f64e443b3cc6a44e7b349d68480b7c3a37af6f5ef5fe55d06558cf597be34ba871636ab2db55665768b96e6d1a7fdf8979d7d0793ff5ab5deb573bab5c463496676500bcf6003adf7dd3bc049513794283039084f7e889d5cfa50d8c5c8eb98427ff1b93f07041e094fa1eb3a9fb73f7d2dc9c3a843316ed1cd38680559869a6b0", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-11T22:46:26.762584", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Yael Waizman, Adriana Mendez Leal, Joao F.
