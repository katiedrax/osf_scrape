The treatment involves exposure to one of three lectures on taxation, foreign aid and investment, and provision of public goods in Liberia. The first lecture focuses on the role of government in funding public goods through taxation. This is the \u201cgovernment\u201d treatment group. The second focuses on the role of Chinese donors and investors in providing public goods without recourse to taxation (at least not of Liberians).

Specifically, it develops a novel survey experiment that assesses whether misperceptions of the global income distribution shape preferences for foreign aid and other types of cross-national redistribution. It builds on pilot results from Amazon MTurk in an experiment implemented on a nationally representative sample of US residents."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: Individuals in advanced industrial countries such as the United States systematically misperceive their position in the global income distribution. More specifically, individuals on average tend to underestimate their rank and overestimate the global median income. Respondents will be considered to accurately perceive their rank if they place themselves in the correct decile of the global distribution of income. They will be judged to underestimate their true decile if the rank estimate that they provide is in a lower decile than their true decile. They will be coded as overestimating the global median income if they estimate it at more than $4,000 (approximately twice the global median income). We expect both self-interested and prosocial concerns to motivate individuals to support more international redistribution when biased perceptions of the income distribution are corrected: H2: If H1 is true, then providing individuals with accurate information about their rank should increase individuals\u2019 support for foreign aid and other kinds of cross-national redistribution. Although most individuals in Treatment Group 2 will be made to feel richer through the information provided (a person earning the individual poverty line income in the US is easily in the top quintile of the world\u2019s distribution of income), several countervailing forces will likely ensure that measured effects on attitudes (if any) are quantitatively small. Individuals may only be comfortable with relatively limited obligations and believe that these obligations are bounded by the nation-state. They may think that domestic recipients are more deserving even if foreign recipients are more needy. Given the negative connotations attached to foreign aid, citizens of advanced industrial countries may view cross-national transfers to poor countries as being wasteful and inefficient. Finally, low and middle income citizens of advanced industrial countries may oppose higher taxes for the same reason that rich citizens may oppose domestic redistribution: it reduces their own income without a meaningful prospect of reciprocal benefits. Although we find significantly higher stated support for international redistribution in the MTurk pilots, we note that we would consider precisely estimated null results for a representative sample of Americans to still be noteworthy."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "Our main comparison of interest is the difference in preferences between individuals assigned to control and those assigned to a treatment group that both asks individuals to estimate the global median income and their rank in the global income distribution, and subsequently gives these respondents accurate information on these statistics. We will compare differences between individuals who are only asked to estimate the median and rank, and those who both estimate these statistics and are given information, and individuals given information about the domestic income distribution. For each of five outcome measures we estimate OLS regressions of the form: (1) f(Yi) = \u03b20 + \u03b21TreatmentGroup1i + \u03b22TreatmentGroup2i + \u03b5 (2) f(Yi) = \u03b20 + \u03b21TreatmentGroup1i + \u03b22TreatmentGroup2i + \u03b3Xi + \u03b5 Where i indexes individual respondents. An outcome of interest Y (described in sections 3.3.1) is regressed on dummy variables indicating treatment assignment (with control groups being the reference category) and additionally a vector of pre-treatment covariates X specified in section 3.1.

Specifically, it develops a novel survey experiment that assesses whether misperceptions of the global income distribution shape preferences for foreign aid and other types of cross-national redistribution. It builds on pilot results from Amazon MTurk in an experiment implemented on a nationally representative sample of US residents.", "q16": "H1: Individuals in advanced industrial countries such as the United States systematically misperceive their position in the global income distribution. More specifically, individuals on average tend to underestimate their rank and overestimate the global median income. Respondents will be considered to accurately perceive their rank if they place themselves in the correct decile of the global distribution of income. They will be judged to underestimate their true decile if the rank estimate that they provide is in a lower decile than their true decile. They will be coded as overestimating the global median income if they estimate it at more than $4,000 (approximately twice the global median income). We expect both self-interested and prosocial concerns to motivate individuals to support more international redistribution when biased perceptions of the income distribution are corrected: H2: If H1 is true, then providing individuals with accurate information about their rank should increase individuals\u2019 support for foreign aid and other kinds of cross-national redistribution. Although most individuals in Treatment Group 2 will be made to feel richer through the information provided (a person earning the individual poverty line income in the US is easily in the top quintile of the world\u2019s distribution of income), several countervailing forces will likely ensure that measured effects on attitudes (if any) are quantitatively small. Individuals may only be comfortable with relatively limited obligations and believe that these obligations are bounded by the nation-state. They may think that domestic recipients are more deserving even if foreign recipients are more needy. Given the negative connotations attached to foreign aid, citizens of advanced industrial countries may view cross-national transfers to poor countries as being wasteful and inefficient. Finally, low and middle income citizens of advanced industrial countries may oppose higher taxes for the same reason that rich citizens may oppose domestic redistribution: it reduces their own income without a meaningful prospect of reciprocal benefits. Although we find significantly higher stated support for international redistribution in the MTurk pilots, we note that we would consider precisely estimated null results for a representative sample of Americans to still be noteworthy.", "q17": "Our main comparison of interest is the difference in preferences between individuals assigned to control and those assigned to a treatment group that both asks individuals to estimate the global median income and their rank in the global income distribution, and subsequently gives these respondents accurate information on these statistics. We will compare differences between individuals who are only asked to estimate the median and rank, and those who both estimate these statistics and are given information, and individuals given information about the domestic income distribution. For each of five outcome measures we estimate OLS regressions of the form: (1) f(Yi) = \u03b20 + \u03b21TreatmentGroup1i + \u03b22TreatmentGroup2i + \u03b5 (2) f(Yi) = \u03b20 + \u03b21TreatmentGroup1i + \u03b22TreatmentGroup2i + \u03b3Xi + \u03b5 Where i indexes individual respondents.

The experiment is motivated by a broader study (dissertation) that seeks to understand the conditions under which party competition might emerge from a democratic transition dominated by a single party. Specifically, it considers the case of South Africa. Ferree (2011) has shown that the ruling ANC party has been able to maintain a \u201cframing\u201d power that persuades voters that the opposition DA is an exclusive (white) party. This moves attention away from purely \u201cexpressive\u201d racial voting and party performance and toward political strategies of persuasion. This experimental test varies both the race (black or white) and party (ANC or DA) of an authority figure in the game. In a diff-in-diff design, it then tests how the authority\u2019s directions, behavior, and persuasive \u201cframes\u201d affect citizen actions. It can therefore test whether the ANC retains the framing power that Ferree found in the first four South African elections (1994, 1999, 2004, and 2009), and whether this depends on the race of the authority. In other words, does the ANC\u2019s framing advantage disappear when the DA leader is black? The experimental design also allows for comparison of the framing effect to performance and to racial and partisan identity absent the frames. The results will therefore show whether the mechanism Ferree points to is still effective or not, and therefore whether the DA\u2019s strategy in the recent 2014 election campaign of shedding their party label has been successful.

If polarization has at least some negative consequences, are there ways to reduce/ameliorate it? Here, I focus on whether it is possible to reduce affective polarization, that is, dislike/distrust of the opposing party (Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes 2012; Mason 2013). Manifestations of affective polarization include lower feeling thermometer ratings, more negative trait evaluations of the other party (i.e., being more likely to rate them as dishonest, untrustworthy, etc.), and in some cases, more discrimination against the opposite party in various tasks (Iyengar and Westwood 2015). Note that affective polarization is theoretically and empirically distinct from ideological or issue-based polarization (see Mason 2015). Affective polarization is dislike of the opposition, ideological or issue-based polarization is a difference between the issue positions of Democrats and Republicans (on issue-based polarization, see Fiorina, Abrams, and Pope 2005). In this study, I examine a particular intervention that might reduce such affective polarization: priming national identity, rather than partisan identity, in order to reduce partisan hostility and competition. If subjects are primed as Americans\u2014rather than as Democrats/Republicans\u2014they will respond with less hostility to the other side. They will see the other party as closer to themselves: as common members of a shared identity (Americans) rather than as competing members of separate out-group (opposing partisans). There is strong psychological evidence for this sort of a prime rooted in the Common Intergroup Identity Model (Gartner et al. 1989; Gartner and Dovidio 2000). This model argues that individuals have superordinate and subordinate identities. When the superordinate (American) identity is primed, they reduce their hostility to the opposing subordinate (partisan) group. This follows because of a pattern of reclassification: instead of seeing the other subordinate group as an outgroup, they now see them as a fellow member of a shared ingroup (the superordinate group), and attach a positive valence to them because of shifts \u201cinvolving pro-ingroup bias\u201d (Gartner and Dovidio 2000, 42; see also Brewer and Brown 1998, 580-1). In this context, suppose a Democrat is asked to evaluate Republicans. If he sees the Republican as a Republican\u2014and hence as a member of an outgroup\u2014then he will tend to evaluate them quite negatively (consistent with Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes 2012). However, if he primarily sees Republicans as Americans\u2014a shared in-group\u2014then he will evaluate them more warmly (likely still not as warmly as he evaluates other Democrats, but more warmly than when they are just Republicans). So by emphasizing a common identity, hostility toward another group decreases (see also Theiss-Morse 2009). What it means to be \u201cAmerican\u201d is itself a difficult question, subject to much scholarly debate (see, among many others, Smith 1997; Schildkraut 2011). Here, by American identity, I mean American national identity: \u201ca subjective or internalized sense of belonging to the [American] nation\u201d (Huddy and Khatib 2007, 65). This conception grows out of social identity theory (Tajfel and Turner 1979), and represents group membership based on a psychological sense of group membership (in this case, a sense that one is an American). This is not tied, however, to an endorsement of a particular ideology or political belief, but rather reflects \u201cbeing or feeling American\u201d (Huddy and Khatib 2007, 65). Ordinary citizens think that this sense of belonging is an important part of being \u201cAmerican.\u201d Schildkraut (2011) asks respondents which factors they think should be important to being an American. More than 90 percent say that \u201cfeeling American\u201d and \u201cthinking of oneself as American\u201d should be important components of being an American (table 3.1, p.45). This sense of national identity transcends racial, ethnic, and partisan/ideological boundaries (Huddy and Khatib 2007; Citrin, Duff, and Wong 2001). So the basic hypothesis is straightforward: priming American national identity will reduce affective partisan polarization. But the effect will not be equally efficacious for all respondents. Such effects should be more muted among those are sorted (i.e., those whose overall ideological outlook matches their partisan orientation, see Levendusky 2009). As Mason (2015) illustrates, those who are sorted (in her words, have aligned identities) show more hostility toward the other party and see them as more of a threat. Given that party and ideology align and are quite strong in this group, their identity as a partisan is a strong and entrenched one, and should be more resistant to this type of priming. The same logic should apply equally well to those who identify most strongly with a party (i.e., strong partisans). There is one final group for whom the treatment should be especially effective: immigrants. Immigrants effectively have \u201cbought in\u201d to the American ideal and American dream, and should see themselves as having a stronger attachment to American identity. Consistent with this, immigrants, particularly Hispanic immigrants, have stronger identity as Americans than other Americans (de la Garza, Falcon, and Garcia 1996; Citrin, Lerman, Murakami, and Pearson 2007). Given this, immigrants might be more responsive to this sort of superordinate American identity priming. Further, those who are more acculturated in the U.S., and have absorbed those norms of Americanism, should be more responsive to the prime. For example, those who have been in the U.S. longer, or are second or third (vs. first) generation immigrants, more strongly identify as Americans (e.g., Schildkraut 2011)."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "That gives the following 4 hypotheses to be tested: H1: Priming American national identity will reduce affective polarization.
