However, observational evidence had suggested that labor market competition is a factor driving anti-immigrant sentiment. I argue that the existing experimental evidence is not sufficiently specific about the skills of immigrants to be a comprehensive test of the labor market competition hypothesis. A lawyer will only be threatened by immigrants who are lawyers and would substantially benefit from other high skilled immigrants such as doctors. To get round this limitation, I coded ~7000 British election study respondents' occupations so that their own occupation could be inserted into the survey experiment in the treatment condition. This should provide a much stronger test of labor market competition than showing generic high or low skilled workers."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Are respondents less favorable to accepting immigrants with jobs similar to their own?

Experimental research has tended to show that both low and high skilled natives prefer high skilled immigrants. They argue that this contradicts the labor market competition theory which states that workers should feel most threatened by immigrants with the same skill level as them. However, observational evidence had suggested that labor market competition is a factor driving anti-immigrant sentiment. I argue that the existing experimental evidence is not sufficiently specific about the skills of immigrants to be a comprehensive test of the labor market competition hypothesis. A lawyer will only be threatened by immigrants who are lawyers and would substantially benefit from other high skilled immigrants such as doctors. To get round this limitation, I coded ~7000 British election study respondents' occupations so that their own occupation could be inserted into the survey experiment in the treatment condition.

This is despite the fact that free public education is a guaranteed right in Kenya. On average, parents pay twice as much for the private schools than they would for public education (even after accounting for widespread rent-seeking within the public-school system). This trend is not unique to Kenya or to the education sector. Low-cost, non-governmental education provision is also common among the urban poor in places like Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Liberia, and India, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) often provide other services such as healthcare and sanitation. This project examines how the prevalence of non-governmental service delivery, including low-cost private schools, affects political behavior and local governance.
