self-served portion size", "description": "Socio-economic position (SEP) has a key-role in health and several studies have highlighted differences in dietary behaviour between people of lower and higher SEP as potential mediators of this relationship (Giskes et al., 2010; Mackenbach et al., 2019; Pigeyre et al., 2016). It has been shown that people of lower SEP are more likely to behave in ways that increase the likelihood of developing cardiovascular diseases and obesity (e.g., higher consumption of meat and fatty foods, alcohol consumption and smoking) (Adler et al., 1994; M\u00e9jean et al., 2013). In developed countries, the prevalence of obesity and other chronic diseases has dramatically increased within all the socio-economic groups (WHO/FAO Expert Consultation, 2003) but to a larger extent among poorer and less educated groups (Burkert et al., 2013). This social gradient might be explained by lower SEP being associated with increased energy intake (Cardel et al., 2016; Sim et al., 2018; Wijayatunga et al., 2019).\n\nNutritional labelling is one of the most common intervention that has been implemented to reduce energy intake (Crockett et al., 2018). Nutritional labels provide consumers with different types of information (e.g. nutritional composition, energy content) in various ways (e.g. numerical, daily recommended intake, traffic lights) and may have a positive impact on food choices and energy intake (Crockett et al., 2018). However, Sarink et al. (2016) investigated the impact of kcal labelling in people of lower vs. higher SEP and showed that it may benefit more people of higher SEP than people of lower SEP, which may in turn increase health inequalities (Sarink et al., 2016).\n\nA novel form of labelling is Physical Activity Calorie Equivalent (PACE) which may be an alternative to numerical energy labelling (Daley et al., 2019). PACE labelling aims to encourage healthier eating behaviours by providing an interpretation of the energy content of a food in terms of energy expenditure: how many minutes (time) or how many kilometres/miles (distance) of physical activity (e.g. walking, running, swimming, bicycle) are needed to burn off the corresponding energy (Daley et al., 2019). PACE might be easier to understand compared to other nutritional labels because consumers do not need health literacy or have advanced numeracy skills to understand PACE (Reale &amp; Flint, 2016). However, in a recent study, Antonelli &amp; Viera (2015) showed a stronger effect of PACE among people of higher compared to lower SEP, in particular among richer people (Antonelli &amp; Viera, 2015).\n\nThe food choices of people of higher SEP are more motivated by health than those of people of lower SEP (Konttinen et al., 2012). As information-based interventions typically rely on people being motivated by health in their food choices (Dub\u00e9 &amp; Cantin, 2000), the presence of nutritional labels may lead to healthier eating behaviours primarily among people of higher SEP.\n\nPrimary objective\n\nTo investigate the effect of labelling (kcal or PACE) on the total self-served energy among participants of lower and higher SEP.\n\nSecondary objective\n\nTo investigate the psychological processes that may explain the different effect of the intervention and whether health motivation and physical activity level mediate the differential effect of labelling (kcal or PACE) on total self-served energy among participants of lower and higher SEP.\n\nAdler, N.

However the designs of these studies were different from the present study: the food options were mainly snacks (only one study offered to consume main meals (Kral et al., 2002)) and participants were not aware of the amount of kcal they actually consumed (the label was placed on the container or packaging, adjacent to the food, or presented on a display board). In our design, we expect a significant effect of kcal labelling with a reduction of 8.4% of self-served energy per meal may occur, which is the effect size found in a meta-analysis investigating the impact of kcal labelling on energy consumed during a meal with a range of available food options \u2013 i.e., the most similar design to the present study. The most up to date evidence of an effect of PACE labelling on energy consumed from foods/drinks is a meta-analysis of two studies and showed a significant reduction of 14.4%. Due to the small number of participants included in this meta-analysis, we conservatory powered our study to be able to detect an 8% reduction for both type of labels (kcal, PACE or kcal and PACE).\n\nWe will run a two-level mixed model including 18 trials (level 1) per participant (level 2) and compare self-served energy in each of the four trial arms (control, kcal labelling, PACE labelling, kcal and PACE labelling). We estimate SD of 300 kcal for self-served energy at level 1 and level 2 based on average SD of energy consumed during experimental meals (Crockett et al., 2018). A sample size of 1,600 participants with \u03b1 = 0.05 will allow to detect a 8% energy reduction between any of the four groups at power = 0.80. It will also allow to detect a small effect (f=0.07) of the interaction between the interventions and higher educational qualification education at power = 0.80 (MLPowSim) (Browne et al., 2009).\n\nIn a previous study we conducted at virtual fast food restaurants (Marty et al., 2020), we found small-to-medium correlation between level of education and healthiness motivation (r=0.17) and small-to-medium correlation between healthiness motivation and kcal ordered (r=-0.25). Because evidence of a relationship between SEP and physical activity is mixed (Gidlow et al., 2006), we hypothesize small-to-medium correlation. Empirical estimates of sample sizes needed for 0.8 power in mediation analyses indicate that samples of \u2248 380 are sufficient to detect mediation through pathways that are small and small-to-medium in statistical size using bias-corrected bootstrap tests (Fritz &amp; Mackinnon, 2007). Thus, a sample of 1,600 participants (i.e., 400 per experimental condition) would allow for adequate power in our planned moderated mediation analysis.\n\nWe will recruit a sample of 1,800 participants (who consent to take part in the study) to account for potential data loss due to dropouts and failed quality controls (approx. 10%) resulting in a minimum sample of 1,600 participants for analyses. However, if we experience a greater loss of data than expected, we will continue to recruit participants until we achieve the required sample size of 1,600 participants.\n\nBrowne, W. J., Lahi, M.

Equivalised household income is calculated by dividing the after-tax household (including all the earner to the nearest \u00a31000) by the sum of the equivalence value of all the household members (1 = first adult; 0.5 = additional adult or child &gt;14 years old; 0.3 = child aged 0-13 years old).\n\nSubjective SEP: The measure of the Subjective Social Status using the MacArthur Scale will be coded from 1 (lower SSS) to 10 (higher SSS).\n\nInhibition \u2013 Stroop task: The median reaction times (RTs) will be calculated for correct responses in incongruent and congruent trials. The interference effect will be calculated as the difference between the median RTs of the incongruent trials and the congruent trials. A larger interference score is indicative of poorer inhibition. RTs data are commonly skewed, reflecting lapses of attention or eye blinks during the task (Heathcote et al., 1991). To resolve this, median will be used instead of means. Median is less affected by extreme scores than the mean and provides a better estimate of central tendency for skewed distributions (Ratcliff, 1993; Rousselet &amp; Wilcox, 2019). We will also calculate the proportion of correct responses in incongruent trials because this outcome has been previously linked to the frequency of fatty food consumption (Hall, 2012).\n\nWorking memory \u2013 backwards digit-span task: The two-error maximum length will be calculated. It is the last digit-span a participant gets correct before making two consecutive errors and the traditional measure of a participant\u2019s backward digit span (Woods et al., 2012). We will also calculate the maximum length i.e., the maximal backward digit span that a participant recalled correctly during all 14 trials.\n\nFamiliarity\nWhen the answer to the question \u201cHave you ever eaten this food?\u201d will be \u2018yes\u2019, the food will be coded as familiar for a participant.\n\nLiking\nFor each participant and each food a liking score from 0 to 100 will be recorded (anchors: not at all, extremely).\n\nHealth motivation in food choices\nHealth and weight control motivation scores will be computed by averaging ratings for individual items in each dimension (health motivation: 6 items; weight control motivation: 4 items). They will range from 1 to 4: 1 = Not at all important; 2 = A little important; 3 = Moderately important; 4 = Very important.\n\nOther variables\n\nBMI will be calculated as weight (kg) / height (m2). BMI data will be trimmed for implausible values excluding weight for less than 30 kg and more than 250 kg, height for less than 145 cm and more than 3m, BMI &lt; 14 or BMI &gt; 48 (Hardy et al., 2016; Miller, 2003).\n\nPhysical activity level will be estimated based on IPAQ-SF answers as MET-minutes per week : self-reported physical activity in minutes*MET score [walking = 3.3, moderate intensity = 4.0, vigorous intensity = 8.0]*number of days (Craig et al., 2003).\n\nAim guessing: Participants who identify the aim of the study as being to examine the influence of kcal or PACE labelling on self-served food portion size will be coded as being aware of the study aims. Responses will be independently coded by two researchers, with discrepancies in coding decisions resolved by a third researcher.\n\nCraig, C. L., Marshall, A. L., Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, M., Bauman, A.

Secondary analyses will be run in order to investigate the role of potential mediators to explain the relationship SEP-self-served energy. The measure of SEP used in our main analyses will be the highest educational qualification (binary variable: lower vs. higher) because previous research showed that people of higher education were more likely to use nutrition labels (Breck et al., 2014; Cowburn &amp; Stockley, 2008).\n\nLinear mixed effect models will be run in order to test the effect of the labels and of highest educational qualification on the self-served energy, with participants and dishes set as random effects to account for correlation between repeated measures by the same participant and across the different food items. The main model will test the effect of the labelling intervention (four levels: kcal labelling, PACE labelling, kcal and PACE labelling, no labelling), highest educational qualification (two levels: lower, higher) and the interaction between labelling intervention and highest educational qualification. If the interaction is significant, analyses will be stratified by highest educational qualification (lower and higher) and two linear mixed models will be fitted to examine the effect of the labelling intervention on self-served energy.\n\nIf there is a main effect of the labelling intervention in one of the above linear mixed models we will follow up this main effect by conducting the following pairwise comparisons:\n\n-\tSelf-served energy in each of the three labelling conditions compared to no labelling condition:\no\tNo labelling vs. kcal labelling\no\tNo labelling vs. PACE labelling\no\tNo labelling vs. kcal and PACE labelling combined\n\n-\tSelf-served energy in the combined labelling condition compared to single labelling conditions\no\tKcal and PACE labelling combined vs. kcal labelling\no\tKcal and PACE labelling combined vs. PACE labelling\n\n-\tSelf-served energy in one single labelling condition compared to the other single labelling condition:\no\tKcal labelling vs. PACE labelling\n\nWe will apply a Bonferroni correction to the level of significance based on the number of pairwise comparisons made (e.g., 12 comparisons: 0.05/12=0.004).\n\nSensitivity analyses\n\nWe will conduct sensitivity analyses to examine whether the pattern of results from the main analyses differ when:\n\n-\texcluding the aim guessers from the main analyses, or if more than 20% of participants guess the aim of the study, including an \u2018aim guessing\u2019 variable (two levels: yes, no) as a covariate in the main model;\n\n-\tsubstituting highest educational qualification by level of education (composite score) in the main model;\n\n-\tincluding hunger and liking as covariates in the main model as these two variables are likely to influence how much one serves oneself of a dish;\n\n-\texcluding any dish that is familiar to less than 50% of participants or that is scored &lt; 50 in liking on average (mid-way of the scale) to examine whether results are consistent when only well liked and familiar foods are used.\n\nWe will report whether sensitivity analyses result in deviations from the pattern of significance to the main analyses (i.e., any significant differences between conditions becoming not significant, and vice versa).\n\nSecondary analyses\n\nThe main analyses will be repeated using alternative measures of SEP to investigate whether different measures lead to the same pattern of results. Highest educational qualification will be substituted by 1/ equivalised income, and 2/ SSS.\n\nModerated mediation analyses\n\nWe will report and compare the measures of inhibition, working memory, healthiness and weight control motivation in food choices overall and for participants of lower vs. higher education level using means, standard deviations and t-tests.\n\nIf the main analyses suggest that highest educational qualification moderates the effect of labelling intervention (i.e., the labelling intervention*highest educational qualification is significant), moderated mediation analyses will be performed in order to explain the different effect of labelling intervention in participants of lower vs. higher education level. We will test as mediators the measures of inhibition, working memory, healthiness and weight control motivation in food choices only if we find individual differences on these measures between participants of lower and higher education level. Moderated mediation analyses will examine the extent to which they mediate the effect of highest educational qualification on self-served energy in each labelling condition (kcal labelling, PACE labelling, kcal and PACE labelling, no labelling).\n\nThe moderated mediation will be tested by estimating the conditional indirect effect of highest educational qualification through M for kcal labelling, PACE labelling, kcal and PACE labelling, no labelling conditions and testing the conditional indirect effect for those conditions using bias-corrected bootstrap. We will use the PROCESS macro (Model 15) on SAS version 9.3 that provides asymmetric bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals for inference about the conditional indirect effects using 5,000 bootstrap samples (Hayes, 2012). Moderated mediation will be tested by determining whether or not the confidence interval for the difference between conditional indirect effects for kcal labelling, PACE labelling, kcal and PACE labelling versus no labelling contains zero.\n\nBreck, A., Cantor, J., Martinez, O., &amp; Elbel, B.

However the designs of these studies were different from the present study: the food options were mainly snacks (only one study offered to consume main meals (Kral et al., 2002)) and participants were not aware of the amount of kcal they actually consumed (the label was placed on the container or packaging, adjacent to the food, or presented on a display board). In our design, we expect a significant effect of kcal labelling with a reduction of 8.4% of self-served energy per meal may occur, which is the effect size found in a meta-analysis investigating the impact of kcal labelling on energy consumed during a meal with a range of available food options \u2013 i.e., the most similar design to the present study. The most up to date evidence of an effect of PACE labelling on energy consumed from foods/drinks is a meta-analysis of two studies and showed a significant reduction of 14.4%. Due to the small number of participants included in this meta-analysis, we conservatory powered our study to be able to detect an 8% reduction for both type of labels (kcal, PACE or kcal and PACE).\n\nWe will run a two-level mixed model including 18 trials (level 1) per participant (level 2) and compare self-served energy in each of the four trial arms (control, kcal labelling, PACE labelling, kcal and PACE labelling). We estimate SD of 300 kcal for self-served energy at level 1 and level 2 based on average SD of energy consumed during experimental meals (Crockett et al., 2018). A sample size of 1,600 participants with \u03b1 = 0.05 will allow to detect a 8% energy reduction between any of the four groups at power = 0.80. It will also allow to detect a small effect (f=0.07) of the interaction between the interventions and higher educational qualification education at power = 0.80 (MLPowSim) (Browne et al., 2009).\n\nIn a previous study we conducted at virtual fast food restaurants (Marty et al., 2020), we found small-to-medium correlation between level of education and healthiness motivation (r=0.17) and small-to-medium correlation between healthiness motivation and kcal ordered (r=-0.25). Because evidence of a relationship between SEP and physical activity is mixed (Gidlow et al., 2006), we hypothesize small-to-medium correlation. Empirical estimates of sample sizes needed for 0.8 power in mediation analyses indicate that samples of \u2248 380 are sufficient to detect mediation through pathways that are small and small-to-medium in statistical size using bias-corrected bootstrap tests (Fritz &amp; Mackinnon, 2007). Thus, a sample of 1,600 participants (i.e., 400 per experimental condition) would allow for adequate power in our planned moderated mediation analysis.\n\nWe will recruit a sample of 1,800 participants (who consent to take part in the study) to account for potential data loss due to dropouts and failed quality controls (approx. 10%) resulting in a minimum sample of 1,600 participants for analyses.

Two ANOVAs will be run to test the effect of the labelling intervention and of highest educational qualification on the first two items: kcal influence and PACE influence.\n", "q23": "", "q6.question": "Participants will take part in an online survey.

Participants will be able to virtually \u2018serve themselves\u2019 the amount of food they would like to eat by increasing or reducing the quantity on the plate using the arrow keys on their keyboard (to increase = right key; to decrease = left key). Energy content will increase by 20 kcal each time they will tap the right arrow key (max. 1000 kcal). Participants will have to increase the portion size at least once (i.e., at least one tap on the right arrow key) to be able to confirm their choice using the spacebar. The 18 dishes will be randomised in order.\n\nFoods\n\nThe food stimuli are based on a previously published work by Whitelock et al. (2018) (Appendix A). For each dish, 50 pictures have been taken to reflect the increase in portion size. The number of calories increases 20 kcal by 20 kcal from a minimum of 20 kcal (first picture) to a maximum of 1000 kcal (50th picture) (Whitelock et al., 2018).\n\nInterventions \n\nFor each portion and dish, participants will see on the screen a label showing the number of calories, physical activity calories equivalent or both. Labels are adapted from Swartz et al., 2013 (Swartz et al., 2013).\n\nKcal labelling (kcal+/PACE-)\nParticipants allocated to this group will see on the screen the amount of food increasing or decreasing based on how many times they tap on the corresponding keys and a real-time kcal counter synchronised with the food amount changes (i.e., increasing/decreasing).\n\nPACE labelling (kcal-/PACE+)\nParticipants allocated to this group will see on the screen the amount of food increasing or decreasing based on how many times they tap on the corresponding keys and a real-time PACE counter (as minutes needed to walk to burn off the calories) synchronised to the food amount changes (i.e., increasing/decreasing) with 4 min being equivalent to 20 kcal (Daley et al., 2019).\n\nKcal and PACE labelling (kcal+/PACE+)\nParticipants allocated to this group will see on the screen the amount of food increasing or decreasing based on how many times they tap on the corresponding keys and a real-time kcal and PACE counters synchronised to the food amount changes (i.e., increasing/decreasing).\n\nNo labelling (kcal-/PACE-)\nParticipants allocated to this group will only see on the screen the amount of food increasing or decreasing based how many times they tap on the corresponding keys.\n\nDaley, A.

Equivalised household income is calculated by dividing the after-tax household (including all the earner to the nearest \u00a31000) by the sum of the equivalence value of all the household members (1 = first adult; 0.5 = additional adult or child &gt;14 years old; 0.3 = child aged 0-13 years old).\n\nSubjective SEP: The measure of the Subjective Social Status using the MacArthur Scale will be coded from 1 (lower SSS) to 10 (higher SSS).\n\nInhibition \u2013 Stroop task: The median reaction times (RTs) will be calculated for correct responses in incongruent and congruent trials. The interference effect will be calculated as the difference between the median RTs of the incongruent trials and the congruent trials. A larger interference score is indicative of poorer inhibition. RTs data are commonly skewed, reflecting lapses of attention or eye blinks during the task (Heathcote et al., 1991). To resolve this, median will be used instead of means. Median is less affected by extreme scores than the mean and provides a better estimate of central tendency for skewed distributions (Ratcliff, 1993; Rousselet &amp; Wilcox, 2019). We will also calculate the proportion of correct responses in incongruent trials because this outcome has been previously linked to the frequency of fatty food consumption (Hall, 2012).\n\nWorking memory \u2013 backwards digit-span task: The two-error maximum length will be calculated. It is the last digit-span a participant gets correct before making two consecutive errors and the traditional measure of a participant\u2019s backward digit span (Woods et al., 2012). We will also calculate the maximum length i.e., the maximal backward digit span that a participant recalled correctly during all 14 trials.\n\nFamiliarity\nWhen the answer to the question \u201cHave you ever eaten this food?\u201d will be \u2018yes\u2019, the food will be coded as familiar for a participant.\n\nLiking\nFor each participant and each food a liking score from 0 to 100 will be recorded (anchors: not at all, extremely).\n\nHealth motivation in food choices\nHealth and weight control motivation scores will be computed by averaging ratings for individual items in each dimension (health motivation: 6 items; weight control motivation: 4 items). They will range from 1 to 4: 1 = Not at all important; 2 = A little important; 3 = Moderately important; 4 = Very important.\n\nOther variables\n\nBMI will be calculated as weight (kg) / height (m2). BMI data will be trimmed for implausible values excluding weight for less than 30 kg and more than 250 kg, height for less than 145 cm and more than 3m, BMI &lt; 14 or BMI &gt; 48 (Hardy et al., 2016; Miller, 2003).\n\nPhysical activity level will be estimated based on IPAQ-SF answers as MET-minutes per week : self-reported physical activity in minutes*MET score [walking = 3.3, moderate intensity = 4.0, vigorous intensity = 8.0]*number of days (Craig et al., 2003).\n\nAim guessing: Participants who identify the aim of the study as being to examine the influence of kcal or PACE labelling on self-served food portion size will be coded as being aware of the study aims. Responses will be independently coded by two researchers, with discrepancies in coding decisions resolved by a third researcher.\n\nCraig, C. L., Marshall, A. L., Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, M., Bauman, A.

Secondary analyses will be run in order to investigate the role of potential mediators to explain the relationship SEP-self-served energy. The measure of SEP used in our main analyses will be the highest educational qualification (binary variable: lower vs. higher) because previous research showed that people of higher education were more likely to use nutrition labels (Breck et al., 2014; Cowburn &amp; Stockley, 2008).\n\nLinear mixed effect models will be run in order to test the effect of the labels and of highest educational qualification on the self-served energy, with participants and dishes set as random effects to account for correlation between repeated measures by the same participant and across the different food items. The main model will test the effect of the labelling intervention (four levels: kcal labelling, PACE labelling, kcal and PACE labelling, no labelling), highest educational qualification (two levels: lower, higher) and the interaction between labelling intervention and highest educational qualification. If the interaction is significant, analyses will be stratified by highest educational qualification (lower and higher) and two linear mixed models will be fitted to examine the effect of the labelling intervention on self-served energy.\n\nIf there is a main effect of the labelling intervention in one of the above linear mixed models we will follow up this main effect by conducting the following pairwise comparisons:\n\n-\tSelf-served energy in each of the three labelling conditions compared to no labelling condition:\no\tNo labelling vs. kcal labelling\no\tNo labelling vs. PACE labelling\no\tNo labelling vs. kcal and PACE labelling combined\n\n-\tSelf-served energy in the combined labelling condition compared to single labelling conditions\no\tKcal and PACE labelling combined vs. kcal labelling\no\tKcal and PACE labelling combined vs. PACE labelling\n\n-\tSelf-served energy in one single labelling condition compared to the other single labelling condition:\no\tKcal labelling vs. PACE labelling\n\nWe will apply a Bonferroni correction to the level of significance based on the number of pairwise comparisons made (e.g., 12 comparisons: 0.05/12=0.004).\n\nSensitivity analyses\n\nWe will conduct sensitivity analyses to examine whether the pattern of results from the main analyses differ when:\n\n-\texcluding the aim guessers from the main analyses, or if more than 20% of participants guess the aim of the study, including an \u2018aim guessing\u2019 variable (two levels: yes, no) as a covariate in the main model;\n\n-\tsubstituting highest educational qualification by level of education (composite score) in the main model;\n\n-\tincluding hunger and liking as covariates in the main model as these two variables are likely to influence how much one serves oneself of a dish;\n\n-\texcluding any dish that is familiar to less than 50% of participants or that is scored &lt; 50 in liking on average (mid-way of the scale) to examine whether results are consistent when only well liked and familiar foods are used.\n\nWe will report whether sensitivity analyses result in deviations from the pattern of significance to the main analyses (i.e., any significant differences between conditions becoming not significant, and vice versa).\n\nSecondary analyses\n\nThe main analyses will be repeated using alternative measures of SEP to investigate whether different measures lead to the same pattern of results. Highest educational qualification will be substituted by 1/ equivalised income, and 2/ SSS.\n\nModerated mediation analyses\n\nWe will report and compare the measures of inhibition, working memory, healthiness and weight control motivation in food choices overall and for participants of lower vs. higher education level using means, standard deviations and t-tests.\n\nIf the main analyses suggest that highest educational qualification moderates the effect of labelling intervention (i.e., the labelling intervention*highest educational qualification is significant), moderated mediation analyses will be performed in order to explain the different effect of labelling intervention in participants of lower vs. higher education level. We will test as mediators the measures of inhibition, working memory, healthiness and weight control motivation in food choices only if we find individual differences on these measures between participants of lower and higher education level. Moderated mediation analyses will examine the extent to which they mediate the effect of highest educational qualification on self-served energy in each labelling condition (kcal labelling, PACE labelling, kcal and PACE labelling, no labelling).\n\nThe moderated mediation will be tested by estimating the conditional indirect effect of highest educational qualification through M for kcal labelling, PACE labelling, kcal and PACE labelling, no labelling conditions and testing the conditional indirect effect for those conditions using bias-corrected bootstrap. We will use the PROCESS macro (Model 15) on SAS version 9.3 that provides asymmetric bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals for inference about the conditional indirect effects using 5,000 bootstrap samples (Hayes, 2012). Moderated mediation will be tested by determining whether or not the confidence interval for the difference between conditional indirect effects for kcal labelling, PACE labelling, kcal and PACE labelling versus no labelling contains zero.\n\nBreck, A., Cantor, J., Martinez, O., &amp; Elbel, B.
