In this project, I will test the prediction that the antagonism (low agreeableness) factor of the Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality will account for the overwhelming majority of the variance in trait aggression (latent correlations &gt; .60).

FFM facets and their relations with different forms of antisocial behavior: An expanded meta-analysis. Journal of Criminal Justice, 57, 67-75.\n\nI ran an exploratory analysis on the data of 355 undergraduates who completed the Brief Aggression Questionnaire (BAQ) and the IPIP-NEO-120. This factor analysis modeled the latent correlations between trait aggression (indicated by the Physical Aggression, Verbal Aggression, Anger, and Hostility subscales) and all five FFM factors (each factor indicated by its six underlying facets), simultaneously. This model revealed that the antagonism facet of the FFM accounted for the overwhelming majority of the variance in trait aggression (latent r = .90), whereas the other four factors only accounted for a relatively small amount of variance in trait aggression (latent rs: conscientiousness = -.29, neuroticism = .22, extraversion = -.01, openness = -.03).\n\nI will now seek to confirm these analyses by replicating them in a combined dataset constructed from several existing laboratory studies on undergraduate participants who completed the 29-item Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire measure of trait aggression and the 44-item Big Five Inventory (7 studies, combined N = 893).\n\nI will use the lavaan package for R to run factor analyses for each FFM facet using the following design:\n\nLatentCorr.mod &lt;- 'BPAQtotal =~ BPAQphysical + BPASverbal + BPAQanger + BPAQhostility\nBFIagreeableness =~ BFI.2 +  BFI.7 +  BFI.12 +  BFI.17 +  BFI.22 +  BFI.27 +  BFI.32 +  BFI.37 +  BFI.42\nBFIconscientious =~ BFI.3 +  BFI.8 +  BFI.13 +  BFI.18 +  BFI.23 +  BFI.28 +  BFI.33 +  BFI.38 +  BFI.43\nBFIextraversion =~ BFI.1 +  BFI.6 +  BFI.11 +  BFI.16 +  BFI.21 +  BFI.26 +  BFI.31 +  BFI.36\nBFIneuroticism =~ BFI.4 +  BFI.9 +  BFI.14 +  BFI.19 +  BFI.24 +  BFI.29 +  BFI.34 +  BFI.39\nBFIopenness =~ BFI.5 +  BFI.10 +  BFI.15 +  BFI.20 +  BFI.25 +  BFI.30 +  BFI.35 +  BFI.40 +  BFI.41 + BFI.44'\n\nfitmod &lt;- cfa(LatentCorr.mod, data=[Dataset], missing='ML')\n\nsummary(fitmod, fit.measures=TRUE, standardized = TRUE)\n\nI will then report the standardized latent correlations for each FFM factor. I will interpret that my hypotheses if the latent correlation between trait aggression and agreeableness is more negative than -.60, and if the latent correlations between trait aggression and the four other FFM factors are &lt; |.60|.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-05T20:00:10.556183", "date_modified": "2020-04-02T09:45:59.960477", "registration":

To test this, we will examine if a five-factor model, in which PMB, HS, BS, HM, and BM form separate dimensions, fits the data better than alternate (e.g., one-factor and three-factor) models.  \n\nHypothesis 2b: A five-factor gender beliefs model \u2013 in which PMB, HS, BS, HM, and BM form separate dimensions \u2013 will demonstrate metric isomorphism across the individual and country levels.

Thus, countries with more patriarchal social structures and larger gaps between women\u2019s and men\u2019s access to power and resources (higher GGGIs) will also score higher in beliefs that manhood is precarious (PMB).

That is, PMB will manifest as the same latent construct at both the individual and country levels.  \n\nRationale: Isomorphism refers to the similarity of a latent construct\u2019s statistical properties (i.e., measurement invariance) across levels of data (in this case, individual-level and country-level).  When a scale demonstrates metric isomorphism, this means that the latent construct under investigation is similar in measurement and meaning at both the individual and country levels.  Demonstrating the isomorphism of PMB allows researchers to use the country-level latent PMB factor score as an indicator of a property that is attributable to that nation or culture.  Thus, establishing the isomorphism of the PMB will allow examinations of the universality of precarious manhood beliefs, as well as links of PMB with other country-level variables.\n\nHypothesis 2a: PMB constitutes a unique cultural belief about manhood that is not redundant with hostility and benevolence toward women or men.  To test this, we will examine if a five-factor model, in which PMB, HS, BS, HM, and BM form separate dimensions, fits the data better than alternate models (e.g., one-factor and three-factor models).  \n\nHypothesis 2b: A five-factor gender beliefs model \u2013 in which PMB, HS, BS, HM, and BM form separate dimensions \u2013 will demonstrate metric isomorphism across the individual and country levels.  To test this, we will use a multilevel confirmatory factor analysis approach.  \n\nHypothesis 2c: PMB correlates significantly and moderately positively with HS, BS, HM, and BM (controlling for age and gender distribution, which vary across samples).  Thus, countries (and individuals) higher in beliefs that manhood is precarious should also score higher in hostility and benevolence toward women and men, and these associations will emerge when other relevant third variables are controlled.\n\nRationale: Cross-cultural studies indicate that ambivalent (hostile and benevolent) ideologies about women and men emerge from and reflect universal aspects of gender relations (status differences, sex-based labor divisions, and heterosexual interdependence).  Thus, demonstrating unique associations of PMB with HS, BS, HM, and BM, will indicate that beliefs about precarious manhood constitute a universal understanding of the male gender role that overlaps with, but is distinct from, these other widespread gender ideologies. \n\nHypothesis 3a: PMB will correlate significantly and positively with country-level gender inequality (the GGGI), even when controlling for HS, BS, HM, and BM.  Thus, countries with more patriarchal social structures and larger gaps between women\u2019s and men\u2019s access to power and resources (higher GGGIs) will also score higher in beliefs that manhood is precarious (PMB).  This effect should persist when controlling for other gender-relevant ideologies (HS, BS, HM, BM).\n\nHypothesis 3b: PMB will correlate significantly and negatively with country-level human development (the HDI), even when controlling for HS, BS, HM, and BM (see Figure 1, in \"PM isomorphism and HDI.docx\").  Thus, more developed countries (higher life expectancy, more access to education, and more economic growth, which combine to form higher HDI) will score lower in beliefs that manhood is precarious (PMB).  This effect should persist when controlling for other gender-relevant ideologies (HS, BS, HM, BM).\n\nRationale: The GGGI reveals country-level gaps between women\u2019s and men\u2019s educational attainment, economic and political power, and health.  Countries with larger GGGIs tend to have more patriarchal social structures and traditional sex-based labor divisions, with men as the primary (higher status) economic providers and protectors, and women as the primary (lower status) homemakers and caretakers.  The HDI reveals country-level human potential in terms of life expectancy, access to education, and economic growth.  Countries with larger HDIs tend to allow their citizens more freedom to be and do desirable things, granting individuals more autonomy and control over their lives and outcomes.  Precarious manhood beliefs reflect cultural socialization practices that encourage boys and men to demonstrate willingness to risk their lives to protect and provide for family and ingroup.  Thus, these analyses will demonstrate that countries with higher gender inequality endorse PMB more strongly, while countries with higher human development endorse PMB less strongly (even when controlling for HS, BS, HM, and BM)."}, "question6a": {"extra": [], "value": "Not applicable"}}}, "confirmatory-analyses-first": {"value": {"first": {"value": {"question1c": {"extra": [], "value": "Latent variables: Precarious Manhood Beliefs (PMB; 4 items; Vandello et al., 2008).

To test this, we will examine if a five-factor model, in which PMB, HS, BS, HM, and BM form separate dimensions, fits the data better than alternate (e.g., one-factor and three-factor) models.  \n\nHypothesis 2b: A five-factor gender beliefs model \u2013 in which PMB, HS, BS, HM, and BM form separate dimensions \u2013 will demonstrate metric isomorphism across the individual and country levels.  To test this, we will use a multilevel confirmatory factor analysis approach.  \n\nHypothesis 2c: PMB correlates significantly and moderately positively with HS, BS, HM, and BM (controlling for age and gender distribution, which vary across samples).

However, due to the high association of GGGI and HDI, we will analyze their associations with PMB in separate models; hence, we divide H3 into two sub-hypotheses.\n\nHypothesis 3a: PMB will correlate significantly and positively with country-level gender inequality (the GGGI), even when controlling for HS, BS, HM, and BM.  Thus, countries with more patriarchal social structures and larger gaps between women\u2019s and men\u2019s access to power and resources (higher GGGIs) will also score higher in beliefs that manhood is precarious (PMB).

That is, PMB will manifest as the same latent construct at both the individual and country levels.  \n\nRationale: Isomorphism refers to the similarity of a latent construct\u2019s statistical properties (i.e., measurement invariance) across levels of data (in this case, individual-level and country-level).  When a scale demonstrates metric isomorphism, this means that the latent construct under investigation is similar in measurement and meaning at both the individual and country levels.  Demonstrating the isomorphism of PMB allows researchers to use the country-level latent PMB factor score as an indicator of a property that is attributable to that nation or culture.  Thus, establishing the isomorphism of the PMB will allow examinations of the universality of precarious manhood beliefs, as well as links of PMB with other country-level variables.\n\nHypothesis 2a: PMB constitutes a unique cultural belief about manhood that is not redundant with hostility and benevolence toward women or men.  To test this, we will examine if a five-factor model, in which PMB, HS, BS, HM, and BM form separate dimensions, fits the data better than alternate models (e.g., one-factor and three-factor models).  \n\nHypothesis 2b: A five-factor gender beliefs model \u2013 in which PMB, HS, BS, HM, and BM form separate dimensions \u2013 will demonstrate metric isomorphism across the individual and country levels.  To test this, we will use a multilevel confirmatory factor analysis approach.  \n\nHypothesis 2c: PMB correlates significantly and moderately positively with HS, BS, HM, and BM (controlling for age and gender distribution, which vary across samples).  Thus, countries (and individuals) higher in beliefs that manhood is precarious should also score higher in hostility and benevolence toward women and men, and these associations will emerge when other relevant third variables are controlled.\n\nRationale: Cross-cultural studies indicate that ambivalent (hostile and benevolent) ideologies about women and men emerge from and reflect universal aspects of gender relations (status differences, sex-based labor divisions, and heterosexual interdependence).  Thus, demonstrating unique associations of PMB with HS, BS, HM, and BM, will indicate that beliefs about precarious manhood constitute a universal understanding of the male gender role that overlaps with, but is distinct from, these other widespread gender ideologies. \n\nHypothesis 3a: PMB will correlate significantly and positively with country-level gender inequality (the GGGI), even when controlling for HS, BS, HM, and BM.  Thus, countries with more patriarchal social structures and larger gaps between women\u2019s and men\u2019s access to power and resources (higher GGGIs) will also score higher in beliefs that manhood is precarious (PMB).  This effect should persist when controlling for other gender-relevant ideologies (HS, BS, HM, BM).\n\nHypothesis 3b: PMB will correlate significantly and negatively with country-level human development (the HDI), even when controlling for HS, BS, HM, and BM (see Figure 1, in \"PM isomorphism and HDI.docx\").  Thus, more developed countries (higher life expectancy, more access to education, and more economic growth, which combine to form higher HDI) will score lower in beliefs that manhood is precarious (PMB).  This effect should persist when controlling for other gender-relevant ideologies (HS, BS, HM, BM).\n\nRationale: The GGGI reveals country-level gaps between women\u2019s and men\u2019s educational attainment, economic and political power, and health.  Countries with larger GGGIs tend to have more patriarchal social structures and traditional sex-based labor divisions, with men as the primary (higher status) economic providers and protectors, and women as the primary (lower status) homemakers and caretakers.  The HDI reveals country-level human potential in terms of life expectancy, access to education, and economic growth.  Countries with larger HDIs tend to allow their citizens more freedom to be and do desirable things, granting individuals more autonomy and control over their lives and outcomes.  Precarious manhood beliefs reflect cultural socialization practices that encourage boys and men to demonstrate willingness to risk their lives to protect and provide for family and ingroup.  Thus, these analyses will demonstrate that countries with higher gender inequality endorse PMB more strongly, while countries with higher human development endorse PMB less strongly (even when controlling for HS, BS, HM, and BM).", "recommended-hypothesis.question6a": "Not applicable", "description-methods.design.question2a": "Not applicable", "description-methods.design.question2b": "Precarious Manhood Beliefs (PMB; 4 items; Vandello, Bosson, Cohen, Burnaford, &amp; Weaver, 2008).  \na.\tBetween-participants\nb.\tNested \u2013 individual responses nested within countries\n\nAmbivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI; 6 items; Glick &amp; Whitehead, 2010; Rollero, Glick, &amp; Tartaglia, 2014).

outcomes by (1) excluding studies with follow-up less than 1 year, (2) excluding trials published before 2015, (3) using fixed-effect models, (4) excluding trials with fewer than 200 patients, and (5) excluding trials with high risk of bias.\n", "q17.uploader": []}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecaaaa", "text": "Medicine and Health Sciences"}]]}, "relationships": {"license": {"links":
