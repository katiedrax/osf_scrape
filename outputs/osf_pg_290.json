related to their child\u2019s ASD diagnosis, there is a gap in the literature examining which aspects of the disorder are related to their stress, and whether there are differences for mothers and fathers. Fathers have been greatly underrepresented in the research literature, specifically regarding the role that their child\u2019s ASD diagnosis plays in their mental health and in their daily lives in general, which is why my study will be including fathers, in addition to mothers, of children with ASD in examining this relationship. \nResearchers have also found that there is a greater need of support for parents of children with ASD. In general, a lot of the research surrounding support for these parents has focused on how it would be helpful for mothers (Zaidman-Zait et al., 2017).  There is limited research that has addressed the idea of whether this would be beneficial for fathers as well. Therefore, my study will make it a point to include fathers and examine and assess the perceptions and satisfaction of feeling supported and understood for both parents. "}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "The first goal of the current study will be to examine and compare overall differences in parent stress between the sample populations (mothers and fathers). Consistent with previous literature, it is hypothesized that mothers will report greater overall parent stress compared to fathers. The second goal of the study will be to determine whether ASD symptom severity and related behavior problems are predictive of parent stress. This goal is simply exploratory in nature to see which aspects of the variables of interest are predicting stress for mothers and fathers, therefore there are no hypotheses regarding this relationship. The third goal of this study is to examine whether there is a difference in the influence of predictors on parent stress between the two sample populations. Based on previous literature, it is expected that there will be a difference in the influence of predictors on parent stress between mothers and fathers. It is hypothesized that, specifically, the child\u2019s behavior problems will be a significant predictor of increased stress levels for mothers, whereas ASD symptom severity will be a significant predictor of stress for fathers. The final goal of the study will be to examine perceptions of support and feelings of being misunderstood by collecting qualitative data through the use of a series of open-ended questions.

They need to be a parent of a child who has been diagnosed with ASD. At the time of the survey completion, their child will have had to be diagnosed within the last 8-10 months. The child needs to also be between the ages of 3-5 years old. Parents whose spouse/partner has already participated in the study may not participate. This study will be entirely online in the form of an online survey through Qualtrics. The flyers that will be sent out to clinics as well as via the Facebook ad will include a description of the study as well as a link to Qualtrics where they will be able to participate in the study. Once participants are directed to Qualtrics, there will be a pre-screening questionnaire asking about the child\u2019s age, whether they have a formal diagnosis of ASD, and if they do have a formal diagnosis, parents should state when the diagnosis was given. There will also be a question regarding whether or not the individual\u2019s spouse/partner who is the child\u2019s other parent has already participated in the study.

Fathers have been greatly underrepresented in the research literature, specifically regarding the role that their child\u2019s ASD diagnosis plays in their mental health and in their daily lives in general, which is why my study will be including fathers, in addition to mothers, of children with ASD in examining this relationship. \nResearchers have also found that there is a greater need of support for parents of children with ASD. In general, a lot of the research surrounding support for these parents has focused on how it would be helpful for mothers (Zaidman-Zait et al., 2017).

Police and military personnel potentially face high rates of trauma exposure, increasing the risk of mental health problems, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Kessler et al., 2017; Skogstad et al., 2013). Though there is expansive research on PTSD in military personnel, it has rarely been studied in police officers, and the level of PTSD across these two groups has not been directly compared. \n\nThere are higher levels of alcohol consumption in the UK Armed Forces compared to the general population (Fear et al., 2007), which may relate to the uniquely high levels of trauma exposure, as several studies have demonstrated the relationship between PTSD and alcohol problems (Conway, Swendsen, Husky, He, &amp; Merikangas, 2016; Debell et al., 2014; Grant et al., 2015; Kessler et al., 1997). Given the occupational similarities, it may be expected that there are comparable levels of alcohol consumption in UK police personnel. However, no study has compared alcohol consumption in a sample of UK Armed Forces and UK police forces. \n\nThe Airwave Health Monitoring Study was originally developed to explore the possible physical health impacts of a new communication system (TETRA), collecting data between June 2006 and 2015, in &gt; 40,000 police personnel.

Police and military personnel potentially face high rates of trauma exposure, increasing the risk of mental health problems, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Kessler et al., 2017; Skogstad et al., 2013). Though there is expansive research on PTSD in military personnel, it has rarely been studied in police officers, and the level of PTSD across these two groups has not been directly compared. \n\nThere are higher levels of alcohol consumption in the UK Armed Forces compared to the general population (Fear et al., 2007), which may relate to the uniquely high levels of trauma exposure, as several studies have demonstrated the relationship between PTSD and alcohol problems (Conway, Swendsen, Husky, He, &amp; Merikangas, 2016; Debell et al., 2014; Grant et al., 2015; Kessler et al., 1997). Given the occupational similarities, it may be expected that there are comparable levels of alcohol consumption in UK police personnel.

The variables of interest have not been explored in the male-only samples for either datasets. \n\nPrior research activity\nI have used this dataset before, including at least some of the variables and measures in this study. However, all analyses were on a mutually exclusive subset (e.g. different participants or different waves) of the dataset.\n\nPrior knowledge current dataset\nI am aware of descriptive statistics for the variables of interest for a subset of data for both the police and military samples. However, there is no existing research showing a comparison of these variables across the two datasets. \n\nMoment of pre-registration \nRegistration after data cleaning, but before any main analyses. \n", "q13": "Police personnel: Airwave Health Monitoring Study includes data on mental health for 41,038 police officers and staff, but only 40,299 participants were eligible for inclusion in the study based on their \u2018role\u2019 description. Data was collected between June 2006 and 2015.\n\nMilitary personnel: KCMHR health and well-being cohort study includes a total of 15,736 individual participants. Data was collected in three waves namely phase 1 (June 2004- March 2006), phase 2 (Nov 2007 \u2013 September 2009) and phase 3 (October 2014 \u2013 December 2016).\n\nAll male participants (all of which are current police employees) of the Airwave Study are eligible for inclusion in this comparative study, except those whose data was collected in 2006 (n = 1,573), as this version of the protocol did not include the post-traumatic stress items (final n = 25,399). \n\nWith regards to the health and well-being cohort study, only serving male regular military personnel are eligible for inclusion. To make the samples more comparable, we will only include phase 2 and phase 3 data from the health and well-being cohort study, as this is within a similar timeframe to the Airwave Study data collection (conducted from January 2007 to December 2015). \n\nComplete case analysis will be used. Participants from both samples will only be included in the comparison study if they have no missing data on the outcomes of interest (e.g. mental health measures, alcohol use) or any of the entropy balancing variables. \n\nOnly male participants are being included in this analysis, as the proportion of females is substantially higher in the Airwave sample and female members of both samples may be relatively unique with regards to the type of role they (can) hold and it is well established that females have higher rate of mental disorders. Therefore, we plan to repeat the outlined statistical analysis using female members of both samples, in a separate paper, following the completion of the present analysis, if the numbers are sufficient for complete case analysis. All variables will be treated the same for females, with the exception of the alcohol consumption categories, as the UK Chief Medical Officer guidelines state that above 35 units per week is considered high-risk drinking in females. \n", "q14": "Approximately 25,000 male police officers and staff will be retained for analyses purposes, along with approximately 7,000 eligible male military personnel, who provide data on at least one of the outcome variables.

Such areas will also be where parents/primary caregivers can reasonably access the Udon Thani Regional Hospital and the two Health Promotion Hospitals.\n\nParticipant recruitment\n\nParticipant recruitment will utilize targeted sampling in order to identify the parents and primary caregivers of young children who are at particular risk of perpetrating child physical and emotional abuse, as well as those children who are at risk of experiencing such maltreatment by their parents/primary caregivers or other adults. Sampling will take place within low-income communities within Udon Thani province, where families are more likely to experience multiple risk factors for child maltreatment, such as low-educational achievement, substance abuse, and high levels of stress [19, 20]. \n\nAs depicted in Figure 2, parents and primary caregivers will be identified through the local Health Promotion Hospitals, referrals from local teachers, and Village Health Volunteers working in the targeted geographic areas. These partners will identify and provide contact details of parents/primary caregivers who may benefit from parenting support to the Project Coordinator, who will coordinate with the project team to determine whether these parents/primary caregivers are interested in participating in the programme. There will be a rolling enrolment recruitment strategy, with recruitment efforts ending when 120 parents have been successfully contacted and enrolled following completion of the consent form. \n\nBenefits \n\nParticipants in the parenting programme will be reimbursed for transportation costs at a rate of 150 Thai Baht (approximately 3.46 GBP) per round-trip, as well as provided with meals and refreshments. In addition, for the purpose of encouraging retention, they will be provided with minor monetary compensation during each data collection point. No separate benefit will be provided to parents/primary caregivers for completion of the self-report satisfaction questionnaire.\n\nFor the purpose of the outcome evaluation, data collectors will visit participating parents/primary caregivers in their homes to administer the outcome questionnaire prior to the parenting programme, one month post-intervention, as well as three months post-intervention. Parents/primary caregivers will be provided with 150 Thai Baht (approximately 3.46 GBP) upon successfully completing the questionnaire at each data collection point: baseline, one-month post-intervention, and three-month post-intervention. Participants will also be administered an observational assessment at these three time points, for which they will be provided with 50 Thai Baht (approximately 1.15 GBP) at each point. Further, on five occasions (at baseline, one month post-baseline, two months post-baseline, three months post-baseline, and six months post-baseline), participating parents/primary caregivers will be provided with 50 Thai Baht (approximately 0.69 GBP) for the successful completion of each Parent Daily Report."}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Study Protocol - PLH Thailand RCT_2020_02_19_OSF.docx"}, "nodeId": "b24dh", "sha256": "2bed730663085fe5ea790a7d6375f4a5698682953a6a464949c1f9a7609e11e7", "viewUrl": "/project/nvqe3/files/osfstorage/5e4d4b9eb8c2e501524c59bd/", "selectedFileName": "Study Protocol - PLH Thailand RCT_2020_02_19_OSF.docx"}], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "Our target sample size is 120 participants.

The Facilitator Manual describes each session activity with detailed explanations and handouts for participants. During programme delivery, facilitators will receive weekly supervision from the trained coaches, with additional support from the Master Trainer and Local Trainer.\n\nDuring the RCT, the 60 parents/primary caregivers in the intervention group will be divided into four groups of 15 participants, with each group overseen by 2 facilitators (one nurse practitioners and one Village Health Volunteer, or one social worker and one Village Health Volunteer) who are supervised and supported by PLH coaches. \n\nContent for the adapted PLH for Young Children Thailand programme was finalised after examining results from the preceding feasibility pilot study. This included the following: 1) spending quality time with children; 2) describing children\u2019s actions and feelings for cognitive development and socio-emotional awareness; 3) using praise and rewards to encourage positive behaviour; 4) establishing limits through effective instruction giving and consistent household rules and daily routines; 5) ignoring negative attention seeking behaviour, and demanding behaviour, 6) consequences for noncompliance and rule-breaking; and 7) mindfulness based stress reduction for caregivers. Core activities during sessions included discussion about assigned home activities, discussions regarding core parenting principles, illustrated stories, role-plays, and problem solving. Home visits will be conducted by facilitators to those parents/primary caregivers who miss sessions or require additional support, and SMS/LINE messages will be delivered to all participants twice per week with relevant parenting tips and reminders to attend the upcoming session. The research team may take group photos during the delivery of the parenting programme for publication and training purposes.

The delivery of services at Parent Schools are guided by the Ministry of Public Health Handbook for Parent Schools, which appear to be open to adaptation at the local level. At Parent Schools, three to five sessions are provided to parents in groups or one-on-one by hospital health personnel. At baseline, one month post-intervention, and three months follow-up, the research team will monitor the services accessed by participants from both the intervention and control groups through an additional item in the outcome evaluation questionnaire. The item will ask whether they have \u201creceived any information from or participated in any other activity by a hospital, clinic, teacher, social worker, community worker, Village Health Volunteer, or NGO worker on parenting or child care\u201d within the past three months.

Standardized measurements, multiple sources (such as self-reports by parents/primary caregivers and direct observations of child-parent/primary caregiver interactions by trained data collectors), and standard timeframe of events or practices over the \u2018past month\u2019 will be used to strengthen study validity and identify potential changes in behaviour due to the intervention. All measures will be translated into Thai and back-translated to check the accuracy of the translation.\n\nHousehold and family factors\n\nThe following household and family factors will be assessed at baseline only:\n\na)\tParent/primary caregiver, child, family and household demographics\nDemographic factors to be measured include general questions as well as items from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) Round 5 implemented in Thailand in 2015-2016 (24 items total) [27]. MICS is a household survey programme that has been conducted in over 100 countries worldwide, and allows for the collection and analysis of internationally comparable estimates of about 130 indicators to assess the situation of children, women, and men.  The general questions and MICS items include: 1) parent/primary caregiver factors (12 items): age, sex, gender, language, ethnicity, citizenship, religion, relationship to head of household, marital status, education, and literacy level; 2) child relationship factors (4 items): staying with child at least 4 nights per week for past 3 months, relationship with target child, and number of children in his/her care; 3) child factors (3 items): age, sex, school enrolment and attendance; 4) family factors (3 items): other caregivers (sex, age, relationship to child, residence), and biological parents (household presence, location); 5) household factors (2 items): number of other adults in the household, and number of other children in the household. \n\nb)\tParent/primary caregiver physical health\n\nParent/primary caregiver physical health will be assessed using an adapted version of the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12, 3 items) [28]. The SF-12 is an adapted version of the MOS SF-34 Health Survey and examines physical and mental health, with items including difficulty in moderate daily activities, such as cleaning the house and carrying a child. Response options are based on a 3-point Likert-like scale (1 = yes, limited a lot; 3 = no, not limited at all). An additional item requires respondents to assess their overall health on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = poor; 5 = excellent).\n\nc)\tParent/primary caregiver and child disability \n\nParent/primary caregiver and child disability will be assessed using two items adapted from the Washington Group short set of questions, which has been used in censuses and surveys according to the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics [29]. These questions ask whether the parent/primary caregiver or child has any difficulties \u201chearing, seeing, communicating, or moving,\u201d and if so, what type of difficulty they have.\n\nd)\tParental/primary caregiver history of experiencing child abuse\n\nParental/primary caregiver history of experiencing child maltreatment will be measured through an adapted version of the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (ISPCAN) Child Abuse Screening Tools Retrospective version (ICAST-R) (4 items) [30].  This scale utilizes parental self-reports of maltreatment experiences during childhood (until age 18 years) to assess the history of ever experiencing physical abuse (e.g., \u201cWhen you were growing up (before age 18), did your caregiver ever discipline or punish you physically by hitting, spanking, slapping, kicking, or shaking you?\u201d) (2 items) and emotional abuse (e.g., When you were growing up (before age 18) did any person ever discipline or punish you by insulting or criticizing you, to make you feel that you were bad, stupid or worthless?\u201d) (2 items). In this study, ever experiencing physical abuse or emotional abuse will be assessed on a frequency scale (0 = Never; 1 = Once or twice; 2 = 3-5 times; 3 = More than 5 times). There will also be a dichotomous score for overall indication of previous child abuse (0 = no abuse; 1 = previous abuse). \n\ne)\tAttitudes toward punishment at baseline (self-report)\n\nAttitudes toward punishment will be assessed using one item from the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 5 Child Discipline module [27]. The MICS item asks the parent/primary caregiver: \u201cIn order to bring up, raise up, or educate a child properly, the child needs to be physically punished.\u201d Parents/primary caregivers will report whether they disagree or agree with the statement based on a 5-point Likert scale of 0 to 4 (0 = Disagree strongly; 4 = Agree strongly). \n\nC.12.2. Socioeconomic factors\n\nThe socioeconomic factors regarding household structure, employment, household assets, and food consumption will assist in assessing relative poverty and living standards beyond direct measures of poverty by income [31]. These factors will be assessed at baseline only:\n\na)\tHousehold structure\n\nAssessments of relative poverty according to household structure will utilize items from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 5 conducted in Thailand in 2015-2016 (3 items) [27]. The items allow for categorical responses regarding the main materials used in the household\u2019s floor, roof, and exterior walls.\n\nb)\tHousehold employment\n\nEmployment will be measured utilizing the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 5 conducted in Thailand in 2015-2016 (2 items) [27]. One item regarding the type of employment held by the parent/primary caregiver will allow for categorical responses, while another item concerning whether anyone else in the household holds a job will be scored using dichotomous variables.\n\nc)\tHousehold income and benefits\n\nInformation regarding household income and benefits will be assessed using three items from the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 5 conducted in Thailand in 2015-2016 [27], and the 2015 Thailand National Statistical Office Household Socioeconomic Survey (NSO HHSE) [32]. The two MICS items examine the total income of all members of the household and the main source of income for the household, while the NSO HHSE item assesses whether anyone in the household receives government income or benefits.\n\nd)\tHousehold assets\n\nAssessments of relative poverty according to ownership of parent/primary caregiver and household assets will utilize the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 5 conducted in Thailand in 2015-2016 (2 items) [27]. These items allow for categorical responses concerning the collective household ownership of particular goods, as well as the ownership of assets by any member of the household.\n\ne)\tFood consumption\n\nAssessments of relative poverty according to food consumption will utilize five items from the Hunger Scale Questionnaire [33], which examines household food shortage and hunger. Parents/primary caregivers respond positively or negatively regarding whether money was sufficient for food, meals were reduced/skipped, or children went to bed hungry over the past 30 days and whether it occurred more often than 5 times. The scale provides scores for single occurrence as well as intensity of hunger by summing the items. \n\nf)\tHealth care coverage\n\nInformation concerning parent/primary caregiver health care coverage will be assessed using one item based on response options drawn from the 2015 National Statistical Office Household Socioeconomic Survey. The item examines whether the respondent has health care coverage, and if so, what type of coverage [32].\n\nPrimary outcome\n\nThe primary outcome to be assessed during the outcome evaluation is child maltreatment (physical and emotional abuse) perpetrated by parents/primary caregivers, which will be assessed through both parental self-report as well as observational measures. The addition of observational coding allows for an independent view of parent-child interactions that is less subject to bias than parent self-reports, which are more readily influenced by the parental moods, poor parental mental health, or expectations regarding the intervention [34] [35]. \n\nf)\tChild maltreatment: physical and emotional abuse (self-report)\n\nPhysical abuse (including abusive discipline) and emotional abuse will be measured using 20 items from an adapted and expanded version of the ISPCAN Child Abuse Screening Tool-Trial Caregiver version (ICAST-T). The ICAST-T is an adaptation of the multi-national and consensus-based survey instrument ICAST-Parent version (ICAST-P), which has been used successfully in low and middle-income countries [36]. The ICAST-T measures parental reports of the incidence of abuse perpetrated against their child over the past month using a frequency score on a scale of 0 to 7, or 8 or more times (e.g., \u201cIn the past 4 weeks, how often did you discipline [Child Nickname] by pushing, grabbing, or kicking him/her?\u201d). This study will assess the frequency of child maltreatment for physical abuse (13 items), emotional abuse (7 items), as well as an overall frequency of child abuse in the previous month by summing the subscales.  We will also assess the incidence of overall abuse as well as for each individual subscale (0 = no abuse; 1 = previous abuse).\n\ng)\tChild maltreatment (combination interview and observational assessment)\n\nChild maltreatment (physical and emotional abuse) will also be measured through an adapted, combination interview and observational assessment tool: The Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) Inventory \u2013 Abusive Harsh Parenting subscale (known as \u2018Acceptance\u2019 subscale) [37]. The original HOME Early Childhood and Middle Childhood Inventory Forms was finalised by the Parenting Experts Working Group during the formative evaluation. The HOME Abusive and Harsh Parenting subscale contains six items that utilise dichotomous scoring, with two items assessed via interview in the home regarding whether the parent used physical punishment or yelled at the child during the past week, and four items assessed via observation regarding whether the parent scolded or yelled; used physical restraint; hit, slapped, spanked, or kicked; and pushed, pulled, or pinched the child during the home visit (score range: 0-6; high scores meaning more harsh parenting). \n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nSecondary outcomes assessed through the outcome evaluation include: positive parenting; dysfunctional parenting; parent sense of inefficacy; child monitoring and supervision; child neglect; parental depression, anxiety, and stress; child behaviour problems; attitudes toward punishment; child behaviour and parenting; parent-child relationships; and intimate partner violence. Parent-child relationships will be assessed through an instrument that incorporates an observational assessment (i.e., the HOME Inventory).\n\na)\tPositive parenting (self-report)\n\nPositive parenting behaviours will be assessed using the Parenting Young Children Scale (PARYC) (21 items) [38]. The PARYC measures the frequency of positive parenting (7 items), setting limits (7 items) and proactive parenting (7 items) by the parent/primary caregiver over the previous month on a 7-point Likert scale (0 = Never, 6 = Always). Positive parenting will be measured using such items as \u201cWere you able to invite (the target child) to play a game with you or share an enjoyable activity?\u201d and \u201cWere you able to reward (the target child) when he/she did something well or showed a new skill?\u201d Setting limits will be assessed through items such as \u201cWere you able to explain what you wanted (the target child) to do in clear and simple ways?\u201d and Were you able to set rules on (the target child\u2019s) behaviour that you were able to enforce?\u201d Items to assess proactive parenting include \u201cWere you able to plan ways to prevent problem behaviour [such as limiting contact with certain peers or not leaving (the target child) unsupervised while they are doing certain activities]?\u201d and \u201cWere you able to make a game out of everyday tasks (such as a daily chore) so (the target child) followed through?\u201d Items are summed to create a total positive parenting score (range from 0 to 126) as well as for each subscale (range from 0 to 42) with higher scores indicating more positive parenting behaviours.\n\nb) Dysfunctional parenting (self-report)\n\nDysfunctional parenting behaviour will be assessed using the Parenting Scale (PS) Overreactivity subscale (PS, 10 items), which examines parent attitudes and beliefs regarding authoritarian discipline [39]. PS responses are based on a 7-point Likert scale in which parents are presented with a situation and then are given two opposing responses at either side of the scale, with the mid-point representing neither one way or the other and the three points on either side of the mid-point representing \u201csometimes,\u201d \u201cgenerally,\u201d and \u201cvery often\u201d as one moves further out from the middle. One such item under this subscale is \u201cWhen my child misbehaves, I raise my voice or yell\u2026I speak to my child calmly.\u201d (7 = I raise my voice or yell; 1 = I speak to my child calmly.) Scoring for this subscale is computed by averaging the responses on these items with higher scores indicating more overreactive parenting behaviour (range from 1 to 7).\n\nh)\tChild monitoring and supervision (self-report)\n\nParental monitoring and supervision practices will be measured using an adapted version of the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ) Poor Monitoring/Supervision subscale (11 items) [40]. The APQ measures parenting characteristics that have been associated with disruptive behaviour disorders in school-age children, although it has also been used with preschool children [41]. The Poor Monitoring/Supervision subscale will be used to measure the frequency of negative parent monitoring and supervision practices over the past month through a 5-point Likert scale (0 = Never; 5 = Always, e.g., \u201cYour child stays out later than he/she is supposed to\u201d). We will also include an additional item assessing monitoring of social media use (e.g., \u201cYour child uses Facebook, LINE, other social media applications, YouTube or the Internet without being supervised by an adult\u201d). The items in the scale are summed to obtain a total scale score ranging from 0 to 55 with higher scores indicating less parental supervision.\n\ni)\tChild maltreatment: Neglect (self-report)\n\nChild neglect will be assessed using an adapted version of the ICAST-Trial Neglect subscale. This subscale has 6 items for assessing medical, physical, and educational neglect, including \u201cIn the past month, how often was [Child Nickname] not taken care of when sick or injured, even when you or another caregiver were able to do so and could afford it?\u201d and \u201cIn the past month, how often was [Child Nickname] not given a meal that he or she needed, even when you or another caregiver was able to afford it?\u201d Items are summed to obtain a total score ranging from 0 to 64 with higher scores indicating more neglect. We will also create an incidence of neglect in the past month (0 = no abuse; 1 = previous abuse).\n\nj)\tParental depression, anxiety, and stress (self-report)\n\nParental depression, anxiety, and stress will be assessed through the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale short form (DASS-21) (21 items) [42]. The DASS-21 will assess parent/primary caregiver depression and anxiety using a 4-point Likert scale [0= Never; 3 = Always] to measure the frequency of symptoms over the previous week. Items include statements such as \u201cI felt that I had nothing to look forward to.\u201d Total DASS scores range from 0 to 63, with subscales from 0 to 21. The recommended cut-offs that indicate severity of depression are 5-6 (mild), 7-10 (moderate), 11-13 (severe), and 14 and up (extremely severe), while cut-offs for anxiety are 4-5 (mild), 6-7 (moderate), 8-9 (severe), and 10 and up (extremely severe). Cut-offs for stress are 8-9 (mild), 10-12 (moderate), 13-16 for (severe), and 17 and up (extremely severe).\n\nk)\tChild behaviour problems (self-report)\n\nFor the purpose of assessing child behaviour problems by parent/primary caregiver self-report, the study will utilize the Eyberg Child Behaviour Inventory (ECBI) Intensity Scale and Problem Scale (36 items) [43]. The ECBI Intensity Scale has been used extensively in multiple countries to evaluate parenting programmes in RCTs [9, 44-46]. The Intensity Scale measures the frequency of child externalizing behaviours over the past month, using a 7-point Likert-like scale (1 = Never occurs; 7 = Always occurs; ranging 36 to 252) [43]. Relevant items include \u201cHow often does (the target child) refuse to obey until threatened with punishment\u201d and \u201cHow often does (the target child) have temper tantrums?\u201d The Problem Scale asks whether particular externalizing behaviours are currently a problem for the parent/primary caregiver (0 = No; 1 = Yes; ranging from 0 to 36). Both scales are summed to create a total Intensity Score and Problem Score, with clinical cut-off scores for disruptive behaviour problems suggested as 131 for the Intensity Score and 15 for the Problem Score in the USA; however, no Thai norms are available [47].\n\nl)\tAttitudes toward punishment (self-report)\n\nAttitudes toward punishment will be assessed using the ICAST Attitudes subscale that is based on a scenario which presents a series of options for disciplining a child with difficult behaviour (4 items: \u201chitting or spanking the child,\u201d \u201cnot allowing the child to go out and play with friends,\u201d \u201cshouting or shaming the child,\u201d or \u201cexplaining why the behaviour is wrong and discussing consequences\u201d). Parents report on how they perceive the effectiveness each response would be as a discipline strategy using a Likert scale from 1 (\u201cvery ineffective\u201d) to 5 (\u201cvery effective\u201d). The nonviolent discipline items are reversed resulting in a possible total sum score ranging from 4 to 20 with higher scores indicate more support of harsh punishment. The ICAST Attitudes subscale also originally included an additional item asking parents to indicate which strategy they believed would be the most effective but this was not used in the present study due to an administrative error during translation.\n\nm)\tParent sense of inefficacy (self-report)\n\nParent sense of inefficacy will be assessed using an adapted version of the ICAST-T Caregiver tool (mentioned above) Inefficacy subscale (2 items: e.g., \u201cIn the past month, how often did you not know what to do when your child misbehaved\u201d). The items are summed for a total score ranging from 0 to 16 with higher scores indicating a greater sense of inefficacy in managing difficult child behaviour.\n\nn)\tParent daily report on child behaviour and parenting (self-report)\nAn adapted version of the Parent Daily Report Checklist (PDR, 44 items) will be used to assess day-to-day occurrences of child behaviour problems and parenting behaviour [48]. The PDR is administered at five time points during the RCT: at baseline, one month post-baseline, two months post-baseline, three months post-baseline (i.e., during post-test assessment), and six months post-baseline (i.e., during follow-up assessment). This allows for the parent/primary caregiver to avoid challenges in recalling events over extended time periods and has been widely used in multiple contexts to assess changes in child and parent behaviours during the course of programme delivery [49, 50]. In order to assess child behaviour, the PDR asks parents/primary caregivers whether a child externalizing behaviour (e.g. destructiveness, lying, hitting others) occurred within the previous 24 hours (34 items), as well as how many hours of sleep the child had (1 item). To assess parenting behaviour, the PDR asks parents about their own behaviour (6 items, e.g. yelled or shouted at the child, praised child for doing something well) and self-efficacy (3 items, e.g. had a feeling that I could not cope with parenting). Responses to these items are dichotomous (0 = No; 1 = Yes), with items summed for each subscale on parent and child behaviour. Negative items on the parent subscales will be reversed so that total scores indicate more positive parenting behaviour as well as a total PDR parenting score ranging from 0 to 9. Total scores for child behaviour indicate more child behaviour problems in the past 24 hours ranging from 0 to 34. The item regarding sleep is a numerical response.\n\ni)\tParent-child relationships (combination interview and observational assessment)\n\nParent-child relationships will be measured through a combination of interview and observational items (26 27 in total), using the aforementioned combined and adapted version of the Early Childhood and Middle Childhood HOME Inventory record forms [51]. The adapted version contains 16 items on the \u201cresponsivity\u201d subscale, which describes the emotional and verbal sensitivity as well as responsivity of the parent to the child, such as \u201cparent holds child close 10-15 minutes per day\u201d and \u201cparent praises child\u2019s qualities twice during visit.\u201d It also contains 6 relevant items on the \u201cencouragement of maturity\u201d subscale, which describes the extent to which parents/primary caregivers expect the child to exhibit socially responsibility and maturity, and conform to family rules. Such items include \u201cparent/primary caregiver sets limits for child and generally enforces them,\u201d and \u201cfamily requires child to keep living and play area reasonably clean and straight.\u201d There are 2 items on the \u201cemotional climate\u201d subscale, which measures the extent to which the parent/primary caregiver can accept the target child\u2019s negative expressions of emotion, as well as how well the parent maintains emotional control. It includes \u201cparent/primary caregiver has not lost temper with child during previous week\u201d and \u201cchild can express negative feelings toward parents/primary caregiver without harsh reprisals.\u201d Finally, the form includes 2 items on the \u201cmodelling\u201d subscale, which measures modelling by the parent/primary caregiver of desirable and acceptable behaviour. These items include \u201cTV is used judiciously\u201d and \u201csome delay of food gratification is expected.\u201d The HOME Inventory is scored dichotomously based on whether each item was either observed or reported by the parent/caregiver during the course of the interview depending on the nature of the item. In addition to summing all 26 items to obtain a total positive parent-child relationships score, we will create sum scores for the Responsivity and Maturity subscales with higher scores indicating more positive relationships. \n\nj)\tIntimate partner violence (self-report)\n\nAdult self-report of experiencing intimate partner violence over the past month will be assessed using an adapted version of the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale Short Form (CTS2S, 8 items) [52]. This scale includes 2 items on the frequency of negotiation (e.g., \u201cpartner suggested a compromise for a disagreement\u201d), 5 items on physical assault (e.g., \u201cpartner pushed, shoved, or slapped me\u201d), and 1 item on psychological aggression (e.g., \u201cpartner insulted, shouted, yelled, or swore at me\u201d). Answers are coded on a frequency scale of 0 to 3 (0 = never happened; 1 = once or twice; 2 = 3-5 times; 3 = More than 5 times). The CTS2S will determine an overall indication of intimate partner violence on a level of severity (sum of negative items) and prevalence (dichotomous variable from negative items indicating experience of conflict or not), as well as for each subscale the Negotiation subscale. Only respondents who have been in a relationship in the past month will answer this scale.\n\nk)\tIntimate partner coercion (self-report)\n\nAdult self-report of experiencing intimate partner coercion over the past month will be assessed using items adapted from the WHO Multi-Country Study Questionnaire on Women\u2019s Health and Life and Domestic Violence against Women (WHO, 10 items) [53]. This scale includes 7 items on coercion and emotional violence (e.g., \u201cmy partner tried to keep me from seeing my friends\u201d and \u201cmy partner insisted on knowing where I was at all times\u201d), and 3 items on restriction of financial autonomy (e.g., \u201cmy partner took my earnings or savings from me against my will.\u201d) All answers are coded on a frequency scale of 0 to 3 (0 = never happened; 1 = once or twice; 2 = 3-5 times; 3 = more than 5 times). We will determine an overall indication of intimate partner violence on a level of severity (sum of items across both scales ranging from 0 to 30) and prevalence (dichotomous variable indicating experience of conflict or not), as well as for each subscale with higher scores indicating more intimate partner coercion. Only respondents who have been in a relationship in the past month will answer this scale.\n\nC.12.5. Process evaluation measurements\n\na)\tImplementation fidelity\n\nFidelity of programme implementation will be measured via self-report checklists by facilitators. The self-report checklist will gauge the level of adherence to the Facilitator Manual,and will include specific activities that the facilitator must deliver for each of the weekly sessions, such as home practice discussions and role-playing exercises. \n\nb)\tImplementation quality\n\nQuality of delivery will be assessed by coaches observing the delivery of programme sessions six and seven (two sessions per facilitator) using the Parenting for Lifelong Health Facilitator Assessment Tool (PLH-FAT). The PLH-FAT, similar to the Leader Observation Tool for the Incredible Years parenting programme, is an observational treatment fidelity tool used to assess the process skills necessary for delivery of the programme. It will examine whether and to what extent core intervention components have been delivered, including questions regarding topics touched on per session, such as home practice discussion and role-playing activities. Seven standard behaviour categories are grouped into two scales based on the core activities (23 items) and process skills (28 items) as outlined in the programme manual. Assessment of core activities includes quality of delivery during home activity review (14 items, e.g., \u201cidentify specific challenges when shared by at least one parent\u201d), illustrated story discussion (7 items, e.g., \u201cdiscuss possible solutions for negative stories\u201d), and practicing skills (10 items, e.g., \u201cdebrief with the participants about experience and feelings\u201d). Assessment of process skills includes modelling skills (6 items, e.g., \u201cgive positive, specific, and realistic instructions\u201d), collaborative facilitation approach (5 items, e.g., \u201caccept participant responses verbally by reflecting back what the participant says\u201d), encouragement of participation (7 items, e.g., \u201cparticipants appear comfortable and involved in session\u201d), and leadership skills (6 items, e.g., \u201cuse open-ended questions during group discussions\u201d). \n\nc)\tAdherence/exposure (parents/primary caregivers)\n\nFor the purpose of measuring adherence and exposure to the parenting programme, attendance registers will be kept for each weekly session in order to assess the level of exposure of participants to the intervention components. \n\nd)\tEngagement in home activities\n\nParticipant engagement in home activities will be measured through weekly participant self-reports of home activity completion, using parent home practice checklists. Participants will complete the forms on a daily basis following the first seven weekly sessions, and these will be collected by facilitators at the beginning of sessions two through eight and maintained in participant case profiles. The forms will indicate to what extent the participants were able to practice the home activities assigned during the previous week\u2019s session and in accordance with the intervention manual.

Generalised linear mixed-effects models will be used with appropriate link functions to estimate intervention effectiveness on primary and secondary outcomes. We will select the appropriate link function for the distribution of the data. If the scores are not normally distributed, generalised linear mixed models will be applied to allow for the outcome to follow a non-normal but parametric distribution using Poisson regression modelling.\n\nTesting theory of change\n\nIntervention research provides an opportunity to test theoretical mechanisms and causal processes related to the role of parenting programmes in reducing risk of child maltreatment [58]. As aforementioned, this study tests two hypothesised pathways of change. Firstly, improved parenting knowledge, skill and sense of competence will increase positive parenting and reduce maltreatment. Secondly, improving caregiver mental health, intimate partner violence, and child behaviour will also mediate reductions in risk of child maltreatment. Path analysis methods will examine these hypotheses based on the aforementioned secondary outcomes [59]. \n\nTesting interaction effects\n\nThe study will examine impact heterogeneity and moderation effects across population subgroups, including particularly disadvantaged groups [60]. Potential differences by subgroup population include caregiver/child gender, age, relationship to child, socioeconomic status, as well as ecological risk factors [61], such as severely economically deprived families [62], intimate partner violence, and prior experience of child abuse [63]. Additional moderators to be analysed include families with parental depression and/or children with existing behaviour problems [64]. Furthermore, the impact of parenting group variation will be examined quantitatively in statistical analyses of outcome measures. Site effects and site X treatment interactions will also be considered in analyses to investigate heterogeneity of effects over sites [65]. It should be cautioned, however, that these analyses will be treated as exploratory since this study is not powered to detect these interaction effects with precision.\n\nProcess evaluation\n\nImplementation fidelity will be analysed by examining data from the facilitator self-report checklists and the Parenting for Lifelong Health Facilitator Assessment Tool [67]. First, internal consistency with means and standard deviation per group for each measurement will be reported. Next, differences between methodological approaches in overall fidelity scores will be assessed with independent t-tests. This will help determine the reliability and consistency of using self-report versus observational assessments of fidelity. Then, in order to produce a basic level of fidelity, a ratio of program implementation to program design will be created for both self-report and observational scores [68]. According to Borrelli and colleagues, a standard of 80% programme fidelity will be considered as \u201chigh treatment fidelity\u201d [69]. In addition, this study will examine challenges in facilitating specific components or aspects of delivery quality. For instance, facilitators may have difficulty implementing a particular session activity or have difficulty practicing reflexive behaviour with participants. Combined with in-depth interviews on barriers to implementation, this may highlight the need for additional training and/or further adaptation of programme materials.  \n\nOverall programme exposure, adherence, and engagement will be assessed based on attendance registers and parent-report of activity checklists. Mean scores and standard deviations will be reported on attendance rates, completion rates, and activity engagement. In the previous delivery of the Sinovuyo Caring Families Programme from which the PLH for Young Children programme has been adapted, it has been recommended that parents participate in at least 66% or 8 sessions [70]. As a result, a similar standard will be used to determine an acceptable overall rate of programme attendance. This study will also report percentages of parents who participate in 50%, 25%, and 10% of the programme.\n\nMultivariate regression analyses will investigate possible associations between change in child maltreatment and secondary outcomes, and implementation fidelity (quality of delivery and content delivery). We will also examine attendance in the programme by using the Complier Average Causal Effect analyses that provides an estimate of causal effects, taking into account attendance (i.e., compliance) and other baseline predictors of attendance [71, 72]. These results will provide useful information on whether programme fidelity have a role in influencing programme effects. Significant R2 values will be reported to show the amount of variance each process indicator accounts in child behaviour problem change. In addition, beta weight values will determine the unit of change necessary to reduce child maltreatment frequency and secondary outcomes [73]. This will be particularly useful for improving the intervention protocols and training prior to further implementation and evaluation [74].\n\nCost effectiveness analysis\n\nIncremental cost effectiveness analyses (CEA) will be conducted from the payer's perspective (excluding participant costs) to assess whether the benefits of the PLH for Young Children programme appear to be worth the added costs. A statistically significant reduction in the ICAST-T overall score will reflect reductions in child maltreatment. Programme costs will be calculated using a micro-costing approach, multiplying resource use by unit costs. These will be divided into 1) start-up costs including costs required for coordinating recruitment, community mobilisation, and facilitator training; 2) programme delivery costs which includes staff-time, transportation, and other materials for home-based individual consultations, parent-group sessions, and supervision sessions; and 3) administrative costs to manage the implementation. \n\nWe will also model costs at scale on the regional level based on the assumptions that the programme will be delivered in a similar way as it was during the trial over three ways of delivery in one year by 168 facilitators and 28 supervisors to 252 groups of 20 parents per group with a total of 5,040 parents. Training will be a fixed cost delivered at the beginning of the year to all of the facilitators. In addition, costs for materials will be calculated without the purchase of illustrate story canvases, which will be replaced by a more cost-effective approach using the illustrated stories in the parent handbook. Material costs will also be shared across three waves of delivery. Transportation and food costs will also be removed from the scale-up model since these will not be provided by the Ministry of Public Health during normal delivery. Finally, we will take a conservative approach to modelling scale-up by including an additional 50% to the modelled costs similar to the cost-effectiveness analysis of the PLH for Teens programme in South Africa [66]. All costs will be incurred in Thai baht but will be presented in US dollars using the OECD average annual exchange rate for 2019. \n\nCost effectiveness will be based on the primary outcome of child maltreatment measured by the ICAST-T physical and emotional abuse subscales. The difference in probability of past-month abuse will be converted to an absolute number of incidents of abuse averted for the number of beneficiaries in the treatment group. We will then divide the total cost of the programme by this incident rate to provide an estimate of the cost per incident of physical or emotional abuse avoided. We will then transform the incidents of abuse averted score into DALYs averted by estimating disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to the different forms of child maltreatment as well as the best estimate of abuse incidence in Thailand. This will allow us to transform the cost-effectiveness ratio into an estimate of cost per DALY averted. For both estimates of cost-effectiveness, sensitivity analyses will be conducted to account for uncertainty around the effect size by using 95% CIs and for uncertainty around the costs of programme delivery at scale based on 50% uncertainty. We will also account for uncertainty in the transformation from child maltreatment incidence to cost per DALY gained by conducting sensitivity analysis which varies the estimate of past-year incidence by \u00b15% and the estimate of DALYs per case of abuse averted by \u00b120% in children\u2019s behavioural outcomes [66]. Bootstrapping techniques will be used to conduct uncertainty analyses to assess variability in our findings from potential sampling bias."}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Study Protocol - PLH Thailand RCT_2020_02_19_OSF.docx"}, "nodeId": "b24dh", "sha256": "2bed730663085fe5ea790a7d6375f4a5698682953a6a464949c1f9a7609e11e7", "viewUrl": "/project/nvqe3/files/osfstorage/5e4d4b9eb8c2e501524c59bd/", "selectedFileName": "Study Protocol - PLH Thailand RCT_2020_02_19_OSF.docx"}], "value": ""}}}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "We do not intend on conducting any transformations of the data."}, "q21": {"extra": [], "value": "The two-tailed significance value (p &lt; .05), means, standard deviations, standard errors, and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) will be reported.

The parenting programme will be delivered in Udon Thani. The communities chosen for participant recruitment will be primarily low-income communities, lying in peri-urban areas where UNICEF Thailand has been working with government partners to strengthen the delivery of social services. Such areas will also be where parents/primary caregivers can reasonably access the Udon Thani Regional Hospital and the two Health Promotion Hospitals.\n\nParticipant recruitment\n\nParticipant recruitment will utilize targeted sampling in order to identify the parents and primary caregivers of young children who are at particular risk of perpetrating child physical and emotional abuse, as well as those children who are at risk of experiencing such maltreatment by their parents/primary caregivers or other adults. Sampling will take place within low-income communities within Udon Thani province, where families are more likely to experience multiple risk factors for child maltreatment, such as low-educational achievement, substance abuse, and high levels of stress [19, 20]. \n\nAs depicted in Figure 2, parents and primary caregivers will be identified through the local Health Promotion Hospitals, referrals from local teachers, and Village Health Volunteers working in the targeted geographic areas. These partners will identify and provide contact details of parents/primary caregivers who may benefit from parenting support to the Project Coordinator, who will coordinate with the project team to determine whether these parents/primary caregivers are interested in participating in the programme. There will be a rolling enrolment recruitment strategy, with recruitment efforts ending when 120 parents have been successfully contacted and enrolled following completion of the consent form. \n\nBenefits \n\nParticipants in the parenting programme will be reimbursed for transportation costs at a rate of 150 Thai Baht (approximately 3.46 GBP) per round-trip, as well as provided with meals and refreshments. In addition, for the purpose of encouraging retention, they will be provided with minor monetary compensation during each data collection point. No separate benefit will be provided to parents/primary caregivers for completion of the self-report satisfaction questionnaire.\n\nFor the purpose of the outcome evaluation, data collectors will visit participating parents/primary caregivers in their homes to administer the outcome questionnaire prior to the parenting programme, one month post-intervention, as well as three months post-intervention. Parents/primary caregivers will be provided with 150 Thai Baht (approximately 3.46 GBP) upon successfully completing the questionnaire at each data collection point: baseline, one-month post-intervention, and three-month post-intervention. Participants will also be administered an observational assessment at these three time points, for which they will be provided with 50 Thai Baht (approximately 1.15 GBP) at each point. Further, on five occasions (at baseline, one month post-baseline, two months post-baseline, three months post-baseline, and six months post-baseline), participating parents/primary caregivers will be provided with 50 Thai Baht (approximately 0.69 GBP) for the successful completion of each Parent Daily Report.", "q12.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e4d4b9eb8c2e501524c59bd", "file_name": "Study Protocol - PLH Thailand RCT_2020_02_19_OSF.docx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/nvqe3/files/osfstorage/5e4d4b9eb8c2e501524c59bd", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e4d4b9eb8c2e501524c59bd"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "2bed730663085fe5ea790a7d6375f4a5698682953a6a464949c1f9a7609e11e7"}}], "q16.question": "Intervention: PLH for Young Children Thailand\n\nProgramme delivery\n\nTrained facilitators and coaches will deliver the programme over eight weekly sessions at our Health Promotion Hospitals in Udon Thani during the RCT. The Facilitator Manual describes each session activity with detailed explanations and handouts for participants. During programme delivery, facilitators will receive weekly supervision from the trained coaches, with additional support from the Master Trainer and Local Trainer.\n\nDuring the RCT, the 60 parents/primary caregivers in the intervention group will be divided into four groups of 15 participants, with each group overseen by 2 facilitators (one nurse practitioners and one Village Health Volunteer, or one social worker and one Village Health Volunteer) who are supervised and supported by PLH coaches. \n\nContent for the adapted PLH for Young Children Thailand programme was finalised after examining results from the preceding feasibility pilot study. This included the following: 1) spending quality time with children; 2) describing children\u2019s actions and feelings for cognitive development and socio-emotional awareness; 3) using praise and rewards to encourage positive behaviour; 4) establishing limits through effective instruction giving and consistent household rules and daily routines; 5) ignoring negative attention seeking behaviour, and demanding behaviour, 6) consequences for noncompliance and rule-breaking; and 7) mindfulness based stress reduction for caregivers. Core activities during sessions included discussion about assigned home activities, discussions regarding core parenting principles, illustrated stories, role-plays, and problem solving. Home visits will be conducted by facilitators to those parents/primary caregivers who miss sessions or require additional support, and SMS/LINE messages will be delivered to all participants twice per week with relevant parenting tips and reminders to attend the upcoming session. The research team may take group photos during the delivery of the parenting programme for publication and training purposes. Any individuals who do not provide consent for the use of photos will not be part of these images.\n\nControl condition\n\nThe control will be an inactive condition of standard care at the time of the intervention. \u2018Standard care\u2019 may include access to Parent Schools in Mother and Child Health clinics at public hospitals, which are provided in some provinces and districts in Thailand. The delivery of services at Parent Schools are guided by the Ministry of Public Health Handbook for Parent Schools, which appear to be open to adaptation at the local level. At Parent Schools, three to five sessions are provided to parents in groups or one-on-one by hospital health personnel. At baseline, one month post-intervention, and three months follow-up, the research team will monitor the services accessed by participants from both the intervention and control groups through an additional item in the outcome evaluation questionnaire. The item will ask whether they have \u201creceived any information from or participated in any other activity by a hospital, clinic, teacher, social worker, community worker, Village Health Volunteer, or NGO worker on parenting or child care\u201d within the past three months. Those participants who respond affirmatively will be asked about the frequency, source, type, and content of such information and/or activities.", "q16.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e4d4b9eb8c2e501524c59bd", "file_name": "Study Protocol - PLH Thailand RCT_2020_02_19_OSF.docx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/nvqe3/files/osfstorage/5e4d4b9eb8c2e501524c59bd", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e4d4b9eb8c2e501524c59bd"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "2bed730663085fe5ea790a7d6375f4a5698682953a6a464949c1f9a7609e11e7"}}], "q17.question": "Outcome measurements\n\nData collection during the RCT will take place at three time points: baseline, one-month post-intervention, and three months post-intervention. Standardized measurements, multiple sources (such as self-reports by parents/primary caregivers and direct observations of child-parent/primary caregiver interactions by trained data collectors), and standard timeframe of events or practices over the \u2018past month\u2019 will be used to strengthen study validity and identify potential changes in behaviour due to the intervention. All measures will be translated into Thai and back-translated to check the accuracy of the translation.\n\nHousehold and family factors\n\nThe following household and family factors will be assessed at baseline only:\n\na)\tParent/primary caregiver, child, family and household demographics\nDemographic factors to be measured include general questions as well as items from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) Round 5 implemented in Thailand in 2015-2016 (24 items total) [27]. MICS is a household survey programme that has been conducted in over 100 countries worldwide, and allows for the collection and analysis of internationally comparable estimates of about 130 indicators to assess the situation of children, women, and men.  The general questions and MICS items include: 1) parent/primary caregiver factors (12 items): age, sex, gender, language, ethnicity, citizenship, religion, relationship to head of household, marital status, education, and literacy level; 2) child relationship factors (4 items): staying with child at least 4 nights per week for past 3 months, relationship with target child, and number of children in his/her care; 3) child factors (3 items): age, sex, school enrolment and attendance; 4) family factors (3 items): other caregivers (sex, age, relationship to child, residence), and biological parents (household presence, location); 5) household factors (2 items): number of other adults in the household, and number of other children in the household. \n\nb)\tParent/primary caregiver physical health\n\nParent/primary caregiver physical health will be assessed using an adapted version of the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12, 3 items) [28]. The SF-12 is an adapted version of the MOS SF-34 Health Survey and examines physical and mental health, with items including difficulty in moderate daily activities, such as cleaning the house and carrying a child. Response options are based on a 3-point Likert-like scale (1 = yes, limited a lot; 3 = no, not limited at all). An additional item requires respondents to assess their overall health on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = poor; 5 = excellent).\n\nc)\tParent/primary caregiver and child disability \n\nParent/primary caregiver and child disability will be assessed using two items adapted from the Washington Group short set of questions, which has been used in censuses and surveys according to the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics [29]. These questions ask whether the parent/primary caregiver or child has any difficulties \u201chearing, seeing, communicating, or moving,\u201d and if so, what type of difficulty they have.\n\nd)\tParental/primary caregiver history of experiencing child abuse\n\nParental/primary caregiver history of experiencing child maltreatment will be measured through an adapted version of the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (ISPCAN) Child Abuse Screening Tools Retrospective version (ICAST-R) (4 items) [30].  This scale utilizes parental self-reports of maltreatment experiences during childhood (until age 18 years) to assess the history of ever experiencing physical abuse (e.g., \u201cWhen you were growing up (before age 18), did your caregiver ever discipline or punish you physically by hitting, spanking, slapping, kicking, or shaking you?\u201d) (2 items) and emotional abuse (e.g., When you were growing up (before age 18) did any person ever discipline or punish you by insulting or criticizing you, to make you feel that you were bad, stupid or worthless?\u201d) (2 items). In this study, ever experiencing physical abuse or emotional abuse will be assessed on a frequency scale (0 = Never; 1 = Once or twice; 2 = 3-5 times; 3 = More than 5 times). There will also be a dichotomous score for overall indication of previous child abuse (0 = no abuse; 1 = previous abuse). \n\ne)\tAttitudes toward punishment at baseline (self-report)\n\nAttitudes toward punishment will be assessed using one item from the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 5 Child Discipline module [27]. The MICS item asks the parent/primary caregiver: \u201cIn order to bring up, raise up, or educate a child properly, the child needs to be physically punished.\u201d Parents/primary caregivers will report whether they disagree or agree with the statement based on a 5-point Likert scale of 0 to 4 (0 = Disagree strongly; 4 = Agree strongly). \n\nC.12.2. Socioeconomic factors\n\nThe socioeconomic factors regarding household structure, employment, household assets, and food consumption will assist in assessing relative poverty and living standards beyond direct measures of poverty by income [31]. These factors will be assessed at baseline only:\n\na)\tHousehold structure\n\nAssessments of relative poverty according to household structure will utilize items from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 5 conducted in Thailand in 2015-2016 (3 items) [27]. The items allow for categorical responses regarding the main materials used in the household\u2019s floor, roof, and exterior walls.\n\nb)\tHousehold employment\n\nEmployment will be measured utilizing the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 5 conducted in Thailand in 2015-2016 (2 items) [27]. One item regarding the type of employment held by the parent/primary caregiver will allow for categorical responses, while another item concerning whether anyone else in the household holds a job will be scored using dichotomous variables.\n\nc)\tHousehold income and benefits\n\nInformation regarding household income and benefits will be assessed using three items from the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 5 conducted in Thailand in 2015-2016 [27], and the 2015 Thailand National Statistical Office Household Socioeconomic Survey (NSO HHSE) [32]. The two MICS items examine the total income of all members of the household and the main source of income for the household, while the NSO HHSE item assesses whether anyone in the household receives government income or benefits.\n\nd)\tHousehold assets\n\nAssessments of relative poverty according to ownership of parent/primary caregiver and household assets will utilize the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 5 conducted in Thailand in 2015-2016 (2 items) [27]. These items allow for categorical responses concerning the collective household ownership of particular goods, as well as the ownership of assets by any member of the household.\n\ne)\tFood consumption\n\nAssessments of relative poverty according to food consumption will utilize five items from the Hunger Scale Questionnaire [33], which examines household food shortage and hunger. Parents/primary caregivers respond positively or negatively regarding whether money was sufficient for food, meals were reduced/skipped, or children went to bed hungry over the past 30 days and whether it occurred more often than 5 times. The scale provides scores for single occurrence as well as intensity of hunger by summing the items. \n\nf)\tHealth care coverage\n\nInformation concerning parent/primary caregiver health care coverage will be assessed using one item based on response options drawn from the 2015 National Statistical Office Household Socioeconomic Survey. The item examines whether the respondent has health care coverage, and if so, what type of coverage [32].\n\nPrimary outcome\n\nThe primary outcome to be assessed during the outcome evaluation is child maltreatment (physical and emotional abuse) perpetrated by parents/primary caregivers, which will be assessed through both parental self-report as well as observational measures. The addition of observational coding allows for an independent view of parent-child interactions that is less subject to bias than parent self-reports, which are more readily influenced by the parental moods, poor parental mental health, or expectations regarding the intervention [34] [35]. \n\nf)\tChild maltreatment: physical and emotional abuse (self-report)\n\nPhysical abuse (including abusive discipline) and emotional abuse will be measured using 20 items from an adapted and expanded version of the ISPCAN Child Abuse Screening Tool-Trial Caregiver version (ICAST-T). The ICAST-T is an adaptation of the multi-national and consensus-based survey instrument ICAST-Parent version (ICAST-P), which has been used successfully in low and middle-income countries [36]. The ICAST-T measures parental reports of the incidence of abuse perpetrated against their child over the past month using a frequency score on a scale of 0 to 7, or 8 or more times (e.g., \u201cIn the past 4 weeks, how often did you discipline [Child Nickname] by pushing, grabbing, or kicking him/her?\u201d). This study will assess the frequency of child maltreatment for physical abuse (13 items), emotional abuse (7 items), as well as an overall frequency of child abuse in the previous month by summing the subscales.  We will also assess the incidence of overall abuse as well as for each individual subscale (0 = no abuse; 1 = previous abuse).\n\ng)\tChild maltreatment (combination interview and observational assessment)\n\nChild maltreatment (physical and emotional abuse) will also be measured through an adapted, combination interview and observational assessment tool: The Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) Inventory \u2013 Abusive Harsh Parenting subscale (known as \u2018Acceptance\u2019 subscale) [37]. The original HOME Early Childhood and Middle Childhood Inventory Forms was finalised by the Parenting Experts Working Group during the formative evaluation. The HOME Abusive and Harsh Parenting subscale contains six items that utilise dichotomous scoring, with two items assessed via interview in the home regarding whether the parent used physical punishment or yelled at the child during the past week, and four items assessed via observation regarding whether the parent scolded or yelled; used physical restraint; hit, slapped, spanked, or kicked; and pushed, pulled, or pinched the child during the home visit (score range: 0-6; high scores meaning more harsh parenting). \n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nSecondary outcomes assessed through the outcome evaluation include: positive parenting; dysfunctional parenting; parent sense of inefficacy; child monitoring and supervision; child neglect; parental depression, anxiety, and stress; child behaviour problems; attitudes toward punishment; child behaviour and parenting; parent-child relationships; and intimate partner violence. Parent-child relationships will be assessed through an instrument that incorporates an observational assessment (i.e., the HOME Inventory).\n\na)\tPositive parenting (self-report)\n\nPositive parenting behaviours will be assessed using the Parenting Young Children Scale (PARYC) (21 items) [38]. The PARYC measures the frequency of positive parenting (7 items), setting limits (7 items) and proactive parenting (7 items) by the parent/primary caregiver over the previous month on a 7-point Likert scale (0 = Never, 6 = Always). Positive parenting will be measured using such items as \u201cWere you able to invite (the target child) to play a game with you or share an enjoyable activity?\u201d and \u201cWere you able to reward (the target child) when he/she did something well or showed a new skill?\u201d Setting limits will be assessed through items such as \u201cWere you able to explain what you wanted (the target child) to do in clear and simple ways?\u201d and Were you able to set rules on (the target child\u2019s) behaviour that you were able to enforce?\u201d Items to assess proactive parenting include \u201cWere you able to plan ways to prevent problem behaviour [such as limiting contact with certain peers or not leaving (the target child) unsupervised while they are doing certain activities]?\u201d and \u201cWere you able to make a game out of everyday tasks (such as a daily chore) so (the target child) followed through?\u201d Items are summed to create a total positive parenting score (range from 0 to 126) as well as for each subscale (range from 0 to 42) with higher scores indicating more positive parenting behaviours.\n\nb) Dysfunctional parenting (self-report)\n\nDysfunctional parenting behaviour will be assessed using the Parenting Scale (PS) Overreactivity subscale (PS, 10 items), which examines parent attitudes and beliefs regarding authoritarian discipline [39]. PS responses are based on a 7-point Likert scale in which parents are presented with a situation and then are given two opposing responses at either side of the scale, with the mid-point representing neither one way or the other and the three points on either side of the mid-point representing \u201csometimes,\u201d \u201cgenerally,\u201d and \u201cvery often\u201d as one moves further out from the middle. One such item under this subscale is \u201cWhen my child misbehaves, I raise my voice or yell\u2026I speak to my child calmly.\u201d (7 = I raise my voice or yell; 1 = I speak to my child calmly.) Scoring for this subscale is computed by averaging the responses on these items with higher scores indicating more overreactive parenting behaviour (range from 1 to 7).\n\nh)\tChild monitoring and supervision (self-report)\n\nParental monitoring and supervision practices will be measured using an adapted version of the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ) Poor Monitoring/Supervision subscale (11 items) [40]. The APQ measures parenting characteristics that have been associated with disruptive behaviour disorders in school-age children, although it has also been used with preschool children [41]. The Poor Monitoring/Supervision subscale will be used to measure the frequency of negative parent monitoring and supervision practices over the past month through a 5-point Likert scale (0 = Never; 5 = Always, e.g., \u201cYour child stays out later than he/she is supposed to\u201d). We will also include an additional item assessing monitoring of social media use (e.g., \u201cYour child uses Facebook, LINE, other social media applications, YouTube or the Internet without being supervised by an adult\u201d). The items in the scale are summed to obtain a total scale score ranging from 0 to 55 with higher scores indicating less parental supervision.\n\ni)\tChild maltreatment: Neglect (self-report)\n\nChild neglect will be assessed using an adapted version of the ICAST-Trial Neglect subscale. This subscale has 6 items for assessing medical, physical, and educational neglect, including \u201cIn the past month, how often was [Child Nickname] not taken care of when sick or injured, even when you or another caregiver were able to do so and could afford it?\u201d and \u201cIn the past month, how often was [Child Nickname] not given a meal that he or she needed, even when you or another caregiver was able to afford it?\u201d Items are summed to obtain a total score ranging from 0 to 64 with higher scores indicating more neglect. We will also create an incidence of neglect in the past month (0 = no abuse; 1 = previous abuse).\n\nj)\tParental depression, anxiety, and stress (self-report)\n\nParental depression, anxiety, and stress will be assessed through the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale short form (DASS-21) (21 items) [42]. The DASS-21 will assess parent/primary caregiver depression and anxiety using a 4-point Likert scale [0= Never; 3 = Always] to measure the frequency of symptoms over the previous week. Items include statements such as \u201cI felt that I had nothing to look forward to.\u201d Total DASS scores range from 0 to 63, with subscales from 0 to 21. The recommended cut-offs that indicate severity of depression are 5-6 (mild), 7-10 (moderate), 11-13 (severe), and 14 and up (extremely severe), while cut-offs for anxiety are 4-5 (mild), 6-7 (moderate), 8-9 (severe), and 10 and up (extremely severe). Cut-offs for stress are 8-9 (mild), 10-12 (moderate), 13-16 for (severe), and 17 and up (extremely severe).\n\nk)\tChild behaviour problems (self-report)\n\nFor the purpose of assessing child behaviour problems by parent/primary caregiver self-report, the study will utilize the Eyberg Child Behaviour Inventory (ECBI) Intensity Scale and Problem Scale (36 items) [43]. The ECBI Intensity Scale has been used extensively in multiple countries to evaluate parenting programmes in RCTs [9, 44-46]. The Intensity Scale measures the frequency of child externalizing behaviours over the past month, using a 7-point Likert-like scale (1 = Never occurs; 7 = Always occurs; ranging 36 to 252) [43]. Relevant items include \u201cHow often does (the target child) refuse to obey until threatened with punishment\u201d and \u201cHow often does (the target child) have temper tantrums?\u201d The Problem Scale asks whether particular externalizing behaviours are currently a problem for the parent/primary caregiver (0 = No; 1 = Yes; ranging from 0 to 36). Both scales are summed to create a total Intensity Score and Problem Score, with clinical cut-off scores for disruptive behaviour problems suggested as 131 for the Intensity Score and 15 for the Problem Score in the USA; however, no Thai norms are available [47].\n\nl)\tAttitudes toward punishment (self-report)\n\nAttitudes toward punishment will be assessed using the ICAST Attitudes subscale that is based on a scenario which presents a series of options for disciplining a child with difficult behaviour (4 items: \u201chitting or spanking the child,\u201d \u201cnot allowing the child to go out and play with friends,\u201d \u201cshouting or shaming the child,\u201d or \u201cexplaining why the behaviour is wrong and discussing consequences\u201d). Parents report on how they perceive the effectiveness each response would be as a discipline strategy using a Likert scale from 1 (\u201cvery ineffective\u201d) to 5 (\u201cvery effective\u201d). The nonviolent discipline items are reversed resulting in a possible total sum score ranging from 4 to 20 with higher scores indicate more support of harsh punishment. The ICAST Attitudes subscale also originally included an additional item asking parents to indicate which strategy they believed would be the most effective but this was not used in the present study due to an administrative error during translation.\n\nm)\tParent sense of inefficacy (self-report)\n\nParent sense of inefficacy will be assessed using an adapted version of the ICAST-T Caregiver tool (mentioned above) Inefficacy subscale (2 items: e.g., \u201cIn the past month, how often did you not know what to do when your child misbehaved\u201d). The items are summed for a total score ranging from 0 to 16 with higher scores indicating a greater sense of inefficacy in managing difficult child behaviour.\n\nn)\tParent daily report on child behaviour and parenting (self-report)\nAn adapted version of the Parent Daily Report Checklist (PDR, 44 items) will be used to assess day-to-day occurrences of child behaviour problems and parenting behaviour [48]. The PDR is administered at five time points during the RCT: at baseline, one month post-baseline, two months post-baseline, three months post-baseline (i.e., during post-test assessment), and six months post-baseline (i.e., during follow-up assessment). This allows for the parent/primary caregiver to avoid challenges in recalling events over extended time periods and has been widely used in multiple contexts to assess changes in child and parent behaviours during the course of programme delivery [49, 50]. In order to assess child behaviour, the PDR asks parents/primary caregivers whether a child externalizing behaviour (e.g. destructiveness, lying, hitting others) occurred within the previous 24 hours (34 items), as well as how many hours of sleep the child had (1 item). To assess parenting behaviour, the PDR asks parents about their own behaviour (6 items, e.g. yelled or shouted at the child, praised child for doing something well) and self-efficacy (3 items, e.g. had a feeling that I could not cope with parenting). Responses to these items are dichotomous (0 = No; 1 = Yes), with items summed for each subscale on parent and child behaviour. Negative items on the parent subscales will be reversed so that total scores indicate more positive parenting behaviour as well as a total PDR parenting score ranging from 0 to 9. Total scores for child behaviour indicate more child behaviour problems in the past 24 hours ranging from 0 to 34. The item regarding sleep is a numerical response.\n\ni)\tParent-child relationships (combination interview and observational assessment)\n\nParent-child relationships will be measured through a combination of interview and observational items (26 27 in total), using the aforementioned combined and adapted version of the Early Childhood and Middle Childhood HOME Inventory record forms [51]. The adapted version contains 16 items on the \u201cresponsivity\u201d subscale, which describes the emotional and verbal sensitivity as well as responsivity of the parent to the child, such as \u201cparent holds child close 10-15 minutes per day\u201d and \u201cparent praises child\u2019s qualities twice during visit.\u201d It also contains 6 relevant items on the \u201cencouragement of maturity\u201d subscale, which describes the extent to which parents/primary caregivers expect the child to exhibit socially responsibility and maturity, and conform to family rules. Such items include \u201cparent/primary caregiver sets limits for child and generally enforces them,\u201d and \u201cfamily requires child to keep living and play area reasonably clean and straight.\u201d There are 2 items on the \u201cemotional climate\u201d subscale, which measures the extent to which the parent/primary caregiver can accept the target child\u2019s negative expressions of emotion, as well as how well the parent maintains emotional control. It includes \u201cparent/primary caregiver has not lost temper with child during previous week\u201d and \u201cchild can express negative feelings toward parents/primary caregiver without harsh reprisals.\u201d Finally, the form includes 2 items on the \u201cmodelling\u201d subscale, which measures modelling by the parent/primary caregiver of desirable and acceptable behaviour. These items include \u201cTV is used judiciously\u201d and \u201csome delay of food gratification is expected.\u201d The HOME Inventory is scored dichotomously based on whether each item was either observed or reported by the parent/caregiver during the course of the interview depending on the nature of the item. In addition to summing all 26 items to obtain a total positive parent-child relationships score, we will create sum scores for the Responsivity and Maturity subscales with higher scores indicating more positive relationships. \n\nj)\tIntimate partner violence (self-report)\n\nAdult self-report of experiencing intimate partner violence over the past month will be assessed using an adapted version of the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale Short Form (CTS2S, 8 items) [52]. This scale includes 2 items on the frequency of negotiation (e.g., \u201cpartner suggested a compromise for a disagreement\u201d), 5 items on physical assault (e.g., \u201cpartner pushed, shoved, or slapped me\u201d), and 1 item on psychological aggression (e.g., \u201cpartner insulted, shouted, yelled, or swore at me\u201d). Answers are coded on a frequency scale of 0 to 3 (0 = never happened; 1 = once or twice; 2 = 3-5 times; 3 = More than 5 times). The CTS2S will determine an overall indication of intimate partner violence on a level of severity (sum of negative items) and prevalence (dichotomous variable from negative items indicating experience of conflict or not), as well as for each subscale the Negotiation subscale. Only respondents who have been in a relationship in the past month will answer this scale.\n\nk)\tIntimate partner coercion (self-report)\n\nAdult self-report of experiencing intimate partner coercion over the past month will be assessed using items adapted from the WHO Multi-Country Study Questionnaire on Women\u2019s Health and Life and Domestic Violence against Women (WHO, 10 items) [53]. This scale includes 7 items on coercion and emotional violence (e.g., \u201cmy partner tried to keep me from seeing my friends\u201d and \u201cmy partner insisted on knowing where I was at all times\u201d), and 3 items on restriction of financial autonomy (e.g., \u201cmy partner took my earnings or savings from me against my will.\u201d) All answers are coded on a frequency scale of 0 to 3 (0 = never happened; 1 = once or twice; 2 = 3-5 times; 3 = more than 5 times). We will determine an overall indication of intimate partner violence on a level of severity (sum of items across both scales ranging from 0 to 30) and prevalence (dichotomous variable indicating experience of conflict or not), as well as for each subscale with higher scores indicating more intimate partner coercion. Only respondents who have been in a relationship in the past month will answer this scale.\n\nC.12.5. Process evaluation measurements\n\na)\tImplementation fidelity\n\nFidelity of programme implementation will be measured via self-report checklists by facilitators. The self-report checklist will gauge the level of adherence to the Facilitator Manual,and will include specific activities that the facilitator must deliver for each of the weekly sessions, such as home practice discussions and role-playing exercises. \n\nb)\tImplementation quality\n\nQuality of delivery will be assessed by coaches observing the delivery of programme sessions six and seven (two sessions per facilitator) using the Parenting for Lifelong Health Facilitator Assessment Tool (PLH-FAT). The PLH-FAT, similar to the Leader Observation Tool for the Incredible Years parenting programme, is an observational treatment fidelity tool used to assess the process skills necessary for delivery of the programme. It will examine whether and to what extent core intervention components have been delivered, including questions regarding topics touched on per session, such as home practice discussion and role-playing activities. Seven standard behaviour categories are grouped into two scales based on the core activities (23 items) and process skills (28 items) as outlined in the programme manual. Assessment of core activities includes quality of delivery during home activity review (14 items, e.g., \u201cidentify specific challenges when shared by at least one parent\u201d), illustrated story discussion (7 items, e.g., \u201cdiscuss possible solutions for negative stories\u201d), and practicing skills (10 items, e.g., \u201cdebrief with the participants about experience and feelings\u201d). Assessment of process skills includes modelling skills (6 items, e.g., \u201cgive positive, specific, and realistic instructions\u201d), collaborative facilitation approach (5 items, e.g., \u201caccept participant responses verbally by reflecting back what the participant says\u201d), encouragement of participation (7 items, e.g., \u201cparticipants appear comfortable and involved in session\u201d), and leadership skills (6 items, e.g., \u201cuse open-ended questions during group discussions\u201d). \n\nc)\tAdherence/exposure (parents/primary caregivers)\n\nFor the purpose of measuring adherence and exposure to the parenting programme, attendance registers will be kept for each weekly session in order to assess the level of exposure of participants to the intervention components. \n\nd)\tEngagement in home activities\n\nParticipant engagement in home activities will be measured through weekly participant self-reports of home activity completion, using parent home practice checklists. Participants will complete the forms on a daily basis following the first seven weekly sessions, and these will be collected by facilitators at the beginning of sessions two through eight and maintained in participant case profiles. The forms will indicate to what extent the participants were able to practice the home activities assigned during the previous week\u2019s session and in accordance with the intervention manual.

Generalised linear mixed-effects models will be used with appropriate link functions to estimate intervention effectiveness on primary and secondary outcomes. We will select the appropriate link function for the distribution of the data. If the scores are not normally distributed, generalised linear mixed models will be applied to allow for the outcome to follow a non-normal but parametric distribution using Poisson regression modelling.\n\nTesting theory of change\n\nIntervention research provides an opportunity to test theoretical mechanisms and causal processes related to the role of parenting programmes in reducing risk of child maltreatment [58]. As aforementioned, this study tests two hypothesised pathways of change. Firstly, improved parenting knowledge, skill and sense of competence will increase positive parenting and reduce maltreatment. Secondly, improving caregiver mental health, intimate partner violence, and child behaviour will also mediate reductions in risk of child maltreatment. Path analysis methods will examine these hypotheses based on the aforementioned secondary outcomes [59]. \n\nTesting interaction effects\n\nThe study will examine impact heterogeneity and moderation effects across population subgroups, including particularly disadvantaged groups [60]. Potential differences by subgroup population include caregiver/child gender, age, relationship to child, socioeconomic status, as well as ecological risk factors [61], such as severely economically deprived families [62], intimate partner violence, and prior experience of child abuse [63]. Additional moderators to be analysed include families with parental depression and/or children with existing behaviour problems [64]. Furthermore, the impact of parenting group variation will be examined quantitatively in statistical analyses of outcome measures. Site effects and site X treatment interactions will also be considered in analyses to investigate heterogeneity of effects over sites [65]. It should be cautioned, however, that these analyses will be treated as exploratory since this study is not powered to detect these interaction effects with precision.\n\nProcess evaluation\n\nImplementation fidelity will be analysed by examining data from the facilitator self-report checklists and the Parenting for Lifelong Health Facilitator Assessment Tool [67]. First, internal consistency with means and standard deviation per group for each measurement will be reported. Next, differences between methodological approaches in overall fidelity scores will be assessed with independent t-tests. This will help determine the reliability and consistency of using self-report versus observational assessments of fidelity. Then, in order to produce a basic level of fidelity, a ratio of program implementation to program design will be created for both self-report and observational scores [68]. According to Borrelli and colleagues, a standard of 80% programme fidelity will be considered as \u201chigh treatment fidelity\u201d [69]. In addition, this study will examine challenges in facilitating specific components or aspects of delivery quality. For instance, facilitators may have difficulty implementing a particular session activity or have difficulty practicing reflexive behaviour with participants. Combined with in-depth interviews on barriers to implementation, this may highlight the need for additional training and/or further adaptation of programme materials.  \n\nOverall programme exposure, adherence, and engagement will be assessed based on attendance registers and parent-report of activity checklists. Mean scores and standard deviations will be reported on attendance rates, completion rates, and activity engagement. In the previous delivery of the Sinovuyo Caring Families Programme from which the PLH for Young Children programme has been adapted, it has been recommended that parents participate in at least 66% or 8 sessions [70]. As a result, a similar standard will be used to determine an acceptable overall rate of programme attendance. This study will also report percentages of parents who participate in 50%, 25%, and 10% of the programme.\n\nMultivariate regression analyses will investigate possible associations between change in child maltreatment and secondary outcomes, and implementation fidelity (quality of delivery and content delivery). We will also examine attendance in the programme by using the Complier Average Causal Effect analyses that provides an estimate of causal effects, taking into account attendance (i.e., compliance) and other baseline predictors of attendance [71, 72]. These results will provide useful information on whether programme fidelity have a role in influencing programme effects. Significant R2 values will be reported to show the amount of variance each process indicator accounts in child behaviour problem change. In addition, beta weight values will determine the unit of change necessary to reduce child maltreatment frequency and secondary outcomes [73]. This will be particularly useful for improving the intervention protocols and training prior to further implementation and evaluation [74].\n\nCost effectiveness analysis\n\nIncremental cost effectiveness analyses (CEA) will be conducted from the payer's perspective (excluding participant costs) to assess whether the benefits of the PLH for Young Children programme appear to be worth the added costs. A statistically significant reduction in the ICAST-T overall score will reflect reductions in child maltreatment. Programme costs will be calculated using a micro-costing approach, multiplying resource use by unit costs. These will be divided into 1) start-up costs including costs required for coordinating recruitment, community mobilisation, and facilitator training; 2) programme delivery costs which includes staff-time, transportation, and other materials for home-based individual consultations, parent-group sessions, and supervision sessions; and 3) administrative costs to manage the implementation. \n\nWe will also model costs at scale on the regional level based on the assumptions that the programme will be delivered in a similar way as it was during the trial over three ways of delivery in one year by 168 facilitators and 28 supervisors to 252 groups of 20 parents per group with a total of 5,040 parents. Training will be a fixed cost delivered at the beginning of the year to all of the facilitators. In addition, costs for materials will be calculated without the purchase of illustrate story canvases, which will be replaced by a more cost-effective approach using the illustrated stories in the parent handbook. Material costs will also be shared across three waves of delivery. Transportation and food costs will also be removed from the scale-up model since these will not be provided by the Ministry of Public Health during normal delivery. Finally, we will take a conservative approach to modelling scale-up by including an additional 50% to the modelled costs similar to the cost-effectiveness analysis of the PLH for Teens programme in South Africa [66]. All costs will be incurred in Thai baht but will be presented in US dollars using the OECD average annual exchange rate for 2019. \n\nCost effectiveness will be based on the primary outcome of child maltreatment measured by the ICAST-T physical and emotional abuse subscales. The difference in probability of past-month abuse will be converted to an absolute number of incidents of abuse averted for the number of beneficiaries in the treatment group. We will then divide the total cost of the programme by this incident rate to provide an estimate of the cost per incident of physical or emotional abuse avoided. We will then transform the incidents of abuse averted score into DALYs averted by estimating disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to the different forms of child maltreatment as well as the best estimate of abuse incidence in Thailand. This will allow us to transform the cost-effectiveness ratio into an estimate of cost per DALY averted. For both estimates of cost-effectiveness, sensitivity analyses will be conducted to account for uncertainty around the effect size by using 95% CIs and for uncertainty around the costs of programme delivery at scale based on 50% uncertainty. We will also account for uncertainty in the transformation from child maltreatment incidence to cost per DALY gained by conducting sensitivity analysis which varies the estimate of past-year incidence by \u00b15% and the estimate of DALYs per case of abuse averted by \u00b120% in children\u2019s behavioural outcomes [66]. Bootstrapping techniques will be used to conduct uncertainty analyses to assess variability in our findings from potential sampling bias.", "q19.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e4d4b9eb8c2e501524c59bd",
