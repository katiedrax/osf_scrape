Additionally, we will investigate the extent to which the effect of this positive writing intervention on acute stress reactivity is moderated by individual differences, specifically: ratings of self-esteem, perseverative thinking, and Big 5 personality traits.\n\nWith respect to each of the moderating variables under investigation:\n\ni) It has been identified that there is a link between high self-esteem and a lower activation of psychological and physiological stress responses, (O\u2019Donnell et al, 2008; Pruessner et al, 2005). It was found that when an individual reports having higher self-esteem, their physiological response, specifically cortisol production and heart-rate variability was considerably less activated in response to a stress task, compared to those with a lower self-esteem. It is therefore predicted that individuals who report higher self-esteem will also have lower overall stress reactivity in response to a critical social evaluation task. It is hypothesised that self-esteem will play a moderating role in the effects of a positive writing intervention for acute stress reactivity. Specifically, individuals with higher self-esteem, and who are in the intervention group, will have lower stress reactivity compared to individuals with lower-self-esteem in both conditions. \n\nii) Stress reactivity has been linked to perseverative cognitions and thinking patterns. Perseverative thinking is described as continuous and repetitive negative thinking and includes processes such as worry, maladaptive brooding and rumination (Sorg et al., 2012). The perseverative thinking hypothesis suggests that stress and perseverative thinking interact, and those prone to this type of thinking are likely to suffer from negative health outcomes (Brosschot et al., 2006; Kelly, 2018). Some studies have found that perseverative thinking can moderate the effects of a writing intervention for physical health issues (O\u2019Connor et al., 2011), however, it is unknown if perseverative thinking moderates the therapeutic effect of positive writing on acute stress reactivity. It is hypothesised that perseverative thinking, as measured by the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ) (Ehring et al., 2011), will have a moderating effect on a positive writing intervention for acute stress reactivity. Specifically, those who have high scores of perseverative thinking will experience both greater levels of stress when presented with a critical social evaluation task, and less benefit from the implementation of a positive writing intervention.\n\niii) There is evidence showing that personality traits influence the coping strategies we choose to deal with stressful experiences; which may be adaptive or maladaptive (Dumitru &amp; Cozman, 2012). Some Big 5 personality traits have been found to be adaptive, for example individuals high on extraversion and conscientiousness are less vulnerable to stress than those high on neuroticism (Vollrath et al, 2000). It is important to know if some personality traits are more resilient to the adverse effects of stress and anxiety, but there is a lack of research looking at the lower order facets of the Big 5. These are six subcategories of each of the five personality traits that provide a much \u2018richer description\u2019 of a person\u2019s personality (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1995), in order to get a deeper understanding of aspects of personality which influence a person\u2019s stress response. It is hypothesized that those who score low for facets of extraversion will experience greater levels of subjective and cardiovascular stress reactivity. Due to this it is expected that these individuals will show greater benefits from a positive writing intervention. Specifically, individuals low on extraversion in the positive writing condition will elicit less of a stress response than individuals low on extraversion in the control writing condition. It is also hypothesized that those who score high on facets of neuroticism will experience greater levels of subjective and cardiovascular stress reactivity in response to a critical social evaluation task. Predicated by research which has suggested that positive writing interventions (e.g. written benefit finding) are most beneficial for individuals with high levels of negative affect (e.g. trait anxiety; e.g. Danoff Burg et al., 2006), it is expected that a positive writing intervention will be more beneficial for individuals with high neuroticism. \n"}, "study_type": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment"}, "study_type_other": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"data": "No, no data have been collected for this study yet.", "name": "Investigating the moderating effects of self-esteem, perseverative thinking and personality on a positive writing intervention for acute stress reactivity.\n\nWe are aiming to investigate whether a positive writing intervention can alleviate the subjective and cardiovascular effects of acute stress when completing a critical social evaluation task based on the trier social stress test (TSST).

Specifically, individuals with higher self-esteem, and who are in the intervention group, will have lower stress reactivity compared to individuals with lower-self-esteem in both conditions. \n\nii) Stress reactivity has been linked to perseverative cognitions and thinking patterns. Perseverative thinking is described as continuous and repetitive negative thinking and includes processes such as worry, maladaptive brooding and rumination (Sorg et al., 2012). The perseverative thinking hypothesis suggests that stress and perseverative thinking interact, and those prone to this type of thinking are likely to suffer from negative health outcomes (Brosschot et al., 2006; Kelly, 2018). Some studies have found that perseverative thinking can moderate the effects of a writing intervention for physical health issues (O\u2019Connor et al., 2011), however, it is unknown if perseverative thinking moderates the therapeutic effect of positive writing on acute stress reactivity. It is hypothesised that perseverative thinking, as measured by the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ) (Ehring et al., 2011), will have a moderating effect on a positive writing intervention for acute stress reactivity. Specifically, those who have high scores of perseverative thinking will experience both greater levels of stress when presented with a critical social evaluation task, and less benefit from the implementation of a positive writing intervention.\n\niii) There is evidence showing that personality traits influence the coping strategies we choose to deal with stressful experiences; which may be adaptive or maladaptive (Dumitru &amp; Cozman, 2012). Some Big 5 personality traits have been found to be adaptive, for example individuals high on extraversion and conscientiousness are less vulnerable to stress than those high on neuroticism (Vollrath et al, 2000). It is important to know if some personality traits are more resilient to the adverse effects of stress and anxiety, but there is a lack of research looking at the lower order facets of the Big 5. These are six subcategories of each of the five personality traits that provide a much \u2018richer description\u2019 of a person\u2019s personality (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1995), in order to get a deeper understanding of aspects of personality which influence a person\u2019s stress response. It is hypothesized that those who score low for facets of extraversion will experience greater levels of subjective and cardiovascular stress reactivity. Due to this it is expected that these individuals will show greater benefits from a positive writing intervention. Specifically, individuals low on extraversion in the positive writing condition will elicit less of a stress response than individuals low on extraversion in the control writing condition. It is also hypothesized that those who score high on facets of neuroticism will experience greater levels of subjective and cardiovascular stress reactivity in response to a critical social evaluation task. Predicated by research which has suggested that positive writing interventions (e.g. written benefit finding) are most beneficial for individuals with high levels of negative affect (e.g. trait anxiety; e.g. Danoff Burg et al., 2006), it is expected that a positive writing intervention will be more beneficial for individuals with high neuroticism. \n", "study_type": "Experiment", "study_type_other": ""}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=quxar", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/de-1/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "de-1", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "quxar", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "quxar", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/tgrbx/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "tgrbx", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kd5s9/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "kd5s9", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5d2d2268d28338002c2432d2/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5d2d2268d28338002c2432d2", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/quxar/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/quxar/"}}, {"id": "yft4n", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Separating conceptual priming from perceptual priming and stimulus-response learning", "description": "It is likely that both component processes and stimulus-response (S-R) learning contribute to priming and repetition suppression (RS).
