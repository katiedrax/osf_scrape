The IAT (Greenwald, McGhee, &amp; Schwartz, 1998) is a computer-based reaction time test that provides information about the strength of associations between sets of social categories and evaluative or stereotypic concepts. All IATs have seven blocks but vary in what concepts they measure.\no\tThe first two blocks allow participants to practice using the \u201cE\u201d and \u201cI\u201d key to sort the two types of stimuli. The first block sorts the two social groups on two different sides of the screen. The second block teaches participants to sort the evaluative or stereotypic words on two different sides of the screen.\no\tThe third and fourth block combine the two pairs of concepts such that participants are matching one social group and one concept to the left side of the screen and the other combination of social group and concept to the right side of the screen. For example, in the Race IAT, participants might be asked to sort both \u201cWhite\u201d and \u201cGood\u201d stimuli on the right using the \u201cI\u201d key as well as sort both \u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cBad\u201d stimuli on the left using the \u201cE\u201d key. Block three includes 20 trials and block four includes 40 trials.\no\tThe fifth block is a training block where participants then practice switching the concepts, such that the word or picture on the right side of the screen is now being matched with the social category that was previously on the left side of the screen. The side associated with the racial categories changes such that \u201cWhite\u201d would now be sorted on the left side with the \u201cE\u201d key and \u201cBlack\u201d would now be sorted on the right side with the \u201cI\u201d key. Participants are only sorting the social group in the fifth block to get used to the change in categorization.\no\tThe sixth and seventh block again combined the two pairs of concepts, but the opposite pairings are opposite to those of block three and four. For example, \u201cWhite\u201d would still be sorted on the left and \u201cBlack\u201d would still be sorted on the right as well as sorting \u201cBad\u201d on the left with the \u201cE\u201d key and sorting \u201cGood\u201d on the right with the \u201cI\u201d key. Block six includes 20 trials and block seven includes 40 trials.\no\tParticipant\u2019s scores (called an IATD score) is calculated as the difference in reaction time between two pairings, divided by the standard deviation of the response latencies for these two blocks. In the Race IAT, this would be the degree to which participants more quickly pair \u201cWhite\u201d with \u201cGood\u201d than they pair \u201cBlack\u201d with \u201cGood\u201d. Whether the first pairing is congruent (\u201cWhite\u201d and \u201cGood\u201d) or incongruent (\u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cGood\u201d) is randomized between participants. It is important to recognize that the IAT captures two different sets of associations: associations about Black Americans and the associations about White Americans. While these might be independent, they are deeply connected. Indeed, many studies conceptualize prejudice as a preference for one group compared to a dispreference for the other group (Alter, Stern, Granot, &amp; Balcetis, 2016). \no\tThis study will be using the Race IAT, Weapons IAT, and Skin Tone IAT. Data will be downloaded from the Open Science Framework (Xu, Nosek, &amp; Greenwald, 2014). All of the stimuli used for these IATs are available online (https://www.projectimplicit.net/nosek/stimuli/). \n\nRace IAT. The Race IAT compares the speed at which participants pair Black versus White faces with \u201cGood\u201d versus \u201cBad\u201d words. This task typically shows a preference for White over Black faces.\n\nSkin tone IAT. The Skin Tone IAT compares the speed at which the participants pair dark-skinned and light-skinned drawings of faces with \u201cGood\u201d and \u201cBad\u201d words. This task typically shows a preference for light-skinned over dark-skinned faces.\n\nWeapons IAT. The Weapons IAT compares the speed at which the participants pair Black versus White faces with weapons and harmless objects. This task typically shows an automatic association for Black Americans with weapons than harmless objects.\n\nEconomic disadvantage. Economic disadvantage at the MSA and county level will be assessed using multiple variables. \no\tUnemployment disparity. We will calculate relative rate of unemployment for each county and MSA from appropriate Census Data (U.S. Census Bureau, 2017b). We will first calculate the employment rate for each race in each area by dividing number of white citizens unemployed by the number of white citizens in that area and will repeat this process for Whites and Blacks for all counties and MSAs of interest. We will then divide the percentage of white citizens unemployed by the percentage of Black citizens unemployed to compute unemployment disparity.\no\tPoverty disparity. The poverty rate will be taken from the Census Bureau (U.S. Census Bureau, 2017b). This measure includes people that are just above the poverty line, representing people with an income below the established poverty level for their state and family size. We will calculate relative rate of poverty for each county and MSA from appropriate Census Data (U.S. Census Bureau, 2017b). We will first calculate the poverty rate for each race in each area by dividing number of white citizens in below the poverty line by the number of white citizens in that area and will repeat this process for Whites and Blacks for all counties and MSAs of interest. We will then divide the percentage of white citizens under the poverty line by the percentage of Black citizens under the poverty line to compute poverty disparity.\n\nCovariates. Including a few covariates will allow us to control for potential confounds. We will include two context-level covariates (median income and crime rate).\t\no\tMedian income. Median income will be taken from the Census Bureau (U.S. Census Bureau, 2017a). The national median income of about $62,000 in 2018 (Guzman, 2019).\no\tCrime rate. Crime rate will be calculated using the number of violent crimes as reported by the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program and Census Bureau (Federal Bureau of Investigation \u2013 Uniform Crime Reporting [FBI \u2013 UCR] 2015a, 2016; U.S. Census Bureau, 2017c). Included in the FBI\u2019s calculation of violent crime are four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault (FBI-UCR, 2015b). Crime rate will then be calculated by dividing the number of crimes committed in an area by the population of that area. Population estimates are calculated as part of the American Community Survey (ACS) for counties and MSAs (US Census Bureau, 2017c). Using FBI UCR and ACS data, we need to calculate the violent crime rate for each county and MSA of interest. We will divide the number of violent crimes by the number of people in each area. This will be calculated for each area of interest.\n"}}}, "planned-sample": {"value": {"question4b": {"extra": [], "value": "-\tSince this is all archival data, we do not control the pre-selection rules.

Skin Tone IAT is a unique, significant predictor of the Race IAT at the context level.\n        oThose with lighter skin, regardless of race, have better outcomes than those with darker skin in almost every area, including income, housing, and education (Hunter, 2007). \n        oResearch also shows that two features independently influence judgment of another\u2019s race: facial features and skin tone (Blair et al., 2002). \n        oHowever, skin tone and race are often viewed as dependent upon one another: dark skinned faces are assumed to be African American (Stepanova &amp; Strube, 2009). Stereotypes are often applied to those who are African American, dark skin, or have Afrocentric features without much colloquial differentiation between these groups (Blair et al., 2004; Blair et al., 2002; Stepanova &amp; Strube, 2009). \n        oWe know Skin Tone and Race Bias are related, but their relationship and extent of their overlap is not addressed in the current literature.  \n       oThere is no research that uses the Skin Tone IAT at the context level; understanding if and how these biases interact at the context-level is important in achieving a more comprehensive understanding of system-level bias. \n\nH2. The Weapons IAT is a unique, significant predictor of the Race IAT at the context level.\n        oWeapons bias is often defined very broadly, such as when people claim to have seen a weapon when there is not one, most often with African American men (Payne, 2006, 2001).\n        o Although the weapons bias can apply to anyone, the weapons bias is stronger for Blacks than other minorities (Sadler, Correll, Park, &amp; Judd, 2012).\n        oVarious stereotypes suggest that African Americans are dangerous and violent, with the Weapons bias being a consequence of broader biases (Oliver, 2003; Quillian &amp; Pager, 2001). \n        oThe weapons bias has already been related to socially important outcomes at the context-level (Johnson &amp; Chopik, 2018; Hehman, Flake &amp; Calanchini, 2018). \n        oHowever, these studies use bias to predict social consequences (like disproportionate use of force by police) without an understanding on the composition of Race bias at the context-level.\n\nH3. Economic disadvantage is a unique, significant predictor of the Race IAT at the context level \n        oEconomic disadvantage is highly related to race; often this is seen through the overrepresentation of minorities, and especially African Americans as poor and unemployed (Economic Policy Institute, 2014, 2018).\n        oA more interesting way to look at the overrepresentation of minorities as poor is to analyze the overlap in stereotype content. Both the poor and African Americans as groups are associated with criminality, being irresponsible and lazy among other things (Carmona, 2011; Bobo &amp; Kluegel 1993; Brigham, 1993). \n\nH4 and H5 - Economic Disadvantage as the moderator\n         oThe next two hypotheses talk about the potential moderating effects of economic disadvantage. There are two mechanisms through which economic disadvantage may moderate relationships between other biases.\n        o The presence of poverty or unemployment in the area might create a social threat through an increase in the negative societal effects of poverty, such as increased gun violence mortality [H5] (Males &amp; Brown, 2014), and obesity rates (Kwarteng, Schulz, Mentz, Isreal, &amp; White-Perkins, 2017). The threat of poverty's consequence might increase bias against those that are perceived to create these negative social outcomes.\n        oThe second way that economic disadvantage might moderate the relationship between biases is through salience. When economic scarcity or disadvantage is salient, we tend to increase our use of heuristics, including skin tone [H4] and race bias (Chang, Krosch, &amp; Cikara, 2016; Krosch &amp; Armodio, 2014).\n        oThese two mechanisms suggest economic disadvantage might moderate the relationship between related biases.\n"}, "question6a": {"extra": [], "value": "Only one prediction is made for each IV-DV combination."}}}, "confirmatory-analyses-first": {"value": {"first": {"value": {"question1c": {"extra": [], "value": "-\tOnly two regression equations will be run - one at the MSA level and one at the county level. \n-\tDescription of variables and their calculations are available on the methods page.\n"}, "question2c": {"extra": [], "value": "OLS Regression at the county and MSA level"}, "question3c": {"extra": [], "value": "See Methods (B)"}, "question4c": {"extra": [], "value": "Median Income: This will control for areas that have lower absolute poverty or unemployment rates and allow us to access economic disparity, rather than poverty and unemployment in general. \nViolent Crime Rate: We want to measure weapons bias, without considerations of how seemingly legitimate that bias may be.\n"}, "question5c": {"extra": [], "value": "-\tWe will use the typical .05 for null hypothesis testing.

Skin Tone IAT is a unique, significant predictor of the Race IAT at the context level.\n        oThose with lighter skin, regardless of race, have better outcomes than those with darker skin in almost every area, including income, housing, and education (Hunter, 2007). \n        oResearch also shows that two features independently influence judgment of another\u2019s race: facial features and skin tone (Blair et al., 2002). \n        oHowever, skin tone and race are often viewed as dependent upon one another: dark skinned faces are assumed to be African American (Stepanova &amp; Strube, 2009). Stereotypes are often applied to those who are African American, dark skin, or have Afrocentric features without much colloquial differentiation between these groups (Blair et al., 2004; Blair et al., 2002; Stepanova &amp; Strube, 2009). \n        oWe know Skin Tone and Race Bias are related, but their relationship and extent of their overlap is not addressed in the current literature.  \n       oThere is no research that uses the Skin Tone IAT at the context level; understanding if and how these biases interact at the context-level is important in achieving a more comprehensive understanding of system-level bias. \n\nH2. The Weapons IAT is a unique, significant predictor of the Race IAT at the context level.\n        oWeapons bias is often defined very broadly, such as when people claim to have seen a weapon when there is not one, most often with African American men (Payne, 2006, 2001).\n        o Although the weapons bias can apply to anyone, the weapons bias is stronger for Blacks than other minorities (Sadler, Correll, Park, &amp; Judd, 2012).\n        oVarious stereotypes suggest that African Americans are dangerous and violent, with the Weapons bias being a consequence of broader biases (Oliver, 2003; Quillian &amp; Pager, 2001). \n        oThe weapons bias has already been related to socially important outcomes at the context-level (Johnson &amp; Chopik, 2018; Hehman, Flake &amp; Calanchini, 2018). \n        oHowever, these studies use bias to predict social consequences (like disproportionate use of force by police) without an understanding on the composition of Race bias at the context-level.\n\nH3. Economic disadvantage is a unique, significant predictor of the Race IAT at the context level \n        oEconomic disadvantage is highly related to race; often this is seen through the overrepresentation of minorities, and especially African Americans as poor and unemployed (Economic Policy Institute, 2014, 2018).\n        oA more interesting way to look at the overrepresentation of minorities as poor is to analyze the overlap in stereotype content. Both the poor and African Americans as groups are associated with criminality, being irresponsible and lazy among other things (Carmona, 2011; Bobo &amp; Kluegel 1993; Brigham, 1993). \n\nH4 and H5 - Economic Disadvantage as the moderator\n         oThe next two hypotheses talk about the potential moderating effects of economic disadvantage. There are two mechanisms through which economic disadvantage may moderate relationships between other biases.\n        o The presence of poverty or unemployment in the area might create a social threat through an increase in the negative societal effects of poverty, such as increased gun violence mortality [H5] (Males &amp; Brown, 2014), and obesity rates (Kwarteng, Schulz, Mentz, Isreal, &amp; White-Perkins, 2017). The threat of poverty's consequence might increase bias against those that are perceived to create these negative social outcomes.\n        oThe second way that economic disadvantage might moderate the relationship between biases is through salience. When economic scarcity or disadvantage is salient, we tend to increase our use of heuristics, including skin tone [H4] and race bias (Chang, Krosch, &amp; Cikara, 2016; Krosch &amp; Armodio, 2014).\n        oThese two mechanisms suggest economic disadvantage might moderate the relationship between related biases.\n", "recommended-hypothesis.question6a": "Only one prediction is made for each IV-DV combination.", "description-methods.design.question2a": "-\tThese variables will be treated as IVs in our regression equation.

The IAT (Greenwald, McGhee, &amp; Schwartz, 1998) is a computer-based reaction time test that provides information about the strength of associations between sets of social categories and evaluative or stereotypic concepts. All IATs have seven blocks but vary in what concepts they measure.\no\tThe first two blocks allow participants to practice using the \u201cE\u201d and \u201cI\u201d key to sort the two types of stimuli. The first block sorts the two social groups on two different sides of the screen. The second block teaches participants to sort the evaluative or stereotypic words on two different sides of the screen.\no\tThe third and fourth block combine the two pairs of concepts such that participants are matching one social group and one concept to the left side of the screen and the other combination of social group and concept to the right side of the screen. For example, in the Race IAT, participants might be asked to sort both \u201cWhite\u201d and \u201cGood\u201d stimuli on the right using the \u201cI\u201d key as well as sort both \u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cBad\u201d stimuli on the left using the \u201cE\u201d key. Block three includes 20 trials and block four includes 40 trials.\no\tThe fifth block is a training block where participants then practice switching the concepts, such that the word or picture on the right side of the screen is now being matched with the social category that was previously on the left side of the screen. The side associated with the racial categories changes such that \u201cWhite\u201d would now be sorted on the left side with the \u201cE\u201d key and \u201cBlack\u201d would now be sorted on the right side with the \u201cI\u201d key. Participants are only sorting the social group in the fifth block to get used to the change in categorization.\no\tThe sixth and seventh block again combined the two pairs of concepts, but the opposite pairings are opposite to those of block three and four. For example, \u201cWhite\u201d would still be sorted on the left and \u201cBlack\u201d would still be sorted on the right as well as sorting \u201cBad\u201d on the left with the \u201cE\u201d key and sorting \u201cGood\u201d on the right with the \u201cI\u201d key. Block six includes 20 trials and block seven includes 40 trials.\no\tParticipant\u2019s scores (called an IATD score) is calculated as the difference in reaction time between two pairings, divided by the standard deviation of the response latencies for these two blocks. In the Race IAT, this would be the degree to which participants more quickly pair \u201cWhite\u201d with \u201cGood\u201d than they pair \u201cBlack\u201d with \u201cGood\u201d. Whether the first pairing is congruent (\u201cWhite\u201d and \u201cGood\u201d) or incongruent (\u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cGood\u201d) is randomized between participants. It is important to recognize that the IAT captures two different sets of associations: associations about Black Americans and the associations about White Americans. While these might be independent, they are deeply connected. Indeed, many studies conceptualize prejudice as a preference for one group compared to a dispreference for the other group (Alter, Stern, Granot, &amp; Balcetis, 2016). \no\tThis study will be using the Race IAT, Weapons IAT, and Skin Tone IAT. Data will be downloaded from the Open Science Framework (Xu, Nosek, &amp; Greenwald, 2014). All of the stimuli used for these IATs are available online (https://www.projectimplicit.net/nosek/stimuli/). \n\nRace IAT. The Race IAT compares the speed at which participants pair Black versus White faces with \u201cGood\u201d versus \u201cBad\u201d words. This task typically shows a preference for White over Black faces.\n\nSkin tone IAT. The Skin Tone IAT compares the speed at which the participants pair dark-skinned and light-skinned drawings of faces with \u201cGood\u201d and \u201cBad\u201d words. This task typically shows a preference for light-skinned over dark-skinned faces.\n\nWeapons IAT. The Weapons IAT compares the speed at which the participants pair Black versus White faces with weapons and harmless objects. This task typically shows an automatic association for Black Americans with weapons than harmless objects.\n\nEconomic disadvantage. Economic disadvantage at the MSA and county level will be assessed using multiple variables. \no\tUnemployment disparity. We will calculate relative rate of unemployment for each county and MSA from appropriate Census Data (U.S. Census Bureau, 2017b). We will first calculate the employment rate for each race in each area by dividing number of white citizens unemployed by the number of white citizens in that area and will repeat this process for Whites and Blacks for all counties and MSAs of interest. We will then divide the percentage of white citizens unemployed by the percentage of Black citizens unemployed to compute unemployment disparity.\no\tPoverty disparity. The poverty rate will be taken from the Census Bureau (U.S. Census Bureau, 2017b). This measure includes people that are just above the poverty line, representing people with an income below the established poverty level for their state and family size. We will calculate relative rate of poverty for each county and MSA from appropriate Census Data (U.S. Census Bureau, 2017b). We will first calculate the poverty rate for each race in each area by dividing number of white citizens in below the poverty line by the number of white citizens in that area and will repeat this process for Whites and Blacks for all counties and MSAs of interest. We will then divide the percentage of white citizens under the poverty line by the percentage of Black citizens under the poverty line to compute poverty disparity.\n\nCovariates. Including a few covariates will allow us to control for potential confounds. We will include two context-level covariates (median income and crime rate).\t\no\tMedian income. Median income will be taken from the Census Bureau (U.S. Census Bureau, 2017a). The national median income of about $62,000 in 2018 (Guzman, 2019).\no\tCrime rate. Crime rate will be calculated using the number of violent crimes as reported by the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program and Census Bureau (Federal Bureau of Investigation \u2013 Uniform Crime Reporting [FBI \u2013 UCR] 2015a, 2016; U.S. Census Bureau, 2017c). Included in the FBI\u2019s calculation of violent crime are four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault (FBI-UCR, 2015b). Crime rate will then be calculated by dividing the number of crimes committed in an area by the population of that area. Population estimates are calculated as part of the American Community Survey (ACS) for counties and MSAs (US Census Bureau, 2017c). Using FBI UCR and ACS data, we need to calculate the violent crime rate for each county and MSA of interest. We will divide the number of violent crimes by the number of people in each area. This will be calculated for each area of interest.\n", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question1c": "-\tOnly two regression equations will be run - one at the MSA level and one at the county level. \n-\tDescription of variables and their calculations are available on the methods page.\n", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question2c": "OLS Regression at the county and MSA level", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question3c": "See Methods (B)", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question4c": "Median Income: This will control for areas that have lower absolute poverty or unemployment rates and allow us to access economic disparity, rather than poverty and unemployment in general. \nViolent Crime Rate: We want to measure weapons bias, without considerations of how seemingly legitimate that bias may be.\n", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question5c": "-\tWe will use the typical .05 for null hypothesis testing.

It is unclear, how much knowledge the German public has about behaviours related to climate-change. This study investigates what a German sample knows about the impact of behaviours to mitigate global warming. Additionally, we investigate if there is a relationship between effectiveness knowledge and self-reported environmental behaviour. We are further interested in possible differences among different age groups, living places (city or countryside), and educational background.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-15T07:33:00.179477", "date_modified": "2019-12-15T05:00:31.852368", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [""], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "6cac1673642d0898783334046c42210f98d98d1d790e78cf58f19147857a3c0566cc10cd51ff75915e2e02ff6a65ab9b072bd8fafe6e1f3ad8f1094ac4c6b2423f7c416165def33d0859c8d94d506f6a6dcedb88d373583f8500aeec7d1f74b68cc50043b5d9b7df6ef419967394ed9e1c2c826c723bdc93c171dd33c943b9f2b5e34340b92398502150a521e4053fb0", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-15T07:33:00.156858", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Daria Mundt, Rosalio Ochoa Saavedra, Marit Kristine List"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "1.\tMisconceptions ~ Education level: We expect adult participants to have less misconceptions the higher their educational level (directional).\n2.\tMisconceptions ~ Personal involvement with the topic*educational level: We expect participants to have less misconceptions the more they are involved with global warming issues (directional).
