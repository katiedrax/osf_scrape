However, neural \u201cnoise\u201d has also been shown to change with age. This noise is considered an aperiodic component of the neural signal and has been shown to affect periodic components of the signal (i.e. oscillations), making it physiologically meaningful. Further, the 1/f component of the aperiodic signal has been found to represent the decoupling of population spiking activity from oscillatory synchronization. This desynchronization leads to a flatter 1/f slope which could help explain a decrease in cognitive function with age.

From mid to late life, the brain is particularly affected by age-related decline, both in brain morphology and physiological dynamics, each of which has been linked to changes in behavior and cognition (Harada et al., 2013; Phillips and Andres, 2010). For example, neural oscillatory dynamic changes with age include a shift from low-frequency oscillations that are dominant throughout childhood, towards higher frequency alpha oscillations that are more prominent in adulthood (Michels et al., 2013). Many studies have shown evidence for a decrease in neural oscillatory frequency and power in an old, relative to young, population, especially in the alpha range (Babiloni et al., 2006; Scally et al., 2018; Grandy et al., 2013; Vaden et al., 2012). Used as a tool to assess this \u201calpha slowing\u201d, individual peak alpha frequency has been found to represent an individual, physiological characteristic that increases from childhood to adulthood, but begins slowing around mid-life (Michels et al., 2013; Scally et al., 2018).  \n\nHowever, recent research has shed light on other components of the EEG broadband signal that could have implications for how past findings should be interpreted. Neural oscillations, also known as the \u201cperiodic\u201d component of an EEG signal, are among the most common data types extracted from EEG recordings both at rest and during task performance and can be used to asses a change in cognitive state with regard to age. However, an \u201caperiodic\u201d component, also known as background noise, exists within the EEG signal as well. This aperiodic component is characterised by a 1/f power-law distribution, and has been found to change with age, task demands, and behavioural state (Grigolini et al., 2009; Haller et al., 2018; Voytek et al., 2015a). Most research to date has used predefined frequency bands to look for neural oscillations within a dataset without regard to the aperiodic signal. This is problematic as aperiodic components have features that are independent of the periodic signal; in fact, neural oscillations are defined as regions of the power spectrum which rise above the background noise. This not only suggests neural oscillatory power should be measured separately from background noise, but further, oscillations should be measured relative to the aperiodic 1/f signal. Therefore, what is considered a neural oscillation using traditional EEG signal analysis methods may not represent a true oscillation, but rather a change in the aperiodic offset or slope within the dynamic 1/f signal (Haller et al., 2018; Ouyang et al., 2020). \n\nA recent study by Ouyang et al. (2020) looked at the effect of 1/f noise on alpha oscillatory activity in healthy young adults. Using a processing speed task, they found a significant and predictive association between alpha activity and cognitive ability. Structural equation modelling was then used to separate non-oscillatory 1/f activity from oscillatory alpha activity, as it has been shown previously that 1/f noise infiltrates the entire broadband spectrum and can confound oscillatory activity (Dave et al., 2018; Voytek at al., 2015a; Haller et al., 2018). After accounting for the 1/f component within the EEG signal, alpha oscillations were not found to be significantly correlated with specific cognitive processes as measured by a processing speed task. This provides evidence that the narrowband spectrum employed by most EEG research to date, and the results that were interpreted without regard to the 1/f background component, may not be accurately representing the physiological processes occurring in these neural systems. \n \n A number of recent studies have sought to determine age-related changes in oscillatory activity while taking into account the 1/f component. Recent evidence suggests that as age increases, the 1/f spectral slope flattens, reflecting an increase in asynchronous neuronal population spiking (Voytek et al., 2015a; Voytek and Knight, 2015b). Local population spiking rates are influenced as a result of changes within the excitation/inhibition balance, and maintaining temporally synchronized and functional activity levels through this balance is an integral part of the healthy brain, affecting the ability to form oscillations, efficient information transfer, and working memory maintenance (Gao et al., 2017; Tatti et al., 2017). Abilities of the healthy brain have been shown to degenerate as age increases, and the 1/f signal is susceptible to the same age-related changes (Voytek et al., 2015a; Dave et al., 2018; Haller et al., 2018). Despite previous evidence found in task-based studies, it remains largely unknown if age differences in the 1/f component affect oscillatory components of resting EEG signal. \n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "In the present study, we investigate age differences in resting EEG signal with regard to the 1/f component.

Participants were financially compensated to cover travel costs and any other inconveniences incurred due to participation in the study and is consistent with previous brain stimulation studies run by our group.\n\nYoung adults were at least 18 years of age and all older adults were without cognitive impairment, as assessed using either Mini-Mental State Examination (score &gt;24) (Folstein et al., 1975) or Addenbrooke\u2019s Cognitive Examination (ACE-III) (score &gt;82) (Mioshi et al., 2006). Exclusion criteria were history of psychological or neurological disease, a history of drug abuse, medications that alter the function of the nervous system, and an uncorrected hearing or visual impairment. All participants gave written consent and the studies were approved by the University of Adelaide Human Research Ethics Committee, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee, and the University of South Australia Human Research Ethics Committee. \n\nEEG data acquisition\nParticipants were seated in a comfortable chair in a quiet room. They were asked to keep their eyes closed during recording, to remain as still, quiet and relaxed as possible, and to refrain from actively engaging in any cognitive or mental tasks. EEG data were recorded for 3 minutes from either 57 or 62 electrodes arranged in a 10-10 layout (Waveguard, ANT Neuro, Enschede, The Netherlands) using a Polybench TMSi EEG system (Twente Medical Systems International B.V, Oldenzaal, The Netherlands) or an ASA-lab EEG system (ANT Neuro, Enschede, Netherlands). Conductive gel was inserted into each electrode using a blunt-needle syringe in order to reduce impedance to &lt;5 k\u03a9. The ground electrode was located at AFz. Signals were sampled at 2048 Hz, amplified 20x, online filtered (DC-553 Hz), and referenced to the average of all electrodes.\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "Age (young vs old)\nAperiodic status (1/f background included vs 1/f background removed)", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "EEG pre-processing\nResting EEG data were pre-processed using EEGLAB (Delorme and Makeig, 2004) and customized scripts in MATLAB (R2019a, The Mathworks, USA). Bad and unused channels were removed. Data were then band-pass (1-100 Hz) and band-stop (48-52 Hz) filtered, down-sampled to 256 Hz, and epoched in 2-second segments. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was run using the fastICA algorithm (Hyvarinen and Oja, 2000) to correct for artefacts caused by eye blinks or excessive muscle activity. An additional visual inspection was done to identify any additional artefacts or bad trials, and remove them from the data set. \n\nSpectral Analysis\nPower spectral densities will be calculated for each electrode with 0.5 Hz resolution using Welch\u2019s method. Peak alpha frequency (defined as the frequency with largest logarithmic power between 6 and 13 Hz) and the power at the peak will first be assessed without controlling for the 1/f component. We will then use the open-source Python toolbox FOOOF (\u2018fitting oscillations and one over f\u2019) (Haller et al., 2018) to extract periodic (centre frequency, amplitude, and bandwidth of alpha oscillations) and aperiodic (1/f slope and offset) components for comparison between age groups. \n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Statistical Analyses \n\nWe will use cluster-based statistics to examine age differences in peak alpha frequency and power (Aim 1), 1/f slope and offset (Aim 2), and the centre frequency, amplitude, and bandwidth of alpha oscillations after the aperiodic background is removed from the periodic signal (Aim 3). As an additional exploratory analysis, correlations between 1/f parameters and alpha peak frequency and power will be tested based on results from previous analyses.\n\nNon-parametric cluster based statistics will be used to protect against multiple comparison errors that appear when comparing across multiple spatial and temporal domains. Clusters will be defined as 2 or more neighboring electrodes with a P value &lt;0.05. A permutation distribution will be created using the Monte Carlo method (5000 permutations), and a cluster will be deemed significant if the cluster statistic (sum of all t-statistics within each cluster) is P &lt; 0.025 compared to the permutation distribution (two-tailed).", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=njzsf", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/au-1/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "au-1", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "njzsf", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "njzsf", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/sqzdf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "sqzdf", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7gext/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "7gext", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/njzsf/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/njzsf/"}}, {"id": "qw3kg", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Another\u2019s Pain in my Social Brain: The Effects of Placebo (Empathy) Analgesia on Social Behavior", "description": "The shared representations account of empathy suggests that sharing other people\u2019s emotions relies on neural processes similar to those engaged when experiencing such emotions oneself. Recent research corroborated this account by showing that experimentally reducing first-hand pain by means of placebo analgesia also resulted in reduced empathy for pain, and decreased activation in the shared neural networks. However, what has not been investigated yet, but is of much greater relevance, is whether the effects of placebo analgesia transfer to actual behavior. In other words, it is still not clear if the reduced empathic abilities, induced with placebo analgesia, have an influence on moral social behavior, that we show towards other, e.g. helping someone in need.
