This information is needed to correctly estimate biomass of these species in tiger diet and to devise strategies to increase tiger carrying capacity where habitat is fragmented and limited in west-central Thailand. We used temporally clumped locations of 24 satellite radio-collared tigers to identify their kill sites and obtained mandibles from 82 gaur and 79 banteng. Kills were aged by teeth eruption sequence, sectioning the M1 molar and counting cementum annuli. Of all gaur killed, 45.2% were adults; of all banteng killed 55.7% were adults.  The smaller proportion of large gaur killed by tigers may be due to size difference of these species.  The average weight of banteng killed was 423.9 kg, which was similar to the 397.9 kg average weight for gaur. The mean weight of both prey species is 3.5 to 4.5 times greater than the predicted 1:1 prey to predator ratio. In the absence of medium-sized prey, killing these larger animals may be especially critical for female tigers when provisioning nearly independent young when male offspring are already larger than the mother.

All participants first read a persuasive message. In the fatigue-relevant condition, participants were instructed to read an email from an overtired employee named George asking his boss explaining why he missed a project deadline and requesting an extension. In the fatigue-irrelevant condition, participants were instructed to read a communication regarding a new comprehensive exam policy at a large state university in the U.S.. The fatigue-relevant weak and strong arguments had been piloted for argument quality in prior work. The fatigue-irrelevant arguments were adapted to match the length of the other arguments in the study from Luttrell et al., 2017.\n\nFollowing this, all participants completed the primary dependent measures of persuasion, empathy and involvement. The question order for each of the following sections was randomized. The persuasion measure consisted of five 9-point semantic differentials assessing participants' evaluation of the message (example: \"To what extent do you think the communication made its point effectively?\" from \"not at all\" to \"completely;\" from Petty et al., 1977). They then completed 11 items from the 12-item Shen (2010) empathy scale using seven response options (example: \"I experienced the same emotions as the writer did when reading the article\" from \"Not at all\" to \"completely\"). The items used George as a referent in the fatigue-relevant condition and 'the writer' as a referent in the fatigue-irrelevant condition. Participant involvement in the message was assessed with the 10-item Personal Involvement Inventory (Zaichkowsky, 1994) with the referent adapted depending on the fatigue relevance condition. While all participants responded to the 10 items using 7-point semantic differentials (e.g., \"To me, X is unimportant-important, boring-interesting, etc.\"), the referent (X) was \"George's emailed request\" for those in the fatigue-relevant condition and \"the article\" in the fatigue-irrelevant condition. \n\nFollowing the main dependent measures, participants responded to manipulation checks on the argument quality manipulation. The first of these four items assessed their rating of the quality of the arguments using 11 options from \"Not very good arguments\" to \"Very good arguments.\" The other three manipulation checks measured the difficulty of the arguments, how hard they were to follow, and the extent to which they had a complex structure, each on an 8-point response scale from \"Not at all\" to \"Extremely.\"\n\nIn the next section of the survey, participants indicated the extent to which a series of 24 terms  applied to them at that moment. Most of these terms were distractor items, but seven items related to current fatigue: fatigued, tired, sleepy, drowsy, energetic, aware, and awake. \n\nThe next question was an attention check in which participants were instructed not to respond with their favorite color but with \"white\", with the question itself asking what their favorite color was. \n\nParticipants then completed the 18-item Need for Cognition scale (Petty, Cacioppo &amp; Kao, 1984) and the 28-item Interpersonal Reactivity Index (Davis, 1980). They provided their gender, age, and ethnicity, reported how seriously they took the study using five response options from \"I honestly blew through the questions and did not pay attention to the instructions\" to \"I took my time and answered thoughtfully.\" They were given a text box to enter any comments regarding typos or unclear instructions and read debriefing information.

Involvement tends to increase argument quality effects by enhancing message scrutiny (e.g., Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1990; Ajzen, Brown &amp; Rosenthal, 1996; Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1984; Petty, Cacioppo &amp; Schumann, 1983; Peck &amp; Wiggins Johnson, 2011; Oreg &amp; Sverdlik, 2014). \n\nA third possibility relates to a phenomenon known as the hot-cold empathy gap. This gap occurs between people in a visceral (hot) versus neutral (cold) state. Those currently in hot states (e.g., hungry, tired, etc.) better appreciate the impact of past or future hot states on themselves or others whereas those in cold states tend to underestimate the impact of hot states (Loewenstein, 1996, 2005). Empathy gaps have been demonstrated in contexts such as social pain (Nordgren, Banas, &amp; MacDonald, 2011), torture evaluations (Nordgren, McDonnell, &amp; Loewenstein, 2011), cigarette cravings (Sayette, Loewenstein, Griffin, &amp; Blankenship, 2008), and public speaking fear (Van Boven, Loewenstein, &amp; Dunning, 2005). \n\nFor example, Nordgren, van der Pligt, and van Harreveld (2007) manipulated participant fatigue by having some complete a difficult and others a mild memory task.

The fatigue-relevant weak and strong arguments had been piloted for argument quality in prior work. The fatigue-irrelevant arguments were adapted to match the length of the other arguments in the study from Luttrell et al., 2017.\n\nFollowing this, all participants completed the primary dependent measures of persuasion, empathy and involvement. The question order for each of the following sections was randomized. The persuasion measure consisted of five 9-point semantic differentials assessing participants' evaluation of the message (example: \"To what extent do you think the communication made its point effectively?\" from \"not at all\" to \"completely;\" from Petty et al., 1977). They then completed 11 items from the 12-item Shen (2010) empathy scale using seven response options (example: \"I experienced the same emotions as the writer did when reading the article\" from \"Not at all\" to \"completely\"). The items used George as a referent in the fatigue-relevant condition and 'the writer' as a referent in the fatigue-irrelevant condition. Participant involvement in the message was assessed with the 10-item Personal Involvement Inventory (Zaichkowsky, 1994) with the referent adapted depending on the fatigue relevance condition. While all participants responded to the 10 items using 7-point semantic differentials (e.g., \"To me, X is unimportant-important, boring-interesting, etc.\"), the referent (X) was \"George's emailed request\" for those in the fatigue-relevant condition and \"the article\" in the fatigue-irrelevant condition. \n\nFollowing the main dependent measures, participants responded to manipulation checks on the argument quality manipulation. The first of these four items assessed their rating of the quality of the arguments using 11 options from \"Not very good arguments\" to \"Very good arguments.\" The other three manipulation checks measured the difficulty of the arguments, how hard they were to follow, and the extent to which they had a complex structure, each on an 8-point response scale from \"Not at all\" to \"Extremely.\"\n\nIn the next section of the survey, participants indicated the extent to which a series of 24 terms  applied to them at that moment. Most of these terms were distractor items, but seven items related to current fatigue: fatigued, tired, sleepy, drowsy, energetic, aware, and awake. \n\nThe next question was an attention check in which participants were instructed not to respond with their favorite color but with \"white\", with the question itself asking what their favorite color was. \n\nParticipants then completed the 18-item Need for Cognition scale (Petty, Cacioppo &amp; Kao, 1984) and the 28-item Interpersonal Reactivity Index (Davis, 1980). They provided their gender, age, and ethnicity, reported how seriously they took the study using five response options from \"I honestly blew through the questions and did not pay attention to the instructions\" to \"I took my time and answered thoughtfully.\" They were given a text box to enter any comments regarding typos or unclear instructions and read debriefing information.
