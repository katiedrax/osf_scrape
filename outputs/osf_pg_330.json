(optional)\n\nThe main question within the present research is whether and to what extent emotions are used as a license for eating behavior in daily life, and what personal and/or demographical factors play a (underlying) role? \nQuestion 1) Is there a relationship between the intensity of experienced emotions prior to eating and the extent to which emotions are used as a justification to eat, and how is this relationship influenced by trait characteristics of restrained eating or emotional eating. \n\nEmotions and emotional justifications (eating during snack moments) \n1. Cross-level two way interaction:\nWe expect that the intensity of positive emotions prior to eating (POS_EMO_WM) shows a (small) positive relationship with the extent to which positive emotions were used as justifications to eat (LIC_POS_EMO_WM) at the level of snack moment,\nthis relationship will be stronger for those who (a) score high on restrained eating (RE-scale) or (B) emotional eating (SEES-subscale positive) at the person level. \n\n2. Cross-level two way interaction:\nWe expect that the intensity of negative emotions prior to eating (NEG_EMO_WM) shows a  (small) positive relationship with the extent to which negative emotions were used as justifications to eat (LIC_NEG_EMO_WM) at the level of snack moment, \nthis relationship will be stronger for those who (a) score high on restrained eating (RE-scale) or (B) emotional eating (SEES-subscale negative) at the person level. \n\nQuestion 2:  Whether and to what extent are emotions used as a license for eating behavior in terms of caloric intake, and how is this relationship influenced by trait characteristics of restrained eating or emotional eating.\n\n3. Cross-level two way interaction (within all snack moments):\nWe expect that licensing (Licensing_1) shows a (small) positive relationship with caloric intake (KCAL) at the level of snack moment, \nthis relationship will be stronger for those who score high on restrained eating (RE-scale) at the person level. \n\n4 .

(optional)\nDependent variable: caloric intake during snack moments. If participants registered an eating moment \u201cat night\u201d or an \u201cother moment\u201d, they registered the specific product(s) they ate and the amount (FREQ) they ate of each selected product. For each of these Snack moments, participants could register up to 10 different products (577-item list). Per snacking moment, the total amount of calories was computed by adding the caloric values (recodedvalues) of each product(PRODUCT) times its amount (FREQ).\n\n(e.g. A1_PRODUCT(recodedvalue)*A1_FREQ +  A2_PRODUCT(recodedvalue)*A2_FREQ  + \u2026etc.) Also see Codebook sheet Products for recoded values (kcal).\n\n\n4.\tHow many and which conditions will participants be assigned to? (optional)\nN/A\n\n5.\tSpecify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis. (optional)\n\n \tList predictors included in hypotheses: \n-Weighted mean of the intensity of experienced positive emotions prior to eating (POS_EMO_WM)\n -Weighted mean of the intensity of experienced negative emotions prior to eating (NEG_EMO_WM) \n-Weighted mean of the extent to which positive emotions were used as a justification to eat (LIC_ POS_EMO_WM)\n-Weighted mean of the extent to which negative emotions were used as a justification to (LIC_NEG_EMO_WM) \n- The degree to which justifications were used to eat (i.e. licensing) (Licensing_1) \n- SEES-subscales for positive and negative emotional eating (Meule, Reichenberger &amp; Blechert, 2018) \n-RE-scale for restrained eating (Herman &amp; Polivy, 1980)\n\nData transformation:\nPredictors on the person level will be centered around the grand mean (GMC), whereas predictors on the level of the snack moment will be centered around the person mean (PMC). Predictors with substantial variation at both levels, will be split into a person level variable (GMC) and a within person variable (PMC). A LOG (log e) transformation will be used if the dependent variable caloric intake (KCAL) is highly skewed.  \n\nAfter data transformation, all analyses will initially be performed including any remaining outliers on the dependent measures of caloric intake (KCAL). Additional analyses excluding outliers on caloric intake will be performed and will be reported if these additional results are inconsistent.  \n\nThe intensity of experienced positive emotions and negative emotions:\nWe will first analyze a new dichotomous variable (i.e. experienced positive (or negative) emotions: yes / no).  \nSecond, we will analyze only the subset in which positive (or negative) emotions were experienced (yes) and their magnitude on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 100 (Very much) (POS_EMO_WM and NEG_EMO_WM). \n\nThe extent to which positive emotions and negative emotions were used as justifications to eat: \nWe will first analyze a new dichotomous variable (i.e. positive (or negative) emotions used as justification to eat: yes / no).  \nSecond, we will analyze only the subset in which positive (or negative) emotions were used as a justification to eat (yes) and their magnitude on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 100 (very much) (LIC_ POS_EMO_WM and LIC_ NEG_EMO_WM). \n\n\nStatistical models:\nFor continuous outcome variables we will perform a hierarchical multilevel regression in SPSS, using the Linear Mixed Models program with Maximum Likelihood estimation. For dichotomous outcome variables (and highly skewed continuous outcome variables), a hierarchical multilevel regression in R will be performed, using the LME4-package, with the GLMER-procedure using Maximum Likelihood estimation (Laplace Approximation). \n\nThe hypotheses include cross-level two way and three way interactions: \nPredictors on the person level will be centered around the grand mean (GMC), whereas predictors on the level of the snack moment will be centered around the person mean (PMC). Predictors with substantial variation at both levels, will be split into a person level variable (GMC) and a within person variable (PMC). \n\nCompeting models will be tested using the deviance test (-2 log likelihood) to determine the improvement of fit by entering additional predictors in the model. If the deviance test proves significant (alpha-level = .05), individual regression weights will be tested (alpha-level = .05, two-tailed tests).\n\nStatistical Analysis Backup Plan: \nFor highly skewed continuous outcome variables, a hierarchical multilevel regression in R will be performed, using the LME4-package, with the GLMER-procedure using Maximum Likelihood estimation, and a lognormal distribution. \n\nInference criteria:\nIf the deviance test proves significant (alpha-level = .05), individual regression weights will be tested (alpha-level = .05, two-tailed tests).\n\n6.\tAny secondary analyses? (optional)\nSee 8. for additional information. \n\n7.\tHow many observations will be collected or what will determine the sample size? No need to justify decision, but be precise about exactly how the number will be determined. (optional)\n\nThe collected data set has participants N =186 (Screening), N = 181 (Step 1 Information), N = 165 (Step 3 Exit Survey), 3623 registered Eating Moments (Stap 2 Eating) and 5395 registered experienced emotions (Stap 2 Mood). \n\nAt this moment, there is no consensus regarding the requirements to conduct power analyses for the multilevel analyses that are considered for the present research. \n\nA power calculation based on linear mixed effects simulation in R (5000 iterations) showed that a sample of 120 will have sufficient power at the level of the on the level of the snack moment (0.89) and person level (0.80) to detect a small interaction effect between (positive /negative) emotions experienced prior to eating (\u03b2 = 0.06) and licensing (\u03b2 = 0.15), on caloric intake (KCAL) at an alpha of 0.05. Assuming an interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.30 and on average, a b-weight of 0.015 for restrained eating at the person level and 15 snack moments per participants. \n\n\n8.\tAnything else you would like to pre-register? (e.g., data exclusions, variables collected for exploratory purposes, unusual analyses planned?) (optional)\n\nPrior research activity (see prior work: https://osf.io/9yzn7/):\nThe following demographics and sample characteristics were previously assessed for descriptive purposes . \n- Body Mass Index (SC_BMI). Body mass index was calculated based on reported current weight (Q39) and height (Q38). \n- Goal motivation (scale: GOAL_5, GOAL_6, GOAL_7, GOAL_8, GOAL_9). Participants rated the motivation to achieve their goal to lose or maintain weight, all items were scored on scales ranging from 0 (not at all) to 100 (very much).  \n- Eating concerns. Three items were used to assess overall eating concerns (Prinsen, Evers, &amp; De Ridder, 2016): \u201cDo you watch your weight?\u201d, \u201cDo you watch what you eat in order to lose weight or to not gain weight?\u201d, and \u201dDo you watch what you eat for your general health?\u201d. Items were scored on scales ranging from 0 (not at all) to 100 (very much). \n- Diet goal (SC_GOAL),\n- Gender (geslacht)\n- Age (END_Age), \n- Education (edu) \n\nThe following measures were previously assessed with single items on scales ranging from 0 (not at all) to 100 (very much), based on the variables collected for each eating occasion (see codebook: sheet Stap 2 Eetpatroon (eating)). \n- Self-licensing: \u201cTo what degree did you just use a justification to eat/drink?\u201d (Licensing_1). \n- Temptation motivation: \u201cHow strongly did you desire what you just ate/drank?\u201d (MOT_TEMP_1). \n- Goal motivation: \u201cHow important was your goal to lose- or maintain weight when you were just about to eat/drink?\u201d (MOT_GOAL_1). \n- To assess the relative balance between competing motivations we calculated difference scores similar to Studies 1 and 2 by subtracting goal motivation (MOT_GOAL_1) from temptation motivation (MOT_TEMP_1). \n- Experienced food intake: \"How much did you just eat/drink?\" (SUB_intake_1) on a scale of 0 (too little) to 100 (too much).  \n\nData Inclusion/exclusion: \nWe will use data from the following datasets: Screening, Step 1 Information, Step 3 Exit Survey as well the collected data on eating (Step 2 Eating) and emotions (Stap 2 Mood). \nAll participants who have complete data for the datasets: Screening, Step 1 Information and Step 3 Exit Survey will be included. \n\nLinking emotions (Stap 2 Stemming) to snack moment (Stap 2 Eetpatroon): \n- We will only include snack moments which were preceded by registration of experienced emotions. We will link the registered experienced emotions to a snack moment in the following way: \n- Each snack moment will be linked to the last emotional experience that was registered prior to that eating occasion in time. \n-Only snack moments that are registered within 180 minutes following the last emotion measurement are included.\n- The registered emotional experience will only be linked to a single snack moment. In other words, if registration of experienced emotions is followed by registration of two or more subsequent eating occasions, we will only include the first eating occasion. \n- Each morning 06:00 is a new starting point. \n\n\nMissing data:\nAny rows including missing datapoints on a specific variable will be excluded from analyses including that variable. \nFor example, we already anticipate that there will be missing values for certain food products. If participants could not indicate a food product in the provided product list (see Codebook: sheet products) they could choose the option \u201cOverig /Other\u201d. In this case, there is a missing value (9999) for any one of the PRODUCT variables (A1 to A10) that are included for the dependent variable caloric intake (KCAL).  All rows including missing data on KCAL will be excluded from analyses.\n\nExploratory analyses:\n\nWe will explore the possible contribution of demographical characteristics to the describe confirmatory analyses: \nSex (geslacht), ethnicity (ethnic), Income (Inkomen), Age (END_AGE), Body Mass Index (EXIT_BMI) and/or exercise behavior (Exercise_min). \n\nWe will repeat the confirmatory analyses as exploratory analyses at the level of meals instead of snack moment, including only breakfast, lunch, dinner. \n\nWe will explore any possible correlations and/or interactions at the level of snack moment (excluding breakfast, lunch, dinner) OR at the level of meals (including breakfast, lunch, dinner): \n\nBetween licensing (Licensing_1), OR positive emotional justifications to eat (LIC_POS_EMO_WM), OR negative emotional justifications to eat (LIC_NEG_EMO_WM), positive emotions, OR positive emotions prior to eating (POS_EMO_WM) , OR negative emotions prior to eating (NEG_EMO_WM)  on the one hand (IV\u2019s), \nAND perceived food intake (SUB_intake_1) restrained eating (RESTR_EAT_1), guilt (GUILT_1) on the other hand (DV\u2019s). \n\n And in turn, we will explore any possible cross-level correlations OR interactions at the \n person level based on restrained eating (RE-scale), emotional eating (SEES subscale \n positive or negative), emotion regulation (ERQ-scale), Trait Self-Control (SC-scale).   \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"summary": "Participating Authors:\nC.

In this case, there is a missing value (9999) for any one of the PRODUCT variables (A1 to A10) that are included for the dependent variable caloric intake (KCAL).  All rows including missing data on KCAL will be excluded from analyses.\n\nExploratory analyses:\n\nWe will explore the possible contribution of demographical characteristics to the describe confirmatory analyses: \nSex (geslacht), ethnicity (ethnic), Income (Inkomen), Age (END_AGE), Body Mass Index (EXIT_BMI) and/or exercise behavior (Exercise_min). \n\nWe will repeat the confirmatory analyses as exploratory analyses at the level of meals instead of snack moment, including only breakfast, lunch, dinner. \n\nWe will explore any possible correlations and/or interactions at the level of snack moment (excluding breakfast, lunch, dinner) OR at the level of meals (including breakfast, lunch, dinner): \n\nBetween licensing (Licensing_1), OR positive emotional justifications to eat (LIC_POS_EMO_WM), OR negative emotional justifications to eat (LIC_NEG_EMO_WM), positive emotions, OR positive emotions prior to eating (POS_EMO_WM) , OR negative emotions prior to eating (NEG_EMO_WM)  on the one hand (IV\u2019s), \nAND perceived food intake (SUB_intake_1) restrained eating (RESTR_EAT_1), guilt (GUILT_1) on the other hand (DV\u2019s). \n\n And in turn, we will explore any possible cross-level correlations OR interactions at the \n person level based on restrained eating (RE-scale), emotional eating (SEES subscale \n positive or negative), emotion regulation (ERQ-scale), Trait Self-Control (SC-scale).   \n", "uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wcb8h/children/?format=json",

approach on skill acquisition of procedures in health professions education: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\nBACKGROUND\nAcquisition of procedures is an important element in health professions education. Traditionally procedures are taught using the \u201csee one - do one\u201d approach. That is a teacher demonstrates and describes a procedure and afterwards the students practice the procedure. A more recent teaching approach was presented by Peyton (1998). Peyton\u2019s approach consists of four steps. Step 1 refers to the demonstration of the procedure in real time; within step 2 the teacher demonstrates the procedure and describes each procedural sub-step; the student talks the trainer through in step 3 and in step 4 the students performs the procedure.\n\nREVIEW QUESTION\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of Peyton\u2019s 4 step teaching method on the acquisition of procedural skills in health professions education.\n\nSEARCHES\nWe will search the following electronic databases for eligible studies: Medline via OVID, PsycInfo, Embase and ERIC. There will be no restrictions regarding recency or publication language. The search strategy will be build using two blocks. The first block will consist of terms relevant for the identification of the population (i.e. students in health professions education). We will search for keywords and map the keywords to relevant subject headings. The second block will be designed to identify studies using Peyton\u2019s teaching approach.\n\nThe following search strategy will be used in Medline:\n#\tSearches\n1\tschools, medical.mp. or Schools, Medical/\n2\tschools, nursing.mp. or Schools, Nursing/\n3\tschools, health occupations.mp. or Schools, Health Occupations/\n4\teducation, professional.mp. or Education, Professional/\n5\teducation medical.mp. or Education, Medical/\n6\teducation pharmacy.mp. or Education, Pharmacy/\n7\teducation dental.mp. or Education, Dental/\n8\tPhysical Therapy Modalities/ or education physiotherapy.mp.\n9\t1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8\n10\tPeyton.mp.\n11\t4 step.mp.\n12\tfour step.mp.\n13\tdeconstructive teaching.mp.\n14\tsee one do one teach one.mp.\n15\tsee one do one.mp.\n16\tPeyton four-step.mp.\n17\tPeytons four-step.mp.\n18\t10 or 11 or 12 or 13 or 14 or 15 or 16 or 17\n19\tresident*.mp.\n20\tstudent*.mp.\n21\ttraine*.mp.\n22\t19 or 20 or 21\n23\t9 or 22\n24\t18 and 23\n\nThe search strategy will be amended to meet the requirements of the other databases.\n\nTYPES OF STUDIES TO BE INCLUDED\nRandomised controlled trials will be included. Cross over studies will be eligible as well presumed that sufficient data is available. \n\nCONDITION OR DOMAIN BEING STUDIED\nAcquisition of procedural skills in health professions education. \n\nPARTICIPANTS\nWe will include studies reporting about students in health professions education. Health professions education is used as an umbrella term for medical and allied health profession education. We will include studies reporting about pre-graduate and postgraduate students.\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nStudies need to investigate Peyton\u2019s four-step approach.\n\nCOMPARATOR\nStudies need to have a comparator group. The comparator can be a specific educational intervention, educational practice a usual or a sham intervention.\n\nMAIN OUTCOME\nThe primary outcome for this review will be the evaluation of procedural skills. These can be evaluated using a procedure specific checklist or a global rating scale. To be included studies have to report on this outcome.\n\nADDITONAL OUTCOMES\nThe secondary outcome will be the time needed to perform the procedure.\n\nSTUDY SELECTION\nRecords will be screened by two independent reviewers. Disagreements will be solved by discussion. \n\nDATA EXTRACTION\nTwo reviewers will independently extract relevant data into an electronic database.\n\nRISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT\nThe risk of bias will be evaluated with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. A human reviewer will evaluate all included studies. Evaluations will be compared against a machine learning classification of the risk of bias with the application \u201cRobotReviewer\u201d (Marshall et al., 2015). Disagreements will be solved by discussion with a third person.\n\nSTRATEGY FOR DATA SYNTHESIS\nThe primary endpoint for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the comparisons will be at the end of the intervention. A secondary analysis will be performed using data from the longest available follow up endpoint.\nData analysis\nThe analysis will be performed using the statistical software package R. A meta-analysis of pairwise comparisons will be performed using the meta package (Schwarzer, 2007). A random effects model will be used for the analysis and effectiveness will be reported using standardized effect sizes (hedges\u2019 g) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Effect sizes will be interpreted following Cohen (1992). Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed with I2 statistic using the guidelines presented in the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions (Higgins and Green, 2011). If possible, we will perform a meta-regression and potential moderator variables such as the student teach ratio will be explored.\n\nREFERENCES\nCOHEN, J. 1992. A power primer.

Low NED has been linked to depression, autism spectrum disorders, aggression, alcohol use disorders, and social anxiety disorder (see Smidt &amp; Suvak, 2015 for a review). Across numerous samples and studies, low NED has been linked to heightened negative affect (NA) intensity (Boden, Thompson, Diz\u00e9n, Berenbaum, &amp; Baker, 2013; Erbas et al., 2019; Erbas, Ceulemans, Lee Pe, Koval, &amp; Kuppens, 2014) and stronger reactivity to daily negative events and experiences (Boden et al., 2013; Starr, Hershenberg, Li, &amp; Shaw, 2017). Importantly, interventions aimed at improving NED such as mindfulness and emotional awareness training prove promising for reducing negative outcomes and improving well-being and adaptive emotion regulation (Kashdan, Barrett, &amp; McKnight, 2015; Van der Gucht et al., 2019). \n\nPositive emotion differentiation (PED) has been understudied compared to NED. This is likely due to several preliminary findings that failed to find a significant link between PED and depression. However, PED may be linked to coping skills (Tugade, Fredrickson, &amp; Feldman Barrett, 2004). Specifically, those with high PED are more likely to be attentive to their affective responses and the situations that elicited them, are more likely to take time to choose adaptive coping strategies and are less likely to respond spontaneously or impulsively. Furthermore, Smidt &amp; Suvak (2015) reported that higher PED was associated with less endorsement of alcohol related problems. Lastly, higher PED has been associated with less affect intensity and variability at state and trait levels (Boden et al., 2013; Demiralp et al., 2012). Lastly, Starr et al. (2017) reported that low PED was associated with less PA reactivity to positive experiences. \n\nThe current study aimed to examine the association of NED and PED with NA and PA intensity, variability, and reactivity in daily life in several diverse undergraduate samples. We aimed to do so in three independent samples that completed experience sampling methodology (ESM) protocols assessing momentary affect, stress, and experiences and in one sample that completed daily diary studies of affect, stress, and experiences. We included both ESM and daily diary studies in an effort to examine whether these relationships are dependent on timescale of measurement.

Two publications resulted from this sample (Sperry &amp; Kwapil, 2017; Sperry, Lynam, &amp; Kwapil, 2018); however, no related analyses have been conducted related to the present goals. We have yet to calculate emotion differentiation values or affect variability in this sample and thus are blind to any descriptive characteristics related to the variables included in the present study. \n\nS2: The data used in sample 2 come from a study of affective dynamics in an unselected college student sample conducted by the first author (SHS) and supervised by the senior author (TRK). One publication (Sperry &amp; Kwapil, 2019a) examined the association of bipolar spectrum psychopathology, as measured by the Hypomanic Personality Scale, with affect intensity, variability, instability, and inertia in daily life. Thus, descriptive statistics and inter-correlations of NA and PA intensity and variability are known prior to pre-registration. A second manuscript is currently under revision that examines state-trait models of affect intensity and variability between the Affect Intensity Measure and Affective Lability Scale with ESM measures of intensity and lability (Sperry &amp; Kwapil, 2019c). Importantly, we have yet to calculate emotion differentiation values in this data set and thus are blind to the results of any analyses proposed in the present pre-registration.\n\nS3: The data used in sample 3 come from a study of affective dynamics in a college sample oversampled for bipolar spectrum psychopathology conducted by the first author (SHS) and supervised by the senior author (TRK). Several publications are currently under review or under revision with this data set: \n1: We examined associations between bipolar spectrum psychopathology, as measured by the Hypomanic Personality Scale, with affect variability, instability, and inertia across multiple timescales (within-day, between-day; (Sperry &amp; Kwapil, 2019b). We did not examine NED or PED in this manuscript.\n2: We examined the extent to which trait emotional awareness (emotional clarity and attention to emotion) moderated and mediated the association between bipolar spectrum psychopathology and affect intensity and instability in daily life (Sperry &amp; Kwapil, 2019d). We did not examine NED or PED in this manuscript. \n3: We examined typologies, or emotion processing styles, and whether they had differential patterns of affective dynamics in daily life (Sperry &amp; Eckland, under review). We did not examine NED or PED in this manuscript.\n\nBased on the pre-registration of the parent study (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/XJNFD), we did calculate emotion differentiation (called granularity in initial pre-registration) values for NA and PA as we hypothesized that those high on the HPS would have lower NA and PA granularity (Hypothesis 2.1). Furthermore, we hypothesized that low granularity would moderate the association of bipolar spectrum psychopathology and reactivity (Hypothesis 2.4). Thus, we are aware of descriptive statistics for NED and PED in this sample prior to this pre-registration. Furthermore, in examining hypothesis 2.4 from the parent study, we observed that both low NED and PED were associated with greater emotion reactivity in daily life. \n\nS4: No papers have been published using the data from sample 4. An accepted poster and paper (Castro, Eckland, Sperry, &amp; Berenbaum, in prep), have examined associations between baseline measures of depression and worry with emotion differentiation, intensity, and frequency in daily life. We have not examined and do not plan to examine the inter-relationships between emotion differentiation, intensity, and frequency as a part of that paper. Further, intensity and frequency are measured at the level of the item (i.e, using specific emotions) rather than being aggregated into positive and negative affect. One other paper is in preparation from these data (Sperry &amp; Eckland, in prep), examining bi-directional associations between stress and alcohol use in a subset of participants (n = 273). The only overlapping measures are intensity of positive and negative affect. There are no overlapping analyses.  \n"}, "q12": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "S1 (n=222)\n\nParticipants. Participants were enrolled via two methods. First, enrollment was open to any students who were currently enrolled in general psychology courses at University of North Carolina at Greensboro. We also recruited elevated scorers on the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS) or the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale. All participants who score at least 1.5 standard deviations above the mean on the HPS or any of the UPPS-P subscales in mass screening were invited to participate to ensure adequate representation of high scorers on the scales. Low scorers on the scales were also included in the contact list to ensure that experimenters were unaware of HPS and UPPS-P scores. Usable data were available for 222 of the 283 enrolled participants (71.6% female, 52.7% Caucasian, Age = 18.81, SD = 3.19).  Participants were dropped for endorsing more than 2 infrequency items while completing self-report questionnaires (n = 10) or for having problematic ESM protocols (n=51). Note that participants were dropped if they completed less than 15 ESM surveys or when they had an excess of invalid ESM protocols (variance associated with responding &lt; - 1.5 SD below the mean). In addition to course credit, participants who completed at least 70% of the ESM questionnaires were entered into a drawing each semester for $100 gift cards.\n\nProcedures. Participants attended a one-hour information session in which they completed self-report questionnaires of personality and psychopathology. After completing self-report questionnaires, research assistants described the procedures for the ESM study and participants completed a practice ESM questionnaire. Participants completed ESM surveys on their personal smartphones through two methods. The initial 69 participants were notified via text message to complete the ESM surveys using the UNCG Qualtrics system. Their cellphones signaled them and administered and time-stamped the ESM questionnaires and their responses were uploaded to Qualtrics. The remaining 153 participants completed the ESM questionnaires through an ESM application, MetricWire (Trafford, 2015), which was downloaded on participants\u2019 phones during the information session. The MetricWire app administered questionnaires and uploaded results to their server. Both methods signaled participants eight times daily between noon and midnight for 7 days to complete the same questionnaire. \nParticipants were told that they must begin the surveys within 5 minutes of the signal, after which the link expired (Qualtrics) or the survey disappeared (MetricWire), ensuring that participants did not skip questionnaires and complete them at a later time. The ESM questionnaires required approximately two minutes to complete. Participants returned to the lab for one follow-up session mid-way through their participation to ensure appropriate practices and to troubleshoot any problems.\n\nS2 (n = 135) \n\nParticipants. Non-clinically ascertained young adults (n = 147) enrolled in the study via an online course-credit portal for students in general psychology courses at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Usable data were available for 135 participants. Participants were dropped due to invalid questionnaires (n=4), completing less than 15 ESM protocols (n=5), and variance of their ESM response less than -1.75 SD below the mean (n=3) indicating invalid ESM responding. Demographic characteristics for the full and final samples did not differ. The final sample was representative of the racial and ethnic background of the psychology department at the host university as well as other large public universities in the United States (59% female, 46% Caucasian, Age = 18.44, SD = 8.09. This study was approved by the UIUC IRB and participants provided informed consent. \n\nProcedures. Participants attended an information session during which they downloaded Metricwire on their smartphone, completed self-report questionnaires, were trained on ESM procedures, and completed a practice ESM survey that was not included in the final data. Participants were notified to complete ESM surveys 8 times daily between noon and midnight for seven and a half days at stratified random intervals (randomized within eight, 90-minute blocks). Participants had five minutes to respond, after which the ESM survey was no longer available. Participants came to the lab once during the week to encourage adequate responding.   \n\nS3 (n=233)\n\nParticipants. A total of 352 undergraduate students were enrolled into the study via two methods. First, any participants in the course-credit subject pool were able to sign up for the study. Second, participants who scored at least 1.5 standard deviations above the mean on the HPS screening items that were included in the departmental pre-screening questionnaire were invited to participate. This recruitment method has been successfully used before to ensure adequate inclusion of high scoring participants. Undergraduates have been widely used in studies of bipolar spectrum psychopathology and are appropriate in that they are just entering into the period of greatest risk for developing bipolar disorders. Additionally, college students with elevated scores on the HPS report bipolar symptoms and have elevated risk for bipolar disorders (Kwapil et al., 2000; Walsh et al., 2015). The final sample included 233 participants with usable data. Participants were excluded from analyses (n = 119) due to technical difficulties with ESM data collection (n = 49), too few ESM questionnaires (&lt;20 per week; n = 61), withdrawal due to time constraints (n = 5), and invalid responding (n = 4). Exclusion criteria regarding number of completed ESM questionnaires was based on two factors. First, the Hox ratio defines adequate power to detect intraindividual variability as at least 20 observations nested within the individual (Hox, 2002). Importantly, planned missing-data monte carlo simulations show minimal bias on parameter estimates at the floor of 20 questionnaires (Silvia, Kwapil, Walsh, &amp; Myin-Germeys, 2014). Second, in order to compute indices of instability, it is important to have enough ESM questionnaires per day to adequately assess successive differences. Note that there was a larger rate of exclusions than proposed in the initial pre-registration . Participants received course credit and those who completed at least 70% of the ESM questionnaires were entered into a drawing for a $100 gift card. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and all participants signed informed consent. \n\nProcedures. Participants first completed a one-hour information session during which they were administered the self-report questionnaires and instructed on ESM procedures using either the ESM application Metricwire or Expimetrics on their smartphone. Participants completed a full practice trial before leaving the lab (not included in analyses). We switched from Metricwire to Expimetrics mid-study; however, participants\u2019 experience of completing surveys on Metricwire and Expimetrics was largely identical. Participants completed ESM questionnaires for 14 days in their normal daily environment. They were prompted eight times daily between 10am and 10pm at random times within stratified 90 minutes intervals. Participants were instructed to begin the surveys within 10 minutes of the signal, after which the link to the survey expired, ensuring that participants could not skip questionnaires and complete them later. The ESM questionnaire required approximately two minutes to complete. Participants returned to the lab for two follow-up sessions, mid-way through each week of participation. These follow-up sessions are a standard part of our procedures and are included to motivate participation, ensure appropriate practices, and troubleshoot problems. \n\n\nS4 (n = 362)\n\nParticipants. Participants were 362 undergraduate students (70.2% female) who were recruited from a large Midwestern university. Their average age was 19 (SD=1.3). The sample was 50.3% White, 30.9% Asian or Asian-American, 13.5% Latino/Hispanic, 5.8% African-American, and 13% other or multiracial. All participants individually consented to be a part of the study and were compensated with course credit.\nProcedures. Participants attended a 15-minute lab session in which they completed self-report measures. Following the competition of the self-reports, a research assistant explained the daily diaries to participants and walked them through a daily survey. Participants were given the opportunity to ask clarification questions about any of the items on the daily survey before leaving the lab. Starting the day after their lab session, the participants received a survey at 9 pm via email, sent through Qualtrics, each night for seven nights. \n\n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "S1 (n=222)\n\nPower. Determination of power and sample sizes in multilevel designs is considerably more complicated in part because the optimal sample size for estimating one parameter in a multilevel design may not be the optimal sample size for estimating a different parameter (Snijders &amp; Bosker, 1999). Hox (2002) advocates the \u201c50/20\u201d rule for assessing cross-level interactions which suggested that the study should have a minimum of 20 measurements nested within a minimum of 50 participants. Each of the studies exceeded this sample size, and the protocol required that participants complete a minimum of 15 ESM questionnaires.\n\nS2 (n = 135) \n\nPower. Monte Carlo Simulation is the most appropriate method for determining power and sample size in multilevel data. Post-hoc power was computed via Monte Carlo Simulation based on recommendations by Heck and Thomas (2015). Using assumed population values (produced by saving model estimates based on 135 participants), entering all parameters, and specifying 500 replications, power was estimated at .80 for examining direct effects between level 2 and level 1 measures. Additionally, using 500 replications, power was estimated to be .69 for determining cross-level interactions.  \n\nS3 (n=233)\nPower. Using 135 participants from preliminary findings (Sperry &amp; Kwapil, 2019), we estimated two models using assumed population values (produced by saving model estimations based on pilot data), entering all parameters, and specifying 500 replications. For 135 participants with an average of 37 observations nested within person, power was estimated at 0.80 for detecting direct effects and .69 for cross-level interactions. Sample sizes for Pearson correlations and linear regressions were determined using G*Power (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007). For a bivariate normal correlation, a sample size of 193 individuals was sufficient to detect small effects with 80% power. We calculated sample size for linear regressions based on R2 increase in a three-step model with three predictors \u2013 suggesting a sample size of 247.\n\nS4 (n = 362)\n\nPower.

Low NED has been linked to depression, autism spectrum disorders, aggression, alcohol use disorders, and social anxiety disorder (see Smidt &amp; Suvak, 2015 for a review). Across numerous samples and studies, low NED has been linked to heightened negative affect (NA) intensity (Boden, Thompson, Diz\u00e9n, Berenbaum, &amp; Baker, 2013; Erbas et al., 2019; Erbas, Ceulemans, Lee Pe, Koval, &amp; Kuppens, 2014) and stronger reactivity to daily negative events and experiences (Boden et al., 2013; Starr, Hershenberg, Li, &amp; Shaw, 2017). Importantly, interventions aimed at improving NED such as mindfulness and emotional awareness training prove promising for reducing negative outcomes and improving well-being and adaptive emotion regulation (Kashdan, Barrett, &amp; McKnight, 2015; Van der Gucht et al., 2019). \n\nPositive emotion differentiation (PED) has been understudied compared to NED. This is likely due to several preliminary findings that failed to find a significant link between PED and depression. However, PED may be linked to coping skills (Tugade, Fredrickson, &amp; Feldman Barrett, 2004). Specifically, those with high PED are more likely to be attentive to their affective responses and the situations that elicited them, are more likely to take time to choose adaptive coping strategies and are less likely to respond spontaneously or impulsively. Furthermore, Smidt &amp; Suvak (2015) reported that higher PED was associated with less endorsement of alcohol related problems. Lastly, higher PED has been associated with less affect intensity and variability at state and trait levels (Boden et al., 2013; Demiralp et al., 2012). Lastly, Starr et al. (2017) reported that low PED was associated with less PA reactivity to positive experiences. \n\nThe current study aimed to examine the association of NED and PED with NA and PA intensity, variability, and reactivity in daily life in several diverse undergraduate samples. We aimed to do so in three independent samples that completed experience sampling methodology (ESM) protocols assessing momentary affect, stress, and experiences and in one sample that completed daily diary studies of affect, stress, and experiences. We included both ESM and daily diary studies in an effort to examine whether these relationships are dependent on timescale of measurement.

Furthermore, we hypothesized that low granularity would moderate the association of bipolar spectrum psychopathology and reactivity (Hypothesis 2.4).

Hox (2002) advocates the \u201c50/20\u201d rule for assessing cross-level interactions which suggested that the study should have a minimum of 20 measurements nested within a minimum of 50 participants. Each of the studies exceeded this sample size, and the protocol required that participants complete a minimum of 15 ESM questionnaires.\n\nS2 (n = 135) \n\nPower. Monte Carlo Simulation is the most appropriate method for determining power and sample size in multilevel data. Post-hoc power was computed via Monte Carlo Simulation based on recommendations by Heck and Thomas (2015). Using assumed population values (produced by saving model estimates based on 135 participants), entering all parameters, and specifying 500 replications, power was estimated at .80 for examining direct effects between level 2 and level 1 measures. Additionally, using 500 replications, power was estimated to be .69 for determining cross-level interactions.  \n\nS3 (n=233)\nPower. Using 135 participants from preliminary findings (Sperry &amp; Kwapil, 2019), we estimated two models using assumed population values (produced by saving model estimations based on pilot data), entering all parameters, and specifying 500 replications. For 135 participants with an average of 37 observations nested within person, power was estimated at 0.80 for detecting direct effects and .69 for cross-level interactions. Sample sizes for Pearson correlations and linear regressions were determined using G*Power (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007). For a bivariate normal correlation, a sample size of 193 individuals was sufficient to detect small effects with 80% power. We calculated sample size for linear regressions based on R2 increase in a three-step model with three predictors \u2013 suggesting a sample size of 247.\n\nS4 (n = 362)\n\nPower. This was an exploratory study of emotions and emotion regulation in daily life. Since the goals of the study were exploratory, we made an a priori decision to collect data over two semesters.

Participants were enrolled via two methods. First, enrollment was open to any students who were currently enrolled in general psychology courses at University of North Carolina at Greensboro. We also recruited elevated scorers on the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS) or the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale. All participants who score at least 1.5 standard deviations above the mean on the HPS or any of the UPPS-P subscales in mass screening were invited to participate to ensure adequate representation of high scorers on the scales. Low scorers on the scales were also included in the contact list to ensure that experimenters were unaware of HPS and UPPS-P scores. Usable data were available for 222 of the 283 enrolled participants (71.6% female, 52.7% Caucasian, Age = 18.81, SD = 3.19).  Participants were dropped for endorsing more than 2 infrequency items while completing self-report questionnaires (n = 10) or for having problematic ESM protocols (n=51). Note that participants were dropped if they completed less than 15 ESM surveys or when they had an excess of invalid ESM protocols (variance associated with responding &lt; - 1.5 SD below the mean). In addition to course credit, participants who completed at least 70% of the ESM questionnaires were entered into a drawing each semester for $100 gift cards.\n\nProcedures. Participants attended a one-hour information session in which they completed self-report questionnaires of personality and psychopathology. After completing self-report questionnaires, research assistants described the procedures for the ESM study and participants completed a practice ESM questionnaire. Participants completed ESM surveys on their personal smartphones through two methods. The initial 69 participants were notified via text message to complete the ESM surveys using the UNCG Qualtrics system. Their cellphones signaled them and administered and time-stamped the ESM questionnaires and their responses were uploaded to Qualtrics. The remaining 153 participants completed the ESM questionnaires through an ESM application, MetricWire (Trafford, 2015), which was downloaded on participants\u2019 phones during the information session. The MetricWire app administered questionnaires and uploaded results to their server. Both methods signaled participants eight times daily between noon and midnight for 7 days to complete the same questionnaire. \nParticipants were told that they must begin the surveys within 5 minutes of the signal, after which the link expired (Qualtrics) or the survey disappeared (MetricWire), ensuring that participants did not skip questionnaires and complete them at a later time. The ESM questionnaires required approximately two minutes to complete. Participants returned to the lab for one follow-up session mid-way through their participation to ensure appropriate practices and to troubleshoot any problems.\n\nS2 (n = 135) \n\nParticipants. Non-clinically ascertained young adults (n = 147) enrolled in the study via an online course-credit portal for students in general psychology courses at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Usable data were available for 135 participants. Participants were dropped due to invalid questionnaires (n=4), completing less than 15 ESM protocols (n=5), and variance of their ESM response less than -1.75 SD below the mean (n=3) indicating invalid ESM responding. Demographic characteristics for the full and final samples did not differ. The final sample was representative of the racial and ethnic background of the psychology department at the host university as well as other large public universities in the United States (59% female, 46% Caucasian, Age = 18.44, SD = 8.09. This study was approved by the UIUC IRB and participants provided informed consent. \n\nProcedures. Participants attended an information session during which they downloaded Metricwire on their smartphone, completed self-report questionnaires, were trained on ESM procedures, and completed a practice ESM survey that was not included in the final data. Participants were notified to complete ESM surveys 8 times daily between noon and midnight for seven and a half days at stratified random intervals (randomized within eight, 90-minute blocks). Participants had five minutes to respond, after which the ESM survey was no longer available. Participants came to the lab once during the week to encourage adequate responding.   \n\nS3 (n=233)\n\nParticipants. A total of 352 undergraduate students were enrolled into the study via two methods. First, any participants in the course-credit subject pool were able to sign up for the study. Second, participants who scored at least 1.5 standard deviations above the mean on the HPS screening items that were included in the departmental pre-screening questionnaire were invited to participate. This recruitment method has been successfully used before to ensure adequate inclusion of high scoring participants. Undergraduates have been widely used in studies of bipolar spectrum psychopathology and are appropriate in that they are just entering into the period of greatest risk for developing bipolar disorders. Additionally, college students with elevated scores on the HPS report bipolar symptoms and have elevated risk for bipolar disorders (Kwapil et al., 2000; Walsh et al., 2015). The final sample included 233 participants with usable data. Participants were excluded from analyses (n = 119) due to technical difficulties with ESM data collection (n = 49), too few ESM questionnaires (&lt;20 per week; n = 61), withdrawal due to time constraints (n = 5), and invalid responding (n = 4). Exclusion criteria regarding number of completed ESM questionnaires was based on two factors. First, the Hox ratio defines adequate power to detect intraindividual variability as at least 20 observations nested within the individual (Hox, 2002). Importantly, planned missing-data monte carlo simulations show minimal bias on parameter estimates at the floor of 20 questionnaires (Silvia, Kwapil, Walsh, &amp; Myin-Germeys, 2014). Second, in order to compute indices of instability, it is important to have enough ESM questionnaires per day to adequately assess successive differences. Note that there was a larger rate of exclusions than proposed in the initial pre-registration . Participants received course credit and those who completed at least 70% of the ESM questionnaires were entered into a drawing for a $100 gift card. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and all participants signed informed consent. \n\nProcedures. Participants first completed a one-hour information session during which they were administered the self-report questionnaires and instructed on ESM procedures using either the ESM application Metricwire or Expimetrics on their smartphone. Participants completed a full practice trial before leaving the lab (not included in analyses). We switched from Metricwire to Expimetrics mid-study; however, participants\u2019 experience of completing surveys on Metricwire and Expimetrics was largely identical. Participants completed ESM questionnaires for 14 days in their normal daily environment. They were prompted eight times daily between 10am and 10pm at random times within stratified 90 minutes intervals. Participants were instructed to begin the surveys within 10 minutes of the signal, after which the link to the survey expired, ensuring that participants could not skip questionnaires and complete them later. The ESM questionnaire required approximately two minutes to complete. Participants returned to the lab for two follow-up sessions, mid-way through each week of participation. These follow-up sessions are a standard part of our procedures and are included to motivate participation, ensure appropriate practices, and troubleshoot problems. \n\n\nS4 (n = 362)\n\nParticipants. Participants were 362 undergraduate students (70.2% female) who were recruited from a large Midwestern university. Their average age was 19 (SD=1.3). The sample was 50.3% White, 30.9% Asian or Asian-American, 13.5% Latino/Hispanic, 5.8% African-American, and 13% other or multiracial. All participants individually consented to be a part of the study and were compensated with course credit.\nProcedures. Participants attended a 15-minute lab session in which they completed self-report measures. Following the competition of the self-reports, a research assistant explained the daily diaries to participants and walked them through a daily survey. Participants were given the opportunity to ask clarification questions about any of the items on the daily survey before leaving the lab. Starting the day after their lab session, the participants received a survey at 9 pm via email, sent through Qualtrics, each night for seven nights. \n\n\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "\n\n", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "All momentary affect items have the item stem \u201cRight now, I feel\u2026.\u201d All items were answered on a scale of 1: Not at all to 7: Very much. \n\nMomentary Negative Affect: \n\tS1: Irritable, frustrated, sad, anxious, bored\nS2: Sad, bored, nervous, sluggish, angry, afraid, irritable \nS3: Sad, bored, angry, nervous, afraid, irritable, bored, sluggish\nS4: Angry, anxious, sad, guilty/ashamed, bored\n\n\nMomentary Positive Affect: \n\tS1: Happy, energetic, confident\nS2: Energetic, relaxed, enthusiastic, calm, confident\nS3: Content, enthusiastic, calm, proud, determined, excited, confident\nS4: Calm, content/satisfied, happy/cheerful, excited/enthusiastic, proud\n\n\nMomentary Stress: \n\tS1: \u201cMy current situation is stressful\u201d\nS2: \u201cRight now my situation is stressful\u201d \nS3: \u201cRight now my situation is stressful\u201d\nS4: \u201cRate the severity of the stress [you experienced today]\u201d\n\n\nMomentary Positive Experience: \nS1: Index of: \u201cMy current situation is positive\u201d, \u201cRight now I am doing something exciting\u201d, \u201cI am successful in my current activity\u201d \nS2: Index of: \u201cSince the last beep, the most important think that happened was positive\u201d, \u201cI am successful in my current activity\u201d\nS3: Index of: \u201cRight now my situation is pleasant\u201d, \u201cRight now I enjoy my current activity\u201d \nS4: not included\n\n\n\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Statistical models: \n\nNED &amp; PED\nFollowing Tugade et al.

In other words, we hope to uncover what emotion regulation strategies are used in real time among those who are anxious (vs. those who are not).

The PROMIS scale has very strong psychometric properties, evidence of validity in both community and clinical samples (Schalet et al., 2016), and has nationally published norms. We computed a mean score for this scale and converted it to t-scores based on published norms (available at http://healthmeasures.net).\n\nEmotion regulation. We measured emotion regulation at the baseline interview using 36 items from the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ; Garnefski &amp; Kraaij, 2006), which measures what individuals generally think when experiencing negative or unpleasant events. Each sub-scale was measured with 4 items each, with response options ranging from 1 = Almost never to 5 = Almost always. Emotion regulation strategies measured by the CERQ largely reflected reflexive or disengagement responses, including self-blame, thoughts of putting the blame for what you have experienced on yourself, other-blame, putting the blame for what you have experienced on the environment or another person, rumination, thinking about the feelings and thoughts associated with the negative event, and catastrophizing, thoughts of explicitly emphasizing the terror of what you have experienced. Engagement strategies include putting into perspective, brushing aside the seriousness of the event/emphasizing the relativity when comparing it to other events, positive refocusing, thinking about joyful or positive issues instead of thinking about the actual event, positive reappraisal, creating a positive meaning to the event in terms of personal growth, acceptance, accepting what you have experienced and resigning yourself to what has happened, refocus on planning, thinking about what steps to take and how to handle the negative event. We computed a ratio of the mean of disengagement or reflexive strategies divided by the mean of engagement emotion regulation strategies. \nBaseline self-report of emotion regulation will be used as a covariate. We will report analyses with and without baseline emotion regulation included to illustrate the effects of its shared variance on the conclusions. \n\nEcological Momentary Assessment of Emotion Regulation. At each EMA, participants reported whether or not (1 = yes, 0 = no) they had engaged in any emotion regulation strategies during the assessment window (\u201csince you woke up this morning\u201d, \u201csince 12pm today\u201d, and \u201csince 4pm today\u2026\u201d). We adapted single items from the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (described above) and added an item measuring suppression. Disengagement or reflexive strategies included rumination (\u201cYou were unable to stop thinking about how you were feeling - thoughts kept popping up in your mind.\u201d), distraction (\u201cYou tried to keep your mind off of a problem by doing something else.\u201d), avoidance (\u201cYou tried not to think about a problem or tried to forget all about it.\u201d), or suppression (\u201cYou tried to control your emotions by not expressing them\u201d). Engagement strategies included reframing (\u201cYou tried to think of a problem in a different way so it didn't seem as bad.\u201d), acceptance (\u201cYou decided to accept a situation or problem the way it is\u201d), problem solving (\u201cYou did something to fix a problem or thought of a way to make things better.\u201d). \n\nAs in our prior work, we will compute a ratio score reflecting the proportion of the sum of disengagement or reflexive strategies (rumination, distraction, avoidance or suppression) with a possible range of 0 to 4, which would mean participants reported using all four strategies 100% of the time) to the sum of engagement strategies (with a possible range of 0 to 3).
