By doing this, we also ensure that only those participants who properly experienced the experimental manipulation are included in the main analysis. \n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=r4jg6", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "r4jg6", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "r4jg6", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/4pb89/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "4pb89", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5ev2x/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5ev2x", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/r4jg6/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/r4jg6/"}}, {"id": "ervb8", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "National and International Experiences on Knowledge Translation to  improve Maternal, Neonatal and Perinatal Care at Technical, Professional, and Traditional Leve.

By doing so, the UASs have committed themselves to taking care of an open and safe research culture, a proper management of research data, honest and open agreements on the research data, setting research ethics standards and advice, and to the training of their researchers. However, so far UASs themselves hardly offer any systematic training in the field of RI.\nOur goal is to enable the UASs in The Netherlands to meet their obligation to provide their researchers access to a basic training course in the field of RI. To that goal we will systematically develop a blended training course that provides online information on integrity topics and offers researchers the opportunity to deepening important, and for their specific situation relevant topics through group-discussions and meetings with experts.\nThe training is to be tailored to the needs of the researchers in UASs. For that purpose, focus group discussions will be organised prior to designing the training. Topics to be discussed in the focus groups are: what makes a good UAS researcher; which norms of the Dutch Code of Conduct researchers do and do not recognise, and which needs for RI training do they identify? Based on this input learning objectives will be drawn up.\nSecondary aim of the focus group discussions* is to pilot test several training methods that are already applied in RI training in other settings (i.e. the VIRT2UE training program). These methods will be embedded in the focus group discussion guide.\n* Due to the measures against the spread of COVID-19, we will conduct interviews by telephone to replace the focus group discussions.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-03-26T21:55:18.344569", "date_modified": "2020-03-26T21:26:27.158866", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["Applied Research", "Applied Sciences", "Research Integrity", "Responsible Conduct of Research", "Responsible Research Practices", "Universities of Applied Sciences"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "1c5281fda208f7709511261720f79d8979f8c713a8eeae675966110ffae672221c8f27e054471960311bda08d24223847ff238db7c8c92619a4fd37ff29910e2c64ff64b3e4a1b3425c133f6e50b842691ce910a11d96aede6a50c1620871734c8ea6a721d9c15ff6c66622784234d5e53e661c659ac0d4f09e6d1183b8b6b1a6dad13f2df6e2d55b9ea886cf29da00b", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-03-26T21:55:18.326666", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Fenneke Blom, Rob van der Sande, Susan Berentsen"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "The aim of this project is to develop training on research integrity for researchers at universities of applied sciences.

Titles, abstracts, and index terms of the hits retrieved will be analyzed regarding possible search terms.\nAs a second step, the databases from the first step and also Google Scholar, CAMbase, CareLit, CC Med, Scopus, and PsycARTICLES will be scanned with the keywords and index terms identified. Then, a title-abstract-screening is performed to remove articles that do not meet the pre-defined inclusion criteria. Afterwards, the remaining articles will be stored electronically in full text and evaluated in detail according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. \nAs the third and last step, the reference lists of hits will be browsed for potential additional studies. The search will be limited to the reference lists of those articles that have been included in the scoping review.\nThe review will include quantitative and qualitative research as well as reviews of any kind published on coping in adults with pancreatic malignancies. Both English and German language journal articles will be included regardless of their year of publication. There will be no restrictions regarding therapy goals or strategies.\nPublications without abstracts will be excluded. Furthermore, studies that focus on other pancreatic diseases like pancreatitis will be excluded. In addition, letters, discussion papers, websites etc. will not be considered.
